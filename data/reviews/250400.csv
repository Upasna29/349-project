"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spencicles/recommended/250400/","Spencicles","Trip Fisk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spencicles/","338 products in account","edit: updating review. evidently its getting some attention, so I figured I might as well expand and clarify.\n\ntl;dr edition: neither good nor fun. do not buy unless its deeply discounted.\n\nI can not refer this game in good faith. There are 2 major things wrong with How to Survive.\n\nFirstly, take a look at the DLC. If How to Survive truly is an indie game, control of the project has been overtaken by greedhead corporate dumb think leadership. Someone (likely 505 Games) has opted to make DLCs out of basic features that should have been part of the basic game. Examples are an extra harder difficulty and a hardcore feature. Other DLCs (Heatwave) resemble what would have been unlockables for games only a generation ago. Lastly there are the DLCs that suggest the core game was released unfinished taking the cutting room floor scraps and selling them off as DLC when they got to them later. I don't know if the nickel and diming customers business model bothers you, but it sure as hell bothers me.\n\nThe second problem is the game itself. Its not good. How to Survive is a perfect example of the tidalwave of schlock being put out by the burgeonning indie industry. It is an inferior imitation of mainstream titles like Diablo and Torchlight. It tries to be unique and original with additional survival features like hunger, thirst, and sleepiness, but they're implemented in a way that make the game tedious and annoying. The quality is painfully amateur and inconsistent. Struggle as a melee character, but have 2 triple bladed boomerangs and you're so golden the game gets dull. The content is particularly slim. Each island is painfully small. And the game itself manages to be as repetitive as Diablo and Torchlight, but in the most flat, boring, and completely unrewarding manner possible.\n\nHow to Survive lives up to its lousy meta score. No idea why this game has such an overwhelmingly high positive customer review count. The $15 asking price with the lazy DLCs is crazy to me. Other games How to Survive is trying to be are the same exact price and offer more and better quality content minus the annoying survival gimmicks and DLC. Specifically either of the Torchlight games.\n\nHonestly, my recommendation is to not buy How to Survive at all. If you absolutely must take the plunge, as stated in the tl;dr above, buy it when its 80-90% off. That way you won't feel too ripped off when you find out how painfully below average it is.","October 14, 2014","false","10.6"," 1,219 of 1,489 people (82%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","82","219","1","21","63"

At $2.25 (Summer Sale 2014), I certainly wasnt expecting much but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this title from 505 Games.\n\nCampaign | Gameplay: The story is straighforward - play as one of three protagonists stuck on a deserted island infested with zombies, and learn 'how to survive' long enough to find a way out. The gameplay is fun (and told from the perspective of a top-down isometric shooter), good graphics and atmospheric sound, M&K controls that are intuitve and responsive, features a broad selection of weapons (from Axe's, Machete's, Bow & Arrows, Molotov Cocktail's to a wide variety of guns), and interesting characters. The game's strength however was the Inventory setup - which allows you to collect a seemingly random mish-mash of junk from your travels around the island and combine them in various ways to create useful items (Eg. String and a wooden stick to create a fishing rod, An old bottle, kerosene and a scrap of fabric to create Molotov Cocktail's, An old rubber tire, an axe and string to create body armor etc etc).\n\nFlaws: Uneven difficulty spikes, and sparse 'Save' points cause needless frustration in an otherwise enjoyable experience.\n\n'How to Survive' might not break any new boundaries but 505 Games have taken on a disparete variety of gameplay elements and executed extremely well to create a refreshingly fun, zombie-horror romp. At $2.25, this one is a no-brainer - A Definite Recommend (8/10)\n\n\nWant More Recommendations?\nMake sure to click the 'Follow' button on our Curator Page (Link Attached) to get the latest reviews updated directly onto your Activity Feed.

The number of legitimate looking positive reviews indicates that whilst others have enjoyed the game I haven't.\n\nThe survival element from which the game takes it's name seems tacked on with little effect on game-play.  In the hours I've played I've never come close to starving or dehydrating.  A little message pops up telling you that you're becoming thirsty or hungry and that's solved by drinking or eating one of the many things in your inventory.\n\nThere are wells and bottles and canisters everywhere; I've haven't felt any tension or had to go on an epic quest to find water.  There are also edible plants everywhere so whilst meat might not always be on the menu starving is not going to happen.\n\nSleeping is ... strange.  There's no building or reinforcing shelters and no bedrolls or similar.  There is one special shack per island that has a closeable door.  That's the only place where you can sleep.  If you're 51% tired you can't sleep but if you're 49% tired than you must.  There's no wait command so sleeping through the night won't happen unless leave your character to get tired.\n\nAs survival games go there's no real element of survival in 'How to Survive'.  Fallout 3 with Primary Needs or State of Decay will give you a much better experience.\n\n","January 5, 2015","false","5.2"," 239 of 333 people (72%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","72","239","333","15","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joecool4279/recommended/250400/","joecool4279","JoeCool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joecool4279/","4976 products in account","This game starts fun. The graphics are decent for the top-down style. Good lighting and water effects. Day and night cycle where night really amps up the challenge by making you watch your back constantly. A diverse crafting system. Decent skill tree options. Some of the voice acting is funny (I think intentionally) and unique.\n\nI liked the survival aspects, which is the point of the game. You have to monitor your hunger, thirst, rest, and health. It's all manageable. You can collect empty bottles to store up water reserves, hunt animals and collect plants to cook at a campfire for food, collect herbs and create bandages to restore health, and secure a bunker to sleep in.\n\nThe combat is solid. The controls are easy. You craft increasingly strong weapons as you progress and different weapons have unique advantages. The machete cuts through plants and carves arrows from sticks, the bow is powerful and the arrows recoverable, the gun is rapid fire with plenty of ammo on the islands, the boomerang is very powerful but not as smooth and fast as the bow, etc. Melee combat animations are fluid with just enough variety--more than I expected from a game with this visual style.\n\nWhile the gameplay mechanics are very solid, the storyline becomes more of a chore than fun unfortunately. It's a series of fetch quests that take you back and forth across the maps. Every time you pass one direction and clear the large amount of zombies, you have to then fight them all over again on the way back due to a fast respawn rate. This turned the game into a slow fetch quest grind for me and I lost interest about halfway through. If you make a wrong turn, it's even worse, because now you're fighting respawns over and over and you're not even in the right spot of the map.\n\nYou can't save the game except at story checkpoints and that can take a bit of time. Perhaps, if I could save at will, I could have tolerated the grind in smaller doses.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I had trouble with the quest early on where I had to collect meat from a deer. I kept wandering the map looking for deer and could never find them. When I finally would spot one, I would have to clear hordes of zombies to clear a path to it and these actions usually scared the deer away, leaving me to wander yet some more. The worst is when you're hunting deer at night and the extra zombies come to chase you down. You need to keep your flashlight on these nighttime zombies to keep them at bay, which makes focusing on the fleeting deer more difficult. The game says you can track the deer once you injure it by following blood on the ground. It's not that easy to do when the ground is already covered in excessive blood from slaying zombies. I eventually caught the deer and made the mistake of cooking the meat, which didn't complete the quest, so I had to repeat it all over again.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I actually told my friends how much I enjoyed it at the beginning. Then the grind just beat me down.\n\nThere is also inventory issues. Some of the crafting recipes call for 5 or 6 items. You're already stocking ammo, weapons, water, food, bandages, quest items, etc and the 25-item inventory fills fast. I don't really consider this a negative, because it more accurately reflects the reality of surviving on these islands. It might frustrate some players though. 25 slots is still considerably more than some games permit.\n\nOne small nitpick when it comes to resting: you aren't allowed to unless your rest meter is low enough. One time I was by a shelter at just over 50% fatigue. I couldn't rest before setting out on the next leg of my journey. That's just silly, because you can make adjustments on the other survival factors whenever you please.\n\nAs much as I would like to recommend this game for all its positive, interesting concepts, I just can't because the story is a major drag.","December 24, 2013","false","5.7"," 279 of 395 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","279","395","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apockyTawok/recommended/250400/","apockyTawok","a_drunk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apockyTawok/","268 products in account","I bought this game on sale, thought, what the hell.  What a pleasant surprise.  It's like Diablo 2 gameplay, with zombies/mutants as your enemies, and one of four survivors as your hero.  The gameplay is very fun, although it does get a bit stale with a lack of diversity among the zombies/mutants.  Couple the lack of diversity with a completely OP weapon (cough, triple boomerang) and you've got a recipe for boredom.  If you want the story mode to remain challenging, I highly recommend avoiding any boomerang, as they are fast, powerful, ammo-less, and there's no such thing as durability in this game.  Killing zombies with a shotgun made out of a tube and duct tape is much more rewarding anyway, right?\n\nStill, easily worth $15 and a play through or two.  The challenges are were the challenge is (play on words intended).  You get your character dropped on an island with no equipment, a real "out of the freezer into the frying pan" kind of experience.  The challenge is reaching your escape under the allotted time, without dying obviously.\n\nThe crafting system in this game is beautiful.  You can make guns out of tubes, boomerangs out of bones, armor out of tires, and potions/elixirs galore from the plentiful plants on the islands.  Very rewarding indeed.\n\nThe talent system is... meh.  It seems like an after thought, and there is a real void of any interesting talents.  Everything is just passive "make explosive arrows" "carry more explosives in a stack" "make X potions" "do more damage on headshot" kind of thing.  Would've loved some Dead Island-esque execution talents or some character specific special moves.\n\nBottom line: Buy it.  You can easily get 10-15 hours if the idea of a Diablo-ish zombie game with great crafting sounds fun to you.  How to Survive gets a 3/5.\n\nTawok\nwww.GuildLeaders.com","December 27, 2013","true","8.5"," 182 of 255 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","182","255","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JACKinbigletters/recommended/250400/","JACKinbigletters","JACKinbigletters","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JACKinbigletters/","153 products in account","This review is coming from a stand-point of about 7 hours of solo play.\n\nDo I like this game? It's okay, I mean, it's nothing special, it's a twin-stick zombie survival game with a somewhat interesting crafting system.\n\nThe game-play, it's basic and easy to understand as all twin-stick games are. Nothing new. Which is totally fine, I mean it's a tried and tested system.\n\nThe story, I haven't finished the story, simply because I hit too many BDN (Board, done now) moments. I just couldn't do another fetch quest. That's all this game is, fetch quest after fetch quest after fetch quest. When did I hit my limit? When the drunk pilot wanted his cargo, where was it? All over the islands... All twenty pieces of the damn stuff. I quit, I was done with the game from then on. The characters were, eh. The only person that interested my in any way was Kovac, mainly because SPOILER ALERT he's apparently the one crashing the boats into the islands SPOILER ALERT OVER. I say apparently because I have no idea if he is or not, though if that was him on the radio at the start of the game it makes sense as he seems to have a radio station at the top of his island. I digress. The characters are cliche to say the least, oh no a mother and daughter that are split up on a terrible island, the friend who was bitten but has the thing you need to get off the island, the crazy old lady, the apparent friend who is actually the villain, the disabled knowledgeable one who spends all their time tinkering with your escape rout and the drunk.\n\nMay as well look at this games big point, the crafting. It's okay. I mean you can make things, cool yeah, okay. I never bothered with the potions. The guns? Didn't bother with them either. Melee weapons? Rusty machete all the way. After I built the boomerang I just didn't need anything else. Nothing. And when I upped it with the red stone, nothing else would do. Now when I say I didn't bother with it, I mean I built every combination I could within 7 hours of play. Tested it, and still found the boomerang to be the best thing to use. Chainsaw? Nope. Flamethrower? Nope. Shotgun? Nope. Boomerang. Always.\n\nSurvival. Pha. My biggest problem surviving was diverting my attention from my current fetch quest to trek to water holes, or where I knew deer were or to safe houses when I got a little tired. Fuel for bombs was the biggest problem for my "survival". I had so much food on my person I could have fed all the survivors I had found with ease. Three jerry cans of water kept me going for days. Ammo was of no concern, I had stacks of the stuff on every island just sitting there.\n\nThe zombies, or should I say, "Monsters". Well there are ones you can kill in one hit, ones that have helmets, ones that have body armor, ones with both, tall ones, ones that come out at night, ones that explode, ones in fireman suits, zombie deers, zombie emus, and a big old boss thing. At first the ones that came out at night were a challenge but then, boomerang one hit kill. The ones with both pieces of armor are just annoying, takes two head shots to kill them, one to knock off the helmet and one to kill 'em. And when they're coming at you in a pack, it's just easier to run off and come back later. The firemen, hint hint, head shots, lots and lots of head shots unless you got yourself a means of using electricity. The deers just run at you, shoot twice, dodge, rinse and repeat. The boss thing is just like a very very weekend version of the Tank from L4D. They just seemed like distractions from the endless fetch quests.\n\nOh yeah side quests are, you guessed it, fetch quests. -_-\n\nThe camera angle is lovely, seeing the exploders just as they enter their area of effect is just dandy.\n\nThe lock on and head-shot system is good too, when your backing away from a group with your trusty boomerang out and it's just about to go red and another zombie bumps your target out of your aim and you gotta start over again. This is especially annoying against the fully armored zombies. Great.\n\nThe leveling system seems just, pointless, the most useful stuff is getting the upgrades that slow down your hunger, thirst and drowsiness. Everything else seems just like fluff to me.\n\nThe most fun I had in the game was going off doing the missions for the scientists on the islands where I was super-under prepared, there was a challenge, and it was ridiculous. Experiments that could change the magnetic fields surrounding the islands? Sounds good enough to me!\n\nIs this game worth the price tag, maybe in co-op. Maybe. However would I play though those opening missions again? Hell no.","August 21, 2015","false","7.7"," 143 of 197 people (73%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","73","143","197","26","19"

It simply wasn't as interesting or enjoyable as it appeared to be in the Steam store.  The premise is neat but the execution is lacking.  Crafting could be cool, but most of the time your tiny inventory is full up with junk.  You have no homebase so there's nowhere to store excess stuff.   Also, where you sleep for the night is highly limited and really annoying.  There is usually only one secure bed shack per island.  And for some reason, when you go to try and use it, a red light and alarm goes off every time, alerting tons of zombies to your location for no real reason.   The most entertaining aspect of this game is watching the short "Kovac's rules" videos.   Save your money and buy State of Decay instead for a much deeper zombie survival crafting game with a better plot.","November 28, 2014","false","2.7"," 293 of 433 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","293","433","9","10"

El Diablo Islands DLC will adds a lot more content if you liked the base game.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: I bought all the DLCs, and all my playthru and review is based on my experience of having all the DLCs activated.\n\nWARNING when buying DLCs, the Heat Wave DLC - x 3 pack is the same as Heat Wave DLC - Kenji's pack, Heat Wave DLC - Abby's pack and Heat Wave DLC - Jack's pack combined! DO NOT REPEAT PURCHASE!\n\n\nThe game is quite interesting at first, but it gets boring and repetitive very soon. The game consists of fetch quests from start to finish. While fetching items, you got to take care of your other needs other than health.\n\nDuring the early game, you might need to spend some time gathering food and resources, but once you venture into 2nd island, food water and sleep are just things that take up some of your limited inventory space. And if you are playing solo, inventory space is VERY LIMITED! I play co-op with my friend, and yet we are still struggling on holding all the quest items and crafting ingredients.\n\nCrafting might seem complicated at first, but in fact there are only a handful of recipes to do.\n\nPlaying co-op have their pros and cons.\n- Co-op have a very lousy camera. Both players share the same camera, therefore when both players wander too far away from each other, off-screen zombies become very dangerous.\n- The connection is quite crappy, it will de-sync every couple of minutes, ruining a lot of fun. Also, the desync will cause the joining player to take a lot of damage sometimes.\n- Quest rewards will only be given to the host player, so if the reward is a good gun, only one of you will get to use it.\n- Food and drinks must be shared.\n+ You have double the inventory slot.\n+ You have double the health, so when one is dead the other can try to survive and revive the dead player without having to reload checkpoint.\n\nThe other game modes are a waste of time.\n\nIf you collect 100% achievements, you will need Kovac's Way DLC, Barricade! DLC, One Shot Escape DLC, and El Diablo Islands. You will also need a lot of patience and luck.","February 1, 2015","true","38.0"," 99 of 133 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","99","133","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StriderRyo/recommended/250400/","StriderRyo","STRYKERryo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StriderRyo/","366 products in account","I picked this game up full price, from it's description it sounded like the type of zombie survival game I always wanted to play. Sadly it was a major disappointment, it's survival aspects in name only. All the elements are sort of there, the "open" map, ammo, limited inventory, food and water requirements and rpg stats, but their implementation is all wrong.\n\nFew of them really matter, you get tons of ammo as drops, and managing water and food is pretty irrelevant, you quickly stack some items for that so that it's more of a petty maintenance than an aspect of survival.\n\nThe so-called open map is really just swathes of map with small pathways cut into them, with just a few open spaces that are usually there just for the sake of variety it seems. The only "Open" element is that of course it isn't a linear game and you can run back and forth between areas and quick travel between maps, but it's not far enough from just mundane backtracking.\n\nThe combat isn't too bad, it works for this type of game, if it wasn't for the overabundance of ammo and the overpowered weapons from the very start. Combat soon feels more like something you just do on the way and not much more enjoyable than running from place to place.\n\nThe crafting is another annoyance if you need a particular item, you have a limited inventory, that's okay, you shouldn't be able to carry everything with you.. but then there is no storage area. It's already not fun to run around this island aimlessly, I don't want to have to run around looking for that one damn ingredient, usually for a quest (what else is there to do in this game?) Just a limited item storage for SOME things, I can decide what to get rid of later, but a few times I've already dropped something I needed to find again, much to my annoyance.\n\nThe overall feel of playing this game was BOREDOM. I was falling asleep at my comp, I soon couldn't take it. It's not too relevant but the final straw was all the damn "Krovac's Rules" cutscenes. Think he's a neat quirky charcater? Wait till you have to endure overwrought, way too long, unskippable video tutorials with the same crappy music, for something that should be explained in 2-3 lines of text.\n\nDon't want to be mean, but it's kind of important to remember what a survival game is so we can actually get a good one. This just isn't it. It's very deceptive, because the gameplay it describes is far from the experience this game actually provides; a top down action game with bad map design and useless aspects that are little more than busy work, that drains the fun out of the concepts of crafting, exploring, or survival.","December 21, 2013","false","15.4"," 263 of 394 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","263","394","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KianaWolf/recommended/250400/","KianaWolf","Kiana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KianaWolf/","141 products in account","An incredibly boring, unbalanced game, that fails to deliver anything meaningful.\n\nFirst, the crafting: This is the game's only true strength, but it's still lacking. There's only a handful of weapons and minor upgrades to them for you to create. A weak machine gun, an average machine gun, a strong machine gun. A rifle. A wooden bow, a metal bow, two upgrades to add onto them. Everything boils down to a couple of tiers of equipment that do the same thing.\n\nSecond, balance: The difficulty curve is all over the place. At the start of the game, you will get mauled, guaranteed, by all the zombies. You'll only have a stick to defend yourself with, which is slow, weak and inefficient against the sheer number of zombies. Then you can finally get a ranged weapon and the game becomes yawn inducing, followed by the second island, where helmeted zombies might actually land a hit on you if there's several of them.\n\nThen you get to the third island and, despite further upgrading your bow AND gun, find that neither are all that effective against the zombies there. How ineffective are they? It takes two perfect head shots to take them down, assuming they don't have a helmet. They also come at you in droves and your movement is slowed by the swamp.\n\nThen you find the recipe for an upgraded boomerang. This weapon outperforms bows and guns quite easily, in terms of speed, damage and lack of ammo consumption. It's only weakness is that you have to wait for the weapon to come back before you can throw it again, but this didn't cause me problems at all. Between the long effective range, high damage and hitting twice, it's often able to take out multiple zombies per throw and the delay is actually pretty low.\n\nThird, the enemies: There is nothing remotely interesting about any of them. There's regular zombies, progressively faster and stronger zombies, fat (explosive) zombies, head crabs and giant zombies. Nothing new to report. Oh, and there's also zombie deer and what I believe are emus. The birds just zerg rush, so they're also boring. The deer attack by charging and can stun you, which makes them one of the more interesting enemies, if only because their speed means they'll actually hit you.\n\nFourth, the plot and characters: The plot is bland. You're marooned on an island and have to survive. The characters are all varying degrees of insane and unlikable. I'd guess that the game was aiming to be parody, but it's just so unfunny and overall dull that I honestly can't tell if it's being sincere or not.\n\nFifth, the quests: Every single one is a fetch quest. If it's not a fetch quest at first, it will become one soon enough. Also, get used to failure, because it's guaranteed. Unless it involves getting to another zombie infested island, you're not  actually accomplishing anything.\n\nAnd then there's the monkeys. With pet parrots. Who give optional fetch quests, because clearly we didn't have enough of them already, right? These are what make me wonder if the game is meant as parody, because they so clearly break the bleak mood of the game. Unfortunately, all they accomplish is changing my mood from apathy to annoyance. The squawking really gets old.\n\nSixth, bugs and nitpicking: One bug I keep running into is that, after I took the skill that showed certain plants on the map, some of the plant icons would remain after harvesting while others wouldn't. A similar problem I kept running into with the skill to see animals on the map was sometimes the icons for them didn't show up, despite the deer being close enough for me to see its antlers.\n\nAlso, there's a sound bug with the boomerang. Sometimes after throwing it, the sound continues even after it returns, which gets annoying very fast. Usually it happens when I open the inventory menu while it's still airborne, but sometimes it just happens.\n\nAnd one last, little annoyance, of no real significance: The voice acting doesn't match up with the dialog boxes, like they were using two different versions of the same script. The ideas are all the same, but the words are different.","July 9, 2014","false","7.6"," 70 of 90 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","70","90","0","1"

After all, neither the "zombie" or "survival crafting" genres seem in much threat of extinction at this very moment, but, well...maybe the sheer quantity of such gaming experiences is precisely WHY this one got lost in the shuffle.\n\nReally quite the little undiscovered gem, which isn't to say it's a 100% frustration-free romp, but my complaints are relatively few and minor, namely:  It's a tad LONG for my tastes (then again, just about all games these days ARE, hahaha); the aiming mechanism is sometimes frustrating (especially with melee weapons, which it's hardly even necessary for); and the night-time sequences, while spooky at first, become increasingly tiresome once you realise all you really have to do is stand next to a camp-fire for ten minutes and you'll be home-and-hosed (though the temptation to wander away and get up some bonus XP is most definitely there, and usually just ended up getting me into needless trouble...but that's just the kinda eejit I am sometimes).\n\nBut on the whole, ♥♥♥♥ it, it's pretty darn fun, not without humour, and certainly not lacking in hearty bloodshed.  Best zombie game since those two that Valve did, that I'VE played at least (and I'll play just about anything with zombies in it, let's face it).  Definitely the BEST ZOMBIE GAME SET ON ONE OR MORE DESERTED ISLANDS to be released in recent years (not pointing any fingers at any infinitely better-known and infinitely LAZIER franchises with similar thematics which I could mention, of course)!  I'll definitely be playing it again sometime, and if that's not a recommendation, well I'll be a Coco's uncle (sorry, but you might have to play the game to get this little in-joke...go on, you know you wanna)...\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","May 14, 2014","true","26.2"," 66 of 95 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","66","95","0","0"

You wake up after a shipwreck, find you're on an island with zombies, need to go do a number of fetch quests while all the wimps hide and you bring the carnage!\n\nGameplay: This is where the game impressed me, but before I jump the gun and explain what I like... the controls are very basic, use mouse buttons to aim and fire/swing, ASDW to move, the game is played from the third person fixed above view camera.\n(Atratzu did some research and learned that this view is known as “Isometric view”. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's the term you're supposed to use. Isometric-fixed-camera?)\nNow to explain the fun part, like most survival games these days, How to Survive has a “Crafting system”. I'm a sucker for crafting, I feel like it gives me one of the strongest sense of progression...But I'm also biased and desensitized to it (translation: if you don't like crafting, don't touch this game). You need to scavenge various materials to make weapons, tools, and food. There are different types of herbs, sticks, animals, various junk items that become useful later, and more.\nThe other main feature I would like to point out is the “leveling system”, mostly everyone is familiar with this concept by now, in this game when you level, you get skill points that you can spend to get different perks and abilities.\n\nAchievements: How to Survive has a total of 43 achievements. There are four categories: 1) Completed while playing through the game on you first play through (about 7-12+ achievements, depends on how thorough you are when you play). 2) Complete these special abilities/conditions. 3) Difficulty related achievements... These are always the roughest achievements to get in the game because it requires Mastery and stubborn determination. 4) Lastly, there are DLC achievements so if you want to go for 100%, you'll need the DLC (about 6 achievements).\n\nPrice: How to survive is priced at $14.99 This game will definitely earn it's value from gameplay, My personal preference is that I always want a game to last one hour for every dollar. If you'd like a better deal I recommend waiting for a steam sale; be it summer or winter.\nI also need to mention that I didn't actually buy this game, it was gifted to me by Eyriana (other names: “Decimaeya” and “Unreal”), so thank you for the gift!\n\nConclusion: There is one more feature that should be mentioned before I wrap up my review; there is multiplier and local co-op, but I haven't played those modes yet.\nTo quickly recap, the story was stereotypical, the gameplay was crafting + looting * Zombies, the Achievements are generally hard earned + DLC, and the price is fair because of how long you'll play the game.\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes the following genres: Zombie, Survival, Crafting.

There will also be a bullet point Pros/Cons review near the bottom of this.\n\nHow to Survive is in my opinion a well done game to say the least. The game has a simple yet elegant combat system that I found satisfying, it takes patience to truly master zombie slaying as you must take time to zero in your aim for those rewarding headshots. This is better then many other games as it adds a touch of needed skill to it. The game also contains a decent variety of zombies to slaughter including some undead animals that prove to be quite scary when encountered. Many zombie types also require you to change up your strategy as a nice bonus, while you normal zombies can be dispatched with melee weapons, zombies such as Fatties require a ranged approach as they will otherwise blow up in your face upon death.\n\nOne issue I had here though was running zombies tend to get spastic when right on you and I found it hard to aim at them as they attacked while running circles around me. The island settings also do nicely, between varied terrain and well done lighting the game's presentation is both beautiful and terrifying. One of the game's strongest points is its well done crafting system, playing the game I constantly found myself wanting to find new items to combine to produce more deadly weapons and armor. This is further expanded by crafting and adding attachments such as scopes for homemade guns to decrease aim time or pulleys to give your bow more damage. Another nice mechanic the game has is a day and night cycle where at night an abundant number of more mutated and aggressive zombie type foe come out to play, what really sets this apart from other games is your ability to fight these off by simply staying in the light. With a campfire your safe and to travel you can simply grab a torch from the fire, however you will drop the torch to the ground if you need to use any other weapon, and while you can use a flashlight with a weapon it is a directional light, so if your not careful these creatures can come up from behind you and attack. The game also sports a decent Hunger/Thirst/Sleep system that adds just a little more spice to the difficulty, however if you acquire both skill perks to double these meters you'll find yourself rarely having to maintain them.\n\nThe game contains a few different character to play as each with different stats and available skills to acquire. A couple of which have a unique ability to craft a specific item only as them. As said the game does contain a leveling system in which each level grants a skill point of your choosing, however out of the 12 or so skills I had playing Jack I only found 4 or 5 of them to actually be worth something. While the story isn’t the best it was still rather entertaining and when taken the time to scavenge and keep yourself properly equipped the main story ran about 15 hours for me across 2 days of constant play. Now though the game lacks any sort of structure building mechanic the game does allow you to drop items anywhere and will never disappear which really came in handy as I tended to have a hording problem in this game. I have a friend that I got to also get the game and together we found the multiplayer gameplay just as fun, you can either to a simple challenge which is essentially an island with a single goal such as finding a plane to escape. You can Co-Op the story, this part was especially cool as while my friend was just starting his story I was well into mine and I retained both my stats and all the items on me allowing me to easily aid him in his story. All in all I'd say this game is worth trying especially for any fan of zombie and/or survival game, to those of you I'd say you wont be disappointed.\n\nSo in a nutshell:\nPros:\n-Satisfying combat system\n-Addictive crafting system\n-Well done setting\n-A decent story both in quality and length\n-Enemy variety\n-Day/Night cycle\n-Hunger/Thirst/Sleep systems\n-Level and skill progression\n-Multiple playable character\n-Rebindable Controls\n\nCons:\n-Zombie AI can be a little wonky but rare\n-Camera style made some areas extremely difficult to navigate\n-Some what low variety of melee weapons\n-Controls for aiming seemed to be off at times (Xbox 360 Controller)\n\nOne final note is that I found that getting information on more advanced stuff was hard, especially seeing how typing "How to Survive..." in an internet search engine usually found unwanted results.\n\nMy finally score for this game as a long time zombie and survival game lover is a solid 8/10, while its of course not a AAA title it does very well with what it has and I find myself strangely addicted to continue playing and watching as my character started as a hopeless shipwreck survivor and evolved into the perfect survivalist.","October 15, 2014","true","21.0"," 129 of 205 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","129","205","5","6"

Here is why:\n\n- UI is terrible, full controller support game, means: no hotkey for windows, some ugly "scroll skill/use skill" buttons. 90% of my deaths in game is because of panic and inability to switch weapon.\n- inventory is crap, if you have some number of stackable items and pickup any amoung over stack maximum - you will loose extra, no joke here, last update of this game was in 2014, so there is no hope for fixing. There are stupid limitations, like 6 molotov max (MAX! i can carry loads of items, but allowed only 6 molotovs!), bullets stacks in 500, arrows in 100, wooden stick in 10, etc.\n- camera... oh my.. What is the use of long range weapon with camera which looks from above on me and hiding anything of turn?? Approaching anything from north means it will charge before you see it.\n- targeting.. I want to see how the guy who innovate this targeting system plays the game, because I think he never bothers to do so. I crafted 100 explosive arrows to waste 90 of them trying to shoot barrikade.. it targets anything else, but not goddamit barikade which I have to go through to progress.\n- respawn.. while trying to create a "base" (to keep all unknown loot and valuables) I had so much pain.. moving half screen away and then back to find dozens of zombies coming from nowhere.. really?\n- farming.. oh yeah, crocodile quests.

Usually with a rusty machete, chainsaw, an axe, a boomerang or some makeshift gun which looks more like a vacuum cleaner than a deadly weapon.\n\nLet's just get it out of the way, the combat is extremely boring. It's boring, tedious and lackluster, and when you got thousands upon thousands of zombies chasing you then you'll get bored relatively fast. The developers also added a finish-move/take-down mechanic when the enemies health drops too low, but even that function is in most cased an hindrance for you to use.\n\nThe difficulty is also laughable. On the games website it says:  "Try the “Iron Man” difficulty for a demanding hardcore game experience.\nCalling the Iron Man difficulty a hardcore experience is an insult to people who crave hard games. I died a few times because of my own stupidity (I used the take-down move and it got me surrounded), but other than that the Iron Man mode is a walk in the park. I never had any problem finding ammo, food, water or shelter.\n\nThere isn't a lot of "surviving" to do in this game, the crafting is tedious and the items you can craft are very limited. Craft yourself a triple bladed boomerang (with spikes) as soon as possible (on the second island) and you'll never want to use another weapon ever again.\nAmmo, food, water and shelter can be found everywhere, it basically becomes a chore to survive, and that chore isn't even remotely fun.\n\nThe game also suffers from being ridden with bugs and is also terribly unoptimized. When you got an almost new computer with an i7 processor, 16gb ram and a 2gb memory card which has problems to render the water properly, then you know the developers were pretty lazy.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game, not by a long shot. It's simply not worth your time or your money.","February 2, 2014","false","18.4"," 141 of 230 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","141","230","0","4"

This game is a 3rd person shooter type of game, the only thing I felt the game lacked so far is that you can't pan the camera around your guy; this makes it a little hard to see how many zombies are going to come running after you next.\n\nThe game has still been allot of fun to play through so far, I think I am probably about half way through the game at this point and I have not gotten bored of playing it yet. You start out with a stick as a weapon, then you find better weapons or craft better weapons by finding Bluprints to create them.\n\nI think they could have done it a little differently in terms of sending the player out to fetch things, so far there is this one guy who asks you to do all kinds of things and I just get this feeling that the guy is a lazy bum; who doesn't lift a finger to help you out in the least.\n\nThey could have really improved that aspect of the game allot, the game is already pretty good; if they would have done something a little different with the quest line the game could have been exceptional.\n\nThat plus the inability to pan around your character take something away from this game.

This game might not be the best zombie/crafting/survival game ever made, but it has a lot to offer when playing co-op.  Even if the game feels as though it could have been bigger.  The idea of keeping your character fed, hydrated, and rested while exploring zombie infested islands and crafting useful items from scraps is a fun idea that is implemented well with this game -- the world, items, and crafting options just seem a little lack luster.\n\nThe survival aspects of the game, eating, drinking and resting, are presented simply.  Safe houses must be discovered and cleared out for the character to have a safe place to rest.  This part of the game works well.  The safe houses get progressively more difficult to clear, and they are spaced appropriately throughout the game.  It would have been nice if the islands were larger.  The player must search for wild edibles or hunt for food.  Foods can be cooked and combined, but a lot of the times there is little to no reason to do it.  While it's fun to make a dish a Fish 'n' Chips, there is no difference from that and just a cooked fish.  This part feels as though it could have used more work.  Maintaining good hydration is another survival aspect that is done simply and effectively.  Fresh water can be found around the island, and the player can store water in different containers.  These containers can be re-used for water again, or for storing other liquids.  Various fruits and items can be mixed with water to make "mix drinks."  This part of the survival felt as though it got more attention.  Every new drink that was discovered had different effects, and that led to more creative use of inventory space.\n\nThe back packs are a tad small; however, if you are planning on playing co-op, which I highly recommend, the back pack size works extremely well.  It took extra coordination between my partner and me, but that added a lot to the co-op.\n\nThe combat is solid and balanced.  What would be overwhelming at first, in time becomes just another brawl on the beach.  The learning curve fits well with the progression of the character.\n\nThe story is nothing exceptional, but that's not why I played this game.  However, all of the npcs are voice acted which is a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe asking price for this game feels right on.  It's a steal when it's on sale.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269475707","June 10, 2014","true","15.0"," 39 of 55 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","39","55","0","0"

For example talking to character made the whole game freeze so we didn’t try to talk to the character again :D\n- Another thing that really annoyed me was that you are not able to save the game in the Main Menu. You need to wait till you get to a checkpoint or something similar. If you die before the checkpoint…yep playing everything again. Frustrating.\n-The looting system in the coop mode is horrible. If one person picks an item up only one of the player has the weapon so on. Also if you get a reward, my friend and I had the problem that only he gets the rewards and I get nothing. And that at the beginning of the game. Frustrating.\n-Your character has 4 “needs”: Health, hunger, thirst and exhaustion. So you always need to make sure you have food and something to drink. But if you play as a pair it’s not easy to have always enough food for both. Having these needs gives the game a realistic touch but I found it frustrating :D\n\nBut even if the game is having some bugs and so on I had fun playing it.\n\n+The crafting system is nice and easy to understand.\n+I liked the bird's eye view of the game. It’s something different from what you normally play.\n+ The game is about Zombies. So yeah….fighting zombies is fun :D\n+The animations looked sometimes really weird but I still like them. For example the character has different “finisher moves”.\n\nIf you don’t have high expectations the game can make a lot of fun,especially if you play the coop mode. And I think if the developers take they their time and erase those bugs the game will be even better :)\n","February 17, 2014","true","35.1"," 44 of 64 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","44","64","0","4"

The survival aspects in this are like you'd expect.  You will need to find and drink water, find shelter (and rid zombies of it) to sleep and kill the local wildlife to eat their meat so you don't starve to death.  You can even make fishing rods to fish as well.\n\nThere is a crafting system and it was somewhat unique and fun in my opinion.  You gather up resources you find throughout the island(s) and you can craft things like axes, bows, body armor, guns and explosive devices.  You will also be finding plants scattered about and you can combine them and make healing items.\n\nHerbalism ranges from making healing items, tonics for shields, better aiming and so forth.  For the most part all I ever used were the healing items.  Making shields and what not only lasted you 15-30 secs and it's gone.  There wasn't much threat throughout the game unless you neglected to upgrade your weapons.\n\nThreats on these islands range from your normal zombies to zombies in full tactical gear to giant Resident Evil Nemesis creatures.  Even the wildlife can turn and cause more problems than the zombies do.  Zombie deer?  You bet'cha!  If you happen to die you end up leaving a tombstone on the ground.  There's nothing for you to retrieve, but once your friends log in they can see where you've parished.  I saw plenty of people I recognize dead all over the place.\n\nThere is a story throughout your adventure and your goal is to get off the island.  There are other people stranded which act as quest givers.  Quests are mostly just fetching items or off to see your next NPC that always comes with funny dialog.\n\nThe DLC consists of challenge modes, the barricade mode and an extra story line that takes place on El Diablo Islands.  The challenge modes are just that.  Complete certain game functions without dying and nothing in your inventory.  Barricade mode is you build a base and keep the zombies out of the base to protect a wounded friend.  You run around and pick up wood and make "barricades".\n\nThe base games story mode took me around 14 hours to beat and El Diablo Islands takes 3-4 more hours.  Max level is 15 and you can respec the skill tree 4 times.  The full game runs around $20 (including all DLC), but can often be picked up for $2 on sale.  Well worth it if the above seemed interesting to you.  Fans of this game asked the devs to make a 3rd person view and there is one availabe.  So, if you'd prefer to play this 3rd person over top down then check that one out instead.  It's the same game just different perspective.\n\nIt's a great time and it was great fun.  Always looked forward to finding my next blue print so I could upgrade my gear.

Developers put a lot of passion inside this game and you can clearly see that after the last patches.\nThe game itself is not only improved but they have added some quite good stuff...from weapons to game modes to achievements...all stuff that will make this game more enjoyable day after day.\n\nThe gameplay is quite simple and original. It is a mix between a crafting game a survival horror and a RPG.\nCrafting because all your weapons, armour, ammo and so on...needs to be crafted.\nSurvival because you will need to eat, sleep, drink etc...\nRPG because you will have a series of skills that you will learn level after level (the stats are automatically leveled up)\n\nThe graphic is quite good and there are some interesting effects (rain, fog where you will literally see nothing, lightings etc..).\nThe main story itself it is quite short yes but all the side quests and the nice number of possibilities about how to deal with some situations will make the game going for a while. Even the new different game modes are a huge plus (survival mode, escape mode or barricade mode...and even a series of challenges with some objectives).\n\nThere are even several types of zombies...some of those only appears during night....and so be advised...only predators live at night...\n\nVery nice thing is that you can make all this thing alone or co-op. And we all know that with a friend everything is better.\n\nWhat else can I say? Do you have few coins to spend for a game that is original and will give you several quite good hours of fun alone but even more hours of fun with friends? Buy this game.\nAre you looking for a zombie RPG where you will have to spend 10.000 hours only for the tutorial? Well this is not the game for you then.\n\nHTS is a simple but very fun and original game.

Its by no means perfect, for me the biggest issue was the excessive level of padding. For instance why cant I just use this one boat to travel to all the other islands and instead need to move to different locations throughout zombie infested islands to reach different boats in order to get to other islands? Padding that's why. Where HtS really shines though, is in the crafting department. There's a lot of stuff you can craft and improve as you discover new recipes books or just by experimenting with the stuff you have in your inventory.\n\nThe combat system won't turn any heads around, but its not too shabby at all IMO, especially the ranged combat mechanic. Now, the lackluster skills tree and the clown mobile safe houses mechanic was a little weird and slightly detracted from the experience, but not by much. I'm definitely looking forward to completing the Story(which was surprisingly cool with a nice twist at the end) mode on the highest difficulty and playing some more coop(which is pretty sweet btw) with my buds.\n\n\nBetter Than DayZ/10","January 4, 2015","true","16.6"," 41 of 71 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","41","71","0","0"

The campaign strands you on an archipelago of zombie-infested islands, and you have to do quests for the other survivors to try to escape. Along the way you'll find tons of crafting materials to make weapons, armor, meals, tonics, and other goodies to help you survive. There's also a skill tree you progress through by leveling up and a full index of recipes to learn and rare flora & fauna to discover. The combat is solid if a bit floaty (kind of feels like Path of Exile if you could play it with a controller), and I especially like the ranged combat system. You aim with the right stick, and the longer you hold your aim steady, the more accurate it becomes until it becomes a headshot. Really makes fights against hordes tense as you struggle to make every shot count.\n\nThe crafting system is very cool, with tons of options and things to discover, and also somewhat forgiving as it often lets you uncombine items if you don't like the results. However as some have said, the limited inventory REALLY works against the design. You won't really know what something is good for until you're able to combine it with something else, so naturally you want to hold on to one of everything. It's just like the crafting system in Teleglitch, actually... except here there's like 10x as many items to hoard, and just as little space. I imagine once you have some experience with the game it's easier to know what to keep and what to toss, but up to that point it can get frustrating.\n\nThe story and writing are barely serviceable, but that seems a small consideration in a game like this. There's co-op and challenge modes if you tire of story mode, and each of the three playable characters (there's a 4th DLC character) is persistent across all modes. If inventory wasn't so limited I would be extremely pleased with this game, but as it stands it's worth the asking price.","September 11, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Also, there are slightly more horrific zombies that only come out at night, but these are thankfully very sensitive to light so if you have a torch or flashlight, you will be able to keep them as far away from you as possible.\n\nOf course, you are able to craft your very own weapons and armor from the stuff you can find around the islands and these makeshift items will provide a much needed edge in your struggle to survive and maybe even escape these crazy islands.\n\nHow to Survive is a great game and I highly recommend it.","May 4","true","14.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

How To Survive is a comedy action RPG where the player chooses one of four characters to play. Each character has different attributes and you weigh up their stamina, agility and strength. You're presented with an array of missions with the eventual goal of escaping a collection of islands filled with the undead. The format is very similar to Diablo or Path of Exile. There's also an online Co-Op mode.\n\nI played through with the agility character, Kenji which has a talent tree geared around marksmanship and hunting game. I usually opt for agility characters in games. I also played the game on normal difficulty, in retrospect I probably should have chosen hard as i found the game started to get a bit predictable and too easy toward the end.\n\nManaging inventory is key. Much like DayZ, your survivability depends on what food, materials and ammunition you carry around. You craft your own weapons out of parts found lying around the island and upgrade them as you find better equipment. Over time your character will become hungry, thirsty and tired. You need to food and water, but it's nowhere near as scarce as DayZ. My god:\n\n"I'm starving" Starving? Again!? I Just fed you ya fat slob! It's the apocalypse for Christ's sake, no more Sizzler buffets for you.\n\nHow To Survive has a lot of comedy in it. Kovac's character is pretty funny and the guides you find lying around the place are good for a laugh. The story is done pretty well too. Simple, but it has a good ending. The game is pretty forgiving on normal difficulty when it comes to hunger and thirst. You could get by without even carrying water, just drinking from wells when you find them. I'd recommend people familiar with top-down RPG's to start the game on Hard.\n\nIf you want to flay these things, you're gonna want the Triple Sticks Cutting Boomerang. This thing is so OP. Just spamming it will kill anything that stumbles into your field of vision. Towards the end of the game it becomes a bit too easy with this weapon. That said, you can play the game on a harder difficulty which would offer more of a challenge.\n\nWould recommend How To Survive to anyone who enjoys the Diablo style, top-down-view, single character RPG's. A decent 8 to 10 hours of single-player game-play. Usually 15USD, I got it for 5 on those sweet sweet steam sales.","December 31, 2013","true","10.2"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

Yes I did. 50% of the time. The other half is pure frustration.\nBugs, some broken NPCs, weird and repetitive quests, bad designed menus and controls and so on and so on.\nExample for bugs (experienced in muliplayer):-after restarting the game there is a chance to lose random items (one of these items was a boomerang)\n-after resetting my skills I lost my passive skill, it's gone and can't see it in my skill tree anymore\n-second player sometimes can't see certain enemies\n-there is a NPC that repeats its dialog over and over again\n-you share one screen in coop - you can't see ♥♥♥♥ most of the time\n-there is a quest in which a NPC drops into the water and gets kidnapped afterwards - problem is: this particular NPC is already kidnapped even without triggering the quest and makes the story confusing. You can find the exact same NPC in two different locations at the same time.\n\nThis game is released since !!2013!! What the heck did the dev's do? Patch the F****** game already!!\n\nDesign flaws:Menu navigation and design is something between bad and -not good-. Everything that has to do with survival feels lame unnecessary. Like, I never took water with me. I don't see any reason to waste inventory space for water. If you really manage to get to 100% dehydration, you must have ignored the wells every few 100 meters. And even if you dehydrate completely, there is no real penalty. Also hunger has a rather small penalty.\nAnd by the way, it's way too easy to get food. Constantly respawning animals break the survival feeling.\nAnimal respawns work like zombie respawns. Just a few steps in the wrong direction and all the animals and zombies are back, Sleeping is also very weird. You only can sleep as long you are under 50% sleep. If you're on 51%, the games gives a ♥♥♥♥. You have to wait until you're tired enough.\n\nYou drink water from you bottle -> you get your bottle back. (Seems about right)\nYou produce a lemonade and drink it -> you'll also eat the glass. (???)\nYou cook meat -> 100% Food and 25% Health restored. (Seems about right)\nYou find a new recipe in which you add mushrooms to your meat -> 100% Food (What happened to the 25% Health? Idk. More items -> less effective.)\n\nTL;DRWeird arcade, non-survival game with too many bugs and design flaws.\nI don't get how this game could get such a high rating.\nIf you can get this game for 1€/$1 it's kinda worth your money.\nOtherwise, don't think about buying it.","June 23, 2015","false","11.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The setting isn't actually creative, yet the crafting options are diverse. Me being a fan of the isometric camera really tips the balance on the game's favor.

The graphics are reasonable, sound is good, gameplay is fun.  A certain degree of strategy is certainly required as there are different types of zombies and environmental challenges.\n\nYou have to manage health/thirst/sleep which I love in a survival game.  There is also a day/night cycle and special enemies come out at night.\n\nThe coop mode also shows promise but I have not yet tried it.\n\nWeapons\nThere is some variety to the weapons you can craft (ranging from a simple bow to a compound bow with fire arrows to pistols to SMG's to assault rifles to shotguns to precision rifles) and they are satisfying to shoot enemies with.  I like how you have to 'focus' your shots to get headshots.  You can make molotovs and bombs too.\n\nCrafting/Inventory\nThe crafting system works, isn't too clunky but isn't extremely exciting either.  You're very limited as to how much you can carry but I've rarely found myself in need of something I didn't have (at least in regards to ammo/stims/food/water), it mostly just becomes tedious when you're trying to collect items for crafting.\n\nStory\nThere's not much to the story but it loosely strings together a series of tasks that keep you going.\n\nAbilities\nThe level-up perks, or ability tree, or whatever you want to call it is kind of a waste - it will make your stats and abilities slightly better but nothing exciting.","May 20, 2014","true","8.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This game is pure amaze ballz. I’m not into the Multiplayer zombie games were its PVE and PVP were I have to have annoying other players kill me off. This is a pure multiplayer (even though it’s just u and one friend) PVE survival shenanigans.\n\nFirstly, although the game may be fun as hell, and it is, I personally had a few bothersome problems that for me alas made the game a not 100% pure epic game; it still became a 98% pure epic game. Problem Uno was the inventory space and no chests in the safe houses. This is a personal opinion as I felt the inventory space (after upgrading it twice) still didn’t cut it for me, possibly I’m a crap survivor but was always frustrated in what to keep and kept chucking things and then having to look for them in each safe house that were thrown on the floor alone the way or in one pile. So a sort of Storage chest or more bags on us would have been nice. Problem duo I felt the Story mode was a bit too short I really wanted more and would have liked more quests and more of a longer story in general (even with the DLC as I have em all) I still wanted more to taste.\n\nLastly and less moany the game is really fun all I’ve played so far was the Story mode, twice as well as collecting everything, so I really still have a lot to tap into this game. With the many DLCs that were cheaper with the game all together in the amazing sale there is still a massive amount of game 4 more different challenges that I still haven’t tried yet. The crafting in the game was just mind-blowing the amount of detail and simplicity they put to make crafting enjoyable as well as was so deep and rich that I simply couldn’t craft everything. The weapons are all mostly different and very fun in their own way (boomerangs are the best!!!) as well as the interesting ways of staying alive with cooking cool foods, drinking interesting drinks and making powerful potions to give u that slight boost in the most impossible situations. Oh and don’t forget the beautiful explosions and Molotov’s.\nDefiantly strongly recommend this game and will defiantly be getting How to survive 2!!! 10/10!!!!","May 9","true","31.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Using either a mouse + keyboard combination or a gamepad, you're hitting / slashing / shooting zombies. It works just fine with both, and you can switch to an axe with a simple press if you're getting swarmed with your bow. Obviously the game is an hack'n'slash with zombies so you can expect all its traditional elements: special zombies and bosses. How To Survive also features a neat craft system, so you can gather as much crap as possible in order to make the weapon of your dreams. One issue with that though, the inventory tends to be full most of the time since it's so small. As for the survival, you can hunt, gather plants or fruits, water, then cook it all before heading to bed.\n\n2) Story\nYou're a survivor, so you meet other survivors who just happen to want the same thing as you: survive in order to escape the zombie outbreak. Though the game is rather humorous, guess we'd all turn out crazy if zombies started to invade the streets.\n\n3) Graphics\nNothing much to say. The game looks nicey with "realistic" graphics, which somehow manages to feel refreshing. Hooray, no pixel shading!\n\n4) Coop\nIt's as good as the singleplayer: there are more enemies and they tend to hit harder since you're two. Yes. Two. That is a bit disappointing, but at least they did it right. Well, almost. Both players have to stay in the same "screen" in order to progress, so don't expect to finish a quest while your partner is farming xp.\n\n5) Conclusion: I picked it up for almost nothing and didn't actually expect the game to be that good, def one of the most pleasing hack'n'slash and coop game I tried. The survival elements and the crafting system tend to spice up the gameplay, which is just what the genre needed to last longer. I'd love it even more if the game was a little longer though... 8/10","November 4, 2014","true","17.2"," 63 of 118 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","63","118","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stratogan/recommended/250400/","stratogan","strato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stratogan/","95 products in account","Not a bad game at all. Game starts off by leaving you stranded on an island with virtually nothing but your wits and clothes, and was quite an enjoyable experience for me. The talent system felt kind of lacking and pointless to me, however, and the game offers only up to about 15 hours of gameplay i'd say. After that it'll probably rot in your library un-touched. Combat is not too bad, controls are pretty solid, graphics are kinda nice, and the game is an ok pc-port, dis-regarding the fact that controller buttons still show up instead of keys. I would say to wait for a %50 sale+ since the game won't last you very long. If the storyline had been longer or had more things to do, i would consider buying it full price (I picked it up on a sale for $3)\n\nUPDATE: (10/3/14)\nLately, a lot of other DLC have been added to the game which potentially boost the playtime of it to around, say, 20-30 hours depending on how fast you play. If you do plan on purchasing the DLC along with the game, go for the bundle (If you want the El Diablo Islands DLC you'll have to wait a bit before they add it to the package). Question is, do i recommend the purchase of the DLC? The answer, however, is totally dependent on how you feel about the game and whether you enjoyed it or not. I consider H2S a hidden gem on the steam market of the zombie/survival genre, and I would recommend the DLC if you have the money. Even without DLC, the game is completely playable and should still provide a fun experience. Basically, if you have your doubts about the DLC, don't buy them. If you liked the game, get the DLC. (Try and wait for a sale also, unless you just want the game that badly)\n\nTL;DR\nDLC add about an extra 10 hours to the game and I do recommend if you enjoyed the game, if you have mixed feelings then i don't recommend them.","April 6, 2014","true","3.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

As if that wasn't bad enough, there isn't even an option to disable in-game tips when browsing through the game's options menu.\n\nI have contacted the game's support team about the aforementioned problems, and they have shown no response whatsoever. I see that a new DLC pack recently came out for the game. The developers should focus on fixing their existing product before they attempt to augment it with commercial add-ons.\n\nI like How To Survive's gameplay, graphics, and sound. The game controls fine with a mouse and keyboard, but the hints that pop up over and over (and over...) - which cover extremely elementary controls (i.e. How to move, how to attack) - make it clear that this game was designed primarily for consoles. Those hints also suggest that refinements that EKO Software had in mind when porting this game to the PC were mere afterthoughts. Players are granted the option to adjust the game's resolution and to play in a windowed mode, but that's about is as far as PC refinements go.\n\nIn conclusion, although I'm satisfied with the core of the game, the reason why I feel it deserves a negative review is because the game is marred by two basic problems (one of which is recurring, demonstrates a lack of playtesting, and detracts from my enjoyment of the game). If the developers ever correct these problems, I will recommend the game, but as of now, I would not condone buying it (or its DLC, or any other product developed by EKO Software) until the developers address the problems I brought to their attention. If you feel compelled to play this game in spite of the issues I covered, do yourself a favour and wait until it is on sale at a very discounted price. Your money would be better spent on acclaimed games by developers who respect their customers enough to address basic defects in their products.\n\nADDENDUM: An update published since last time I played How To Survive enables players to disable in-game hints/tips if they so choose (Main Menu > Help & Options > Game > Tips). This update is a mixed blessing: One the one hand, it's great that I can disable in-game hints so I don't have to see the same messages repeat over and over and over, no matter how many times I have executed their suggested behaviours. On the other hand, it sucks that the problem of excessively redundant tips continues to plague the game.\n\nIn essence, what the update enables players like myself to do is to bypass a glitch that the developers are too lazy to correct. For all I know, if I continue to play the game, I may miss out on an important tip (for once!) because EKO Software's reluctance to address the underlying problem makes it very inconvenient to play the game with tips enabled.\n\nI have also noticed that I am frequently required to download updates to this game, and the updates are often huge. The updates are clearly not addressing the game's core mechanics and options, so it would appear that everyone  who owns How To Survive is being forced to waste time and bandwidth downloading DLC data that can only be unlocked by purchasing DLC content.","June 25, 2014","false","6.8"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","0"

I wonder what the new "zombie" will be and how long it will take to get here? Oh well, I shouldn't let that get in the way of telling you about How to Survive! HtS is actually a very enjoyable little game, kind of like Zombie Driver, Alien Breed and Diablo II ran a train on Krater. I can't put my finger on it, but it really did feel like I had played HtS before, and to me that's a really good sign that a game is made properly (at least to my liking, anyway). I found it challenging, but not so much that I wanted to go Super Saiyan on my screen, and was genuinely interested by the plot twists and creative story. I found this surprising because HtS, at first glance, looks like your run-of-the-mill horde grinder, but upon closer inspection I found it to be much more.\nThe crafting system is elaborate enough yet easy to understand, that it is not only enjoyable, but essential to the gameplay. The environments are colourful enought that you don't feel like you've been sating at ants scurrying across tea-stained paper for hours, though a little more variation like cave systems would have added a bit of contrast. Everything worked, no bugs, no pulling my hair out looking for fixes or walkthroughs, and the in-game tutorials on how things work were humorously done, adding an element of comedy that you don't often see in survival games.\nIf you're beween AAA titles and you're looking for something casual to break it up a bit, How to Survive has to be one of the best little games I've played in a long time.

You get regular zombies, but you also get a lot of mutants, so it keeps you ready for anything.\n\nGame runs smoothly, I didn't encounter any bugs and after you're done with story mode (I obviously am not), you can try to play in local co-op, co-op and multiplayer. There are several modes included and hardcore difficulty will make you cry (even normal one has its tough moments). Incredibly deep crafting system makes you craft something completely useless and this is the first time I saw something like this in any kind of crafting games.\n\nHow To Survive is an indie gem that looks cheap, feels cheap and plays lovely. Basically, this is one of those games you've dared to love before huge web portals and trend-fueled magazines told you it's not OK to love these kind of games because of I don't know what reason.\n\nGET IT.","January 4, 2015","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It had previously been on my wishlist, since it features local co-op.\n\nNot a bad little game from my first play with it. Isometric (Diablo-like) view, decent enough to look at and with a good sense of humor. Gameplay is a hybrid Action-RPG/Survival/Crafting type of game.\n\nThere looks to be 4 main islands in the game, which you can hop between when you fix boats etc. and explore. It has a hunger, thirst and fatigue system that works all together with the crafting. Crafting in this is actually quite good. I have made myself a handmade gun that shoots scrap metal (think Flak-Cannon) out of various materials I found. I also crafted a bow and arrows, and even some "fish and chips". Ehem. Like I said, this is a humorous game. As soon as you hear one of the fellow survivor "Kovac" reciting his "Survival Manual", you will know what you are in for.\n\nSimilarly to 7 Days to Die, night time is a difficult time to be out and about wondering without sufficient supplies, since you get a new type of fast zombie at night, that can rip you to shreds in an instant. Campfires, torches and flashlights work quite well against these guys though, so as long as you have one, you are okay.\n\nSo, it's nothing special, but I bought it mainly for local co-op anyway, for which I foresee it being good fun. For the price I paid, it is well worth it.\n\nJimbo Rating: 6/10","February 10, 2014","true","2.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

As others stated its got a Diablo hack n slash feel to it. There is item crafting (combine or break down essentially), gathering such as medicinal, food/water, and then weapons/tools which so far have had a nice variety I am satisfied with. The combat is repetitive, but each island is introducing new items and enemies. The islands themselves are fairly open, but still mostly pathways with a few open areas. I have yet to play the harder difficulty or go online, but have played coop local which was fun. Future DLC should probably include more game content and diversity of quests. More islands, adding caves maybe even some kind of scuba diving mission series and of course more characters. I'm not sure what"iron man" difficulty has so excuse me if I mention something I just haven't gotten to yet, but I would like a survival mode with water being more difficult to acquire and maybe having raw meat attract hordes better. Constructing your own safe house would be nice instead of the typical one. This game has been enjoyable and future updates I could see it being really good. I don't see why it has such low reviews, but then again I just picked it up on sale with all dlc for around $9-10. Seems worth it so far.","May 16, 2014","true","17.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There's only about 10 hours of game play, and that's hitting all the side missions, but there's a certain charm to the game. There are several instructional videos in the game, and they remind me of Team Fortress 2 in their style.\n\nI don't think there's much variation in the characters and their play styles unless you force it. For example, I took Jack due to his melee skills, but found myself using the "machine gun" from the time I got it until the end. I suppose I could have gone melee all the way, but why would I do that when I have a perfectly good ranged weapon?\n\nI do have some qualms about the crafting system as you'll run out of space in your backpack and won't be sure what you need, and what you don't without researching things you can build in a menu accessed in the start menu, which is part of the main menu. That was confusing, and took me out of the game. If the game is based around the survival guide, I should be able to access it IN game. A minor complaint.\n\nAnyway, check out the video to see if the gameplay looks like something you'd enjoy, and if so, grab it next time it's on sale.","June 5, 2014","true","16.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But H2S has so many good things, its in the vein of when i first played S.t.a.l.k.e.r.(one of my all time fav) or Dead Island(good game) there are too many systems going on for it all to come together to make it great. As an example, there are only a dozen or so enemies and they will spawn in exactly the same point every time, the level up system doesnt really make too much sense on why it is so limited in scope. I could make explosive arrows, but not ammo? I held onto some of the unique flowers never finding any use, etc. But god damn if i didnt have fun and that is what it is all about. I thought the story was actually pretty good meaning B movie quality good, and some of the side missions are ok but very rewarding. The game looks really good, comabt was solid, and the crafting is actually pretty smart. If you run through games and nit pick at every little thing i wouldnt recommend but if you enjoy exploring and doing quests its a worthy journey.\n\n","January 5, 2014","true","31.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/250400/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","How To Survive is one of those games I've come across that while it is an overall average game I can safely say I'm not touching it anymore. The first time I heard about How To Survive it sounded like another survival game on a zombie apocalypse, with crafting elements, drinking, eating, cooking, hunting etc. After playing it I can safely say it's not exactly as it was advertised or as the videos seem to show you. How To Survive is an isometric shooter, pretty similar to the Alien Shooter and Zombie Shooter series, which in my opinion are very good ones, but with a slight different twist to it. Graphically I'd say the game is rather nice looking but nothing that will blow your mind and animation quality is somewhat rough and to be desirable. The sound assets are pretty poor in my honest opinion and the voice acting is something to laugh at but it does get the job done. Story wise the game has fairly little to it, you stranded on a series of islands and there you find that these islands are infested by zombies are other creatures, you also find various survivors and Kovac, a guy who helps you and gives you tutorials, which are present as chapters of his survival book and they teach you the basics of the game, Kovac is probably the only funny guy in the game because he has a russian/soviet accent. The game features a serious of basic mechanics such as fishing, crafting, hunger, thirst and tiredness. Fishing is best done at dawn and at sundown, as you might expect hunger and thirst are dealt with eating and drinking while tiredness is either dealt with by eating certian fruits or capturing certain safehouses, when you open the doors to these safehouses it will trigger a wave event of sorts, alot of zombies and creatures will come at you and after you've cleared the area you can enter the safehouse, close the door, and then you can save your game and sleep on some sort of bed that is laying on the ground. Now the crafting along with the inventory management system and the way it works is probably one of the things I was most disappointed by, your inventory is fairly limited in terms of space and that's to be expected from something that is similar to a survival game but the fact that you need to go to the menu and check each recipe individually and that you have to select an item and then you click combine and it will show you the items which you can combine that item with is rather frustrating to me because it won't tell you what you will get by combining those items together without you having to check the menu, I'm pretty sure they could've had putted something that indicated what would the outcome of that combination will be but whatever. Nonetheless in terms of actual crafting recipes it's actually very varied, you can combine harpoon grips with diving tanks and some other stuff in order to make a pressurized pistol, shotgun or submachine gun, the ammo for these guns are found in zombies bodies and I believe it's mainly metal scrap, shrapnel and screws, of course you can also craft various kind of armour such as combining a soldier helmet with a bone in order to make some sort of horned helmet or mixing plants in order to make various kind of potions such as shield potions, aim potions etc. Now the combat, the combat is probably the best thing from How To Survive, you usually have melee and ranged weapons and the melee weapons are pretty standard, machetes, stone axes or chainsaws, and you can charge your melee attack if you keep holding the attack button which will result in increased damage, ranged weapons are maybe the best way of fighting, there's various types of bows you can craft and when you kill someone with a arrow you can go to their body and get the arrow back so this is a very efficient way of taking out individual or small groups of enemies and you can also make incendiary arrows. The aiming system is fairly enjoyable actually, you basicly have one button for shooting/attacking and another one for aiming, by keeping the aiming button pressed a little circle will appear around the enemies head and the more you keep it pressed the little the circle will become and eventually it will become a red crosshair which means it will be an headshot which is the most effective way of taking down enemies the way I see it. However by the time you figure this out the game starts introducing you to zombies with soldier helmets which will require you to take their helmets off and only then taking them down and the same happens with zombies with kevlar vests which require you to charge your melee attack in order to chop their head off. In the end I didn't really enjoyed How To Survive but I can surely say that is a good game, even though it tries to get you in an emotional way at some times and it fails horribly, in my case it just wasn't what I was expecting it to be and so I ended up just abandoning my playthrough and I don't plan to go back and beat it. Overall I'd say that if this is what you're looking for you should grab it, if you're not sure yet I'd recommend waiting for a sale.","February 1, 2014","true","6.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanduar/recommended/250400/","Zanduar","Zengineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanduar/","480 products in account","This is a very generic and low budget zombie survival game. The only unique mechanic that sets it apart is the ability to disassemble created items to their basic parts. It does not work on certain items, particularly advanced armor.\n\nThe rest of the game is low quality top down zombie shooting. Your field of view is very narrow so there is no sniping. The camera is also a fixed viewing angle which causes too many problems both from a player standpoint and a game design standpoint. However this is all moot because the actual playable area is very small. There are several islands which are all designed in basically the same way. Here is an example of some of the level design: Talk to NPC. NPC gives mission to find X item on Y island. Follow a winding path that features many areas to fall down or access previous areas of the level but only features one way forward. See barricade that is indestructible regardless of total damage done to it. Find a "safe" house. Open door of "safe" house and have a swarm of zombies attack on the area is clear of zombies. See campfire near safe house. Take route to find location near final destination. See another indescribable barricade. Visit objective. The indictable barricades can eventually be destroyed but only very late into the game. They basically serve as walls until destroyed and then they become massive shortcuts.\n\nThe survival aspect is pitiful. You have four status bars to keep track of: Health, Hunger, Thirst, and Tiredness. They are easily taken care of and really only serve as a nuisance to take up backpack space. Uncooked meals kill you. Cook meals increase the hunger bar's fullness and occasionally heal a small amount. They never go bad and there are only two basic ingredients that are edible, raw meat which comes from any animal and special white plant which is found in various locations. It is possible to carry water but there are so many sources of water (expect rain) you'll never have to worry about it.\n\nCombat is heavily biased towards guns. There are almost no melee recipes but there are gun recipes. Ammo is abundant and all guns use the same ammo. Bows are basically handguns and every gun is a fully automatic that at worst rapidly pumps ammo but is lethal at close range. The greatest gun I could create at "high" for every state, including accuracy, so I could actually aim at enemies off screen and kill in one hit. But really the best weapon of all is the tri-blade boomerang with spikes. Take a melee blade and combine it with a bone. Now you have a sharpened bone. Combine two sharpened bones. Then combine a third. Then combine a piece of flint. You can add the flint with just two bone blades.\n\nThis is basically the best weapon you can have. It hits multiple zombies, it is incredibly fast, and best of all it doesn't require blueprints.\n\nWhich leads to the biggest failure of this game. The crafting system isn't based on experimentation and it has a terrible UI. For the UI you click on an item, see if the combine item is there, click combine and see if you have another item that can be combined with. But you need recipes for many of the items in order to make them. Most of the time you can't just combine two random items and see what happens. During the first bits of the game yes you can and the amazing tri-blade boomerang can be made at this stage but later in the game you'll simply be finding recipes for items that you could have made with ingredients you found hours ago that were useless. Also the crafting is additionally resctricted by a player's level and unlocked skills. So even though you'll unlock the recipe for fire arrows pretty quickly unless you spend the point to make them you won't be able to. Luckily you can at least use items that you haven't unlocked a skill or blueprint for. Just don't uncombine it.\n\nThe skill tree is a joke. The player characters have slightly different stats but it doesn't matter. Even though I choose the character with the lowest stamina and accuracy I was easily able to shoot or run away. I died a few times but mostly boss deaths or zombie-animal attacks which who will charge you rapidly and suicidally.\n\nThe only part of the game that I was impressed with was the standoff in the mist. Rain is occasionally used as a weather effect  but only during a final stand is an effect used to really change up gameplay. The mist moves which creates a realistic affect of obscuring sight and requiring character reaction. The massive amount of hidden zombies actually creates a sense of panic. Unfortunately one exciting part of a game is not enough to redeem it. The quirky survival manual voice overs are really the only positive thing I've taken away from this game.","March 7, 2015","false","4.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","2"

I just wish I had ignored the low score earlier. METACRITIC IS WRONG.\n\nI am seriously amazed that the Metacritic score is currently sitting at 60%, I would definitely put this game at a 90+%.\n\nBasically I was looking for a game that I could play Local Co-Op with my girfriend, and this game does not disappoint, her and I love it. She is not an avid gamer either and it is not easy to get her into a game.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great Local Co-Op experience.\n\nAs you can probably see from this review, I don't typically do this, but I felt compelled to give this game the respect it deserves.

Boss battles are boring, every time I ran into one it would get stuck on something and be an easy kill. The only good part of this game is I got it for literally pennies with money from selling trading cards, and partly due to a steam sale.

How to survive or H2s if you are in the now, Lets you make up your mind in its crafting, want to make a gun? sure but do not get upset if it backfires why? well you made the thing stupid, How to survive will not hold your hand in your crafting endeavors, you will be told how to craft what makes this and that, but the games crafting combos are massive and can catch you off off guard, sometimes in wonderful ways( its something you just need to find out first hand honest. all I can say is that I have a new found respct for STICKS!) you will collect pages, as your journey unfolds pages from one of the most likeable NPC'S in a game (my opinion) the questionable and charismatic kovac AKA the guide dude. a russian accented inventor/author/POSSIBLE CRAZY AS A 3AM TEAM FORTRESS 2 PLAYER WHO LIKES TO ASK PEOPLE HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT CATS IN HATS fella, who will  show you the ins and outs of the game and who will gloat in his Knowledge of the island and its offerings. like meat? good! but cook it first! or you will be sorry, thirsty? well thats nice but do not drink from the swamps! or you will.. oh you get the point. its the details to things like what will make you sick and what will see you to victory that set how to survive apart from its bloated zombie brethren,  its a game  that you need to think not just hack and slash and yes there is plenty of that as well but the zombie asskicking is a way for you dear player to level up and unlock abilities! abilities that let you set fires, aim better  and just flat out become a badass. OK now that I have typed all this really stuff about How to survive I do have a few,(but minor) gripes. the aiming can be touchy, the mouse is your aim in the form of an ever present yellow arrow/sometimes red aiming circle/ and is your firing ability. this can be an issue when faced with undead clusters or a animal who you wish to turn into food, while the standard W-S-A-D key layout is how you move the character, you will not aim and hit a target unless you hover right over it and this is a one at a time system, so get clicking like a mad man and or chick. lucky the badies drop, pritty quickly (rember to level up!) also the crafting layout is more or less a hey try this and see what happens, you pick what you want lets say grip(the first object needed for a gun) you will be given the options, in yellow highlighted app looking boxes what the grip will craft with. if you click by accident on something that you did not want( you know the eh ♥♥♥♥/I did not mean to do that moment) it will, craft with out a prompt, then you must uncraft and pick what you wanted in the first place. this can leave the player feeling annoyed and disracted from the quest that they are undertaking. but good news for you, overtime and practice the picky aiming and just so fireing mechanism get to be reflex like. How to survive is a game made from passion and the drive to, offer a new take on a beat to death genre, no this is not Left 4 dead and it is not way any means trying to be. no mindless running and gunning no vast amounts of weapons laying randomly about no sir and or mam. this is a game about finding things makeing things out of things useing your head to make things and showing you, yes you. that How to survive is the difrent kid on the block and seeks to prove that not only to you but to the field of gameing as well.","February 9, 2014","true","5.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","2"

While not really bringing much in the means of innovation. The game is a TON of fun. The crafting system is pretty damn in-depth. While the missions aren't exactly perfect, they're do-able. But that's not where the game shines.\nFor me, roaming around the various islands, looking for new parts to salvage, food to hunt for and sleep to manage is the main enjoyment here.\n\nI play this game more for the survival aspect, making sure i'm topped on ammo, making sure i have enough food and water, then making sure i'm back at a safe house before dark, too avoid being chased by creatures that only appear at night. Not to mention they've recently implemented Online Story CO-OP. I haven't tested this, but I assume it'll be just as fun, if not better than the single player.\n\nThere are challenge modes to play, I personally like 'Island of the Fatties' on 'Iron Man' difficulty, it's a hell of a lot of fun, and various other challenges which are also great fun!\nSoundtrack is star, some of the tracks used are just perfect for the settings they're used in. and the sounds of the guns and weapons actually sound like what you'd expect in real life.\n\nAll in all, definately worth the £11.99 it's priced at, although I grabbed this for a deal of £3!\n","February 25, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What's fun is the crafting and exploring - it gets better later on in the game. I think the storage system sucks because you get to clear saverooms but no possibilty to save your stuff that you don't have in your inventory for later.(you CAN drop it on the floor and it will stay most of the time....but come on - seriously?)\n\nI recommend that game for anyone that likes zombies and survival(only with Kovac's DLC!), with a touch of crafting and rpg.\n\nI strongly advise anyone who wants HtS for the Coop modus to STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY from this game!!! (at least till they fix it - which doesn't seem that big of a concern at the moment)\n\nRegards,\n\nAX","May 28, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The item system was very enjoyable to use for me, using differnt parts to caft different weapons was great. The story is predictable, but you get to smash zombies heads in with a flint axe.

I'm really glad I did, because this game is awesome.  Sure the graphics aren't great, and the fighting is a little bit clunky, but this is the best survival game out there that is actually finished.\n\nIn this game you are stranded on an island, and you have to craft a lot of items to survive.  You have to manage health, sleep, hunger, and thirst meters to stay alive.  The crafting system is really simple, but it works really well.  There are a whole bunch of different things to craft, and you can play differently depending on the items you craft.\n\nThere is no story.  Even though technically there are characters and dialogue, it's pretty terrible.  But that doesn't really matter when you are just taking it as a surival game.  In the story mode I mainly skipped the dialogue.  The exception to this rule is the survival guides you can pick up.  These guides help you to be better at the game, but they are hilarious!  Kovac who wrote the book narrates and is a really funny character.\n\nThe DLC in this game is mostly just cosmetic, but at a sale price it is worth getting.  There are different costumes for each character, and the ability to craft fire weapons.  These fire weapons come in really handy.  There are also a couple game modes to buy, and even a new map to play.  The DLC is really cheap when it is on sale, so there is no reason not to get it.\n\nThere is online co op and local co op for this game, so don't worry about that.  It's often best to play with a friend, but you really need to play together.  I don't think that there is in game chat or voice chat so you will need to play with someone you know using Skype or something because this is the type of game where it is a lot easier when you have a good teammate and good communication.\n\nI've been playing a lot of games like DayZ, The Dead Linger, Rust, and others.  These are mostly great, but the biggest gripe I have is they aren't finished yet.  Even don't starve is adding a multiplayer mode that isn't quite finished.  This game is completely done, and has a lot of DLC.  So while DayZ and other survival games will probably end up being much better games, this one is really good now.  As far as survival games, this is the one I would recommend you get if you are waiting for updates on DayZ or rust.\n\nOther then the story you can also play the challlenge modes.  These are fun because you start each level with nothing and then you have to find and craft everything.  You can change the difficulty if you have already beaten the game and it will still give a challenge.  These modes add a lot of replayability, and it is fun to just play a couple challenges with a friend when you are short on gaming time.\n\nAt 15 dollars, I could recommend this game to survival fans, but at a sale price of 2 or 3 bucks, this game can be fun for anyone.  The crafting system is fun, the game has a lot of content when you add the DLC, and with online co op there is a lot of replayability.","January 3, 2015","true","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture.

Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.","December 23, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

And that reason is probably good enough to tell you that if you're into these types of games that you will enjoy it. There's lots of stuff to collect, lots of weapons and armor to craft so you will always find yourself occupied in a good sense of the fashion. The zombie killing mechanics are quite entertaining. The sprint button, weapon charge and aiming system makes taking care of the zombies fun.And there's always something to do such as monitoring your Health, Hunger, Sleep and thirst meters, ensuring they are substantial at all times. Also, the quests eventually lead you to new locations. There's lots to explore, in a well designed and graphically detailed world with new Zombie type monsters lurking around every corner, confronting you with new challenges. Not to mention the skill tree which is unique to every character, you will find certain skills to benefit your party early on. The Co-op gameplay has a lot going for it, and when you're playing online there are tombstones scattered around the map indicating where players from the internet had their characters die in the game.

Overall it is a very fun game easily worth the 3 dollars on sale and whatever the normal price may be.

While not really bringing much in the means of innovation. The game is a TON of fun. The crafting system is pretty damn in-depth. While the missions aren't exactly perfect, they're do-able. But that's not where the game shines.\nFor me, roaming around the various islands, looking for new parts to salvage, food to hunt for and sleep to manage is the main enjoyment here.\n\nI play this game more for the survival aspect, making sure i'm topped on ammo, making sure i have enough food and water, then making sure i'm back at a safe house before dark, too avoid being chased by creatures that only appear at night. Not to mention they've recently implemented Online Story CO-OP. I haven't tested this, but I assume it'll be just as fun, if not better than the single player.\n\nThere are challenge modes to play, I personally like 'Island of the Fatties' on 'Iron Man' difficulty, it's a hell of a lot of fun, and various other challenges which are also great fun!\nSoundtrack is star, some of the tracks used are just perfect for the settings they're used in. and the sounds of the guns and weapons actually sound like what you'd expect in real life.\n\nAll in all, definately worth the £11.99 it's priced at, although I grabbed this for a deal of £3!\n","February 25, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Targetting often swaps between enemies make it so you can't get a "critical hit", the bug list is sizeable and fixes are not coming. If you can stomach that it is a fine little game for the price point that has okay controller support and pretty fun multiplayer. Some of the DLC makes it more interesting.

Turns out, it is actually a really fun game. I can't vouch for playing it singleplayer but the 2 co-op aspect is really good. It does have a slight issue with the shared camera (players can only deviate from each other so far before it blocks) and it does ooze bad console port, but these issues didn't really get in the way of some really fun gaming sessions. Plus, the combat system and ranged weapon mechanics are very good. Thoroughly recommended :)","October 14, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Kovac is a rather interesting helpful character that is on the island to make the tutorial more interesting.\nAnd can find recipes around to help with crafting or you can try and figure it out yourself.\n\nYou can play several characters each with different skill trees and exclusive weapons, so you can play different ways.\nCan save at the rest spots when you want once they are cleared. Which is handy.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be very many quests and the islands you can explore are rather small and even though it's quite linear you can return to any islands you've previously been to as much as you want.\n\n\nDislike that when people die all these gravestones with the persons name gets left everywhere like 50+ of them covering the islands even when it's someone not even on your friends list or someone you've never played the game with, I find it ugly and obtrusive and sometimes makes it hard to see things.\nI'd prefer if the game did not put them in or at least give the option to turn them off.\n\nThe game causes a complete screen freeze lockup at least once a play sessions. Making it really annoying if you're trying a challange mode.\n\nWhen you open the map you can't interact with it in any way, and it does not list which island you are on with the map.\n\nAnd even when the pilot was no longer at his camp you could still hear a gulping sound like he was there drinking, it's the same with doctor miller, when she is no longer in the game you still hear her voice yelling out to watch out for zombies at the previous spots she was at.\n\n\nI find the game mostly fun and enjoyable, and rate it 6/10 better than average but not a game I'd class as good as it has annoying flaws. Still worth playing for a while. A game worth getting on special but not full price.","September 29, 2015","true","34.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

There is no survival challenge once you have selected the 3 skills to make your bars drain slowly, ammo isnt a problem with the boomerang, and enemies are predictable and slow.\n\nThe "night time" is meant to have some kind of evil creature that is scared of the light, but the torch never drains so they are just free exp to my boomerang of 5 one shotting.\n\nI probably should talk about some of the good features, the characters are cool I guess.\n\nI think the best part of the game was trying to find places to sleep, these were spread decently, and alerted a large group of enemies when opened, which was fun, at first, until I just stepped inside and closed the door and dealt with what looked like, 100 zombies coming from a broom closet.\n\nOh, the graphics are nice, apart from very repeating animations, the "executions" are nicely done, but always revert back to the stick, which forces me to change weapon again.\n\nOverall, I will give this game 3/10 for some nice graphics, and fun moments, but I would not recommend this to any one, unless you really, REALLY, love survival games.","October 24, 2013","false","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The zombies basically just hit harder and drop less items.\n\nI managed to find a few people playing the coop, but the ones playing challenges without playing the main game are at a disadvantage because they don't know the recipes or have the levels/armor of a more experienced player.\n\nIf you enjoy twinstick rpg/shooters, you will most likely enjoy this game.","January 12, 2014","true","124.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is also some monkey business. It is worth to cater monkey’s needs you will get precious goods. But all in all, story is vividly sick and there are some twists.\n\nIron man mode is challenging but not impossible.

This game doesn't only brings out the basic joy of "pretenting" to survive in front of your keyboards, it teaches some very fundamental yet essential skills for surviving at home, especially when you are the type who likes to lock yourself up and game 48 hours each day,\n\nFirst of all, this game equips you with the skill of item organization. Look around you. No, I don't mean look around your monitor, but around the place you are currently sitting in. Do you see piles of clothes, files, items stacked all around you? If no, then good for you. But if you do, and when you do, this games can teach you the skill to organize these "Mount Fabrics" and "Mount Rubble" around you. If you have ventured around for a couple of hours in this game, you would have known that there is no item chest. That's okay, because whenever you dump an item onto the ground, it will stay there, forever. So, when you've collected, let say, a hundred different items (you can easily acheive this number after somewhat 5 hours of gaming), you will find yourself staring at piles and piles of save-it-for-later items, which the later usually mean never. Therefore, when you decide to craft an item (item crafting is one of the selling points of this game), you will need to dig these piles of save-it-for-later to find what you want. You will soon learn to locate burried items, as well as organizing items so that things looks asthetically pleasant and they can be easily located.\n\nItem location is not the only skill you learn, as you will be learning the basic functions of the human body. One thing you will notice is that you sleep when you need, and not at night. Well, to be honest, your biological clock doesn't exactly run on a 24 hour scale, at least not in "How to Survive". You will be sleeping during the day, at night, whenever you need, period. Another thing about your body is that, although you need to eat, you never poop. Yes, your body is amazing, because it is all input and there will be no physical residues for output. Everything will be transformed into energy. Think of it like poop is your fuel. So, the keyboard warriors reading this, you felt ashamed that your level is not high enough to unlock this ability of poop-fuel? Me neither. The last thing about your body you should know is that, although you need to cook whatever you eat, you don't have to boil your water. Why? Because you are immune to those zombie infections, dummy! You are the chosen one!\n\nThere are many more bedroom survival skills for you to figure out, so when you are done slacking around, jump right in and start learning how to survive in your own darn room!","January 16, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","3","4","4","1"

To be honest- I hate writing negative Reviews; especially on games that seem to be rather popular like this one, also, I got it on summer sale for a mere 90cent.\n\nFirst, what's this game about?\nIt's an isometric zombie hack and slasher game(literally, don't even think about being stealthy- that will not lead to success -.-) placed on different islands. Of course with some "crafting" just like all new games, although it's not really crafting. It's basically collecting items and clicking on them until stuff is created. (I won't go into detail about graphics as I really don't give a /&%/% about that- either you like it or not, right? Think graphics are ok)\n\nSo what did freak me out on this game?\nActually I really like the way this game is built up:\nIt has a good sense of humour, different types of zombies and also of course some survival aspects such as the need to sleep, eat and drink. Anyway, as far as I remember, I chose medium difficulty and when I first ran out of food or water... I was freaked out to find some damn food! But when I finally reached point 0 on either of them... NOTHING happened. Is it good or bad? Well, actually it's good because finding enough food is next to IMPOSSIBLE! Until you get, sorry, "craft" your fishing rod. But of course just as in any realistic game, you can only get your fish to bite in either dusk or dawn. That leads us to the next problem: DAY AND NIGHT! It seems to me that days are like 5 minutes and nights last forever! Even more, while it's night, you not only get zombies(and there are already millions of it on each island) but you get to fight some UBER zombies which you have to scare off with a flashlight!).\nYou can only save your game and sleep/recover in hiding spots which can be locked BUUUUT upon opening each hiding spot (which are maybe 2x2m big btw) an alarm goes on an endless stream of zombies appear from nowhere- some even explode :) Since there are also zombie deers... Whats next? Zombie trees that shoot nuclear raspberries? Also if you get into a thunderstorm (which is beautifully implemented) make sure, your health bar is up because once again, it's neverending AND!!! you get hit by lightnings every few minutes and you can't hide anywhere. Yes, in this game you are a moving lightning rod.\nAnother pain in the A$$ is that islands are locked within(like in gta) and you have to solve some quests requested by some dump chimp by eg. finding yellow fruit or ♥♥♥♥, to unlock it.\n\nAnyway, what made me giving up playing this game was this stupid... early 90s console type gameplay technology... I mean come on... let's say you escape from 83974987928479 zombies, jump into your boat/plane to a safe area with just one life point left, recover, explore other islands and return to that same place again... what do you expect?\nYES OF COURSE ALL THE SAME ZOMBIES WAITING FOR YOU AT THE SAME EFFIN SPOT!\n\nIf you're as good as me, then you end up "escaping" on each island leaving you in a deadlock forcing you to write a negative review. :3 <3:3 <3:3 <3 Upon returning, you're basically dead as you're immediately hit by thousands of zombies.\nAnyway, to come to an end; it gave me like 5h of fun and about 2h frustration. If there was another option to rate this game apart postive/negative I'd say it just failed to be good enough to be positively rated. My frustration isn't that high because I just paid, as said, 90cent on summer sale.","July 16, 2015","false","6.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadtv/recommended/250400/","deadtv","DeKKeR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadtv/","491 products in account","Info___\nI have finished the main story twice - both in a 2 player co-op. First time, just after the game launched and it wasn't as much fun as it was a struggle with predefined controls (we played with Strike FX Gamepads). At the first playthrough my partner could not turn in place which made aiming impossible so she was stuck with a chainsaw and had to position herself properly. I'm skipping those issues in this review as there where major fixes which convinced us to finish the game again.\n\nPros___\nThe sounds and music make a great, horrifying experience yet the whole concept of Kovac and his guides of "How to survive" - a guy who seems to enjoy the battle for survival on a zombie filled islands helps you treat all those dangers lightly and find pleasure in hacking through hordes of undeads.\nThe graphics are simple and that made us overlook some items like healing leafs since those bushes may blend with every other bush but it's a small annoyance.\nStory is interesting and although some quests may seem irritating (f*cking Sanchez and his packages) and repetitive (mostly fetching for items) the campaign is not long enough to make you bleed for this reason.\n\nCons___\nThe reasons you might find yourself flipping tables are mostly related to controls. The characters animations are kinda stiff and slow which made us fall from cliffs few times, making one of us wait for other to come back around or respawn if we fell into piranhas - from where you can't revive your buddy. I strongly recommend playing with controllers and please remember that making turns while running is futile so when you press that sprint button on a narrow high ground you are almost guaranteed to experience this problem.\nAnother annoyance is uneven difficulty but that is mostly related to how fast you can react to given situation - some weapons are better for single, strong or fast enemy and others are perfect for dealing with hordes. And again because of the controls you might find yourself switching from ranged to melee weapons instead of switching from rifle to shotgun.\n\nSummary___\nThis is a perfect game for co-op party, best if done with good partners or locally as cooperation includes handling items to a friend if your backpack is stuffed with ammo etc. You will find very helpful defining player roles such as melee/ranged/medic/crafter in terms of what you collect and how you handle fights.\nA fantastic game for rampaging those damn zombies that should give you around 10-12 hours of fun in main story and few more hours with challenges.","September 23, 2014","true","33.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I'm guessing it's due to the fact that it's so linear.  Survival games are such a trend that we automatically assume sandbox or open-world.  This is not either of those, but that doesn't make it a bad game.  As a matter of fact, I think it's an outstanding game.  I believe all the hatred comes from perception.  Don't think of this is a survival game like DayZ, Rust, etc.  Think of it as an old-school RPG with survival themes.\n\nMy only complaint would be the controls.  It's clearly designed for a gamepad and I'm currently using a mouse and keyboard.  It's slightly clunky when in the inventory.  But even at that, it plays well, it's just crafting is a bit odd.\n\nOverall this is a very fun game that is quite polished.","April 10, 2014","true","7.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

When you start playing, you find it really interesting, newfangled and addictive, but it soon starts being linear and boring.\n\nYou just kill zombies to find a quest, keep killing zombies to complete the quest and kill zombies again to get the reward. Damn, I bet you even have to kill zombies if you want to kill some zombies. Oh, and if you have to kill zombies at night, prepare yourself because you won't be able to step forward without having to deal with those night zombies. They're tough at the beginning but they'll become such a nuisance soon after you get your first ranged weapon.\n\nI can't find an explanation to this game's difficulty curve. You start playing and you can observe how difficulty increases as long as you learn how to play and then... then you get your first ranged weapon again. That's it. This applies to crafting and resources management too: "Watch out, you've got limited inventory space, you'd better think twice what you carry and what you drop". Ehmm... no. You may need this to hunt or you may need that to fish, or you could just choose to be a vegetarian and throw that s**t away. You may need to eat, you may need to drink or you may need to sleep: you eat and drink from one of those thousands of plants or wells you'll find with no effort and you can choose to never sleep again if you become a guarana seeds junkie. All of this mixed up with... surprise, killing zombies. Killing the same standard zombie again and again.\n\nStory is a nonsense, it doesn't follow any path and it's just absurd.\n\nIt is supposed to be replayed again and again, choosing different characters and difficulty, but one is enough. In a scale from CRAP to AWESOME, I give this game a Low 'meh'.","February 17, 2014","false","16.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

How To Survive is similar to Diablo in the sense that you have the same isometric camera angle and you eliminate tons of enemies - this time, however, it's zombies instead of demons.\n\nYou can pick one from the available 3 protagonists - each has different strength and their skill tree is also different. Attributes change automatically - when levelling up after a set amount of XP you get to decide only which skill to pick.\n\nOur heroes pretty soon meet Kovac, a mysterious fellow fully dressed in armor, who provides us with guidance as to how to survive. He explains eating, drinking, sleeping and the importance of - most of all - weapon crafting. There are dozens of items out there and they can be combined in various ways. When looting you'll bump into new guides regularly and these can be looked at from the menu.\n\nI like how many types of foods could be made to quickly quell our hunger or thirst. A special fruit or root even eliminated our tiredness. Sleeping is only possible at select locations - these are shackles that must be rid of the walking dead before they can be entered. Not only sleeping but saving our progress is done at these locations.\n\nYou find materials, you eliminate zombies, you pick up some herbs and fruits, you loot, free some locations, rinse and repeat. This is How to Survive in a nutshell. There are some side missions, extra difficulty levels and a separate challenge mode offering even more entertainment.\n\nWhile an indie game How To Survive looks very decent. Once night falls new enemies appear who try to jump at you from behind. Your flashlight, however, provides the very source they are afraid of. This and fire are especially nice and I liked the fog effect, as well. The game employs some excellent physics effect, too. My favourite weapon from halfway through till the very end of the story was a boomerang I reinforced greatly with some bones and flint. Initially, however, melee will do along with a bow which you also get to make better and better.\n\nIn any case, I found How To Survive an entertaining experience. Too bad some difficulty levels (including new enemies and weather effects) and additional locations are only available in the form of DLCs. Make no mistake: if you liked it you'll probably pick them up, too, it's just a shame they have to rely on the same concept as some of the AAA developer companies do.\n\nWhen discounted give How To Survive a try. But just the base game. And if you like Kovac and you accept his rules you can collect the DLCs, as well.","March 2, 2015","true","9.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

It is alright for a while but it quickly wears on you. The difficulty comes only from being swarmed when you do something such as open a safe house gate and the alarm trips and armored zombies come. That's about the only hard part in the game meaning the game's difficulty spikes randomly. It was about a 6/10 for one playthrough but I still don't recommend it because so many other games exist where your time would be much better spent. The game is not hard but it is sometimes easy to get swarmed and die because if a zombie is close to you its character model sort of awkwardly slides around you in circles making actually hitting it a lot harder than it should be. Game plays nicely (when it doesn't crash) but sometimes it is way too hard to find the right crafting components. I have to craft an electric gun to kill a shielded zombie but the game gives me zero clues to where the parts for the gun are. Crafting really sucks bad in this game. I find red, white, and blue plants all the time and hold on to them forever and finally just have to drop them because they combine in no way with anything and are useless. So I guess I just have to scoure every inch of every island until I magically stumble on the parts needed for the electric gun? Very little effort went into giving you any crafting guidance at all in this game. It is a very sloppy and ill-conceived crafting system.\n\nI played through it once but when I was done it was instantly forgettable. I just recently bought the new dlc and the game hasn't gotten any better with its lack of direction. Waste of $5 on the new expansion which only kept me entertained for about a half hour anyway.\n\n5/10 on its best day","January 3, 2015","false","15.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathDream/recommended/250400/","DeathDream","Death Dream","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathDream/","458 products in account","This is a good top down zombie survival game. Sure there are plenty out there but with this game constantly going on sale, online coop, and some decent mechanics, it is a lot of fun. It is difficult even on normal and you have to share resources to survive.\n\nStory - Bland, go to point B, get item, bring it back to A. Oh, that item doesn't work, go get this one again by going to point C, then back to A. Zombies will respawn in an area you already cleared going from A to C or A to B. There is a small hit of a story, escape the island.\n\nGameplay - Crafting weapons is the best part. At times you feel like there are to many weapons to make. Trying to condense down your inventory and make some machine gun by pure luck. You can craft armor but that is more straight forward. Zombie animals are the best sense of OH CRAP, RUN! you'll have in the game. Even compared to some of the bigger bosses in the game, animal deer are the worse. If you are playing on the harder difficulty, you get Zombie Bears (DLC)\n\nCoop - A blast. I would even recommend this zombie game over others if I was asked. You can play coop story mode, challenge mode, and if you have the DLC, two other game modes. All are fun. Each one making you find resources and trying to survive. Would highly recommend voice chat as there is no text support in the game.\n\nCons - To much back tracking. There are a couple islands in the game, more if you have the DLC. You get a mission and you feel like you've explored the whole island. Then they send you back out to cover land you already covered to get another item. And those zombies you cleared re spawned (mentioned above). This adds a lot of time of gameplay which can be a good or bad thing how you look at it.\n\nMy time - Story mode with coop partner on normal difficulty - 18 hours. Everything else was on multiplayer. If you don't have a coop partner, get over on the discussion page for this game and ask for one.\n\nOverall - the game goes on sale constantly. At $2-3 for all the DLC plus the game, it is a steal and a must have for any zombie coop fan out there. At full price of $15, I would pass.","December 29, 2014","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been playing it for two days, just hit the Third Island and am having a great time. The Plot is good, the basic training Island in the beginning is a great approach at Tutorials, along with you friend 'Kovac' who helps you every step along the way giving you new skills and training. The game is fun, it operates in an overhead, 45 Degree-Helicopter View, with an RPG style Skill tree, and leveling system. You gain new items, Craft better weapons, and utilize Plants from teh land. And the best part, is that that it isn't a failed attempt at a Zombie game where they just throw tons of Zombies at you... In this case, you can actually walk at least 20-40 feet without running into any Zed, and you can even sneak around them if you choose to. It's a great survival game, and I recommend that you try it.

It's fun for the first 4 hours or so, but the last few missions are a total slog. There's one mission near the end that's there purely to extend the life of the game and is just horrid desgin.\n\nThere's some cute writing in this, and the voice acting is passibly funny.\n\nThere are some serious issues though. Inventory management is some of the worst I've seen in a game. Also, I think this was designed to be convoluted just to extend the game as opposed to a logical design choice. You have to drop extra items off at one of your "bases" and it never fails that the one thing you need will require you to travel back across the entire game world. That mixed with the sluggish run speed makes for an extremely dull experience.\n\nI did enjoy the look of the game, and the animations / art are top notch. It's a 6-8 hour game that should have been a 3 hour experience.\n\nI wish they had a maybe recommend button. If you're SUPER into zombie games, or dig the robotron isometric style, I recommend it.

It's fun for the first 4 hours or so, but the last few missions are a total slog. There's one mission near the end that's there purely to extend the life of the game and is just horrid desgin.\n\nThere's some cute writing in this, and the voice acting is passibly funny.\n\nThere are some serious issues though. Inventory management is some of the worst I've seen in a game. Also, I think this was designed to be convoluted just to extend the game as opposed to a logical design choice. You have to drop extra items off at one of your "bases" and it never fails that the one thing you need will require you to travel back across the entire game world. That mixed with the sluggish run speed makes for an extremely dull experience.\n\nI did enjoy the look of the game, and the animations / art are top notch. It's a 6-8 hour game that should have been a 3 hour experience.\n\nI wish they had a maybe recommend button. If you're SUPER into zombie games, or dig the robotron isometric style, I recommend it.

It has fishing which is great though the catcth rate is low even when it is supposed to be higher at night fall and sunrise and aside from being able to make fish 'n' chips you will NEVER need to fish except for one monkey mission, as animals deer and ostrich give you fesh meat and considering ostriches are everywhere after the second island you have surplus 90% of the time.\nAnother disappointing thing or rather irritating thing is the sheer amount of helmets and bulletproof vests in which you will only need ONE of each EVER, just irritates plain and simple and though armored zombies ARE irritating they really don't add any real difficulty to the game even on ironman mode, I think the zombie animals are so much more problematic.\n\nThough even with it's problems I would recommend the game simply just for, a simple, fun 'pass the time casual' game.

I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining this game was from beginning to end.\n\nThings I liked:\n-  Great humor (not over the top but funny)\n-  Interesting scavenge and craft system.  It wasn't overly complex but required some discovery and encouraged picking up everything just to see what you could do with it.\n-  Challenging encounters.  Not everything was go in and steam roll with a single weapon.  You had to swap out weapons (a combination of melee and ranged) and use the best mods (i.e. explosive arrows) to get the job done.\n-  More than one way to skin a cat.  There didn't seem to be a single way to play this game.  It was basically all about how you wished to accomplish a goal.\n-  Semi mindless hack and slash.  I could put the game down and pick it back up with ease.  There wasn't a whole lot of stuff that I had to remember from my last encounter.

I'm glad to say after finishing it that it was a journey well worth taken. You play your choice of character (all of which have different advantages) washed up on an island that is inhabited full of zombie and other weird creatures. I won't go further in depth into the story because it's nothing you haven't really seen before (other than a few twists and turns here and there). Pretty much you'll be killing lots of zombies while looking for food, medicine & supplies as you running missions that'll help you leave the island. I really enjoyed the fact you could make your own weapons, armor etc. with stuff you find on the island.  Nothing was so rare that you couldn't make anything (other than character specific items) but there were times you'd have to earn it to find it. The sound design was nice, the voice acting was decent and the lighting effects were very good. The bad being the combat and running are a fairly clunky and I didn't care for the best weapon being a (SPOILER ALERT) three pointed boomerang. I also didn't care for mutated crabs, zombified animals or the invincible piranha either. Those last two got me worse than the zombies did most of the time. With all that said I definitely recommend "How to Survive". I paid around $2.25 during the winter sale and that was an absolute steal. Most of the time I've seen it for $3.74 and that's also a great price. For your money you get a fairly lengthy SP campaign and I'm sure the co-op is even better.  8/10 from me.","July 11, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been playing it for two days, just hit the Third Island and am having a great time. The Plot is good, the basic training Island in the beginning is a great approach at Tutorials, along with you friend 'Kovac' who helps you every step along the way giving you new skills and training. The game is fun, it operates in an overhead, 45 Degree-Helicopter View, with an RPG style Skill tree, and leveling system. You gain new items, Craft better weapons, and utilize Plants from teh land. And the best part, is that that it isn't a failed attempt at a Zombie game where they just throw tons of Zombies at you... In this case, you can actually walk at least 20-40 feet without running into any Zed, and you can even sneak around them if you choose to. It's a great survival game, and I recommend that you try it.

Wasn't really sure what to expect going in but I have been very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this title.\n\nUpon first entering the game I found that the default keyboard / mouse controls were a little weird feeling to me.  I switched to the Xbox 360 controller, which I much prefer.  Be aware that the controller needs to be on before you start the game.\n\nViewpoint is overhead isometric, and gameplay is hack / slash / shoot.  Initially reminded me vaguely of a slow moving "Zombie / Alien Shooter" title in feel.  The game features a dynamic day / night system, and tracks hunger, thirst, tiredness, etc.  You must eat, drink, sleep, hunt and forage, and above all kill kill kill zombies.\n\nI found NPC interaction to be cleverly written, well voiced, and entertaining.  The game has a surprising amount of humor in both the dialogues and the situations you'll encounter, but most especially in the manual "How To Survive" for which the game is named.  The manual is written by loony survival expert named Kovac, and each chapter is hilariously written, narrated, and animated.  The manual also serves as a tutorial component as well, and presents each new concept step by step without feeling burdensome.  Kovac's manuals are definitely a highlight, and so good you'll watch them again just for fun.\n\nYou'll be fighting your way around several islands that you end up stranded on, and each island is built to present an environmental puzzle to work your way through.  Certain areas and paths are closed off,  you will look forward to gaining new capabilities that will let you open new areas on the islands as you progress.\n\nThe final gem of this great little game is the depth of the crafting system.  The islands are littered with loot (from zombies), plants, animals (to hunt), and various debris and natural resources.  Nearly every item I've found combines with something else in some fashion, and you will find crafting recipes through exploration as well.  This allows you to develop your arsenal as you go, tailored to your liking through the different craftable melee and ranged weaponry, ammunition, and armor.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.  Don't forget to chat with the local monkeys.","June 29, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have to say it is a really fun and well made game.  For $1.50 you can't go wrong.\n\nSome tips for the game.  It is hard!  Be prepared to be frustrated a lot throughout the game when you get overwhelmed by hordes or get your ♥♥♥ kicked by zombie deer.  But to make it easier this is what you should do.\n\nClear out the sleeping areas when you are high on heath and even if you don't need to sleep.  They come in handy when you need it later.  When possible, try to sleep at dusk and wake up at dawn to maximize your day light hours.  Fishing is useful in the earlier part of the game, but once you see the ostriches (3rd island I believe) you should be fine on food.\n\nSave up the parts you need for automatic machine gun and build it as soon as possible.  This is the gun I finished the game with and you can find all the parts needed about half way through the game.  You will be low on health, hunger, thirst, and sleep at various parts of the game.  There is no way to keep your health full most of the time and even basic zombies do quite a bit of damage each time they hit you.  For the skill tree I think the best investment is, in this order.  Campfire, slow sleep and hunger, the gun skills until you get scope, (at this point you can make some scopes and respec to get the arrow skills)  the explosive arrows is a great investment as once you can make explosive arrows you can access the barriers and reinforced sheds without wasting bottles.\n\nSpoiler!  To beat the last wave of zombies I just stood at the right most point on the beach.  The water is behind you and zombies come from the left.  Use your automatic machine gun to kill all the mobs.  When the big guy comes out finish it off with explosive arrows.  Its a pretty tough battle even with the best weapons in the game, I believe.  I died twice before finishing it on my third try.  To make the fight easier be sure to make some Green Beef Soda before the fight to replenish health and get an aim bonus.  Its hard, but worth playing :)\n\nIn addition to the main game, your can complete challanges that adds additional playability to the game.  I imported Jack from the main game and he shows up with all the armor and skills you found in the main game, but no items.  The first challange took me about 30 mins, and it is basically running through the first island.

A big blast, in my opinion, of this game is the multiple choices of combining objects that you find (basically trash) and turning it into a weapon or a armor and not a regular one: the lightning and the flamethower are dope!\nThe graphics are pretty good for a zombie rpg and the texture always give you a little bit of the dark ambience of a pos-apocalyptical forgotten world.\nBesides the story, this game was a ton of challenges to do and many islands to explore, ones bigger then the others, but you'll be entertrained, that's for sure. The multiplayer mode gives you the option of "not being alone in this zombie world" and you can do the challenges or the missions with a friend.","December 31, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The night crawlers-although a bit unnerving on first encounter-are laughable as long as your flashlight shines on them WHICH it NEVER runs out of battery power :S\n\nI like the crafting system and skill trees, that's interesting. And the noise mechanic is kinda there, especailly when opening a ssaf house door. I would wish that this game however could toughen itself out in future updates. And make the player more terrified that he/she doesn't have the materials to make something they can't do w/o or less sources for food/water/shelter.\n\nAGAIN, recommended ONLY ON SALE, $4's is worth it since it's not the worst game ever made (*cough* Colonnial Marines *cough*) But at the same time it's only for a more casual or newer player, not a hardcore one.

Most of your time is spent running back and forth between the same four isalnds on boring fetch quest. The islands themselves are each different, complex, and each brings its own new threat.\n\nThe story it self is nothing new, but who playes zombie games for the story? The game has a variety of weapons for all types of players and even towards the end of the game you can still easily become overwhelmed and killed. The three defferent characters arn't much defferent ecxept for two schematics I found which could only be used by one character.\n\nOverall the game was fun, but I recomand you play with friends as it can seem boring or annoyingly hard at times.\n","January 2, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And therfore overlook the areas where the game truely does fail and recommend the game. I can't speak to the worth of the game compared to the price but I did purchase it at %90 off which is well worth the risk even though most reviews are positive ones.\n\nFirst Impressions\nAs of this review I have completed the first set of missions and seemed to have left the tutorial portion of the game. It's been slightly more than an hour.\n\nYou essentially get taught the mechanics b the first few people you meet, wihthout needing more instructions there are tutorial books scattered around the island which essentially repeat everything you've just found out a moment ago and add another 10-20% detail. I found these books to be redundant and took me away from the game I wanted to play. And speaking of them....\nThe tutorial books have figure based explanations in video form which for me causes my screen to spazz between the video and the actual game underneath, add in some crazy green digital glitches and some strobes and that's what I saw all the time, pluss the animations played at half speed. Luckily I got all the info I needed already in game. As a disclaimer I'm currntly playing on an Ultrabook without dedicated graphics, but everthing else is running smoothly.\nOntop of both those tutorials you have tooltips popping up every other friggen second and often they simply alternate back and forth between 2-3 tips.\nAnd speaking of those tooltips maybe half of them have the same spelling error where instead of "your direction" it's "you direction". Seriously devs?!\nThe irst safehouse you encounter there is a gameplay breaking bug where you can close the door so you are inside and you are still able to hit zombies on the outside, if there are more safehouses in this fashion (Its 1:1 atm) it can become a bigger deal to gameplay.\nI'm playing with a controller, for some reason the devs though it would make sense for LT to use your secondary weapon and RB to use your primarey weapon, this was terrible to learn and luckily found out that all controls are rebindable.\nAdditionaly the Y button swaps your primary weapon. But it will only swap from melee weapon 1 to melee weapon 2. The same follows for ranged weapons. If i want to switch weapons during a fight I probably want to switch from melee to ranged No one thought that through straight.\nAnd then there's some general UI left unpolished where dialouges IMO fade in too slow, the menus aren't navigatable with an anolog stick - just the d-pad, menus can be a tad slow to respond or navigate.\n\nSo these are some pretty glaring issues but overall I'm still enjoying the game.\n\nGood atmosphere that your life is in danger\nAppropiate difficulty and gameplay to match #1\nWho doesn't like a crafting system out of junkyard scraps?\nCo-op (Which I haven't tried yet)\nInteresting user tombstone death thing - although there is kinda a lot of them, everywhere, always.\nUnique and challenging gameplay\nA skill tree\n\nSo again, all-in-all these are obviously not the best developers and makes me wonder what was happening during development and on the forums, but I still find the game very fun to play.","January 4, 2015","true","39.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of your time is spent running back and forth between the same four isalnds on boring fetch quest. The islands themselves are each different, complex, and each brings its own new threat.\n\nThe story it self is nothing new, but who playes zombie games for the story? The game has a variety of weapons for all types of players and even towards the end of the game you can still easily become overwhelmed and killed. The three defferent characters arn't much defferent ecxept for two schematics I found which could only be used by one character.\n\nOverall the game was fun, but I recomand you play with friends as it can seem boring or annoyingly hard at times.\n","January 2, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InitiatePenguin/recommended/250400/","InitiatePenguin","Mr.Marbles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InitiatePenguin/","93 products in account","I will be updating this review as I play.\n\ntl;dr despite the games lack of polish in some areas and redundent tutorials I've so far found the gameplay to unique and fun. And therfore overlook the areas where the game truely does fail and recommend the game. I can't speak to the worth of the game compared to the price but I did purchase it at %90 off which is well worth the risk even though most reviews are positive ones.\n\nFirst Impressions\nAs of this review I have completed the first set of missions and seemed to have left the tutorial portion of the game. It's been slightly more than an hour.\n\nYou essentially get taught the mechanics b the first few people you meet, wihthout needing more instructions there are tutorial books scattered around the island which essentially repeat everything you've just found out a moment ago and add another 10-20% detail. I found these books to be redundant and took me away from the game I wanted to play. And speaking of them....\nThe tutorial books have figure based explanations in video form which for me causes my screen to spazz between the video and the actual game underneath, add in some crazy green digital glitches and some strobes and that's what I saw all the time, pluss the animations played at half speed. Luckily I got all the info I needed already in game. As a disclaimer I'm currntly playing on an Ultrabook without dedicated graphics, but everthing else is running smoothly.\nOntop of both those tutorials you have tooltips popping up every other friggen second and often they simply alternate back and forth between 2-3 tips.\nAnd speaking of those tooltips maybe half of them have the same spelling error where instead of "your direction" it's "you direction". Seriously devs?!\nThe irst safehouse you encounter there is a gameplay breaking bug where you can close the door so you are inside and you are still able to hit zombies on the outside, if there are more safehouses in this fashion (Its 1:1 atm) it can become a bigger deal to gameplay.\nI'm playing with a controller, for some reason the devs though it would make sense for LT to use your secondary weapon and RB to use your primarey weapon, this was terrible to learn and luckily found out that all controls are rebindable.\nAdditionaly the Y button swaps your primary weapon. But it will only swap from melee weapon 1 to melee weapon 2. The same follows for ranged weapons. If i want to switch weapons during a fight I probably want to switch from melee to ranged No one thought that through straight.\nAnd then there's some general UI left unpolished where dialouges IMO fade in too slow, the menus aren't navigatable with an anolog stick - just the d-pad, menus can be a tad slow to respond or navigate.\n\nSo these are some pretty glaring issues but overall I'm still enjoying the game.\n\nGood atmosphere that your life is in danger\nAppropiate difficulty and gameplay to match #1\nWho doesn't like a crafting system out of junkyard scraps?\nCo-op (Which I haven't tried yet)\nInteresting user tombstone death thing - although there is kinda a lot of them, everywhere, always.\nUnique and challenging gameplay\nA skill tree\n\nSo again, all-in-all these are obviously not the best developers and makes me wonder what was happening during development and on the forums, but I still find the game very fun to play.","January 4, 2015","true","39.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's truly refreshing to get a change in scenery for a game that's about crafting and grinding abilities. Which brings me to number three.\n\nSKILL TREE\nNot only can you choose the character you want to play as - they each have their own advantages, but they also have their own skill trees. Progress your survivor the way you want to and fend off the dead for a few more hours.\n\nThis game is challenging, but rewarding.\nYou can play solo or with friends, there are mulitiple challenge modes.\n\nIt feels almost like a top down Dead Island, except with death coming into factor more heavily.\nThat being said, it's kind of unfair to lump zed games together, they each come with new ideas.\nThis one is worth a playthrough.\n\n8/10","January 14, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The night crawlers-although a bit unnerving on first encounter-are laughable as long as your flashlight shines on them WHICH it NEVER runs out of battery power :S\n\nI like the crafting system and skill trees, that's interesting. And the noise mechanic is kinda there, especailly when opening a ssaf house door. I would wish that this game however could toughen itself out in future updates. And make the player more terrified that he/she doesn't have the materials to make something they can't do w/o or less sources for food/water/shelter.\n\nAGAIN, recommended ONLY ON SALE, $4's is worth it since it's not the worst game ever made (*cough* Colonnial Marines *cough*) But at the same time it's only for a more casual or newer player, not a hardcore one. Short story/easy enemies = short game but it DOES have positives and while it's still on sale try it out for yourself and decide... before it goes back to original pricing!!!!!\n\nHope this helps. Least it's not biased huh? XD","February 9, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It wasn't super easy, but it wasn't amazingly challenging either.\nI think the crafting system is simple, but decent. If you could craft more items that were really good, it would have made things more interesting. As it is, there were a couple of weapons that felt ultimate, and everything else was okay.\nThis game is definitely a different take on the zombie survival game. It certainly has survival elements, but it was always easy to get food, drink and enough sleep.\nOverall, I quite enjoyed the game and would recommend it.","July 11, 2014","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got it during the Summer Steam Sale and really loved it.  Played both Single Player and Online Co-Op with a friend.  Single player may be a bit tough with limited space, but this is a perfect Online Co-Op game where there are several offensive/defensive styles to choose from (I went melee x snipe while my friend played bow & arrow x explosives).  Storyline was interesting.  Several bugs here and there, but it's tolerable.  I wish the original story was a bit longer.  I'll most likely buy the Kovac's Way DLC eventually.\n\nIs it worth $14.99?  Somewhat, but it does have a mediocre replay value behind it.  Seeing how it's a two player Co-Op availability, I think it would make more sense to have a two game bundle package discount.\n\nWould I recommend this game to others?  I already have.  A few of my friends bought the game and loved it as well.  It would be great if there'll be more How to Survive games in the future.

There is a lot of crafting and lotsa opportunites to combine things to make interesting things.\n\nIt's got decent graphics and some interesting quests.   It is just a bit open world, meaning you go to fairly large areas to complete quests, but have some ability to wander around exploring.\n\nOverall, it's underrated in my opinion.\n\n\nIf it's on sale and you like this kind of thing you should definitely buy it.","July 14, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been playing it for two days, just hit the Third Island and am having a great time. The Plot is good, the basic training Island in the beginning is a great approach at Tutorials, along with you friend 'Kovac' who helps you every step along the way giving you new skills and training. The game is fun, it operates in an overhead, 45 Degree-Helicopter View, with an RPG style Skill tree, and leveling system. You gain new items, Craft better weapons, and utilize Plants from teh land. And the best part, is that that it isn't a failed attempt at a Zombie game where they just throw tons of Zombies at you... In this case, you can actually walk at least 20-40 feet without running into any Zed, and you can even sneak around them if you choose to. It's a great survival game, and I recommend that you try it.

I bought it with the intent on doing co-op and it went horribly!\n\nFirst, I couldnt figure how to set P1/2 to mouse+kb or controller (turns out you cant, it detects a controller ONLY if its powered on before launching the game AND it wont let you assign who is using it - its given to P1). Once we finally got going, we were almost immediately frustrated with the loot and xp system, having only 1 person with a stick and only the person killing gets the xp! We left it there, as it seemed to be one thing after another done badly...\n\nI decided to give it another try myself at some point and I am glad that I did. While there are some issues, Ive enjoyed getting into the game (just finished the main story as of writing this).\n\nWhile this is a good game, it could so easily be a great game if a few changes were made. There is no storage (fair enough, its a survival game!), instead you need to drop things on the ground, they dont appear to despawn, the problem is, if you are playing with breaks between sessions, you probably wont remember where a certain component that you need was left and with limited inventory space and without knowing what items are really going to be useful or needed next, you often have to drop things. This could have easily been addressed by allowing notes to be added to the map, lets face it, if you're trying to be real about it and all that stood between you being able to craft a weap was some tubing, you would remember where you put it!! Since Im not in a life and death situation (irl!), rather sitting on a chair with a controller in my hand and this item was dropped in a game somewhere last week, it stands to reason I may not recall ^^ This ONE change would really lift this game.\n\nAs for the co-op, it needs to be tweaked to reflect there are 2 people playing (as it is, you are left playing the very same game as the single player, loot/mob count/exp/everything). 4 Things that would have made for a far better experience for co-op\n1) A little more slack on the camera (even solo the odd time it gets rather close and pointed downward, with 2 people having to share an already unforgiving view space....)\n2) Shared xp, straight up split down the middle - always - for everyone - always.\n3) Minor adjustment of available starting loot. It takes from the experience when one person can do nothing, doesnt matter if its "only" for 5 mins or 20 mins, it just isnt fun and shouldnt be this way.\n4) A more forgiving hit box for your partner. Just swinging a stick I found it easier to hit my partner than the zombie! Even if it appeared on my screen I was pointing at the zombie and it was slightly closer, I either hit only my partner or both! Whether it was lag, or just crappy hit box.\n\nI could do a rant about the dlc decisions (some weather effects not included in base game :O!!), I wont say more! I got it nicely discounted and Ive gotten my moneys worth.","May 12, 2015","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I only bought this game for the local coop part and it was indeed a lot of fun. What I didn't like in this game are the ridiculous zombie respawns and the inventory management. My friend needs to open his backpack most of the time to make arrows and stuff and I have to wait too since I can't move.\n\nThere is not really a survival feeling about this game until I bought the Kovac's way DLC. That is what I expected from this game from the description page, low resources, more different animals, hard to survive in this dangerous environment and more simple realistic things that makes it more challenging instead of zombie respawn till you death. I don't like their DLC policy but I don't mind it since it is that cheap on sales offers lol.

And yes, it will get repetetive after a while. And yes, you will max out your character pretty fast, after which the surviving aspect of the game becomes pretty much a walk in the park. BUT. Doing all this is pretty charming, rather mindless fun. Nice looking surroundings plus rather different outtake and feel of zombie survivalism compared to the competition make it well worth your time and money. At least if you enjoy Diablo-esque light-RPG-hack'n'slash sort of affair.\n\nI've seen some reviews around complaining about juvenile and absurd humour. Each to his or her own; talking parrots with absurd quests, t-shirt wearing silly monkeys and heavy accented welder-masked half-lunatic made me chuckle a few times. When not chuckling, I've been having loads of fun with the insta-kill death animations, blowing heads, scattering limbs and blasting all kinds of zombie humans and animals with bolts and nuts.\n\nAt the moment I'm struggling to keep my interest up in retrieving last 5 of the 20 packages to a drunken latino aviator, which tends to be repetitive pain in the ♥♥♥, but I can't wait to get it done and get on with hopefully some more exciting aspects of the adventure. hen that's done, there'll be Horno isles to be conquered. And after that, there will be the challenges which I really look forward to, co-op playing-wise. People ith crispier playing pace will have probably about 10  hours worth gaming time ahead of them, with my snail-paced completism you can double or triple that easily.","November 9, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

That's what zombie games should be right? The game is easily worth the $5 or less you can usually get it for on sale.\n\nThe simple story and its minor twist was enough to keep things going. Crafting is a fun and there is enough reward to make this worthwhile. It was also great fun playing local co-op where you have to be careful not to shoot each other while being onset by a hoard. The challenge modes are great fun after you finish (you get to keep armour you earned in the game for this) - again even better in co-op.\n\nPROS\n+ Zombie Killing - fun!\n+ Good Powerups\n+ Nice Design overall\n+ Graphics, Sound and Animations are decent\n+ Good tension at times but without being too stressful.\n\nNEGS\n- It gets quite repetitive at times.\n- Small environments (islands are not very big).\n- The inventory size is many a tad limited which means even more wandering back to places to get things you need.\n- Frame rate drops suddenly on occasion and needs reboot.\n- Occasional crashes (but game does get saved automatically quite often).\n- Switching ammo type is a real pain (no quick toggle button).\n- Map should show where you dropped stuff. Too hard finding things you already found!\n- Terrible Spelling!!! Not a dealbreaker but so many typos!!\n- Diablo Islands achievments are way too hard. I had S-Ranked this game before the DLC but now I can't get that back despite 50+ hours work.\n\nThis is a fun game and great value for money.\n\nOverall I give it an easy 7.7/10","January 21, 2014","true","75.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked the way that the story was made because of his circular feature (the story began with Ramon and Kovac, wich are the principal characters of the game and it is supposed to be continued again with them... I could say more, but i don't wand to give any spoilers. However, the story is very well structured and i recommend to follow it).\nOn the other hand, i liked the variety of weapons wich you can craft from apparently useless things. The combat with "monsters" is such funny if you use the typically machete because you become untargetable while you are donig a instakill movement, wich can be a great thing when you are doing 1 vs 100 zombies, where you can kill all of them without taking any kind of damage. That doesn't means being a survivor, that means being a ninja :D. Madness!\nThe game is more entertainer if you play co-op. You can revive your dead teamate, so you can "live forever", you are doing things together and stuff like that wich brings a lot of fun and laughters.","November 17, 2015","true","43.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought it with the intent on doing co-op and it went horribly!\n\nFirst, I couldnt figure how to set P1/2 to mouse+kb or controller (turns out you cant, it detects a controller ONLY if its powered on before launching the game AND it wont let you assign who is using it - its given to P1). Once we finally got going, we were almost immediately frustrated with the loot and xp system, having only 1 person with a stick and only the person killing gets the xp! We left it there, as it seemed to be one thing after another done badly...\n\nI decided to give it another try myself at some point and I am glad that I did. While there are some issues, Ive enjoyed getting into the game (just finished the main story as of writing this).\n\nWhile this is a good game, it could so easily be a great game if a few changes were made. There is no storage (fair enough, its a survival game!), instead you need to drop things on the ground, they dont appear to despawn, the problem is, if you are playing with breaks between sessions, you probably wont remember where a certain component that you need was left and with limited inventory space and without knowing what items are really going to be useful or needed next, you often have to drop things. This could have easily been addressed by allowing notes to be added to the map, lets face it, if you're trying to be real about it and all that stood between you being able to craft a weap was some tubing, you would remember where you put it!! Since Im not in a life and death situation (irl!), rather sitting on a chair with a controller in my hand and this item was dropped in a game somewhere last week, it stands to reason I may not recall ^^ This ONE change would really lift this game.\n\nAs for the co-op, it needs to be tweaked to reflect there are 2 people playing (as it is, you are left playing the very same game as the single player, loot/mob count/exp/everything). 4 Things that would have made for a far better experience for co-op\n1) A little more slack on the camera (even solo the odd time it gets rather close and pointed downward, with 2 people having to share an already unforgiving view space....)\n2) Shared xp, straight up split down the middle - always - for everyone - always.\n3) Minor adjustment of available starting loot. It takes from the experience when one person can do nothing, doesnt matter if its "only" for 5 mins or 20 mins, it just isnt fun and shouldnt be this way.\n4) A more forgiving hit box for your partner. Just swinging a stick I found it easier to hit my partner than the zombie! Even if it appeared on my screen I was pointing at the zombie and it was slightly closer, I either hit only my partner or both! Whether it was lag, or just crappy hit box.\n\nI could do a rant about the dlc decisions (some weather effects not included in base game :O!!), I wont say more! I got it nicely discounted and Ive gotten my moneys worth.","May 12, 2015","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay itself is enjoyable, running through the game can be a challenge and that too, is enjoyable, when it comes to zombie slaughtering pastimes. Regardless of the drawbacks, I don't mind having this in my steam library.","May 23","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is fun but short, it has a very nice crafting system which gets dry after a while with a lack of items to craft and once you have reached the final island you have pretty much found everything you can craft and you'll find yourself just throwing random items away because you'll never ever use them again.\n\nThis game can be challenging if you dont prepare yourself, there is a lack of health on this game and it can be quite hard to find the health plants, but certain food types provide you with small health boosts which help but dont stop you getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you later in the game.\n\nI have played about 3 hours of single player and the rest of the time played is co-op story mode, both seem just as fun as each other, but co-op has some down sides that i wasnt liking much. When given quests by one of the various monkeys on the islands you go off on said quests and complete that return to the monkey and he hands you a reward, BUT! only one player gets the reward and thats always the host of the game :( it would be nice to both receive a reward being as we BOTH took time to complete the quest. Also this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off on one of the monkey quests upon completion i returned to the monkey for him to reward me with some modded ammo, after the monkey finished talking my character model was frozen to the spot for about 5 seconds and no controls or menu functions worked at all the game hadnt frozen just player input wasnt working for this short time, when play resumed my modified boomerang was gone from my inventory and no where to be found, i wouldnt complain its easy to make another but this one had a red stone added to it so its a quality weapon and the game just removed it completely from my inventory as if it never existed so that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\n\nAnyway back to the game itself, its short and by short i mean very short i have completed it and done nearly every single quest im lacking 1 herb out of the 20 in the game and i think thats all i have to do to 100% it, the survival aspect of the game is a little lackluster, you just eat, drink and sleep when needed and ceratin plants you find during the game kind of make the survival side a bit laughable you have 4 things to keep an eye on, health, food, water, and sleep. Health is a struggle sometimes if you cant find the right food or the right plant to replenish your health, food isnt so much of an issue because you can eat certain plants and kill various animals and cook the meat from them to replenish your health, water was no issue at all for me i filled a gallon tank of water which provided me with 3 drinks and if you boil it over the fire each drink fills your meter back up and to refill the gallon tank you just go to a well which there are plenty and stock up. Sleep is probably the annoying one at first you have to take over safe houses to be able to sleep and this can get challenging as you progress in the game with bigger and stronger waves of zombies attacking each time you open a new safehouse and you cannot save or sleep until all zombies have been defeated, so this can make finding somewhere to sleep and chore, but each safe house has some nice items inside.\n\nThere is a load of loot to be found in this game and crafting items is a fun feature but is lacking in variety, the skills tree is quite poor and it does not give you much freedom in regards to customising your character to how you want to play its one of those skill trees where you have to upgrade certain things otherwise youll have issues finding certain items in the game etc its nothing bad but its nothing good either.\n\nGameplay, this is fun nice controls for PC also uses gamepad (xbox 360) and both work well, menus are simple and easy to use. Weapons are fun to craft and the sounds are awesome. The gameplay can feel repetetive with the lack of enemy variety but its still challenging and entertaining, the only character i can say i like was Kovac the survival expert his books he leaves around the islands have some funny cutscenes but thats where the game lacks in character attachement you dont really care for any character on the game and the voice acting for 99% of the characters is shockingly naff. But that don't make the game any less fun to play.\n\nIf you can get it cheap and want something to play that wont take all day and has co-op/multiplayer features and a little crafting on the side, plus is filled with zombies then this is the game for you. If you like diablo and you like zombies, and you liked dead island again this is the game for you.\n\ni would give it 7/10, it was fun and a challenge at times but i cannot see me replaying it again now i have completed it as it was a little slow, and too noticeably repetetive far too often. The crafting system was a nice novelty featurem graphically its nice to look at, but character depth is lacking and enemy variety could of been better.","September 9, 2014","true","13.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Easy to understand. I like game mechanics, charcter advancement and crafting system.  Dificulty seems to be right. What I hate is camera position and its movemet. It makes the game quite often very confusing and player can do nothing about that. I wish camera angle was adjustable If not freely then at least in 90 degree steps. That would make the game much better. Because sometimes Im surounded by zombies an some fuc.ing obstacle like tree or shack prevents me to see my charcter and its frustrating when I die becuse I dont see properly what is going on. Anyway If you like zombie games I recomend to get it. Best during some special offer :-) Its not perfect but Its  quite enjoyable. Getting it for a deal price (like during this haloween special steam deal) its not definitely a disapointment :-) At least not for me :-)","November 2, 2014","true","19.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When i bought it and had a look at the screenshots i wasn't really impressed, however the gameplya and the use of imagiation in the game have really brought it together. I like this game alot. Its one of those games that you need a friend to play with to be able to have more fun than what you usually would. I like how its no first person- there are too many games liek that. Thats what this game brings. A difference. I want to say that the online system is good, however the connection between players is poor as me and my friend at first found it a little hard to roam around with all of the stoapges needed to be made. I also don't like the quick constant spawn of zombies that appear as soon as you leave an area. There should be a bigger spawn time. But I like the crafting system and hunting system in the game. If i had to rate this, It would be 9/10 for the online and 10/10 for the game experience.","November 2, 2014","true","11.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Quite engaging crafting makes the gameply interesting. You will also want to explore to find good items which adds more into what makes the whole package of the game work. Only annoyance I find is that you do have to walk around to travel the different islands, since not everything is available on one island. Really, you will be spending a good amount of time walking around because apparently, the boats can only go a specific docks instead of allowing you to use one boat to travel to all visited islands. These docks are usually far apart, and you'll have to maze through the islands just to travel from island to island. That's probably the only annoyance that I've found. Story-wise, it's pretty ok. I've only played one character, and I can only guess that each character has their own story path to follow. As to what most reviewers can note, the crafting system for items you pickup is the bloodline of this game. Most story quest do require you to craft, and at a certain point, there's no reference for an item you needed to craft and you'll need to use your imagination (or google) to figure out what you needed to craft. 7/10","October 20, 2014","true","12.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
