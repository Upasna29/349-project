You're easily getting a game worth more than the $5 you're paying for it.\n\nWhat I like about this game is being able to individually control all of your people, giving them jobs, equipping them, etc..  Your man power actually matters in this game instead of them feeling like dead weight like they did in State of Decay.  In SoD you pretty much had to do everything yourself as the player.  In this game, you actually have to delegate orders to ALL of your community members unless you want to run back and forth hauling boards and chicken wire a few at a time.  Your community actually feels like, a, well, community.  It's not unlike in SoD where you radio in for someone to come grab stuff while being arbitrarily limited by the game.  It's the same principle, but a very different execution.  Whereas SoD focuses more on exploration and beating up zombies, Survivalist focuses more on the town building.\n\nYou get this game for the awesome town and community building aspect.  If you want to run around slaughtering zombies, there are better alternatives, like State of Decay, because that is not the object of this game.","January 31, 2015","true","84.0"," 265 of 291 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","265","291","13","5"

I have no idea why Steam keep pushing Early Access scams on my front page, when there are brilliant games like this already available. I had never heard of it. I also always wanted to play a Action-RPG/RTS Hybrid with Base Building... this scratched the itch with its zombified claws.\n--\nINTRODUCING you to Survivalist. One of the few Indie titles that really lives up to its screenshots and descriptions, this can easily get you hooked for hours.\nPlay as you like: be the careless, selfish, evil badass people like to think you are, be the paragon savior of the land, or decide for yourself who deserves to keep breathing in a world where trust is the best currency.\nDo you seek Money, Power or Love?\n\nGRAPHICS and AUDIO are good and more than enough for what the game was trying to accomplish.\n\nCONTROLS are simple: WASD to move, right-click to aim and swipe mouse horizontally or vertically to change target or change aim (legs/body/head), left-click to fire/use/select, mouse-wheel to select dialogue options.\nPressing Control will enable Command Mode, in which you can give orders or assign job (or roles) to your characters.\nYou can also press F to pause, or G to Fast-Forward up to 4x speed.\nFrom F1 to F4 you can select the menus (Inventory/Community/Quests/Map screens). Therefore, no need for crazy hand-dancing when equipping your 5 new recruits!\n\nCOMBAT is also simple and straightforward.\nAlmost all ZOMBIES are fast-moving, and there are different zombies strains, which means each strain is stronger than the other. You'd be smart to adapt yourself and your squad when fighting weaker enemies to preserve ammo, or stronger enemies to prevent instant deaths if bitten. Also, remember to bring some antigen ("antidote") and bandages!\nAgainst LOOTERS (or human opponents in general), not being able to command your people tactically can make combat against well-armed looters rather hard and chaotic if you're not geared up properly - so get your squad some bulletproof vests before attempting some post-apocalyptic genocide! Still, with a little thinking, you can get through anything, and it feels great when you clear an enemy base with no one hurt.\n\nROLE PLAYING: Your actions will change the opinions of those around you (or your whole community views of you, or the whole city you're in, or the whole region). This can make it easier or harder for you to recruit and convince people. You can also give gifts to the characters to make them like you, or perform shakedowns to keep them in check and to show who's boss.\n\nBASE BUILDING: Give a man a hammer, and he'll build you Walls and Concrete Watchtowers for a lifetime.\nDefend your base perimiter with Wooden and Wire walls and gates, build wooden or concrete watchtowers and pillboxes to make your enemies think three times before trying to molotov your base to the ground!\nYou'll also need to provide housing, outhouses, food and water to your people.\n\nMICROMANAGING your community member's gear is necessary, but should only take a minute for every member you recruit for the different roles.\nSome roles the members can take, like Farming and Guarding, doesn't need micromanagement. Farmers will water the plants, harvest, and plant as necessary. Guards will enter any available towers - your guards will keep cycling locations at every "shift", which looks really cool and natural.\nThe Collector (Bring Materials to Base) and Builder roles will need to have orders assigned. For the Collector, you tell which building he should go to, and which item he should bring from there.\nNOTE: I don't know if characters pick up ammo from the base on their own, but the only time someone had low ammo was a guy collecting wood on his own and walked through a pack of 6 zombies - which I should have made him avoid.\n\nAs far as BUGS go, being halfway through the game and halfway through the map, I haven't found any.\n\nCONCLUSION: Definitely try the demo. And if you like it, then buy it, and spam the forums begging for a sequel.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE: This is one of the very rare occasions, within our current market, in which a game not only delivers what it promises, but costs (criminally) less than it should. It's less promoted than more expensive "indie" (kickstarted) games who were abandoned by the developers (yet are still available on Steam and being put on sale).\nI have bought 60USD Triple-A incomplete and bug-ridden titles, and this game made (apparently) by a single guy on his spare time gave me way more fun than a lot of games I've purchased these last few years.\n\nWith more complexity and depth, a sequel could take the market by storm.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope I helped in some way!\n\n--\nBONUS PROTIP: Change your Quick Save key to F5 [or other key]. I was forced to murder a whole innocent town because I acidentally pressed Quick Save twice and it overwrote Auto Save slots. Save often to avoid making dumb mistakes like me :)","July 10, 2015","true","33.1"," 240 of 260 people (92%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","92","240","260","25","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/olaf_merchant/recommended/340050/","olaf_merchant","Olaf the Merchant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/olaf_merchant/","210 products in account","The game offers pretty much all it advertised, something I thought rather rare for a 5 € game.\n\nYou're pretty much thrown into the post-apocalyptic world unawares, unequipped, climbing out of your Vault (where have I seen this before?) and completely unprepared for the horrors outside. Thankfully, the game's first tutorial run provides an easy crash course into the game world and mechanics, first strolling you thru combat, party interactions, building bases and trading and so forth.\n\nYou'll soon be on your way to building your own post-apo settlement to your own whims, within certain limitations. In addition to your zombie neighbours (colour-coded for your convenience), you'll be setting up diplomatic relations with other settlements in the neighbourhood, with various shantytown or lone survivors out in the boons.\n\nWhat I did like about the game world was the surprising outcomes and twists in quests- instead of plain boring fetch quests, you can sometimes blunder right into a moral dilemma that needs to be solved on the spot, usually either resulting in placating hostiles, or turning previously friendly forces into hostiles, or score some extra loot or survivors for your settlement.\n\nSo, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I was tasked with 'wiping out Looters' (the staple of the post-apocalyptic quest world), and instead of brutally gunning everybody down, I was given the choice of sparing a survivor of the group, recruiting them for my cause, instead of persisting in the silly tradition of game foes have of fighting to the death, even against unwinnable odds.\n\nAnother time, I was sent to kill looters who stole food from a settlement- only to find out the truth to the matter was not all black and white, as the quest giver had originally let on.\n\nOverall, the game is no State of Decay, Dead State, Rebuild: Gangs of Deadsville or Project Zomboid, but it has it's moments- the combat mechanics tend to be very twitchy, with split seconds to open fire on the Infected, as they barrel down on you from the desert with a hankering for survivor flesh. The infection mechanic is pretty simple- you get bit, you gotta get an antidote. Different strains of the disease have different germination times, with the worse strains taking down the host in minutes, requiring survivors to have the proper antidote at hand, or succumb to the disease themselves. Ammo is usually pretty abundant, and you even score 10.000 pistol rounds in the first hour of the game, so you are unlikely to run out of ammo for the basic shooter during your first days. By day 5, I had enough ammo to spare, equipping most of my resource mules with shotguns, my main character with a automatic rifle and farmers and builders with pistols.\n\nInstead of bottlecaps, food and water, your main currency in the wasteland is gold, which is surprisingly abundant in spite of the whole apocalyptic scenario. I found this somewhat funny that while the game makes it clear that paper money is worthless, the concept that the new economy would be based on a non-essential luxury item is kind of a strange notion. Still, it's no a big deal- you'll end up doing more barter than plain gold trading most of the time, anyway.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Freebuild of your own settlement, within some limitations\n+ Additional diplomacy and unexpected realism with some sidequests, moral dilemmas\n+ Game's difficult, but does not punish you horribly\n+ You can delegate resource fetching, farming, building\n+ Survivor AI is not completely helpless if left to their own devices. Pathfinding is decent.\n\nCONS:\n\n- The minimap and survivor topdown view are much too close, even on 1920x1080 resolution, giving the game a 640-x480 look.\n- Sometimes survivor messages on the right zoom past at astounding speeds, and you miss whatever tooltip or notice was in question.\n- Your survivors are practically blind, barely able to see ten feet in any given direction, so they'll constantly get bushwhacked by super-fast, feral zombies until the route is cleared with buckshot, which brings me to...\n- Fast undead. Combat is arcade-y, twitchy, sometimes almost Press 'X' not to die.\n- Survivor animations on walk and run are a bit wonky.\n- Molotov aiming is a game of chance.\n- Some of the music tracks are really tiring. Others, not so bad.\n\nStill, for five bucks, this game is not a bad investment, and probably a good diversion to anyone else who enjoys zombies and town management mixes.","February 3, 2015","true","35.3"," 146 of 158 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","146","158","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963161776/recommended/340050/","76561197963161776","Razor","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963161776/","161 products in account","The game has all the content to be a great survival game - scavenging, base constructing, farming, item crafting, diplomacy, trading... unfortunately it suffers from a terrible lack of balance that completely breaks realism.\n\nFirst, the zombies aren't actually 'fast zombies', they are 'olympic runner zombies'. They will charge you from beyond your seeing distance at the speed of a cheetah and then lunge at you from 3 meters away to tackle you. Combat is just 'dodge - shoot - dodge - shoot' until your enemies are dead. There's no room for strategy/tactics or even a little bit of thinking. It isn't difficult, but it lacks depth and quickly becomes uninteresting. And in case you're wondering, there's no stealth mechanic so zombies always aggro you before you can see them, no way around this.\n\nThe shooting mechanics are also frustrating - guns are very inaccurate even at close range. The characters could miss the side of a barn at 10 feet, literally. And since zombies have quite a bit of health, you'll empty a few clips to kill them. If you wait without moving long enough, you can make a perfectly accurate shot but this rarely happens since you're fighting marathon runner zombies. The time it takes to aim a perfect shot at 3 feet is way too long anyway to be realistic.\n\nThen there's ammo - there's too much of it lying around to be realistic or to feel like you're struggling to scavenge for supplies. Out of bullets? Just search the nearest house or car and I guarantee you'll find enough to kill a few zombies. Yes, since guns are so inaccurate it's a good thing there's lots of ammo, but why not just make guns more accurate and give the player less ammo? At least it would feel realistic and like you're actually in a post-apocalyptic world were supplies are scarce. Right now it feels like the entire US Air Force airdropped all their ammo reserves over the game map.\n\nNext problem is the inventory size. Characters can't carry a lot of stuff without backpacks so scavenging runs are very unproductive. The ammo you need to carry with you also takes up a lot of inventory room even if you just carry enough at once to kill 5 zombies. This isn't a problem when you have backpacks, but it can take time to find them. And by the way, you NEED a backpack if you want a character to do any construction. Construction requires you to carry a heavy toolbox + construction materials, you can't just drop the materials at the construction site and then come back with the tools to complete the job. Without a backpack, most characters don't have enough inventory room to build anything. That means when you leave someone at base to build stuff, that's one less backpack you can give your guys going out to find supplies. It also means the first backpack you find won't help you scavenge because building barricades will be more important at that point, so you'll have to keep looking for another one if you want your scavenging runs to actually become productive.\n\nThen there's the time lapse. The days just go by too fast. Your characters have to regularly eat, drink, sleep and some have medical conditions that require taking meds like diabetes/insulin. So whenever I speak to an NPC, I feel like I'm wasting precious time. Seriously, a 2 minute conversation feels like a terrible, unproductive waste of time. I never ask NPCs about their backstory, I only use dialogue for quests or trading. And when I speak to an NPC, I just quickly fly over the dialogue.\n\nAnd with time flying by so fast, well you need to get food and meds quickly. Your characters will eat them up almost faster than you can get them, especially the meds. Just like with combat, there's no time to think or plan, you have to keep moving.\n\nThis isn't a survival game, it's a fast-paced arcade game with survival elements. And it's a shame, because it could be an awesome survival game just by modifying a few variables.\n\nSure, it's only five bucks. But then again, it's a game I quickly gave up playing with no intention of playing it again. It's a game I want to enjoy, but it needs modifications to be an actual survival game and less of an arcade game. Right now it feels like the devs just had no idea how to balance difficulty properly in a game, so they made zombies sprint, they made your guns less accurate than a nerf gun, and then they gave you thousands of ammo lying around everywhere to make sure you wouldn't run out.\n\nWould sure be nice if they fixed this or at least provided a minimum of mod support. It's just stupid how close this came to being a really great game in it's genre, yet failed completely.","February 26, 2015","false","2.3"," 442 of 571 people (77%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","77","442","571","66","17"

Looks cheap and stupid, but gives you tons of playtime and finally a great mix of story, survival, sandbox and RPG. All in all it's kept simple, which is more than ok considering the price and being an Indie, but that doesn't make the fun smaller.\n\nIf I would compare it to another game, than State of Decay (which I love,too). Survivalist is simpler, top down, weak graphics, less items, less challenging and a smaller world, but gives you a story with choices to make and more "open world" feeling, survival gets more important and finally you not just can control everyone, but also form groups and give your community members jobs to do (farming, guarding, supply runs, building...or just control several groups via strategy mode or by switching through the groups). And ofc there is building. Not just "This is ma base, I build a kitchen here", but building up a base you like. You start with a single bunker and then you can add shacks, barns, wells, farming ground, walls and several defense buildings whereever you want.\n\nFrom time to time zombies or looters attack your base, so you have to organize a defense. But not all looters need to be killed. Some group of looters you can find will threaten you, but there are some ways to avoid fighting and even recruit them. Socializing is an important part in the game, although generally kept simple. The creativity to solve quests sometimes reminded me of fallout (for example !SPOILER! there will be a quest killing a gay couple. You can either just kill em, talk with them, kill the person that gave you the job, just lay down the quest and lose the chance to get some extra insulin...or not? You can actually lay down the quest and then rob the quest giver for the key to the insulin, and if you do it right, you won't even get the revenge for robbing here)\n\nSo yeah..blablabla yada yada yada\n\nBuy game, game great.","March 6, 2015","true","71.9"," 80 of 87 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","80","87","3","1"

I feel guilty I only paid $5 dollars for this game. If you decide to crowd-fund your next game, please make note of it on your blog so people can donate.  I have gotten an immense amount of fun out of Survivalist, far beyond its actual retail price.\n\nI've tried to figure out why this game was so addictive for me, and I think it comes down to a combination of the post-apocalyptic setting, the crafting and community building element, the exploration system, and the strategy and foresight required to reach the end of the game. If these elements appeal to you individually, the combination of them will bring you many days of fun.\n\nThere were bad times though. The first few hours, I derisively referred to this game as Insulin Quest.  Watching my team split up and run off in four different directions because I was walking to close to a the edge of a cliff was a serious, recurring frustration. I became more afraid of slight elevations than I was of White Strain infected. I also did not like that human-on-human violence played such a big, hard-wired role in the game.\n\nBut nonetheless I couldn't put the game down until I had beaten it and replayed it, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who appreciates those good qualities I have described.","December 14, 2015","true","125.3"," 57 of 57 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","57","57","6","0"

Being a veteran of survival, RPG, and all types of strategy games in general I still intended to give a fair review based on the game's content. Twenty minutes into the game all i could say was "Wow!" This game is amazing and so much fun. It masterfully mixes Survival, RPG, RTS, and Action elements into a highly addictive adventure that will entertain you for numerous hours and even at full price I strongly recommend this game to fans of all these genres. Not convinced? Then read on...\n\nIn Survivalist the ultimate goal is obviously to survive yet another zombie apocalypse. Except that these zombies offer a greater challenge than typical survival games. The infection has multiple strains with varying effects and incubational periods before turning into a zombie yourself. Each will require an antigen specific for that particular type. Another difference is that these zombies are incredibly fast and agile. Don't expect to outrun them. In this game its fight or die.\n\nSurviving will ultimately depend on building a strong community of people working together. You will need to build a strong base able to defend against attacks. It will also need to provide other basic basic needs to survivors like clean drinking water, fresh crops of food, shelter and hygiene. This will require you to recruit people with varying skills, gather an assortment of building materials, and collect items that can be useful. There are many NPC's in the game and most of them can be pursuaded in different ways to join your community. Players can use gifts, perform tasks, or even strong-arm characters into joining. There are countless possibilites based on dialogue and other decisions made over the course of the game. Its really nice how all choices have consequences. And, don't be fooled. Not everybody you encounter is a friendly face ready to welcome you with open arms. There are other survivor communities and bands of looters scattered across the map with their own needs in mind.\n\nMembers of your community can be assigned to perform different jobs either by direct control or by using the command feature which will enable you to avoid the hassles of micromanagement. Individuals have a handful of stats that level up through use of that particular skill. They are affected by respect and approval ratings even after being recruited so they can decide to leave your community if they become unhappy with your leadership skills. These are just some of the many challenges that this game offers.\n\nThe Good:\n=======+  Solid story and quality content\n+  Numerous options and variety of choices\n+  Entirely sandbox and open (aside from the tutorial)\n+  UI is easy to use\n+  Good quality graphics\n+  Sound quality\n+  Rotating camera\n+  Full controller support\n+  High replay value\n+  Realistic concepts\n+  Variable speed settings\n+  Stability (lack of bugs and crashes)\n+  Low requirements/runs well on older machines\n+  Steam Achievements\n+  Developer friendly and active in community\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  No option to turn tutorial hints off\n-  No ambient sounds in background\n-  No useful vehicles or items for transporting resources\n-  Crafting is minimal (somewhat abandoned concept?)\n-  Could be multiplayer or co-op?\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========Survivalist is definitely one of those games Steam users won't want to miss. I strongly recommend picking this game up if you're a fan of Survival, RPG, RTS, or Action  games and the price is unbeatable for the content you receive. Forget about the fact that its made by one person on a low budget rather than by an entire development team with studio backing. This game can easily compare to big name titles like State of Decay and hold its own. Yes, the game is that good.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 19, 2015","true","357.8"," 87 of 105 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","87","105","4","4"

The choices you make can define how your gameplay is, such as: Should I recruit this group of five to my community? They could be used for guarding, farming or constructing buildings, but they also need to be fed which can drain my supplies and risk my other survivors' lives if they venture out to get more food for them.\n\nI am very impressed by this game, considering that it costs such a small price is a big surprise for the quality of it. I wish we could see more games like these more and State of Decay. I adore a game where you build a community during an apocolypse or other circumstances.\n\nThe only cons I would say about this game is that the camera angle and this 'fog of war' that limits your visibility to such a small sight, by the time you've seen a group of infected and raised your gun, they're already on top of you and infecting you. I have had this happen quite often, which is an annoyance. The other con would be the unecessarily fast zombies in this game, there is nothing that has annoyed me more than having one of my runners ambushed by a group of infected and then constantly caught by them when they try to outrun them, eventually they either get caught and bitten due to the poor fatigue that takes a long time to improve or they waste all their ammo on shooting them whilst moving, which is irritating due to the poor accuracy when moving even when a survivor is right in front of them.\n\nOverall, there are improvements to be made, but this game at the current moment is great in my opinion.","August 17, 2015","true","77.9"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","60","65","2","1"

I highly recommend it!\n\nSurvivalist has a lot of things going against it, to be honest. It's one of a plethora of titles in the survival genre, it employs a very basic graphics package, and it's developed by a relatively small shop, just to name a few. That said, in my opinion it far surpasses so many of its peers in so many ways. Here's my short list of exactly how it does it:\n- Choices matter. Virtually everything you do has consequences, including your interactions with the environment, your community (i.e. the survivors who join you) and NPCs. These consequences do have some remedies, but they take work to get around.\n- There's a lot of quests/missions. In my playthrough, almost nothing has to be done in a particular sequence, in that you can put things on hold if you like and do your own sandbox thing for a while.\n- Strategy AND tactics. You can choose the RTS controls for some overarching activity, and then take control of a particular character to make sure something is done the way you want it. Perfect for your micromanaging streak while allowing you accomplish a lot of the mundane stuff without pulling your hair out.\n- Scavenging. The map is full of useful stuff, and you get to choose how to use it, particularly when it comes to building your base.\n- Replay value. This relates strongly to the first point dealing with choices, but because almost everything can pivot the game in at least a small way, things can be very different depending on what you choose.\n- Performance. My machine is definitely middle-of-the-pack, but it has no issue running this game with several different background apps.\n- Active development. The developers just released a major patch today that implements online co-op, and they've been regular about updates and bug fixes since launch.\n\nThere are some things to be aware of that some people won't find that attractive.\n- The graphics are very basic, but it's by design.\n- The crafting system is rudimentary, but you also don't have to pull your hair out putting things together.\n- Music gets a bit repetitive.\n\nSeriously, for the money, it's going to be very difficult to get a game that rivals all you can enjoy here. Really well done!","April 16","true","22.1"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","40","43","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edgarsabin/recommended/340050/","edgarsabin","Abobo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edgarsabin/","136 products in account","I will have to preface this review with this one line:  This is literally the first game in over 2 years I am excited to come home and play.\n\nSurvivalist is an RPG/RTS hybrid, with sandbox elements baked in.  You start off as Joe, a financial hedge fund manager who has no practical skills and a boatload of worthless money, who lives in a 3x3 meter concrete bunker.  As you start, the game takes you through its tutorial phase, and I found it to be a quite easy to understand.  It covers most, if not all you need to learn about the game.  In about 1-2 hours you will learn how to build your base, scavenge for loot, and shoot zombies in style.\n\nHowever, this game shows its detail even in the tutorial, as you can completely skip it, and the game will remember this and assume you know the game, giving you full control over all functions.  It will also remember that you didn't get a certain community member and have certain events unfold!\n\nBut this is only the beginning of the game.  From there, you can quest by yourself or with a posse, forgo exploration and build your base and community, or build relations with not only the friendly communities but also the various looter or highwaymen gangs.  I found it a nice touch to be able to recruit what you would expect to be basic "bad guys", and then find out they have personality, and some even have their own story lines!\n\nThe quests range from difficult and strategic, mysteries to solve, or easy and borish... but expect the unexpected.  Much like real life, don't take all you hear at face value.  And this is, in my opinion, one of the strongest suits of the game.  Not only do you have multiple approaches to quests, but you'll quickly find out that not all quests are good for you.  I will also note here that the story, or main quest line, is really, really good.  I honestly haven't been engaged in a games story for many years, and this short story for some reason has me coming back for more.\n\nThe base building is in the basic RTS style.  You can set your community members out to gather resources, then have some other community members build various structures, while others do your farming, guarding, and exploring.  There aren't too many structures to build, but there is enough variety to work with.  However, the main break away from RTS style games is that your gatherer can also be your builder, soldier, explorer, farmer, doctor, or guard.  However, for veteran RTS players, the controls in Command mode(The RTS mode) are not as extensive as other RTS games.\n\nCombat in this game is simplistic, yet I found it quite fun.  Depending on your firearms skill, you can aim at the torso, legs, or head.  Aiming is heavily based on the firearms skill, with no stars in the skill meaning you cannot hit the broad side of a highway sign, to 5 stars where you can head shot all day long and rarely miss a shot.  The enemies you fight are not the slow type of zombie, these are the "Warp 9 engage!" zombies that can run down a galloping horse on speed.  Seriously, Aim for the legs!  I found this to be a fun, arcade-y style of combat, with reaction time being paramount between being zombie chow or using its skull for a cup.  However, even if they do get ahold of you, don't fret: you can give 'em a swift kick to get them off you.  This will use up your fatigue meter, which is based off of fitness.  Again, no stars = you can kick them off a couple times to 5 stars where you can go all Neo in the matrix, tossing them off repeatedly.  However, there are stronger zombies out there that will require more, if not all your strength to throw off.\n\nThe graphics aren't anything to write home about, but I did find them more than passable. For the most part they didn't break me away from the game in any form.  That said... the walking animation is not the greatest, and the sidestep animation reminds me of MC Hammer.  You can't touch this!  The soundtrack has a couple of good tunes in it, but to sum up: "Its good, but not great"  The controls I found to be spot on, and I could always get my character to do what I wanted, when I wanted.\n\nIn summery, I love this game.  I imagine I will be playing this for at least another 50 hours, and I spent a whoppin' 5 bucks on it.  I've gotten more enjoyment out of this game than most AAA stuff out there.  And if you are on the fence, you can even download the demo and try it yourself for free.\n\nPS:  This game was made by one guy.  ONE.  Cudos to you, Bob, and thank you for producing a quality FULL game for an amazing price!","March 17, 2015","true","98.3"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","32","34","3","1"

When will this end?"\n\nWell yes this is a game about zombies and YES zombie games are very common, some of them suck, some of them are medicore, and some of them are Very good, like one.\n\nSmall review You start as a survivalist who has been in hiding in his bunker for 1 year in a zombie outbreak.\nAfter 1 year you get out of your bunker and meet some people who help you start a community.\n\nYou have to search for food and water at the beginning. later you build a well for all your Water needs and then you start your own farm which is a MUST because food will get scarce very fast.\nYou will come across other communities. Some will give you quest opportunity, others will give you a bullet to the face or they will take al your gold (The game currency).\nIf a character not from your community likes you very much you can recruit then in your community, making your community bigger and even stronger.\n\nyou can give community members objectives and tasks which they must do to keep up (searching for construction materials/Farm/Guard).\nSkills are VERY important in this game, A character with a low fitness level and high firearms level is a smart choice to keep on lookout in one of your guard towers.\n\nLast but not least, the zombies.\nThere are 5 types of zombies and there infection. (if they bite you you have limited time to find the right cure)\n\nGreen eye's: Most common of all the 5, if they bite you have a very long time before the infection kills you. low HP\n\nBlue eye's: second most common of the 5. If they bite you you have a moderate amount of time before the infection kills you. Mid HP\n\nRed eye's: Rare, Infection will kill within a minute. High HP\n\nWhite eye's: Very rare, Infection will kill in seconds. Very high HP\n\nGray eye's(?): This infection is spread as a rumour so many don't belive in its existence, But it exists. I regret to tell you that i have no information on this infection.\n\nIn short, This game is worth the 5 euro, damn it is even worth 20 euro, If you like survival games which include social systems and zombies, don't wait just buy.","July 13, 2015","true","52.4"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","30","32","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/340050/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1457 products in account","First of all I want to say… this game was just not for me, and so to people who know my likes well and have similar tastes, I would not recommend it. However, I can appreciate that although it may not be for me, it is actually a fairly good game and people who don’t have the same miffs with it that I do might really enjoy it (and actually have).\n\nThat said, let’s get on with the review.\n\nJoe Wheeler, a self-centered businessman, leaves the safety of his bunker in search for food just about a year after the zombie apocalypse. The game is actually pretty run-of-the-mill post apocalyptic survival game, you have to scavenge, avoid looters, kill/escape zombies, build your own place in the world and overall just survive.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, not 3D masterpieces but I rather like the look of them; the game runs perfectly on older computers and the sounds and music are pretty alright as well.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe game has lots of potential, and for being a one-man job, it’s really an amazing accomplishment on the developer’s part.\n\nThe world seems to be quite large, the quests, although rather typical, are alright; the quest givers do remember your actions and any misstep will have consequences. You can go to war with factions, recruit people to your side, etc. You can use diplomacy, buy, sell, trade…\n\nThe characters do seem to have some form of distinct personalities, and they are flawed in them. I really loved the touch of one of them having diabetes, it brought realism to the story. That there is a limited supply of insulin you must find/trade for also made it more realistic. But it also has the downside of making you feel truly rushed…\n\nYou can split your party and give everyone commands. You can build things and plant crops.\n\nIt has a fatigue system so you can’t just run forever, and I rather like that they added a needed sleep schedule to the hunger/thirst part of surviving.\n\nPeople can actually leave your party/settlement/faction when they don’t like you anymore.\n\nYou can save at any time during the game, something that always wins my heart.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe default controls are super uncomfortable to me. Having to click F1 for the inventory is a stretch, using the middle button (mouse wheel button) to skip text is super uncomfortable. Entering a building is done through clicking with the mouse, but so is talking, and the menu for talking pops up as soon as someone is next to you, so sometimes the characters would stand right next to me when I was trying to enter a building which ended up in me talking to them when I didn’t want to.\nOverall it was a pain to do half the things I had to do.\n\nThe characters who didn’t have a high shooting skill couldn’t shoot straight worth a damn. I get it this was probably going for realism, even Joe outright admits that he’s a bad shot. But there’s a bad shot, and there’s I-can’t-hit-a-target-even-when-it’s-on-me. The zombies were just way too fast and the aiming did not work quite as well when you had to be moving around all the time to avoid them jumping you from far too far. I found 0 melee weapons on the time I played (I honestly don’t know if there’s any), which admittedly wasn’t much. It was disturbing. I’d expect you’d find a baseball bat to smash a zombie’s head with before you’d find a gun…Then again I suppose since it’s a year later most people would be carrying guns… all the same, a backup melee weapon would have been nice to find.\n\nThe game’s inventory is handled by a weight system, which is alright. However, it feels like you can’t really accomplish anything because everything you find to carry weighs too much and you end up having to make some very tough choices. This could be fine if you like a hard challenge, I’d rather get a bit more time to enjoy the game while surviving…\n\nResource hunting is mind numbingly boring. Just getting the things to start building a fence took forever. Even with a backpack, because of the weight issue, the character can only bring one or two pieces of wood at a time. While realistic, this was also terribly frustrating - It takes longer to bring a piece of wood back to the shelter than it takes my characters to start getting hungry and sleepy and thirsty.\n\nThe need for food/sleep/water/insulin seems too pressing. Again, good if you’re playing say, hard mode, but it doesn’t let you (or at least, wasn’t letting me) enjoy the game. I wasn’t even done figuring out a quest, and already they were starving. (Ok, not starving-starving, but already quite hungry).\n\nThe AI seemed clunky when you left your guys alone. I left one doing the supply runs for wood so I could start building up something, he was attacked and bitten because I wasn’t there to press space when he got jumped. Had to restart because I was unable to get the needed antigen and I was fairly sure I couldn’t lose my only builder so far.\n\n\n\nAll in all, while I loved the general premise and style of Survivalist, I couldn’t bring myself to fully enjoy the game as I felt rushed to get through it, and annoyed with the controls; yet I can see lots of potential in it. I was pretty split on recommending this game or not. In the end I’m going with a tentative “no” because to me the cons are a bit more annoying than the pros. Still, I can admit it's not a bad game.\n\nSo, if you like a challenge in your survival games, then I would definitely recommend Survivalist to you. For the price it can be a great game. If you were expecting something a little more relaxed, I wouldn’t recommend it.\n\nThere is word that there might be a multiplayer mode added, and I’m looking forward to see if it makes it any easier on the players by teaming up.\n\n* Key provided by Developer","September 21, 2015","false","2.8"," 182 of 283 people (64%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","64","182","283","13","11"

Then Zday kicks off and you're living easy. Well that got you through the first hump but your supplies have run out. Now it's time to venture out and resupply and hopefully reconnect with whatever remains of civilization.\n\nWhat you find, rather unfortunately, is an emotional train wreck of a woman with an insulin problem who badgers you constantly and sets off warning bells every time her blood sugar gets too high. Then some pointless quests that are all focused on getting said waste-of-space woman more insulin so that she can complain again later that she's out. I've thought about kicking her out of the group so many times...\n\nThat aside, you meet some interesting people and convince them to join you. Together you make a small community, build up some walls, put up a tower or two, some crops, a well, a few houses.. before you know it, you've got the sparks of a community you can call yours. you set the guard rotations, make sure your crops are being tended to, and put together an A Team of badasses with some heavy packs to loot the hell out of the desert. Let the good times roll.\n\nAt 10 hours in I have just barely gotten to that point, and there is so much more to do... This game rocks. The controls are a bit funky (on 360 controller and/or mouse/keyboard) but you get used to them. Some of the interaction menus come up at the complete wrong times and can cause you to die, so my suggestion is to save often to avoid that. The graphics are great for this game and help with emersion. The music ranges from good and very fitting to the horrible non-stop out of place techno music that tends to give me a headache. I usually just save the game then reload the save to force a new song to go on. Some people complain about the reputation grinding, but it's not that bad. So you have to talk to a few people, do some work for them (which also gets you gold), and gift them an item... isn't that how it works in the real world too? It's completely fine.\n\nAll around great game and for only $4.99 it's an instant buy if it's already on your wish list. So far I've gotten $0.50 an hour of enjoyment in my 10 hours of play and can easily see another 20-30 hours...

Not one crash or bug encountered in 16 hours of game play.\n\nCombat is fast and fun. Controls are intuitive. Controlling each individual survivor as well as being able to command them in command mode for repetitive tasks (like go get the 60 boards from that hardware store, 2 at a time) is very nice. The base building aspect is great. Roaming zombies and looters makes having some guards in guard towers useful.\n\nYou can recruit pretty much anyone with the right approach, including the enemy looters in camps that people in towns tell you to kill. Getting them all to join you seems to work just as well as killing them, at least in the missions I've done so far.\n\nQuick tip for newbies: Try fighting green zombies hand to hand. Not only does it save bullets, it builds your fitness skill - which lets you carry more (much more with a good backpack) and keep the tougher zombies off you better. Just make sure not to sprint your stamina away before a fight, hand to hand does basically no damage when fatigued and you can't kick the zombies off you either. Once your skill is higher you can even fight off the tougher zombies with hand to hand.\n\nAnother plus to having high fitness is you can do the boxing thing with npcs, which builds respect for you in addition to giving you money. I think high fitness even helps with making the NPCs who try to shake you down back off if you stand up to them (big buff guy more intimidating I guess). With a high fitness I was able to walk into a looter camp and shake down one of them, then recruit him forcibly and everyone else just by asking since they are now impressed with the way I handled myself.","May 15, 2015","true","49.0"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

Open world with fun quests and compelling character quests. The lack of melee weapons and limited guns (pistol, shotgun, and assault) makes fighting somewhat repetitive but the freedom of how to build, design, and manage your own compound more than makes up for it. For 5 bucks you cant go wrong and if your a fan of survival games like State of Decay then this will grab your attention for hours of challenging fun.","February 1, 2015","true","19.9"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","27","34","0","0"

What, 3 bucks?  Damn, there is no reason not to try this game out.  It is basic, but entertaing and has yet to crash even once (Paging Bethesta, et, all, this is how you put a game out, it WORKS!!).  Congrats and praise for the Developer.\n\nIf you like "zombies" and TEOTWAWKI, by all means, spend your bucks.  I enjoy this much more than Dead State, or any other appocolyptic game I have bought in recent time.\n\nEDITED TO ADD:  Still playng, as I get further along it gets harder as I am juggling supplies with one group, building with another two recruits, farming and taking my action team further and further away from home.\n\nSome of the compliants are true, it can feel tedious, but I think a lot of that is the lack of the lazy man's fast travel and the fact that you have to think and experimant to find ways to progress, as there is little in the way of a cheati.  This game gives you little, you have to work for it.  Still better than Dead State, with much much more replay value.\n\nCombat isn't that bad (who the hell plays games without a mouse or a controller?!?!), and with a little practice I'm rocking it.  As for zombies out of no where, yeah, so what?  Fkrs are sneaky that way.  Wait till you get the sniper rifle, then you start seeing them first.  Also, don't run everywhere as you explore, gives you less reaction time to the zombies that come out of no where, and makes you tired.  Finally, LEARN TO DODGE, when they first jump at you, step to the side and kick or shoot them as they go past.  You can also stop them in their tracks with a first strike kick when they come at you.","January 2","true","121.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","16","16","3","0"

I really REALLY love this game.\n\nFor me graphics aren't very important. I always compare to the film industry - there are so many shallow, big budget, gorgeous looking, but TERRIBLE films coming out ever since we had the technology to make them.\n\nHowever I am old school and graphics are meaningless compared to story, gameplay and how much you get sucked into a game.\n\nYes you can get the odd title with all of the above including graphics, but you can't get them for the tiny sum these guys are asking.\n\nThis game is deep, with plenty of fun quests that keep you playing and playing. It has some great base building gameplay which can take place independently at the same time as you are out shooting up the world, thanks to having programmable community members to build, farm and collect materials.\n\nYou can build up your community and its members as you like, finding people with the required skills or training them up and hopefully keeping them alive. You can test your strategic skills by assaulting enemy camps or defending bases that you have designed completely yourself.\n\nEveryone you meet will have their own opinion of you depending on how you interact with them and the people they care about, affecting trade prices and available missions. You can lay waste to other communities or slowly recruit them all away to your base, or leave them intact as valuable outposts for trade and supplies in the middle of the wasteland. You can be as good or totally evil as you like and reap the consequences or rewards!\n\nYou always need to keep moving and exploring to find the resources required to keep your people alive and it just draws you in!\n\nOn the downside I did find the controls slightly clumsy and difficult to use in places to begin with, but it was quickly overcome. I would like to be able to change the camera angle though, unless I haven't found this yet. Also to start with I wasn't paying attention properly when placing buildings, so my first watchtower was the wrong way around and open and exposed to everyone beyond the wall! (not sure if this is actually reflected with defense penalties) I would like a feature to be able to rotate the buildings after building them without deleting them (although not realistic).\n\nI haven't tried co-op but I am really a single game player so my review would be meaningless on this.\n\nAll in all you can really get completely absorbed into this world and these guys prove you don't have to have a VR set + next gen visuals to do that!","May 10","true","14.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

It depends on playstyle I suspect. Most of the time, my people did their things without supervision. That said, there is manegement required, it ain't abojut the shoot, hack and slash.\n\nThat said for my only grievance, hopefully future improvements will see optimization of the community member list, so you can sort by skill to pick the right survivor for a job.

Basically it's an open world sandbox in the vain of Project Zomboid. You start off in a bunker and go exploring to find food/water and other supplies. Along the way you'll meet friendly NPCs and settlements, as well as enemy raiders and of course Zombies. You can recruit other NPCs to follow you (and become playable characters), and eventually establish your own settlement wherever you like really. This settlement can be built up with walls, houses, towers etc.\n\nInventory management plays a big part in this game with some tasks taking a while to complete without having large backpacks equipped on your characters. You can automate tasks by telling your characters to go collect wood/water/other supplies so in a sense it has an RTS element too as this is all controlled from a top down perspective. Combat is simple yet functional with bullets being relatively scarce, and the enemies are quite varied with raiders being tough to kill while zombies are cliched being simple in small groups but quite difficult in hordes.  There are way more features I have not touched on but if you want a really pleasing survival game with a pick up and play aspect to it, then Survivalist is that!","March 7","true","4.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/340050/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: For the most part I found Survivalist to be a very solid and enjoyable game.  On first appearances it may seem like a casual version of Dead State-lite but its not even turn-based. If you are a fan of State of Decay then you will be pleased to find a number of similarities with that game.\n\nIts a zombie survival RPG played in real-time with exploration, combat, character fatigue/hunger/ thirst, community recruitment, base building, tied together with some complex quests.  Unfortunately there are a few really frustrating things such as overly complex quest-arcs, somewhat frenetic combat and some very gamey aspects to recruiting and achievement hunting that bring it slightly down from being great.\n\nOverall the game possesses some really well designed and implemented features which together add up to surpass the sum of its parts.  However it can be difficult to get into if you dont enjoy the feeling of not being in complete control.  If you are not great at multi-tasking or you dislike the pace and frantic nature of real-time combat then I would give this a miss or dont expect too much!\n\nThose things almost put me off during my first aborted playthrough.  Yet if you can overlook them or possess a methodical approach to gameplay there's a very good game to discover.   One that surprised me but only if you have the patience and persistence to try.\n\n\n... More info below ...\n\n\n01. GENRE: Story-driven, zombie survival isometric RPG.  Played in real-time.\n\n02. SETTING: A post-apocalypic scenario full of rival communities in a fictional desert region around mid-west United States.\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: Take control of Joe Wheeler a successful hedge fund manager (i.e. tosser) who built his own bunker before the zombie apocalypse started.  After a year of surviving alone and with dwindling resources, its time to take your first steps into a harsh new world, recruit characters, form a community, build a base, gather resources and complete quests, while fighting bands of looters and avoiding infection from zombies.\n\nThe story is fairly deep, with a complex main quest.  One that demands your full attention otherwise you can lose your bearings and get bored.  This is further complicated with the time sensitive nature of the insulin quest and your need to find more of it to keep a certain NPC alive.  Unfortunately there is also at least one convoluted quest where you have to wait, wait and wait for someone to die (if you dont want bad karma) to get an item you may desparately need [for more insulin].  These plain suck and take away from the satisfying quests.\n\n04. GAME MODES: A multiple story driven campaign played out on a single map with around two dozen quest arcs of varying length, complication and effort.  The main story arc has about 20 sub-quests to complete.  The core gameplay will take in excess of 50hours easily.  My playthrough took 90hours and it was far from comprehensive.  If you fail a quest you are given the chance to reload automatically.\n\n05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: The whole game takes place on one explorable map populated by survivor communities, zombies, deserted towns and looters.  The map is not fully open-world restricting exploration through the the nature of the insulin quest and the need to keep an eye on your community members.  The game can be continued after the main quest is finished.  If you are lucky you can attempt to complete the other two alternatives to the central quest.\n\n06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: An almost perfect blend of features for the genre. Contains a good number of well conceived multi-option quests, well-rounded and flawed characters and a clever dialogue system even though sometimes gamey recruitment requirements for key characters - such as luring zombies near to them to increase respect.\n\nThere is also excellent base building and community management, substantial item inventory, and a good RPG-lite stats for each character that determine key actions such as fitness, combat, construction, healing and farming.  Combat is frenetic in real-time which was hit and miss and, a fairly robust A.I. that allows you delegate tasks to community members even if it was not perfect.  Resource collection was a tad too slow, making the game last too long.\n\n07. ENEMIES: Zombies are unfortunately not the main threat in the game.  They exist alone or in small groups in unexplored areas.  They will try to run and bite your characters either alone or in groups until despatched.   Once the fog of war is exposed those areas are clear. Humans come in two forms: survivors and looters.  Combat doesnt necessarily need to occur with humans but once you start they will remain hostile until they are dead.  These attack with numerous weapons and in groups so are much more dangerous.  However periodically the groups of roving zombies and looters will target your base to keep you on your toes.\n\n08. A.I: The game possess some solid A.I.  It allows you to manage what tasks individuals are assigned, while having them seek; food, water and rest when they require it.  They will even hunt down ammo if they are low.  The A.I. was so well-made that the paltry issues I had were that farmers did not collect and store corn and if water wasnt available, they did not seek it from nearby wells.   Combat is straightforward enough, as they will shoot any perceived threat or attempt to kick them off if overwhelmed.\n\n09. CONTROLS: Fine but not completely initutive for a PC user.\n\n10. GRAPHICS: Basic.  Cartoony in nature but clear and good enough for the job.\n\n11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Unintrusive.  Firearms and reloading sounds are satisfying.\n\n12. VOICE ACTING: None.  But the well-written dialogue compenstates.\n\n13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: Easy to pick-up.  Not so easy to manage the party as it grows.  Its main difficult is determining the right course of actions to complete the quests in hand.  Combat also presents its challenges when faced with better equipped enemies.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: No problems running the game experienced.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: These are wide ranging.  Only a few are simple.  Some are overly complex.  If you are expecting easy and fast achievements this is not the game for you.  There are a couple that are insanely difficult to get and very time consuming!  On the other hand when you do trigger one its very satisfying.  Some of the achievements will need at least one replay.  Likely more.\n\n16. DLC: None but a sequel is planned by the developer.  Yes I said developer.  It was made [mostly] by one person!  So kudos to him for a sterling effort!\n\n17. ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: Did not try co-op but I would imagine if its stable the game would be twice as engrossing to play with two of you in the same group.\n\n18. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: For a real-time RPG and indie game this really surprised me.  It has alot of great content even if only the main quest is replayable.  I think fans of games with the story and questing of Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale, and the zombie survival and party/base management of State of Decay, Dead State wil definitely enjoy Survivalist.  Even if it appears to be the poor relation graphically.\n\n19. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: The game is built for at least one playthrough but given the complicated nature of the quest arcs and the all to real possibility of messing up something you could be playing this twice or three times as there are three possible player sanctioned goals that require the best part of the game to slowly achieve.  These are: Love, Money and Power.  Each has its own set of sub-quests you will really need to make and to some extent grinding goals to chip away at as you play.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: One of the few titles I would recommend at full price.  Getting it on a sale would just be a bonus.","March 19","true","220.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","3"

The camera angles, combat, looting, controls and character interaction (basically the whole game) are all really clunky and not enjoyable.  I was hoping this was going to be a great game, it is full of great ideas but as a whole it is very poorly designed and put together.\n\nOne of my biggest issues is the "fog of war" that covers everything and is only revealed when you get REALLY close to it.  As in I'm sure even someone with poor vision could at least see the outline of a building 20 feet away, but it's blacked out for no good reason until I get close enough to spit on it.  Combat is often initiated because you can't see things coming due to the "FOW" and the zeds get on top of you so fast you can't do much about it.  The combat controls are crappy at best, however I do like that you can initiate a kick while holding a pistol or other weapon.  Lots of games would make you put the weapon away to kick or punch.   The building aspect is a good idea but I haven't bothered trying to drag around enough stuff to build anything so I'm not sure if it's useful or more trouble than it's worth, however that is something more zombie survival genre games need so I give the game a solid +1 for adding that.\n\nI guess if you love the genre pick this up on sale, otherwise steer clear.  Despite not really liking the game I'll probably still play it a bit here and there since I see potential there.  Just wish I'd paid even less than I did.  Got my fingers crossed that this game gets straightened out soon.","April 12, 2015","false","1.0"," 32 of 55 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","32","55","2","10"

The game focuses on a business man named Joe Wheeler, who emerges from a underground bunker in the middle of a desert. Here are some Pros and Cons of the game.\n\nPROS:\n*Price tag for this game is relativaly cheap and affordable, about the same price of a 5 $ foot long at subway.\n*Big in-game map and lots of interesting locations.\n*The player can make decisions and choices.\n*Good amount of NPC's.\n*(SPOILER!!!!! BELOW!!!)\nInfected are harder than others and have different types of "strains"\n*A player can build a community.\n*A player can interact with a good number of NPC's\n*A player can learn skills\n*And much much more but I don't want to spoil anything :-)\n\nLike every game, it has its flaws...\n\nCONS:\n*Graphics aren't the best and may look outdated, however, if your interested in this game, this really shouldn't matter.\n*The Soundtrack........ terrible, just turn it off, unless you like retro during a zombie apocalypes, however, turning off the music sound isn't a challenge.\n*There aren't alot of weapon veriaty, the player only uses guns to defend himself or may use the characters fist, so don't expect UZI's or AK-47's, however, there are still some weopons but these are very broad with the name and description.\n*Combat: Combat is not the best in this game, as this game does not really focus on combat itself. Usually, you'll run into some looters or infected and shoot them and defend yourself. Don't expect anything special with the combat here in this game, as it focuses on survival.\n*This game is not for you if all your interested in is shooting zombies and getting killstreaks.\n\nCONCLUSION: Is this game worth it? Yes and of course, the game itself it a very unique take on survivaland living in a zombie apocalypes. However, like I mentioned above, if all you want is to kill zombies and get killstreak, this game is not for you. I have enjoyed playing this game alot so far and I never encountered a bug or glitch. For being a lesser known game developer, they really made a neat game. You should check it out yourself.","September 25, 2015","true","78.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You leave the bunker, only to be attacked while looking for your car. You beat up the zombie, take his gun and ammo, and from then on, get ready to shoot some Zombies.\n\nBut the main focus of this game really isn't on the Zombie shooting. You need to find other survivors, entice them to join you through various methods, and slowly build a community. You can build buildings, fortifications, farm food, draw water from the well you dug, and most importantly, trade and scavenge for food and other supplies.\n\nThe game becomes increasingly harder, giving thougher Zombies and looters to fight while you solve various quests and increase your numbers.\n\nBy now I have plenty food, water, ammo and a completely build camp with walls and towers, and most importantly about 10 inhabitants.\n\nAnd still, I haven't seen the entire map yet, or found all the challenges to come.\n\nGreat game, especially when you consider the price!","April 29, 2015","true","65.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It is a superbly well thought out game and contains a perfect mix of RPG, Base building and Adventure.\n\nRPG: Characters level up. They improve as they carry out the actions in several different areas. You can also purchase books which improve their skill whilst in the inventory. Your actions are remembered by NPCs too and their opinion of you is fluid throughout the game based upon your actions.\n\nBase Building: This is just sublime. Yes, the buildings are generic templates, but you can buid those fences, fortifcations and such however and wherever you like. One very minor point is that it's fairly tricky to build anywhere other than the default place, but as mentioned before, what you do to enhance it and how, that's very much up to you.\n\nAdventure: There are storylines! You have to curry favour with various individuals and factions. This can open up other questlines, and you can even persuade them to join your cause. I believe prices charged by vendors for items can be swayed this way too.\n\nThis truly is a magnificent game. Until this game came along, State of Decay was probably the closest to 'realism' and sense of survival against the odds with dwindling supplies. This, for me, while it doesn't perhaps look quite as gorgeous to look at, is infintely better it almost all other aspects of the game.\n\nSince buying it I've hardly gotten any housework done, and I've contemplating phoning in sick at work!\n\nThe developer seems to be a one man team - and he is very active on forums, answering questions and discussing feedback.

It doesn't need a powerful computer to run and I think your grandpa's pc will be sufficient as well.\n\nYou start solo and then can expand into a community which enables you to control any character in your group. Yes, you do need to gather food supplies, ammo, water and well medical supplies like any other zombie survival game by either scavenging or trading with other npcs. What I like most about this game is the challenge it might provide as well as the little details the developer managed to fit in such a light game. One of the initial, rather a major character suffers from diabetes so you need to find some specific medicines for her from time to time. As you over use a character, it becomes tired and end up being less productive so you are forced to shuffle which is a POSITIVE here. You can kill any character and decide if you want to complete a mission or not. It has base building which is pretty straight forward and unlike other games, it takes real man hours to complete construction (an NPC fetches resources and builds).\n\nI could go in detail (not really) but lets keep it short.

Survivalist is a top down post-apocalyptic RPG similar to State of Decay and Dead State. Set one year into the zombie apocalypse you start off as a wealthy business man with heaps of worthless money who has been living alone in a bunker for a whole year hoping to wait out the apocalypse, but then your bunker supplies unexpectedly ran out. Left with no choice but to venture outside you will encounter other survivors, zombies, looters and so your adventure begins in this zombified desert wasteland.\n\nThe game is not perfect but it is still very fun to play. The graphics are pretty dated; they look like The Sims 2 from 2004 level of graphics but with better shadow effects. But this is probably due to the game be ported over from old Xbox 360 hardware, which also limits the frame rate to about 30 so that may turn some people off. Also the aiming is off as you cannot pull off any headshots against your enemies which makes gun combat pretty annoying in early game where your character's firearms skills are low and can lead to some pretty cheap deaths with your characters. Also ammo and supplies are plentiful in this game which can take away some of the hardcore survival aspects of this game.\n\nBut the positives out-way the negatives, gameplay is still fun and there is a lot to see and do, there is a good package here for just $5. If you enjoy zombie games like State of Decay which is also similar, then you will have no serious problems with this game.\n\nSurvivalist has my seal of approval.","January 31, 2015","true","6.1"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","23","39","8","0"

Thankfully there is a demo available for it, and after I played the demo, I was sold.  Best way to describe Sruvivalist would be a "post apocalyptic, zombie survival, base building, resource gathering goodness".  While the graphics may not be "top of the line", and the camera cannot zoom in or out(same with minimap), and at the moment; there really are only three guns available(been unable to locate the sniper rifle if it is in game yet; found plenty of ammo but no gun,  the gameplay itself is very solid.  The music is well made, and the idea of being able to improve relations with various survivor groups around you to possiably recruit them later is very nice.  On top of the basic find food, water, guns and ammo, the devs also included a twist of one of the survivors you find that joins up with you, needs insuline b/c they are type-1 diabetic; resulting in some nail biting moments when running to the nearest trader in hopes they have some left for sale to save her life.\n\nMelee is fun, but much more enjoyable when using a fire arm.  Filling a zombie with lead and then kicking them away is entertaining as well as if the slo-mo kills get combined into it.  One of my personal favorite things they did for this game is to allow you to build your own base (once you find a survivor that can help build, but they are near by in the beginning ;) ).  Base building can seem pretty straight forward, build a wall here, gate there, tower over here, shack over there.  However, to build the base, you need supplies, aka lumber, chicken wire, cement, ect ect ect.  This causes you to either just let one person build, than go out alone to gather supplies(which will only be one of each since the mats weigh so much), or send out a few ppl to gather the mats, so the builder can stay safely tucked away in the base and they can protect each other?  Mean while, you can keep exploring and looting.  Also enjoy the fact that you can start growing your own food and make a well, creating a self sufficent base.\n\nSometimes while exploring you will find small camps of looters, that want nothing more than what you have, and they will attack.  A nice feature is sometimes, one of them will surrender, and offer to join you if you wish, leaving you the choice to take them in, take all of their stuff, or kill them.  Many npcs will have quests, and there are a few times where "things are not as they seem" with the quest, adding to the depth of the game.  There are so many positive things that can be said about this game they greatly reduce or destroy any negativity I may have about it.  It is after all, a indie game.  For $5, you get more out of it than many $20 + games made by reconized labels.  I'd have no qualms about spending $10 for this game. I'd highly recommend this game to any one, and if you are unsure, check out the demo first.","March 9, 2015","true","78.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It made it into my top 5 and it should be in yours if its not already. This game has so much content i was baffled that it only cost 5 dollars. The game lets you choose your own goals which effect the storyline, theres fantastic combat, zombies dont respawn which some might consider a negative but i actually like that since you can effectively set up safe zones where theres no threat of attack, but even then if you enter a major township a pack of zombies or lotters might pick up your scent and follow you back to your base. The looting is amazing, i was always excited to see what new buildings held and what i was gunna bring home with me. The character interaction is top notch, you can switch to any player in your community at any time and control them as you would the main character, and so the character you currently control will have different views of different people and people outside your community will see that character differently than your main character, which makes character selection when interacting with other communities very important. Lastly, the build up to the final fight and the final fight itself with los ceros is amazing. I was losing it trying to make sure that everyone in my community was geared up for a good fight, and we certaintly had a good fight which was quite satisfying. I'll say it now, I WANT ANOTHER!!!!

It is a zombie survival game but it's not boring. It has an interesting and depressing story behind it where there are no right answers.\n\n-Karma.

Be wary of Looter Gangs and Infected Hordes that emerge from the small towns.\n\n-Control or command. Control each survivor in your community individually or command them as a group as you would an RTS. Issue orders such as Guard, Farm, or Supply run to keep them busy. Don't worry about their needs. If they need food, water or sleep, they can do so themselves and return to their assigned duties. I found it useful to have a larger community with good fighters to cover the Watch Towers. So say 10 Watch Towers, with 20 Guards on shifts. One guard goes to sleep the others take their place. Giving the community 24/7 protection from anyone or anything sneaking in, and the buggers do manage to sneak in if you're not careful.\n\n-Story. There is a story involved and it's good. You meet your main character Joe Wheeler, likely of Captain Planet fame which explains why he's so despicable. He survived in a Bunker for a year but now needs to venture out. He meets a damsel in distress. Ok cool, what does she need? Oh that's easy. Kill her sister... well she's infected so good news. Bad news is telling her she's infected. I am joking. Now Alice Ivers plays as your secondary main. Her Chat options are much kinder than Wheelers and will achieve more friendships than Wheeler will who is better off as an imposing figure to intimidate people to his will. Finally we meet the third character who players only use to build the base. Isham Seely, the sole survivor of his community who joins up to assist in helping Alice with her problem. She needs Insulin and there isn't a lot to go around.\n\nSo now with Wheeler as a fighter, Alice as a healer, and Isham as a builder, you're off to a great start to playing this game the best to your ability to swindle, convince, fight, and manipulate others, or, are you being manipulated yourself by those you trust the most? Honestly, I trust the Antagonists of this game more than I do any one else. At least they're honest about what they do.\n\nAfter 85 hours now, I feel accomplished. What an experience and for a very low price. This is a survival game that doesn't get boring so easily. The map isn't too big, there are over 400+ characters with their own stories and needs, and you can choose to help them or kill them outright. You can build your home where you need it to be or build multiple homes. Burn homes down, take over territories, whatever. It was a blast and I cannot recommend it anymore than I can right now.\n\nI never knew this game was going to be so damn good.","April 9","true","92.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I have enjoyed this title so far, Even thought I feel like the controls are made for a controller more than a keyboard every thing is still responds smoothly. There are a lot of interactions with NPC in this game, some of the dialog is very funny, and what you choose to say can affect the story. I have found this game to be one of those that you better save often or youll find yourself loosing a few hours of game play because you saved three hours before you got infected, or injured. I like the NPC team control in this game. You must keep track of your survivors health and sleep statistics, or at least make sure they have food and water available to eat and drink themselves. You can send survivors in different directions and on different quest at the same time. There is a system that allows you to give orders and the survivors will use their own AI to complete the task given. So far I have one fetching water, one fetching wood, and the other is completeing the story quest. Ammo is sometimes hard to come by in this game and youll need a lot of it to level your firearm skills. Dont allow the infected to bite you as the antigen is hard to come by and is very expensive. I think this game has a neat User Interface it is simple I really enjoy the action camera view in the UI. So far what ive explored of the map is pretty fun, not knowing whats ahead always makes things tense however I feel that the survivors would be able to see a bit further than they are able to in the game, but then they wouldn't have so many suprise infected moments.\n\nFor those who are looking for a fun single player game with a good setting,story, and action then I can easily reccommend this game. If you are wanting a sandbox, openworld, build it yourself then I reccommend 7 Days to Die because this is a different type of game. I have had no issues with performance on this game either everything worked very smooth from the beginning. I am using Windows 7 x64 and Radion HD 5450 series video card. Overall I could easily give this game a 9/10 score. The only reason it didn't get 10 is every good game can use more content, or even a coop player mode right?","January 31, 2015","true","21.7"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","15","25","2","0"

I have been playing several hours and still can't decide whether I should continue exploring or expanding my base. Or moving my base elsewhere? I wouldn't know. I'm too wrapped up in this game and its surprisingly suspenseful gameplay.\n\nThis is more of a RPG than an action game, but you can't win on auto-pilot: you need a strategy and some decent reflexes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aeighwoupe/recommended/340050/","aeighwoupe","aeighwoupe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aeighwoupe/","2115 products in account","A very well made game. The graphic and layout may gives an impression of a cheap and sub par game but when you try it, you know you were wrong. Well, after you finished the tutorial of course. The first few hours of the game might be boring but if you stick to it until you get your base, that's the real fun and action really starts.\n\nPro:\n- Nice story. It is not a blockbuster, but it is not as simple as save-the-damsel-in-distress-but-she-is-in-another-castle linear type of story.\n- Nice implementation of RPG gameplay. You start weak, you end strong. You start poor, you end rich. You start with fist, you end with a rocket launcher. You start alive, you end dead, at least couple of time for me near the end.\n- Nice action/combat. It's kinda simplistic, but fits well with the gameplay. Some people dislike the targeting system where with the lowest skill, you can even miss at melee distance. For me it is done well as you can improves it with firearm skill. It's better than not being able to use certain weapon due to not meeting the requirement. You want to use a rifle? You can, but you'll waste lots of rifle bullets. If the rifle bullets are too precious, keep using the gun until you get better with your aiming.\n- Nice enemy. Some people dislike the infected being able to detect you from distance and ambush you. I think that's brilliant. It will give you a sense of fear and always be careful when exploring especially new area. It's not zombicalypse if you're not fear for your life. You're not only dealing with zombie, but also with human.\n- Adequate partial RTS. You can build a base, or multiple bases. You can provide shelter and create a self sustain community. Fend off gang of raiders or zombies. I would love to have more choice, but it is adequate for the game.\n- It's a survival. You need to eat, you need to drink, you need to sleep, you need to make lov...maybe not. Be prepare for your adventure and scavenge as needed.\n- Choices you make, affect the game. All those people you kill, all those people you shakedown, all those presents you give, will affect others.\n- There are no "I'm the kindest, purest, friendliest, generous" type of gameplay. It's a state of emergency, act like one.\n- Large map. It is kinda empty, but it is large.\n\nCons:\n- Slow tutorial. The tutorial is embedded within the storyline. It'll be a while before you'll complete the tutorial and left only with a real quest. Before the tutorial completed, the game kinda boring, which turn off some of the players.\n- Some part of the objective give you a sense of rushing towards the ends. You don't have all the time in the world to explore the map (in the beginning). It's part of the story, and with a good reason to do so, but some people just get annoyed by it. Me included. After finishing the game, I'm glad it's there. It serves a purpose. A valid purpose.\n- Super equipment to know everything. I'm not sure why it's there, but it feels like a cheat.\n- After you established a self sustain base, the survival part of the game feels empty. Corns are way too effective that it's becoming a trading commodity.","February 22","true","61.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

When i ventured closer to the corpse it stood up, so i proceeded to ruin my suit and bash the corpses head in with my bare hands.\n\nThe corpse had within its pockets a loaded gun and a large amount of extra ammunition for it. I needed to find a town, and people. My radio let me know of an sos call nearby that i might check out. Probably not, i dont like getting involved with other peoples ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOn my way down the road i found another corpse, it stood up yet again, but i was expecting this and i had my new found pistol ready, it took me a few shots, roughly about a clip before i got lucky and put a bullet between the blazing green eyes.\n\nIt was quicker and easier than the first corpse, but i still missed alot so i decided to train a bit on a nearby parking sign. I got a few good shots in and decided to continue into the nearby town because that was still the reason i was out here right now.\n\nSo i found some food, and decided i would in fact check out that sos call. Who knows, maybe they have some food or something i can have?\n\nI met a girl and killed her sisters corpse, this one had red eyes, i wonder if that means anything, i think it does, all of my shots landed thanks to my training on the sign, but it still took almost 4 entire clips to put her down. The girls started following me around now, apparently she was headed for a different town before she and her sister were attacked by other living corpses.\n\nWe ran into another man, he gave us some insulin (the girl turns out to be diabetic, who knew) and offered to help us hold up somewhere, he tells us he knows a thing or two about building, and he'll even gather the supplies himself.\n\nWell not long after, i was just out looking for food and now im lying here bitten and bleeding out quickly. I'm not going any further than this. So i guess this is the end for Joe Wheeler huh? Oh well, lifes a ♥♥♥♥♥ and then you die heh...\n\n\n\nThese were my first about 20 minutes of survivalist, and i have to say its an excellent game, despite its age and cheap price, its excellent and has a very deep gameplay. By this i mean, its not a tps or an fps, or anything of the sorts. Its a very in depth survival game where food, water, sleep and even insulin are all required to live. It has a good learning curve, as long as your not an idiot like me, where your fairly babied here and there, your first two enemies can barely move, and even if they catch you, just tap space and your fine, but your third enemy, is a sprinting zombie who jumps out of nowhere and tackles you, and moves too quickly to aim your gun at properly, but get tackled 4-5 times without getting a shot in and the game says "hey, ♥♥♥♥♥, SIDESTEP" which in turn, dodges the attack and gives you time to aim your gun. This game is really cool and one awesome thing is in the top right corner theres a little window which shows events as they happen, if you swing a punch, you get a full body view of your character swinging said punch, if your talking to someone, the camera alternates between each persons faces. But the game isnt without fault, a strange and unchangable camera angle forces a omewhat top down view which i enjoy, however you cant change it, and id like even a SMALL amount of ability to change it apart from simple 360 degree rotations. And theres also the fact that while tutorial missions do baby you a tad, when theyre done, thats it, zombies come in different levels, green being the lowest, then blue, red and apparently theres a "White super zombie race" each gets progressively stronger and all the tutorial missions are against green and thats it, with a single red but theyre somewhre u can hit them but they cant hit you so that doesnt matter, but i accidentally wandered the wrong way and got instantaneusly mauled to death by a hord of about 15 blues.\n\nBut this game is still amazing, and cheap as dirt, i would have happily payed triple what i did for it just to support the developers. 10/10","July 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I bought the game thinking 'Might as well give it a try'. I played the game on the edge of my chair trying to keep my survivors alive for just another day. I still haven't stopped playing this game(I'm actually trying to complete a quest as i type this).\n\nOverall, this game is a fresh & interesting combination between a classic topdown zombie survival game, Sims & The Walking Dead.\n\nPros:\nNot purely quest-driven. I've played more than my fair share of zombie games that are 'Go get X object, return the object to Y person, get Z reward and progress in the game'. Survivalist does away with the linear quest-driven system & replaces it with a nice 'Go do it if you want to, or if you don't just don't. We're not going to hold anything away from you if you don't'.\n\nIf you're told 'Go and stop this gang' then you also have the choice of assimilating into your group/community instead of just marching in there & murdering everyone\n\nA unique relationship system. Instead of the standard 'i like you, i don't' Survivalist has a twin-axis system of respect and approval. You can make someone do what you want by either making them like you, or fear you. They see you burn their village to the ground single-handedly then they'll fear you, if you save them from being bitten they'll like you.\n\nWell-balanced progressive gamplay that keeps you from becoming too powerful, whilst hard work/dedication/planning pay off greatly\n\nCons:\n40 hours in and I'm yet to find something bad about the game that wasn't caused by oversight or just plain stupidity on my part","March 2, 2015","true","86.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not...\n\nHehe, but even though it's about zombies which has been chewed to the death it bring something that should count the most in games world, playability! And this game has it in abundance! I'll try to review it without spoilers :)\n\nIt's about John Wheeler, some broker dude who did some fine investments in his life that made possible for him to buy a shelter in the desert.. All hell broke loose, he hid there for one year until his supplies run out and decided to get out of bunker..\n\nThat's where you start leading this dude through his adventure. Game is incredible because only one dude made it! And he managed to implement many great aspects like character development, relationships with npc's, trading and even some RTS and building elements!\n\nLike I said, you are John Wheeler, no nonsense dude, who wants to survive zombie outbreak, and (depends of the player decision), achieve his life goal of love/money/power. It has sort of isometric view, game is very fluid, it offers few standard weapons and enemies, and besides outer danger, you have to take care of sleep, hunger and thirst.. So, especially in the beginning, save water and food cans :)\n\nAs you progress through the game, it gives you option to make a settlement, recruit people to join your cause, plant corn, build wells etc.. Interesting part is that you can control everyone who is in your settlement/group, so when Wheeler needs to sleep, you just play with other characters..\n\nAlmost everyone is "expendable", except Wheeler, which gives you much freedom.. Ofc., you can save game anytime, so if you are opsessive like me, you can always do missions without casualties :)..\n\nOfcource, people can leave your camp, based on your actions and their approval of those actions. Some people will approve your violent nature, some won't etc.. Be careful when you recruit people, because if you recruit people from opposing camps, they will attack if they run across eachother regardless of their current "group".\n\nPRO\n- very interesting main story with many intriguing side missions like saving people from zombies, other people, burning stuff, building stuff, finding missing persons, their stuff..\n- great playability and replayability!,\n- easy to use/comprehend inventory and trading systems,\n- very good balance between story and action,\n- 4 player coop online, one player can scavange, one build settlement, one just killing and grinding characters, one doing missions!,\n- almost everything :)\n\nCONS (remember, this game has CONS only if you compare it with some blockbuster games, but remember, one dude made this game, so taken this into account, every CON here is irrelevant)\n- it could use some more items for food or drink, it only has corn and dog food.. And only water for drinking (and wine, but wine is used for increasing relationship status with NPS's)\n- shortness hahahaha, well, game isn't short, it is actually pretty long, but after you finish it, it gives you that feeling "I WANT MORE" hehhe\n\nThis game is a must have, if you want hours of fun and exploaration, action, story telling, if you want to see how world gets on based on your decision (directly and indirectly), i.e. I once expelled one dude from my settlement, gave him gun, few bullets and let him go..\nAbout few hours later, while scavanging, that same dude, now zombified killed two dudes from my group XD. Your actions have very lasting consequences..\n\nBig shout to Bob the P.R Bot, the dude who made this great game (something tells me that it's not his real name :/..\n\np.s. It also offers 4 coop online which is incredible to play!","March 5","true","55.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The story is intriguing and gives you a meaning to the world around you, giving you a reason to move and explore the world instead of just surviving.

This review can change in the next days I keep playing, but at the moment I can say it's a deep game.\n\nAbout the PROS: If you like background stories, there's a lot of microstories as you do  your main quests. As in any other sandbox worth his salt, you can chose to do your quests or just roam for loot and improve your base.\n\nI'm not used at all to play multi-character RPGs so I can say this game makes it easy to control different characters, doing different actions in different parts of the map. That's so enjoyable because you can just ask your stronger man to go and search for heavy supplies for your base while your gardener keeps farming and your firegunner roam killing bandits or doing missions. And you can chose who you control, or you just can take care of them all.\n\nThe AI is pretty good despite some path errors, the zombies are hard enough to beat in numbers and easy enough to kill one by one.\n\nThe freedom to chose your playstyle as bandit, hero, neutral, or whatever is great -a guy wanted me to pay him 75 coins for a cure of the infection, I bribed him with an item 10-15 coins worth, he now wanted me to pay him "just" 73 coins for the cure. I killed him, got a lot of coins and the cure-.\n\nAbout the CONS: I feel there's so little variety of weapons. It doesn's seem like more will be added since every weapon has already a hotkey number 1-9.\n\nThis is not really a negative aspect, but sometimes is hard to end missions cause the guys who give them to you go and fight and sometimes die, so you have to chose between loading the game or keep going without the mission.\n\nToo many ammo. Sometimes you forget it's an apocalypse because since the beggining of the game the mainstory leads you to a weapon storage with 12000 (yes, you did read well) pistol bullets and like 500 shotgun shells and rifle ammo. Anyways you can buy bullets SO cheap. Its true that in the beggining you're not very acurate, and zombies needs more than 1 bullet most of the times, but I like to worry about my ammo when it's about the end of the world, and here you will just shoot like a rambo.\n\nI will edit the review while i keep playing, thx for reading!","May 7, 2015","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After that, the game seems to slow down. It doesn't of course, but while you've got your main guy out exploring, shooting zombies, etc, the girl you pick up sleeps for about two days (and so you can't do anything with her), and the construction guy (no, not Emmett) walks at a snail's pace between your camp and the local hardware store, bringing back a single plank at a time so he can start building walls, shacks, even toilets.\n\nThat said, this is about the only complaint I have about the game. The rest of it is simple (gameplay, not difficulty), intuitive, and fun. Just... While you're exploring, don't forget to save regularly. It's pretty easy to wander out of your 'safe' zones, and if that happens, you're going to be the one seeking breakfast brains.","June 2, 2015","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It contains so much content and gameplay. The RPG system with decisions and reputation works very well (your choices to matter), action is simple and easy to understand, yet extremely entertaining. Society growth and base building is really fun and the storyline is interesting. Food and supplies are scarce and requires effort to gather which makes the survival aspect of the game feel real. Since online co-op mode is on the rise aswell, this game is looking to become one of the better survivalist projects out there in my opinion.\n\nThe only negative thing I can mention about this game is the fact that there are some abusable bugs out there, such as bugs which allows you to gather more supplies than intended. Other than that, I can't really find anything negative.\n\nI really recommend this game to anyone out there who's looking for an interesting indie, society building, survival RPG-game.","May 4","true","62.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198152899150/recommended/340050/","76561198152899150","Cotton Eyed Joe","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198152899150/","381 products in account","Survivalist is an open world, survival RPG where you play as Joe Wheeler, a self-centered businessman who has built a bunker just before the apocalypse with resources sufficient for one year, lived in his bunker during the apocalypse without any connection with the outer world, and finally decided to go out into the wasteland when he got out of resources. He doesn't have the slightest idea about the events happened after the apocalypse, unfamiliar with the surroundings, people and of course zombies.\n\nSkip to the end for TL;DR\nI will start with pointing the best thing about this game: the atmosphere. The feeling of isolation, chaos and depression, which are the outcomes of apocalypse are perfectly reflected. There will be times when you will have tough chocies, times you have to decide between two parties and you can't simply pick the 'evil' out of the sides, as moral values/ethics are simply not valid anymore; in a world where looting is the only way to survive, killing a person is justified by a simple conflict of interest and overall, being strong is the ultimate goal of everyone.\n\nAs humanity has taken a step back from the civilization, there are no laws and no enforcers. People have done what they had to do, in order to increase their chances to survive, they have gathered and started forming groups. There are small civilized settlements which started raising their own crops, outlanders, bandits, looters and all sorts of groups in game.  Now with such a case, a logical human being would find a decent community that shares his/her interests and join them. But Joe Wheeler happens to have a better idea; without knowing absolutely no one in this world and having nothing to offer, he will start building his own settlement.\n\nThis is the goal of this game. To make Joe Wheeler lead the biggest/strongest settlement in the area (i.e. feed his ego). Other than the first two characters who join you within the progress of storyline, people are not willing to leave their current, steady systems and join your newly-founded formation. And neither they are going to do it for the sake of your baby face and well-tailored businessman suit. You have to convince them. People have flexible opinions about you and to make them join your group, you have to act accordingly.  You can either complete their quests, protect them from raids and deal with someone they dislike to make them respect you, or pick the correct approach with your dialogues and bribe them with rare trinkets (e.g. chocolates, wine, books etc.) to make them like you. Only then, you can have enough influence on them to make them join your group.\n\nMap is huge. And it is not empty at all. I need to say that I am really surprised with finding so much content here, as there are various events/characters/loot all around the map and this encourages discovering. Even when it gets really hard with lots zombies around, you know that you'll find something significant in that area and it definitely makes up to your effort.\n\nStory progression is in a way that teaches you the mechanics of the game, which is appropriate as the game has so many things to do and you need to get to the end step-by-step. You also get to recruit people, explore the world and have better equipment with side quests, alongside with getting in the middle of conflicts between the factions and overall the intriguing plot.\n\nAccording to your play style, game almost always allows you to choose between a diplomatic and a violent approach. Every choice you make show it's unique consequence in story progression. While you may find it more beneficial to rock the boat and loot loads of corpses for items, recruiting people instead of killing them makes your group bigger and thus, increases your chance to survive.\n\nThe game has a simple, strategy-game style of base building system. You need to have tools, materials and builders for building. You build houses, barns and wells for the needs of your group; and walls, watchtowers and pillboxes for the protection of your settlement. Protection around the settlement has to be set strategically, as there will be numerous zombie/rebel raids against your settlement and they get more frequent with the increasing population. The game sets a great balance for protection issues. If you assume that you will be perfectly safe after building wooden walls around your settlement, I am afraid you will soon find out how long it takes for a molotov coctail to burn down wood.\n\nProtection is not the only issue. You need resources for your group. While you can usually find plenty of water around, food is not that easy to come by and you will quickly run out at some point. The game introduces another asset here: farming. This is also well implemented; you manage to feed your group with the food you scavenge around until the time you have access to crops/farming and after that, all you need to do is tasking some members of your group with farming and wait.  With more population, the amount of crops you have to plant also increases.\n\nI believe these are enough for convincing people this game is amazing in terms of its RPG and sandbox factors.\n\nShooting mechanics are not hard if you follow some simple rules: stand still, aim and wait for the crosshair, shoot. Spraying is only a waste of bullets. The more you use weapons, you earn experience and get your firearms level up, this allows you to use more weapons and makes you shoot more effectively.\n\nSound effects and graphics are quite good for an indie game; I haven't had any staggers or graphical glitches despite the huge map with various interactive elements.\n\nThe only negative I could think of would be the controls. They are kind of way-out and this may make the game seem tedious first, however I got used to them in my first two hours and understood the way things work, so it's not really a big issue if you are interested in playing the game.\n\nTL;DR\nI am simply amazed by the content I got from this game. Really well-made and fascinating in many aspects. Brilliant as a RPG, a survival, a sandbox and in the end, for this price, this game is a steal. Kudos to the developers for getting it right with their first game. I can't recommend this enough.","March 25","true","28.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

This post-apocalyptic zombie arcade game offers more than you'd actually of expected. I feel like I've made at least a £10 under-payment. There is so much content just wedged in to such an un-renown, outlandish game.\n\nIt lacks polish in the combat, and sometimes it can throw an abundance of haste zombies at you- which can be rather profuse, and irritating. The RPG elements to this game are fantastic, and I've really found myself getting drawn in to Joe Wheeler's character. If you have somebody in your group which is diabetic, you need insulin; if somebody in your group has been bitten, you need to inject yourself with some toxin, which has to be the parallel colour of the zombie's eyes who bit you. There's also a Sims-like command system which works spectacularly.\n\nI'm just getting to a part where you can fortify your base- yes, you build and fortify your own base too. Another feature which isn't intricate, and easy to pick up.\n\nFor £3.99 you can NOT go wrong with Survivalist.\nI'm looking forward to my future endeavours.\nWell done developers for making a zombie game which isn't overhyped, and doesn't suck.","February 4, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It was fairly unique for a zombie game to actually feature infection as a mechanic rather than a plot point, as well as the antidotes for different strains. It's incredibly helpful that you can actually manage the community and assign tasks to survivors, such as lugging cement from a gas station down the road to the bunker until it's all secured in your base.\n\nI think that my only complaint at all about the game has nothing to do with the actual game, but rather that I wish that there was dlc or that the game was workshop enabled. The map itself is huge, but I feel that through either of these the game would receive an entirely new life.","March 15","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's incredibly helpful that you can actually manage the community and assign tasks to survivors, such as lugging cement from a gas station down the road to the bunker until it's all secured in your base.\n\nI think that my only complaint at all about the game has nothing to do with the actual game, but rather that I wish that there was dlc or that the game was workshop enabled. The map itself is huge, but I feel that through either of these the game would receive an entirely new life.","March 15","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only negatives I have for this game is that its LONG, and I mean it. I've currently played about 25 hours of it, and still havent completed it yet, and I'm breezing through the side missions.

It's a really fun, open world game that feels quite unique compared to a lot of zombie games I've previously played.\nThere are plenty of quests to keep you busy and you will also need to build defences at your base to keep looters and undead hordes away. Switching and controlling different characters is fairly straight forward and allows you to multi task with the members of your group with ease. Sometimes leaving group members to do tasks you've given them can get put off due to the character deciding he/she needs to find food/water first before continuing their task even when they're not overly hungry or thirsty. However, I think it's fair to say that this is the biggest problem I have with the game which isn't much of a problem, just a nuisance from time to time. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a simulation zombie game to put a decent amount of time into. To anyone who is interested in the game but not entirely sure on whether to buy the game or not, be sure to try the demo.

The thing I like about it most is the fact that you can control an entire community of people. The trailor didn't necessarily do a good job of showing community so I will talk about that and then tell you some Pros and Cons of the game(there are way more Pros).\nIn the community you have to provide for each and every need that all your survivors have. You need to provide them with water, food, ammo, sleep,insulin (for Alice a person with type 1 Diabetes) and protection. You can farm crops or scavenge nearby towns for food. For water you can make wells or scavenge. For ammo you have to scavenge gun shops. And for sleep you need to make sure you have enough buildings constructed or taken over that provide your members with sleep. Each member has a certain amount of respect and approval for you and if you fail to provide them with these necesseties they will lose approval and respect. There are two ways to recruit people to join you. You can help them and make them like you and they might join, or you can force them to join you by having fun with a bullet and rifle. You can tell your people to be guards, farmers, build things, follow you and help you, medics, scavengers you can even set up a team to explore. These are just the first parts of owning a community but I hope it helped.\nHere are the Pros and Cons\nPros\nYou can control your characters directly or in a control mode\nYou can control each character\nThere is a huge variety in skills and a really cool skill system\nThe game slowly gets harder and harder as you progress\nThe game has a cool zombie system with different strains that are harder\nThe game periodically sends hordes or groups of zombies and looters to attack your base\nI love the missions in the game\nGood online gameplay except for one thing(see Cons)\n\nCons\nGraphics aren't the best\nSometimes glitches will happen when forcing someone to join your community\nIn multiplayer if you get in a big fight against zombies the game will sometimes lag\n\n\noverall I believe survivalist is a very clever and cool game and I really hope this review helped.","May 25","true","33.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I almost feel guilty for buying it at such a low price. I was very pleasantly surprised to learn just how fun and... honestly kind of complex this game is.\n\nPROS:\n\n* Great gameplay. Combat can feel a bit repetitive, but being able to cap a zombie in the leg to prevent the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from jumping you is pretty good. I also really like the skill progression, though it can feel like a grind at times. There's homesteading, zombie shooting, looter shooting, quest taking, micro-management somewhat akin to RTS games, building a huge posse of fellow survivors, exploration... lots of content in this game.\n\n* Content. I'm still kind of baffled just how rich this game is for its price tag. 30 hours in and I still am not done with my first playthrough. I'd say that's pretty impressive. Along the same lines, the RPG elements are pretty solid. I was amused to see that characters respond to just about anything you do to them or others in their community. If you so desired, you could just wiped everyone out with extreme prejudice, or you could be more of a peacemaker and try to recruit as many people as you can... including bandits. I'm somewhere in between. People even remember you being RUDE to them.\n\n\n*Game design. The author of this game clearly went to great lengths to implement depth and replayability. There are three game winning scenarios that the player can choose from, people to save or not save, quests to take or not take, and just the fact that you can't please everyone in the game makes it so that you can easily boot it back up and try a different path.\n\n\n\n-----\n\nCONS:\n\n\nHonestly... I can't think of many serious problems with this game other than a few minor nitpicks, but there are two things that bother me in particular-\n\n\n* Ear-bleeding music. UGH. The soundtrack in this game is just hideous. I've played most of it with it muted. It's a minor gripe, I suppose, but still.\n\n*The allied AI can sometimes be a bit bone-headed... like they may wander away from the path of safety just to make a shortcut (and bumping into zombies and looters along the way), they waste time sometimes by wandering around FOREVER looking for food or water when they could just complete their ♥♥♥♥ing jobs and go back to base to eat and drink.\n\n\n----\n\n\nAll in all, VERY solid game. I highly recommend it. The price tag certainly helps me say that it's worth every penny.","August 5, 2015","true","34.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Fantastic game, with individual character development, tons of potential NPC allies and enemies, expansive map to explore, good story, etc. It goes on sale for a mere couple of bucks, often, which is really just stealing money from the folks who deserve more for a really well made game. If you are on the fence, then spend the few bucks to pick this up; you'll probably be surprised you hadn't discovered it sooner!\n\nPros:\n+Interesting/original spin on the zombie outbreak scenario. Fast zombies suck but are awesome.\n+Lots of NPCS hidden around the desert, mostly in small enclaves to interact with. Hostile humans can often be turned around to become neutral, or even join your group, if you play your cards right.\n+Base building is balanced; the buildings and upgrades give benefits comparable to the work required to construct them.\n+Finite, if generous, quantities of building materials rewards careful selection for base location and smart construction of buildings.\n+Anyone who gets taken by an infected becomes an infected; you'll find former friends and enemies have become the very zombies that are now attacking you!\n+Individual character development, with uncomplicated stats and skills.\n+World changes as you play; NPC enclaves will eventually succumb to wandering bands of bandits and zombies, including side-quest locations and even groups of hostile survivors end up perishing over time.\n+Reasonable graphics, the game has very modest system requirements.\n+Good replay value; it is quite a long game and can be played through several times.\n\nA real nice touch is that the NPC's appear to have the same rules as the player characters; everyone needs food, water, and sleep. If the NPC's that do the farming of an enclave or group die then the other members will start travelling the desert in search of provisions. It also usually leads to the death of everyone else in that group as their members individually run zombies they can't handle. Then they become zombies and help polish off the next desperate survivor who leaves the camp in search of food. The bandit groups might be an exception to this, hostile survivors that cannot be negotiated with, seem to never move and have no resources close by to sustain them. They stay awake for months at a time, with no food or water, the true zombies of the apocalypse!\n\nCons:\n-Character development, while effective, is quite simple. It may be part of the charm but it feels like some lost potential.\n-Base building can be pretty tedious when trying to gather resources from remote locations. Your runners either constantly run to the point of exhaustion(extremely vulnerable to zombies!!!) or walk about at a casual pace.\n-Unable to create groups of runners for salvaging/gathering. Having to select each individual survivor and send them out to collect resources is a nuisance. These survivors all function separately, instead of working as team, out in the field. Lots of times a survivor gets mauled by a couple of zombies that they've encountered while one or two other survivors, also travelling to the same destination, are within a screen's distance and do not go to the aid of their fellow survivor. The only work around I found was to assign guards to each runner, which works, but wastes a lot of carrying potential.\n-As above, you have to micromanage your survivors out in the field. Lone survivors are no match for two or more zombies at a time. Even teams of two, with a dedicated guard, tend to get overwhelmed pretty easily. It wouldn't be much of problem except they tend to be much less effective when AI controlled so you have to be quite vigilant. If your main group is also dealing with an encounter, it is very easy to miss a runner in trouble.\n\nThis is a great game and would easily be worth $20-$25, especially to fans of the genre!

Wounds require bandaging quickly, or you'll bleed to death.  A bite from a zombie requires a speedy shot of antigen, which often isn't available (making a zombie bite the death sentence it ought to be).  Choosing the right balance of equipment with weight limitations is a constant challenge.\n\nBetter Moral Dilemmas: Would you be willing to murder a doctor or a random survivor to steal insulin for a member of your party? Do you have time to work odd jobs to make the gold to buy a shot of insulin to make her last a few more days? Can you accept a survivor into your party knowing that he is an outlaw in a town you frequent?\n\nMultiplayer: Unlike Fallout 4, there is actually a multiplayer mode in this game.  Like Destiny, the multiplayer co-operative  is meant to blend seamlessly into the singleplayer experience.  Unlike Destiny, Survivalist properly executes on this feature.  The chat log is extremely handy.\n\nYou can't go wrong with this game at full prce, or on sale, buy it now!!","May 11","true","9.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Yes? Well, i'm certainly not. This game have zombies and it's a top-down shooter with light crafting and strategy to spice things up.\n\nThe game takes place in the near future, one year after the collapse of civilization. You take the role of John Wheeler, a wealthy L.A. manager, who own a underground bunker in the middle of the desert, filled with food and water for 1 year, in which you took refuge. On the 364 day in he picked up signal for help on his radio, coming from somewhere near by. He goes out to investigate . You find woman named Alice locked, you help her and the rest is up to you to find out. Half way through the game story picks up and starts to get interesting and it have few twists.\n\nUsually in a game like this, the is goal to find out, where the disease started, find a cure or save someone. Here it's not like that. Your first priority is surviving. Some quests will lead to answers. To reach the end of the game, you have complete five objectives: construct certain number and type of buildings, enough food for feeding your people, neutralize all regional treats, find love, have at least one person in your community with max skill level in each of: Fitness, Firearms, Construction, Farming and Medicine.\n\nThe game was first introduce for Xbox Live before landing on the PC platform and it's almost perfect port. The most disappointing thing are the video options. Only fullscreen, resolution and large fonts. Textures are okay, movement of everyone is kind of robotic. All human and zombie characters differ from each other only by the clothes and skin color. In Sound there are only 3 options – sound effects, menu sound and music. But all those things are minor problems, the game is indie and it's awesome!\n\nHowever, the developer did make mouse and keybord controls perfect. So many variations in Controls menu. I was really surprised by this. And of course all keys can be rebind. You can even play with a controller if you like.\n\nNext is gameplay. Here is where the game shines a lot. I'll start with the base. After rescuing Alice, you find out she have diabetes and she need constant supply of insulin. Through the hole game you will either have to buy it or searching for abandoned pharmacies. You and Alice are heading to the nearest town and there Isham, another survivor, will join you and decide John's bunker will be your base. Here you will find the strategy part and it's giving orders to your people. And what are they? To bring supplies to your base and build. So, Isham is constructs, Alice is carrying and you complete quests. In the beginning you can only build shack outhouse, wooden and wire fences, gates and wooden watch tower. After gaining few levels in Construction it will unlock more things – barn, well, concrete tower and pillbox. All buildings will improve the life of your people. Don't make wrong conclusions. For the most part this is  action oriented game, with nice story and it's not another with only crafting and surviving.\n\nThe game wants from you to build certain number and type of buildings. That way you will have places for everyone and everything. More people you have, more buildings you need. They are used to store supplies and for people to sleep. Of course, you need to defende your base. That's way you have watch towers and pillboxes. When someone is inside them, it's more hard to shoot them.\n\nOne extremely important elemnt of the game is feeding your community and supplying them with water. In the first few hours they will eat cans and chips and water you can be found in dead bodies, buildings and water towers. But there is easier way for providing  both of them. After the mentioned hours, you can plant crops. This way you will have constant supply of food. And if you don't want to search for water, build a well. It's also used for watering the crops.\n\nYou can take control of every single person in your community and make them do what the game allows you to do. I was quite surprised by the AI. When you give an order, there is no need to babysit them. When someone is thirsty or hungry, he goes where you store food and water. If don't have them in your base, he/she is searching for you. If he wants to sleep, he goes to a building alone and after it's done, continues his task from where he stoped . Builder don't have enough materials? He goes to the nearest dicovered place to get them. Sometimes suppliers encounter 1 or 2 zombies and they deal with them without a problem. You don't need to take control over them, unless they are big group. If this is the case – you better rum. I didn't rely entirly on the AI and you don't have to. While people sleep, I feed them and give them water and supplies. Sometimes I take control if something attack them. Simple, but effective.\n\nEvery single person have 5 skills to develop: Fitness, Firearms, Constuction, Farming and Medicine. Level 5 is the top, but not all characters can, they are just limited. Only when using certain skill, you gain experience for it. For example – using a weapon will increase Firearms. There is artificial way for gaining levels. You will find books for the respective skill and the only requirement is to carry them all the time.\n\nOn the right side is shown the person you control, mini map (there is big map also), what weapon he uses, does he have bulletproof vest and fatigue. If you run for too long, the character is getting tired and you better stop on one place or just walk, because if you run it to a zombie or looter, it will be hard to fight them.\n\nThere are few stats, that you need to keep an eyeon them. They are hunger, thirts, for smokers lung cancer, for Alice glucose level. When you walking or running without a break, people don't eat or drink water, so keep in mind to stop for e brief moment.\n\nIf you want to get somewhere quickly or people sleep and you don't have anything to do, speed up the game. But there is a risk. When you are in this mode and you control someone and zombie attack the character, you may not push it on time and this have consequences.\n\nThe map is huge and dangerous, but there are friendly communities. From them you will get quests. Most of them are just killing looters. All communities have traders. From them you can buy a lot of stuff or sell. The currency here is gold. You will get it from searching buildings, cars, bodies and completing quests. The first thing you need to buy is backpack. It will let you carry more stuf with you. The bigger backpack and higher level of Fitness will allow to take more things with you.\n\nYou have total of 6 weapons – pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper, RPG and Molotov. The shooting is as follows: you hold the right mouse button to lock-on target. For more accurate shots you have to stay in one place for the crosshair to turn red. But if you are not moving, you are sitting duck. Bigger the Firearms level, fastert the crosshair turns red. It's fun to shoot with every weapon. They don't have recoil, but even if you have highest level of Firearms, doesn't guarantee every single shot to hit the target. Don't expect to get RPG right from the beginning. You will start with pistol. For him it's easy to find ammo, but it gets progressively harder to find for the better weapons. While the target is lock-on, you can choose with the mouse to shoot it in the legs, torso or head. They have their advantages and disadvantages. The head is harder to be hit, but guarantees quick kill. The torso is easy to hit, but you do less damage. Shooting the legs leads zombies to limp and generally slow them down.","May 9, 2015","true","35.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Oddly the buttong you use to kick can cause the same problem.\n\nThe quests will often beeline you into choices you never wanted to make. Such as trying to play as good person and being forced to be greedy for gold.\n\nThe crafting and inventory lacks any depth at all, with crafting being basically an abandoned concept.\n\nPlaying it is constantly frustrating and all of its good points have glaring problems.\n\nI honestly don't think there is one positive feature about this game that doesn't come with an annoying downside. Unless you count being cheap.\n\nDon't buy the game until the developer learns how to make it accesible at least.

Unfortunately, the controls and interface are non-intuitive in the extreme. The player wanders about with no sense of direction or purpose, and has little interaction with the world around him. Enemies overtake you in an unpredictable manner, and you must "aim" at them on the one hand, and then "attack" them using an altogether separate control system. I'd really enjoy a game like this if it were fun, but I'd recommend better-designed "post-apocalyptic" games. Not to specifically "plug" a game, but a hint as to the name would be "the resulting devastation after nuclear war that has an amazing half-life." Another hint is that you're raised in a vault safely underground and leave to see what the outside world looks like. Even if this game were on a terrific sale, steer clear of it.

I'm really not sure what they were thinking trying to combine a "state of decay" like game with infected zombies running at you from the dark fog in packs of 12 at 100mph when your sight range is about 25ft. You spend most of your time just trying to side step their massive jump lunges and kicking them off one after another when they do get you. It quite literally gets to the point of annoyance and repetitiveness so quickly, that I pretty much shut it off an hr in. I mean in what "fast moving zombie" movie like "28days" or "World War Z" do you see people carelessly just strolling down to the local store to collect chicken wire one piece at a time with the delusional goal of eventually building a fence that will stop this type of zombies. I mean come on....all zombie fans know the difference between the slow zombies and the fast zombies, along with how different survival tactics would be...well, except the people making this game apparently.

After fixing the issue (The developer was awesome in helping with this). I started off playing coop. It was a great time with my wife who decided to micromanage my community. I absolutely love the possibilities here in this game. You can be a lone gun and only play for yourself (no time limits or urgencies except for the beginning) or you can build a huge community and deal with everyone's problems (pretty realistic). If you enjoy micromaging things than this is your game. If you enjoy scary post apocalyptic settings than this is your game.\n\nIn all honesty I have played the "big box" games that cost $60 on release and none of them compare to this game which is still being developed. The story behind any of the paths you choose is astounding for a choose your own adventure sort of game. Survivalist really hit the nail on the head.\n\n10/10 would blow up felipe's house with a rocket launcher again.\n\n10/10 would run my 60 member community into the enemy base with just pistols and molotovs.\n\n3/10 would want to meet a diabetic in the real world apocolypse","April 13","true","24.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","7"

You'll be halfway through the run when the party memeber decides to disregard your orders, exit the bunker into a mob of zombies while unarmed and estentially getting eaten, thus ending your game.\nThe savegame function is a joke:  Hey, your party memeber just committed suicide ... np quickload .... whoops ... the autosave dinged, literally, right as the partymemeber enters the middle of the mob.  At least you can watch her/him get eaten over and over and over ....\nHorrible, un-wieldly dialouge, inventory and command menus.  Just ... ridiculous.\n\nThere's about 20 other reasons why this game sucks.  I can appreciate an indie game like this, especially for $5 ... but it's just horrible.\n\nFun idea; terrible execution.  Just give me your $5 and save yourself the hassle of this game.","March 5, 2015","false","5.8"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

I played it at last because... it updated.\n\nTop-down combat that's not very good. You can't see zombies before they're running at you. Your companions get to do gun combat. YOU get to lie under a zombie and kick it off. Since you have to shoot things to get better at shooting things...\n\nI was hoping, from the other reviews, that there was some reason to keep playing. But action combat with RPG stats in this case is purely translating to "you are bad at this, and it's the part of the game that isn't walking". And I thought, from all the positive reviews that the writing would make up for the graphics. It doesn't. I'm facing characters that are more lifeless than the ♥♥♥♥ing zombies, who at least have expressions.\n\nThe game also does a thing I really can't stand. It's the opposite of handholding... blindfolding. You have to advance the story to gain the power to hit f4 and bring up the map. That's not nice. It means if I try to explore at all, I'm going to get lost, and probably get someone killed.\n\nI could probably forgive the hell out of a lot of these things if it were 2D... and/or turn-based instead of some anti-fun action combat where the game unhelpfully suggests dodging to the "side" while you're DOING that, but when the zombie's close, wasd with lock-on means you're barely moving.","April 17","false","0.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

A quest/mission need you to travel to several places and it takes a hella long time just to walk your character over there.\nFourth, your backpack literally has no room! You can barely pack anything in your pack, after you pack things like ammo, gun badage, some food, water. You are pretty much full in your backpack and you have to throw things away for loots you find.\nFifth, the directions of the quests in this game is extremely ♥♥♥♥ing confusing! I don't know if it is just me, but the directions are very unclear and hard to follow. Sometimes glitch happens and you don't get missions done or your mission SOMEHOW disappear.\nSixth, you might think it is fun to build a fortress to defend against zombie, yeah that it fun BUT IT TAKES ♥♥♥♥ING YEARS TO BUILD ONE. You have to get supplies and transfer supplies to your base, with a backpack and toolbox so that takes ♥♥♥♥ing years and your backpack\nI do not recommand this game, i would 10/10 refund this game. This game was fun in the beginning but because of how confusing it was and how long it takes to do stuff is just boring,","June 14, 2015","false","2.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

There are is very poor crafting system, no forging, tree cutting, mining, and there are not too many different weapons : Pistol, shotgun,Smg,Sniper,molotov,and i think RPG.( haven't seen Rpg yet)\n\nAnd you know what? I really missed Ai(people) faction wars, they just stand in their bases and only farmers growing crops and thats it. By the way only corns? I dont want to eat in post apocalyptic world only corns. I want potatoes, apples, bananas, grains, carrots and ect.\n\nEdited: Thats why from 10 i give only 7.\n7/10 (and the game still needs co-op)\n\n\n+ One more thing after i almost completed the game...

After a while, you begin to constantly adapt to the ever changing world that is Survivalist, making choices in power or money, life or love.\n\nThe story-line can be edited to many different outcomes in the mysterious choices of our three protagonists that could change as the tides turn. It could be five, ten maybe hundreds of characters that build the story of this game.\n\nIf you could just not see the negative reviews, they don't really make that much sense. Yes, the game will expand and take a bigger shape in zombie survival and it is much better than buying a hamburger with somem fries and drink for 5$.\n\nTrust me, after a little, you will not regret the choice. And if its only because of the tragic downfalls in the story, then let me tell you, I know, it can get sad...","February 14, 2015","true","24.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","3"

I thought it would be some stupid childish game BUT I read all the other reviews and figured what the hell, for $6 im gonna give this game a shot. All I can say is, this is a good $6 well spent. Yeah the graphics arent much, but for the price they are good enough and actually the graphics really arent that bad, they could be worse. I may only have 6 hours on record but ive enjoyed every minute. There is ALWAYS something to do, the game keeps you busy whether its killing zombies and looters, building your own community, or going on mission after mission. Another thing that shocked me was how friggen HUGE the map is. Ive done alot of exploring in my 6 hrs of game time and Ive only scratched the surface of the map, WOW. In sum, this game is 110% worth the price, Im actually suprised its not more $$. Its better than some games Ive paid way more money for a whole lot less.

But that said, its still not going to be  a game that everyone enjoys. The game is more focused on community building than combat, theres several structures and defensive structures you can build....although i could see the game being ALOT better with more choices in the future. Alot of people hate on the graphics, but remember its a top down indie game.....and your only paying $5 for it. The combat can be a little repetitive....and lacking in weapons (aside from fist there is only like 6 weapons i think). But like i said its more focused on building a small community and recruiting survivors to join ur community. The game can get a lil fustrating having one of the main characters being a type 1 diabetic and CONSTANTLY needing insulin which often u have to complete some fetch and kill missions to get. But your free to off her, or send her off into the wilderness alone at any time u choose, and still be able to complete the game. You loose a lil bit of the story and background....but you can still do it. The game can have some wcked replayablity since you can build anywhere....start a war with any of the other communitys or make different choices on who you want to help / kill. All in all it has plenty of flaws but way worth the $5 price tag.\n\n\n-Cons:\n-Somewhat repetitive combat\n-The feels you get when you off one of the main characters\n-Feels slightly lacking in building options and weapons\n-Horrendously repetitive music\n-No multiplayer currently\n\n-Pros:\n-An excellent game for anyone who enjoys city builders\n-Good replayabilty, if you enjoy the game at all\n-Very Resonable price tag\n-Runs extremely smoothly\n-Very easy to learn the game\n-Complete freedom to play / build wherever and however you want\n-Random attacks by hordes of zombies, and gangs of looters keeps the game from being way to overly easy","February 10, 2015","true","65.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have paid more for games that are much worse with less content.\n\nThe only thing that I would like to see change here is to have a low respawn rate in the areas that you have explored, or possibly some sort of zombie migration where zombies would migrate from outside the map into the cleared out areas.  I have noticed what seems to be an incidental zombie appearing once in a while in areas that I have cleared, but it is not enough to even make a slight challange.\n\nCurrently the only respawning that I have seen has been from the semi random events where zombie packs or looters detect your tracks in any town that you have explored.  This is a fairly nice feature but it is really too easy to deal with them under most situations.\n\nOdd things:\nZombies can't break down wood walls or fences.\nThe green zombies are not a threat at all once you have upgraded your stats a couple of points.\n\nMy Easy Game:\nI restarted my game a couple of times once I figured out how the game play worked and finally found my first sniper rifle.  First thing I did was to take my bare handed main char and hunt down the green zombies, working my way towards a location where I knew a fitness book was availible with only greens around.  By the time I went back to the totorial I had 2 stars in Fitness and 1 Fitness book which made me completely immune to greens and fairly good against blues.  I then went and grabbed both the secondary characters and grabbed the easiest sniper rifle and then finished the tutorial.\n\nFrom there I would just use the Sniper rifle to explore and a shotgun to kill.  Anytime I had to take care of looters I would do head shots and one hit kill them from beyond their range.  The most problematic things so far in the game are Looters in towers which give them extra range, and white zombie hoards.\n\nBy the end of the first day I had 2-3 in both fitness and firearms for both the MC as well as the secondary Girl, while the third guy was used to act as the person who did construction.  I also pushed fitness for him as it was valuable for the few times that he went into combat as well as for increasing the carry capacity.\n\nMy current game has 9 characters with the map about half uncovered as well as all the main locations explored.  Additionally I have not once been bitten by a zombie so the antigen have not been of any value to me.  While the High end sniper ammo is not all that plentiful the shot gun and assult rifle is, not to mention about 70k of pistol ammo which is great for those you have manning towers.  This being the case the only one that carries a sniper rifle is my active character for when I am either exploring or when I am needing to take down looters.  If I could instruct my non active characters in combat behavior than I could see spreading out the sniper rifles.\n","February 10, 2015","true","54.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well there're three main aspects that you need to pay attention with to keep you alive, hunger, thirst, and sleep deprivation. There's an additional aspect for sickness. There're skills as well. You can level it up if you use its tool often. Also you can level it up by using magazine. What I liked is the skills' level will be down if you get shot but they will be recovered eventually. The combat is okay. I like the way you can aim the head, body, or legs individually based on your skill with your weapon.\n\nI don't want to rate the story because it's not finish yet but what I dislike is the beginning of the story because it's ridiculous. Some people may notice that the girl can climb up the fence and save her sister, also why her sister brought the key? I dislike the UI, especially the font but it's pretty identical to indie game so it's quite okay. The animations for walking and sprinting are really weird.\n\nI shocked by its musics. Totally different with the atmosphere of post-apocalyptic. But the musics make me enthusiastic.\n\nDon't look at my gameplay stats because I played this game about 20 hours.","February 11, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Alot of people hate on the graphics, but remember its a top down indie game.....and your only paying $5 for it. The combat can be a little repetitive....and lacking in weapons (aside from fist there is only like 6 weapons i think).

The game can get a lil fustrating having one of the main characters being a type 1 diabetic and CONSTANTLY needing insulin which often u have to complete some fetch and kill missions to get. But your free to off her, or send her off into the wilderness alone at any time u choose, and still be able to complete the game. You loose a lil bit of the story and background....but you can still do it. The game can have some wcked replayablity since you can build anywhere....start a war with any of the other communitys or make different choices on who you want to help / kill.

I have paid more for games that are much worse with less content.\n\nThe only thing that I would like to see change here is to have a low respawn rate in the areas that you have explored, or possibly some sort of zombie migration where zombies would migrate from outside the map into the cleared out areas.  I have noticed what seems to be an incidental zombie appearing once in a while in areas that I have cleared, but it is not enough to even make a slight challange.\n\nCurrently the only respawning that I have seen has been from the semi random events where zombie packs or looters detect your tracks in any town that you have explored.  This is a fairly nice feature but it is really too easy to deal with them under most situations.\n\nOdd things:\nZombies can't break down wood walls or fences.\nThe green zombies are not a threat at all once you have upgraded your stats a couple of points.\n\nMy Easy Game:\nI restarted my game a couple of times once I figured out how the game play worked and finally found my first sniper rifle.  First thing I did was to take my bare handed main char and hunt down the green zombies, working my way towards a location where I knew a fitness book was availible with only greens around.  By the time I went back to the totorial I had 2 stars in Fitness and 1 Fitness book which made me completely immune to greens and fairly good against blues.  I then went and grabbed both the secondary characters and grabbed the easiest sniper rifle and then finished the tutorial.\n\nFrom there I would just use the Sniper rifle to explore and a shotgun to kill.  Anytime I had to take care of looters I would do head shots and one hit kill them from beyond their range.  The most problematic things so far in the game are Looters in towers which give them extra range, and white zombie hoards.\n\nBy the end of the first day I had 2-3 in both fitness and firearms for both the MC as well as the secondary Girl, while the third guy was used to act as the person who did construction.  I also pushed fitness for him as it was valuable for the few times that he went into combat as well as for increasing the carry capacity.\n\nMy current game has 9 characters with the map about half uncovered as well as all the main locations explored.  Additionally I have not once been bitten by a zombie so the antigen have not been of any value to me.  While the High end sniper ammo is not all that plentiful the shot gun and assult rifle is, not to mention about 70k of pistol ammo which is great for those you have manning towers.  This being the case the only one that carries a sniper rifle is my active character for when I am either exploring or when I am needing to take down looters.  If I could instruct my non active characters in combat behavior than I could see spreading out the sniper rifles.\n","February 10, 2015","true","54.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well there're three main aspects that you need to pay attention with to keep you alive, hunger, thirst, and sleep deprivation. There's an additional aspect for sickness. There're skills as well. You can level it up if you use its tool often. Also you can level it up by using magazine. What I liked is the skills' level will be down if you get shot but they will be recovered eventually. The combat is okay. I like the way you can aim the head, body, or legs individually based on your skill with your weapon.\n\nI don't want to rate the story because it's not finish yet but what I dislike is the beginning of the story because it's ridiculous. Some people may notice that the girl can climb up the fence and save her sister, also why her sister brought the key? I dislike the UI, especially the font but it's pretty identical to indie game so it's quite okay. The animations for walking and sprinting are really weird.\n\nI shocked by its musics.

I enjoy how difficult it can be and how you can feel the danger. Another  thing I like is all of the added mechanics. The ability to customize the layout of your base and choose the best defense scheme is a great addition. Although this isnt the most immersive game, such is State of Decay in my opinion, it is a well designed and thought through game which i truly enjoy. Now the downers in the game.

A couple of them went missing along the way and I couldnt' find them.\n\nInitially I thought this was a bug and contacted the dev (who responded VERY quickly and went to a lot of effort to help me).  After sending my save game the dev had a look and told me the location of a few guys still waiting around that I had to track down.

The progression; story, character, and gameplay!\n\nCons:\nSingle player.. which may or may not be a big deal. The insulin thing.. I won't spoil anything; but it makes it feel a lot less sandbox-y. Lack of character customization.

There are a lot of great things about the game and there are some things that could have been done much better.\nFirst the pros:\nThe storyline and content of the game are impressive. With a variety of win conditions that allow players to decide what type of person Joe Wheeler wants to become in the post apocalyptic nightmare that is his new life. It also has a plethora of recruitable NPC's which have their own backstories and personalities.\n\nThe combat system is straight forward and as you increase your abilities you get more ways to ensure that in a fight you're the last one standing. The fact that your characters can be infected makes fights with the horde all that more dangerous since one bite and you better start running for some anti-gen otherwise get ready to lose one of your companions and be in danger of losing even more when they finally turn.\n\nOf course with a large cast of characters you're going to need more than just a small bunker in order to keep them all together. This leads into the construction system which is similar to combat in that the higher your level the more things you can do. Sure you can craft yourself a wooden gate but, if you want a watchtower you got to have the skills before you can actually build it.\n\nThe game gives you a small tutorial though you have to complete it in a certain time limit if you want one of the characters to stay alive. It introduces you to all of the basic skills in the game but, does allow for some trial an error (no complete hand holding but, enough of a hand to know what you're doing.)\n\nOne of the more unique takes on it has to do with the female lead. Since she's a type 1 diabetic she'll need insulin for the entire game if you want to keep her alive throguh it. This  allows for insight on exactly how difficult a post-apocalyptic world would be on those with poor health conditions. It also gives a sense of urgency to you depending on if you want to keep her alive or not.\n\nAs far as the graphics go it's not excellent but, when you take into account the game was developed by one person it's much higher quality then certain games done by teams.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the con's there are quite a few but, mostly things that just required more work rather then actual demerits.\n\nFirst the Ally AI is fairly shoddy even if those characters are profecient in weapons they don't usually use the tactical skills that they have acquired (IE: no head shots or knee capping) in command mode they will either run full speed until their fatigue bar is full or they will walk at a normal pace. Unlike a player who would mix running with letting the fatigue bar lower after a while.\n\nBoth of these can be reworked by messing with the AI however the important one (for survival sake in roming) so that a character will be told to "run" until the fatigue gauge is  at a certain level before going back to a walking pace.\n\nFor consturction there is a far too little selection in the amount  of things you can build. A few different style of shaes would be nice or being able to set up automated defenses.\n\nNext, Farming. The farming system is fairly convoluted. First it takes several days before what you plant actually grows. Also it doesn't tell you when there is food ready at your camp so the farmer ends up hording it. The fact that the plants tend to blend into the ground doesn't help much either.\n\nRaising your skills- Even though you can get a character that doesn't mean their stats are perfect. However raising the skill of a single character takes a long of time and the game doesn't really give directions on how skill gain experience (other than the obvious of "using them increases skills)\n\nFinally the last major issue is in combat or rather "ranged combat" If you're in a fight with a set of ranged enemies it's most likely not going to end well. Even with a bulletproof vest all it will do is protect from some of the damage as you get turned into swiss cheese. Fights can be won or lost on a dime when it comes to facing human eponents\n\nAll in all I highly recommend this game in spite of it's faults because the game is very fun and gives a realistic view of what would happen if the "zombies" infested the planet. The only big problems are less about the actual game and more about the gameplay itself an how it could have done something better.\n\n\nFinal score 8/10","March 27","true","81.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's ok at first, but it needs some vast improvement before i play again.\n\nI enjoyed the soundtrack at first, but when you roam around for long periods of time the same 3 loops over and over again start to get dull (and quite annoying).\n\nThe gunplay feels ok at best, but it mostly comes down to how much ammo you have, not how much damage a gun does or how skilled you are.\n\nThe base building is a joke, as you have to have someone that's skilled as a mechanic to even carry THE SUPPLIES for building a base back home! Why would i need to how how to use barbed wife and planks to carry the bloody things around?!?\n\nWhile i enjoy the lack of voice acting, the dialogue is mediocre and the characters feel as bland and lifeless as the undead they are fighting off. The least you could do is give each character a personalty, as they aren't randomly generated and you will run into the same people time and time again.\n\nI also feel that the game forces you along certain paths, and here's an example of what i mean: I was doing a quest for someone at one of the forts, she wanted to go see some guy she left at a police station. I liked the guy better then i liked her, as he seemed pretty polite and would make a better addition to my group. So i shot her and recruited the guy. I saved in a different slot and started my way back to my base. Half way home my people at my bunker kept getting killed. So i set the main guy on the course for home and switched back to the carpenter at my base. Turns out, the people from the fort of the woman i shot sent a death squad to my base. It may sound logical at first, but i was halfway across the damn map when i shot her! HOW ARE THEY GOING TO KNOW?!? It wasn't even a little while after either, it was right when it happened! Unless you're armed to the teeth, you are going to get annihilated. So i you even stray a little of the path the game thinks you should go on, you get severely punished.\n\nOver all, it's a mediocre survival game with decent potential, but poor execution. I'll give this game another shot down the line to see if it is improved, but in it's current state, i strongly reccomend spending your money elsewhere.","October 27, 2015","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No special zombies, yup, no bloaters, screamers, animalistic ones, nothing that goes beyond the realm of common sense and a need to artificially make the game more challenging. There's only time you have to get an antidote before you join the population of the undead, including the white strain, which is immediate death.

Humanity is sick and you have to make hard decisions to get through the story line, so it should be.\n\nI like the idea of your partner protagonists having illnesses that need attention, however if I have anything negative to say, the search for insulin is the driving force of the game, I think the game would have served better with more driving forces as it stops you from really taking in the environment whilst you're rushing about from camp to camp, doing the evil deeds of others just to get some medicine.\n\nHonestly though, this is a fabulous game for the price and even if you don't like it, you've spent lunch on it, so it's not much of a loss.","June 3, 2015","true","37.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ability to customize the layout of your base and choose the best defense scheme is a great addition.

Needless to say they died anyway and I no longer cared...)\n\n- Combat became stupid once I figured out what to do, which involved:\n- Infected = side step them when they come running and dive at you, or press space as soon as they tackle you, wait to get a lock on them, and aim at their legs, then  shoot them, confirm that you slowed them, if there are many, thin their numbers with headshots, then switch to your fists (to save ammo) and run up an hit them and then retreat, repeat until dead.\n- Looters = have a shotgun run up in their face, as quickly as possible, and shoot them as fast as you can... they seem to out range you, and they deffinately lock on faster than you do (Sniping them might work, but as of writing this, I have found tons of sniper ammo, and been shot by snipers, but I have yet to loot one)\n\nAll this aside, it is kinda fun, but I wouldn't recomend unless you can get it really cheap.","August 29, 2015","false","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The base building especially since you can set up literally anywhere on the map. Some places are easier than others due to proximity of resources but if you want to build a base off in the corner of some canyon or ontop of a hill with only one or two entry points that would be easy to defend you can.\n\nCombat is fast, though predictable. Each fight basically comes down to trying to keep your stamina high enough to knock away Zombies that grapple you while trying to aim at legs to make them stop running or heads to just kill them quicker. One thing I don't like is there's basically no melee option, the only weapons are guns and there is a limited amount of ammo available even from traders but to be fair it's a hell of a lot, more than enough to finish the story even if you take it slow.\n\nYou can recruit as many people as you want and build your base as large as you want, your choice between sticking with a small group that's easy to manage or recruiting everyone possible and having a massive compound with farms as far as the eye can see. The advantage to the latter is you can bring a bunch of people with you and totally overwhelm any opposition. I would have liked to see an option to just join one of the other groups instead of always having to fend for yourself though.\n\nOut of stamina and get bit? If you have the correct cure for the strain of Zombie that bit you then you're fine, if not you better hope you can find someone who has it in time or that character dies when the infection meter fills up. It adds a bit more challenge and an actual reason to be extra careful when exploring.\n\nThe other thing I really didn't like was the whole type 1 diabetes thing for one of the characters. I mean, sure, you could just forget about hunting for insulin and let her die right away and not have to deal with it but then you miss out on some very nice free skillups and some story.\n\nAll in all it's a fun game and worth the couple bucks, especially if you get it on sale.","September 20, 2015","true","67.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It could also do with some more construction options, as well as more use of insulin, there being only 1 character who uses it just makes it a pain in the butt to get it when you could just kill the character off. It also needs a changing map, the same map over and over again gets kinda boring. I know, I know, I've only been saying bad things so far, but I can't really name all of the great things about this game. Overall, this is a great game with some kinks, but has tons of potential, eventhough the game is finished besides for a patch or 2 after this time.

The progression; story, character, and gameplay!\n\nCons:\nSingle player.. which may or may not be a big deal. The insulin thing.. I won't spoil anything; but it makes it feel a lot less sandbox-y. Lack of character customization. The only thing I wish I could change about the game is that characters, traits and scenarios be a bit more random so that each playthrough could be as amazing as the first.\n\nIn conclusion:\nA lot of other zombie, survival, or zombie-survival titles will not mete the itch quite as thoroughly as this one, and for less than it costs to eat at Subway...

Needless to say they died anyway and I no longer cared...)\n\n- Combat became stupid once I figured out what to do, which involved:\n- Infected = side step them when they come running and dive at you, or press space as soon as they tackle you, wait to get a lock on them, and aim at their legs, then  shoot them, confirm that you slowed them, if there are many, thin their numbers with headshots, then switch to your fists (to save ammo) and run up an hit them and then retreat, repeat until dead.\n- Looters = have a shotgun run up in their face, as quickly as possible, and shoot them as fast as you can... they seem to out range you, and they deffinately lock on faster than you do (Sniping them might work, but as of writing this, I have found tons of sniper ammo, and been shot by snipers, but I have yet to loot one)\n\nAll this aside, it is kinda fun, but I wouldn't recomend unless you can get it really cheap.","August 29, 2015","false","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel like there should be another area becuase you are blocked of from leaving where you are there should be an update or even a DLC where you can leave or travel to a new area spread your influnce there and bring people back to your community. I feel like they should add more guns into it , but if they don't I am fine with the same ones anyways. I would a also like there to be a community that is a US base and that the army is their trying to work on a cure but they take people from their communties to do test on them tp weaponize the infected people and you have to stop them and leading you to becomng the best community and having high respect because you saved them.

As many others have pointed out; it's definitely worth the very low price.\n\n\nPros:\nProject Zomboid-esque freedom with a touch of the sims thrown in. The game is a legitimate free, open sandbox. The backstory, characters, and world are all well thought out. Controls are very straight forward, and the learning curve isn't too brutal or too casual. The progression; story, character, and gameplay!\n\nCons:\nSingle player.. which may or may not be a big deal. The insulin thing.. I won't spoil anything; but it makes it feel a lot less sandbox-y. Lack of character customization. The only thing I wish I could change about the game is that characters, traits and scenarios be a bit more random so that each playthrough could be as amazing as the first.\n\nIn conclusion:\nA lot of other zombie, survival, or zombie-survival titles will not mete the itch quite as thoroughly as this one, and for less than it costs to eat at Subway...

I definitely appreciated that and it's worth mentioning.  I didn't come across any bugs or glitches though it did leave some things to be desired.  The AI seemed to work well for this game.  The basic concepts of survival was also fun, as were the quests.  The graphics are simple but worked for this game rather well, same with the interface.  I kept my community fairly small which I did prefer, it can quickly become a micromanaging nightmare after 10-15 members.\n\nThough the combat system was simple, I didn't like the heightened speed during combat.  Dying was so common and random during fighting with other "humans" you really had to save a lot and reload if the outcome wasn't desired.  Fighting the infected was only annoying if running on fast-forward, since you'd easily get bitten in a second even with fast response.  Again emphasizing on saving frequently.  Also not sure about the replay value but I expect to give it a try.  It felt quite linear the first run through.  Victory conditions are kinda lame and winning was a bit of a let down as well.  There's quite a few quests, I think every person has a "job" for you to do that increases your relation with them and their community.\n\nOverall the good does outweigh the bad in this one.

It could also do with some more construction options, as well as more use of insulin, there being only 1 character who uses it just makes it a pain in the butt to get it when you could just kill the character off. It also needs a changing map, the same map over and over again gets kinda boring. I know, I know, I've only been saying bad things so far, but I can't really name all of the great things about this game.

I'm 42 hours into it and not yet near the end. At least I don't think so. I'm the type that likes to take my time and explore slowly, finding everything. This game has a lot to explore and you can pretty much pick your own pace, at least until you run out of insulin which hasn't been a problem so far.\n\nI found the game challenging at first, mainly because I didn't understand the dodging mechanic and I didn't realize all the options that are available to you. There are a lot of things at play here and they are not obvious at first but once you understand how things work you begin to see the simple genius behind the design. I'm only just now realizing different ways use the command interface to multitask my group far beyond simply fetching supplies.\n\nThe story is interesting and the characters have just enough individualism that I know who I like and who I send out to fetch things with low ammo and no escort :) The world feels real enough as you see NPCs in other communities relying on each other for food, bandages, water, etc.\n\nMy favorite example of NPC behavior was when I had a fist fight in a small camp of looters. After the fight, my opponent was bleeding but nobody in the camp had any bandages left. He went running off and I followed him. He made it to an abandoned car, got bandages, and stopped his bleeding. But he then ran into a zombie and got infected. He ran back to his camp asking his people for antidote but turned into a zombie before he could get help. I gained respect from the people in the camp by helping them kill him :)\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.

I think it works on some games that allow you to build a fortress and wepons and make a life out of what you got,  but to just fight ,dig , fight and repeat this over and over is a waist of time.  A goal is always the reason to go on in life even if its a game.  NOW as for this game it has a GOOD STORY, its fun but it is buggy.  The chacters do not heal even when sleeping and fatigue and heal takes forever so another waist of time. You may not have a life out side of gaming but most of the world does and i what to play and have fun not sit around and wait.   A lot of frustration is understanding the level ups as you go, with no guide built in showing the characters leveling up bar menu and other menus are missing or i have not seen this help menu on menu bar....

For the price, this game is a must buy for the zombie suvivalist lovers.  I would like to add that this game offers more than a game made by a major company.  Not only is the story very well written, but the attention to detail in characters, traits, base building, and weapons is top notch.  And what makes this game even more worth it?  The developer is a true developer.  The developer watches the forums not judt on steam, but other sites too.  And not only do they watch the forums, but answers and responds to the posts.  That right there is what makes this game worth it.  This game is a 10/10.  Look every single game will have a fault to it, some with many more than others.  But with what you can tell is that the developer put a lot into this game.  And I will be one of the first to buy the sequel.\n\n\nPROS:\nCharacter development\nCharacter story\nGraphics are great for this game\nNot grinding\nAble to task one community member to build while others farm, scavange, trade, etc\ndiplomacy\ngood trade system\nweapons\nbase building\nenviremntal hazards in the game from starving to roaming zombie/looter packs\netc etc\n\nCons:\nNone that are game breaking for me personally.\n\nAll in all, this game is a gem for the price.  It is worth it.  Great game.","November 7, 2015","true","36.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csgocali/recommended/340050/","csgocali","caliHD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csgocali/","23 products in account","Okay, so I was hunting around Steam for a relatively cheap game because I had $5 left in my wallet and wanted to make the most of it.\n\nI sure did.\n\nSurvivalist is quite frankly the most modest/fulfilling game I have found in a long time, in all honesty it should be raised to the $7.50-$10 price range, and I shall tell you why soon.\n\nOkay so basically TL;DR Survivalist is a post-apocalyptic zombie survival game that orientates you a year after the outbreak, all the whilst you have been barricaded inside a bunker you bought for absolutely no reason (quite coincidental if you ask me). You begin the game exactly one year on as a rich, cheesy character who emerges from his bunker looking for other signs of life, and then the adventure begins.\n\nBefore I mention about the storyline (I don't want to spoil it so I will only provide vague details) I want to talk about the general gameplay. The closest I can liken the camera angle to is Diablo, fixated roughly birds-eye but angled slightly towards the player. This allows for a good view of the surrounding area, but doesn't impede imersion at all. Your character also follows the direction of your mouse, which is a good quality as you are easily able to pick off zombies as they come screaming towards you. The aiming aspect of the game I believe is unique, yet brilliant; your accuracy is basically zero if you are 'run and gunning' so to be able to kill zombies you need to stay still, juke side to side while plinking them off. The sound is also relatively ambient, however after a fair amount of time the footstep sound can get a little repetitive, but don't get me wrong it definitely adds to the realism of the game. Occasionally you hear the words "Eeeviillll" coming from a zombie somewhere in the close vicinity, but I love this cheesiness considering the game only costs $5, and I have absolutely no problem with it. Although the only aspect of the sound that I consider irritating is when you over-encumber/fatigue; the heavy breathing your character embodies (despite realism) is loud and kind of annoying but oh well, thats a minute flaw in a brilliant game.\n\nNow basically this game grasps every concept of a fantastic zombie survival on a minimalistic, but perfect scale. You cannot carry over a certain weight in items, but this can be enlargened through increasing your fitness skill (by running) or by obtaining different backpacks. You have a constant need to find water and food but on top of that ammo is relatively scarce so you need to make use of it considering zombies take a fair amount to bring down. You can also band up with other survivors to create a community, each with different assets like construction/medicine that can help improve your chances to survive. That brings me to the point of base-creation, which in this game is just amazing; you have to collect building resources such as wood and concrete to be able to fence off an area and construct buildings/defenses for a good defense agaisnt the undead. I love this aspect of the game, I didn't expect it to be there at all considering the price but oh boy does it make the difference. However early on you are established as the alpha of the group, and that means catering to the Type-1 Diabetic who requires Insulin constantly, which in this world doesn't come cheap at all.\n\nThe one thing that really impresses me though is this game is made by a single guy. Just one developer, who hasn't given up on the game (online co-op is in beta now with constant updates) which brings happiness to my heart considering most developers these days give up on early-access. For this guy to be able to create such a simplistic, perfect zombie survival is beyond me, and that is why I believe the price should be raised.\n\nI definitely recommend this game 100%, and at this point I only have 3.5 hours but I feel like that number will just skyrocket.","November 12, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My favorite is how the story line goes. I have always looked for a game where you can build your own community and I found the best one. I would like if they added more choices into the game and even more communities to trade with as well. I feel like there should be another area becuase you are blocked of from leaving where you are there should be an update or even a DLC where you can leave or travel to a new area spread your influnce there and bring people back to your community. I feel like they should add more guns into it , but if they don't I am fine with the same ones anyways. I would a also like there to be a community that is a US base and that the army is their trying to work on a cure but they take people from their communties to do test on them tp weaponize the infected people and you have to stop them and leading you to becomng the best community and having high respect because you saved them.

This didn't just happen a few times, but A LOT.\n\nHOWEVER! Once you get ahold of how the game works/plays it becomes chanllenging enough without being too hard or too easy. I enjoyed the freedom of the basebuilding and felt a real sense of victory when I had my entire bunker surrounded by a dual layer of fences and a careful spreading of guard towers and pillboxes.\n\nAnd I had a ton of fun becoming the new superpower of the wasteland by growing my settlement one person at a time. Those who could not be persuaded, bought, or threatened into joining me were met with a swift end. It's the end of the world, baby, and you're either with me, or you're dead.\n\nIn the end, Survivalist is a game worth picking up if you're a major zombie fan, are in the mood for something new, and it's on sale. For less than five bucks, you're actually getting a fairly good (albeit wonky) game.","March 7","true","41.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of fun, defintely one of the more enjoyable indie games Ive played.","January 17","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However personally i really enjoyed this game. I was skeptical at first but this game absolutly blew me away, i binged the crap out of it. It has one of the best storylines i have seen in a game since like The Walking Dead (game) 1st season. The characters are simple and loveable and the choices you make have profound affects on the world around you, surviving is harsh and constantly keeps you on your toes, and best of all (for me) this game is not only a "zombie sim" it asks the deep questions in life like: what do you want out of life? AND YOU GET TO CHOOSE. LIKE WHAT GAME LETS YOU DO THAT?!??! ONLY THIS ONE!!!! It's honestly the best thing ever and its probably going to be the best game im going to play this year. So, if your looking for a new and refreshing take on the zombie survival genre this game is definitly worth a pick up, especially if its on sale.\n\nPS: (SURVIVALIST DEVELOPERS IF YOU'RE READING THIS OMGOSH PLZ MAKE A SEQUEL ILL PAY LIKE 60 BUCKS FOR IT).","March 27","true","43.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Was. Wrong.\nTypically, I am the type of person who isn't interested in games with zombies, and I thought I would give this game a shot.\nGranted, I initially played the game up until Alice gets her first five insulin and I stopped playing the game for 5 months.\nEventually, I did return. I was bored, scrolling through my Steam Library when I saw this game.\n"What the hell" I thought "might as well give it a shot".\nI played it for 30 minutes, which turned into an hour, which turned into 6 hours.\nI loved it. The game was amazing, and when I finished my first play through (I chose Love over Power and Money), I was hungry for more. I am now starting my second play through, choosing Power, which is no easy task.\nSo far, I have not run into any bad bugs or glitches. The physics do sometimes do weird things, for instance, if you shoot a zombie as it is jumping at you, the body can end up going several feet behind you. A similar instance is when you kick a zombie in front of you, it can end up flying in the direction you pushed it, several feet away. Regardless, it's not a "bad" thing, just funny.\n\nMy point is: give this game a shot. I initially hated it, but I grew to enjoy it a lot.\n\nAlso, I realize that my review says that I have only played 0.8 hours of the game, but I played it offline on a separate harddrive.\n\n9.5 out of 10.\n\nA little tip: if you're going to threaten looters to get them to join you, use a character other than Joe. That way, there is less of a chance of people leaving your group (people often leave if they hate Joe).","January 28","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Survivalist is a top-down shoopter with rpg elements. As I first stated in the begining dont expect to run to your nearast town and rambo your way through. It wont happen. This is a in depth (in my opinion which may be crap to your) real survival game. No your not Bear Gryilles (or what ever that crap his last name is) eating poop and drinking pee. But you do have to manage food, water, sleep, etc. Also on top of that you have to manage Alice's type 1 diebetes. YAY, which means your'll constantly be running around looking for food and water and insulin. As I said this isn't easy starting off. As all games should be,  in the beggining your gonna be moslty scaveging for food and water and ammo and insulin. Then you'll head back to the bunker to start making your camp. Here's where it starts getting intense. Now your'll have to juggle using only one survivor Joe. For the time being. So that means you'll have to split food,water,ammo,and else. But enough rambling. Once you finally start builgind a comminuty the real action starts. I found myself constantly getting attacked while i was building or away. SO now your gonna have to start getting wood, and metal to secure your small comunity. As you start to accumulate more and more in your community your begin to realize hey I dont have to scavenge as often i have farms and wells. While ammo and insulin and building supplies now on the top of the GOT GET IT ALL list. Soon your'll feel safer leaving your comminuty alone from time to time knowing hey anything comes close ole buckeye pete and his m16 will gun it down. Of corse nothing is invincble but you'll feel better knowing raiders cant burn down chain-link fences. Soon the game gets easy for the time till it catches up with harder zombies. Now with that talk of coop it makes tingle inside knowing I can be guarding my community while someone else scavages. So I rate this a 9/10 IGN very very fun but gets kinda repetitive. Very hard early one. But hard fun.? (sounded better in my head). I would reccomend you get this. But learn to come and love the restart button","May 31","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know how to describe it to anyone that the other comments don't already do a good job of doing. You play as a survivor, you find other people along the way exploring, you do missions for other groups, build up your resources, including building your own town. It is beautiful in its simplicity and wonderful in a sandbox survival with a light hearted story. The fact is I wish there were more buildings, or atleast options to choose colors for your buildings. The game has a lot of amazing fun moments, and some over the top ridiculous story arcs, which made me laugh and I enjoyed the time I've played.
