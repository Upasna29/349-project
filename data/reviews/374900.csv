Hercule Poirot is a bit of a ♥♥♥♥, right. If I met him, I suspect I'd come to feel an urge to punch him in the throat. He's smug, vain, arrogant and somewhat rude. Yet the world just can't seem to get enough of him. Even Agatha Christie couldn't stand him. In fact,  she once referred to him[www.telegraph.co.uk] as a “detestable, bombastic, tiresome, ego-centric little creep.” And  she even warned [thepeterwimseyreader.blogspot.no] other authors about creating a character like this in an essay from 1930. He was however a creep that made her a lot of money given his popularity, so she was stuck with him.\n\nDuring the war though, she made a plan to ensure his death should she herself die. Yep, she wanted to ensure that he could not live on if she didn't. Yikes. She wrote the story about his (and Miss Marple's) death in 1945, with instructions to publish if she got killed.\n\nShe survived, as did her detectives, and she continued to produce stories about them for another 30 years. Until her own health started to fail in the 1970s, and she finally decided to kill him (cause of death: poison induced heart attack). The public reaction was intense, and included a front page obituary in the New York Times [www.poirot.us] (this was the first time a fictional character had gotten an obituary) - no doubt to Christie's annoyance. She died the year after, ensuring that no one would continue to write new stories about the ego-centric little creep she had created several decades earlier.*\n\nThat never stopped anyone from creating new versions of existing stories - the most famous adaptation is probably the   British TV series [www.imdb.com] that aired from 1989 to 2013. And then there's this game, based on the novel with the same name from 1936. In other words, if you have read that novel (or watched that episode), you already know the plot. If not, I'm not gonna spoil it here anyway.\n\nThis is a fairly standard point and click mystery adventure, where in addition to actually solving the mystery you get bonus points for behaving like Poirot would. The point system is aptly called "ego-points", and one of the things you can do to gain them is to make sure you look at yourself (and groom your 'stache) everytime you're near a mirror. In short, they have captured his spirit. Props for that. I also think there's just a right amount of complicated puzzles, and it has a certain hook to it. I enjoyed connecting the dots (or as he would say, getting the little grays to work), and sorting through relevant information and red herrings.\n\nI do however find it a bit of an uneccessarily slow game. It's point and click, and you have to wait for the animation, or more accurately, Poirot himself. You have to wait for him to walk places, to finish talking, and so on. I'd maybe have more patience for that if I liked him more. There's actually an achievement for getting impatient with him. There is, of course, no doubt that he is good at his job. As are you if you manage to solve the mysteries at hand. And by the way you will, don’t worry. There’s not actually any way to fail at this game I think? But you might find yourself spending time on the puzzles, sometimes due to the animation of it dragging out, but sometimes because they’re complex.\n\nSo I'm sorry Agatha, but I'm going to recommend this game to people who enjoy point-and-click-puzzles.\n\n\n* One new novel was actually approved for publication (The Monogram Murders by Sophie Hannah, published in 2014)","April 5","true","6.1"," 133 of 153 people (87%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","87","133","153","37","14"

But then I always found Agatha Christie games to be easier than ND and SH games (although this is a completely different style as to the other AC adventure games).  Trying to be thorough going for max points and working out achievements, first gameplay was 6-7hrs, with no hints.\n\nThe gameplay is easy as there are objectives that are scored out so you know when you have done everything in an area and can move on to the next objective.  The hotspots for areas in scenes are generous so it’s hard to miss anything and there are optional hints if needed (have no idea how they work or if you can skip puzzles with them.)\n\nAt most there are two areas at a time for you to explore so you can’t get lost and thankfully there is not a lot of inventory items ever in the game so no trying to combine a lot of things or trying items on every hotspot you come across.  Gameplay is very linear.\n\nThe puzzles are easy and a couple do get annoying with the repetitiveness of them, but some will take you a while not because they are fundamentally hard but the execution of some of them is fiddly and a couple makes you think they will be harder than they actually are.  If you hate all puzzles/minigames then this game isn’t for you as I’d class this as a puzzle/adventure.\n\nThe observations of people you can’t get wrong and in scenes it tells you how many clues there are to find so that’s easy as well.  Where it gets not relaxing is limited dialogue choices which can frustrate as sometimes you don’t want to pick either choice and trying the nice route first which Poirot does in the books doesn’t always yield you max points.\n\nThe questions for the deduction board later sometimes didn’t always gel with the facts you give to support it.  I am used to the more complex and better Sherlock Holmes deduction boards where the hardness is in trying to remember your facts and what goes with something but in this game it’s more the ambiguity of the questions sometimes.\n\nI have read the book so I found the deductions and questions to be easier, if you haven’t read the book I could imagine you might find that side of the game to be harder but with limited choices re deduction board you will get it quickly.\n\nThe one thing I find ultra-annoying is that there is no manual save game system, which for me is a basic need especially with a game with points and achievements.  I kept wanting to retry conversations and try different things but I couldn’t.\n\nI do appreciate that there are built in achievements, a timeline which helps you understand the story better at the end and points.\n\nI sadly find P&C games to be rare so I devour ones I find and I will buy all the hopefully future Agatha Christie games there will be, not just because of this but also I am a huge Agatha Christie fan.  But for $24 I wished it was either longer, or more non-linear, have more areas to explore or more in-depth complexities of gameplay, maybe fewer but harder puzzles.\n\nIt was a good but not a great game and of course the plot and story was excellent, overall I did really enjoy it and there is replayability in trying to get all achievements.  I’d give it a 7/10.","February 9","true","15.3"," 61 of 66 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","61","66","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/374900/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1503 products in account","Agatha Christie - The ABC Murders is an adventure detective point & click game based on Agatha Christie's crime novel The ABC Murders (who would have thought).\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You play as Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian detective with an incredibly sharp mind and the capability of solving complex puzzles that the police usually can't solve by themselves. This exact capability makes a mysterious serial killer challenge Poirot if he can find who he is. You start by visiting the first crime scene, where a woman was murdered. You have to find clues and pull something actually useful out of them. After all, you're Hercule Poirot!\n\nPros:    Voice Acting | This is a very very important thing in this game, as Poirot just has to be properly voice acted for this game to work. You may have watched some of the episodes with Hercule Poirot and his voice is just one of integral parts of the whole thing. In The ABC Murders, voice acting is, in my opinion, done very well, which is a huge plus.\nVisual Style | I like the kind-of-3D world this game is set in and the animations are also very nice. The way characters look kind of remind me of comic books based on Christie's novels, if you've ever seen one of those.\nGameplay | You will constantly be looking for clues everywhere. You will later also connect these clues to make assumptions which will help you later in the game. Finding those clues also gives you Poirot's opinion about it, which is really nice to hear and is sometimes even slightly funny.\nPuzzles | This is not just a simple adventure game with a nice story, but it also includes some nice puzzles. They are usually based on one object, on which you can find clues or just push your brains to get the solution. Puzzles in this game are very pleasant for us solvers and they can be both easy or hard. But none of those go to extremes. For solving puzzles, you also get so called "ego points", which is cool, because we like points. I just don't know yet why these points are used for.\nThe Story | Well, this one is pretty obvious: the story is great. I've read the book and I've forgotten all about it except that is was awesome, so it's pretty cool that I get to experience it again, but this time in a different shape. For a little bonus, this game even has multiple endings for those who can remember things they read in the past. Or at least the developers say so.\nThe Achievements | There are 50 achievements and they are pretty well-set. They are not like "get 10 ego points!" and "get 100 ego points!" and "get 250 eg ..." ... you know what I'm trying to say. You get them for actually achieving things in the game, which is how achievements should be.\nSteamOS and MacOS | If you want, you can make your inner penguin happy for playing this game on Linux-powered machines. You can also run it on that expensive aluminum thingy of yours, if you want to.\nCons:    Settings | There are not many, when it comes to graphics. The only two options for graphic quality are "high" and "low" and they don't make much difference. There are a few basic resolutions listed, but not an option for fullscreen/windowed mode. However, this game runs in Unity, so you can change fullscreen by using Alt+Enter. This should be available to less advanced users as well, though.\nPricing | Although this game is pretty good so far, I'm not really sure about the 30€ price tag. You will have to decide this one for yourself.\nThe final verdict:I'm not really far in this game at this moment, so I will be updating this review after I finish the game. So far, however, I wasn't really bothered by anything special and I think this game is going to offer some quality gameplay hours. I love Agatha Christie's novels, so if you love those as well, you should certainly give this game a try. It plays great so far and I can't wait to uncover the killer once again!\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.\n---\nNo drama, Just Reviews.","February 4","true","11.4"," 56 of 70 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","56","70","0","1"

It is too basic, impossible to lose or miss something, only has a handful of puzzles which are pretty straight-forward, and just does not really feel like you're a detective at all. If Steam allowed some kind of rating in between a Yes or No, say, a Maybe, then I'd pick that. The visuals and voice acting are great! But the game holds your hand every linear step of the way, and so any sense of discovery is completely missing. Sometimes the clues the game is expecting you to match up in the Little Gray Cells mini-game do not even make sense, but you can't ever get stuck there - there is no progressing until you get it right, and there's only one correct combination. If you really love Poirot, or you just want to drop thirty bucks on a few hours of a murder story that you have to point-and-click through, then go for it. The production values are great here, just the actual gameplay is lacking.","February 13","false","9.4"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","40","49","0","0"

There is no allowance in the plot for your wrong answers; there are no what-if scenarios where you (and thus, Poirot) ♥♥♥♥ up the investigation and send the wrong man to jail; and there's not a lot of freedom in how you approach things. Despite how it looks, ABC Murders is pretty oldschool-adventure in a lot of ways. Or, to be more accurate, it's pretty oldschool-Frogwares -- Poirot's investigation here has some things in common with how Sherlock investigated Jack the Ripper or looked into whatever the ♥♥♥♥ Testament was about. You get to build a timeline, you get to stick clues together to supplement Poirot's ideas about the case, and you get to solve inane inventory puzzles and open puzzle boxes because apparently half of London shops at the Mondo Puzzlebox Outlet and they put damn near everything in them. There is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzlebox built inside a cash register, which is the kind of asinine nonsense that only could happen inside of an adventure game. It doesn't even contain anything that would justify such a confusing security scheme, because surely if someone has broken into your shop and robbed you they can break into the back room as well and also our puzzle-minded shopkeeper decided to write the code on the register anyway, it's all nonsense, who cares, Poirot is a cool guy and he solve a crime, 9 moustaches/10","February 4","true","1.1"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","33","44","8","0"

Good introduction to Poirot literature (or TV series with David Suchet), no previous knowledge on the matter is required, hardly any incessant winking at the fans. You're playing as Poirot himself – a fussy little Belgian detective in absurdly neat shoes, obsessed with his moustache and gentleman class. Poirot's challenged by one A.B.C., a murderer of seemingly random people. Cue a short-ish adventure game focused on introspection, logic and cultured wit. There's a handful of plot twists predictable to those who pay close attention. Overall, the writing doesn't insult the player's intelligence and leaves one satisfied. Undeniably a game of one character – Poirot, either enjoy him and his methods or spare yourself the trouble. Dialogues are well-written and rather engaging. After you end the game, there's an option to play the whole plot unravel chronologically in a delightful and well-crafted manner.\n\nGAMEPLAY WISE:\nA typical point & click, but don't expect much combining of items or asking random people for their opinions on random stuff. The game's absolutely linear and alternative paths lead only to trophies or Poirot's funny little monologues. Invokes “Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments” in nearly every aspect, judge by yourself whether it's good or bad. Poirot investigates isolated crime scenes, one after another, in-between he compares results and discusses them in his apartment. Unlike “Sherlock Holmes: C&P”, this game is far more dialogue-driven and you'll frequently engage in conversations testing your tact and keen eye, but in the end still linear. A good share of fairly easy puzzles (of oddly Mystian vibe, rather than the usual point & click sort) to solve is liberally put in every corner of the game. Investigations consist also of examining objects for clues and looking for visual hints, as well as mapping the observations in a shamelessly Sherlockian “neuron map” (conveniently called “little brain cells”) for conclusions – there are no wrong conclusions though, the game prevents you from committing the gravest mistakes. Every action in the game is scored – the perfect score of 600 does however demand from you such little distractions as fixing your moustache in every mirror you pass. Amusing the first time, dull at the end. There's also a bunch of trophies granted for every little task, including committing mistakes and discovering secrets. Easy to max out – two playthroughs at most. “Agatha Christie – The ABC Murders” takes about 5 to 6 hours to complete without skipping any dialogue. No time limits, no QTEs, one can relax entirely and focus on working out the mystery.\n\nART WISE:\n1930s are conveyed mainly through graphics, clearly influenced by recent Telltale games – every object is cel-shaded and slightly comicbook-like. Textures are sharp and easy to look at, every object and character fits the art style perfectly. Meticulous attention for historical detail, no jarring anachronisms. The musical score serves its purpose, but that's about it – subtle piano keys in the background are pretty, but not what one would call mesmerising. Except for Poirot's charming little Belgian-scented voice, the acting feels rather average. No grand and memeworthy performances, everything's by the book, although I've noted a fair amount of little mistakes and mispronunciations, as if the actors had only one chance at recording their lines. Expect lovely non-RP accents here and there.\n\nTECHNICAL WISE:\nFor a Unity Engine game, I was surprised how smooth and easy this game runs. Weighs a little over 2,5GB and eats up a meagre part of one's resources even on a weak rig (such as mine). No stuttering, no game-breaking bugs. Animations feel a bit stiff and there's a slight problem with path finding, but 3D adventure games had these problems since the 90s – love them or hate them, it's a part of the deal. Only once I've had to re-enter a room to fix a little bug. The game doesn't crash on you while alt-tabbing. Technically well executed.\n\nSTEAM WISE:\nThree trading cards out of six, dropping very fast, approximately every hour after hitting the 2h mark. 50 achievements correspond to in-game trophies, rather easy to max (I've ended up with 90% after my first playthrough). No modding, nor do I expect any mods at all. There will probably emerge a small community focused on completion guides.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nEasy puzzling and a lot of genuine charm in this one. It's rather short and not really replayable so you should probably wait for a sale. Primarily for enthusiasts of top-notch detective stories and Poirot lovers, but also a good introduction to the genre and an apt warm-up before more challenging adventure games. Won't make your blood run faster, but will certainly give your brain something to do.\n\nSO, HOW MUCH OUT OF TEN?\nYou should feel bad about yourself for taking this 1-10 nonsense seriously.","February 5","true","6.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

It had some good points, but overall was a disappointment to the genre.\n\nPros:\n* Reasonably good art, at its best points charming.\n* Voice acting is good enough to carry the story.\n* Automatic assessments of how people are feeling based on body language as you interrogate/interview them.\n* Adaptive interview techniques: as you assess someone's character and what they respond to, you can change your line of questioning. (The point system gives you feedback by awarding you points for the perfect response, though because it's a varying number of points, it's hard to know if you chose the best one or just a not-terrible option.)\n* It's fun to get points for checking the mirror every chance you get and grooming your mustache. It adds to the conceited, easy to dislike character that is classic Poirot.\n\nCons:\n* Railroaded experience (no pun intended.) At first you are chasing the ABC killer; you know who has committed these murders and why, and are still forced to investigate a lot of other suspects before concluding "Yes, it's that same killer I was obviously chasing!" Then when a forced twist comes, you are similarly walked through the rest of the game.\n* Unless I was insanely lucky or something, Steam achievements really are handed out for next to nothing. There are ten or so for finishing a section, in a game I finished in about six hours. That's only a fraction but is representative of the 50 to be had.\n* As you question someone, it is sometimes obvious what tactic to take with them, but you still get the dialogue options wrong because the summary of what you want to say is misleading. E.g., what may seem like a reasonable question makes them angry because you unexpectedly say it in an insulting way.\n* Observations of a suspect or scene have nothing to do with your own perceptiveness. The reticule changes from white to green as you zero in on whatever the designers wanted you to notice.\n* A conclusion system modeled after the Sherlock Holmes games, but too flawed to be interesting. If you insert the right clues into the open spaces (which is sometimes frustrating, if you don't know what conclusion Poirot is trying to draw), it automatically tells you the meaning. For example, "This suspect is innocent." You don't have to use your own powers of judgment.\n* Repetitive mini-games involving manipulating objects. Apparently, every criminal in this world has a similar lockbox that involves sliding bits of wood and copying patterns from elsewhere in the room.\n* The final conclusion of the one crime you're investigating throughout the game is very unsatisfying. The motives are boring, the proof of guilt is unconvincing, the assumptions behind the guilty party are logically flawed in some very obvious ways, and at last only a Perry Mason-style blurted confession proves that Poirot got it right. I personally formed a much more interesting theory to implicate someone else, a suspect that was never even seriously questioned.\n\nSo, I did get an interesting six hours out of following Poirot around. But the most enjoyable part of the game was yelling at our hero for stumbling around wasting time on silly leads, which isn't the basis of a good detective game.","February 11","false","6.6"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

You will travel through England via train to several destinations where the murders took place.\nI really enjoyed the game play; not only are you looking for clues and talking to people but you are also observing them and trying to understand who they are or what they may hiding from the police. In terms of the puzzles, if you like point and click games like myself, you might find most of them average or even simple on some occasions.\n\nThe 3D graphics are great and the voice over is superb, mes chers amis.

I'm also a huge fan of Agatha Christie's and I've both read the book and watched the movie. The game however... is a very poor immetation of the movie.\n\nTo take it from the top, the first thing that really offends a loyal player, is the fact that Poirot is sooooo off. His character model is absolutely not made to look the part, his walking animation is not the same as the movie and his features are definately not as described in the book. The voice actign is just aweful! Poirot's accent is more German than French (Belgian), almost all the actors are emotionless, and there are way too few of them, so that 2 of the key characters in the game have the exact same voice! (Spoiler Alert! one of them is the murderer!)\n\nThe gameplay is very boring. You can not go wrong, you just button mash and click around for the puzzles to be solved automatically. I've finished the game, and through the whole thing never did I ever have to look up a walk through, or even think for more than  5 minutes on a puzzle. They become dull and repetative. The exact same puzzle is used 3 times (Comparing letters) and the solution is exactly the same each time! Everything is jus so simple...\n\nThe story is scewed. Some times your characters says things that you actually don't know, and he mispronounces a whole lot of stuff. They've taken out a whole murder from the book/movie, and so poirot has to be unreasonaly smart to know exactly where the murderer is before he is supposed to be found!\n\nSo to conclude, I would not buy this game because it's a poirot game. If you haven't a clue who poirot is, even then it's going to be boring and stupid. Now there are zingers in the game, but with so much wrong on the making of characters... it just fades away.","April 23","false","6.3"," 43 of 76 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","43","76","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cjcomplex/recommended/374900/","cjcomplex","Cjcomplex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cjcomplex/","6196 products in account","True to the spirit of Agatha Christie, this game offers an enthralling tale of murder and mystery. You play as Hercule Poirot, the famed Belgium detective out to solve another crime with his trusted companion Mr. Hastings. The story is engaging and well paced and like Agatha Christie's novels, will keep you guessing till the very end of who is the A.B.C. Murderer.\n\nGameplay wise, the mechanics are serviceable. There is noticeable roughness to be found with all aspects of the game, yet it does not detract from the experience. The puzzles are rather easy to solve, though this is most likely intentional as to not disrupt the flow of the narrative (there is a mechanic within the game where it will solve the next step of the puzzle for you if you happen to get stuck if you so choose). The game does a good job of telling you whether or not you are done within a certain area, making sure you do not miss any vital information that would hinder progress further along in the game.\n\nThe controls are a bit rough (played with mouse and keyboard), but nothing too troublesome. This game is fully voice acted, though there are moments where it felt a bit off. That being said, I found the person who voiced Poirot in this game to well casted and considering the fact that he is the central character, that is what I believe to matter the most. The aesthetic is pleasing and the game's selection of music is well suited to the narrative.\n\nAll in all, even though it has a few faults, it is nothing too large that would prevent me from recommending this game. The price point may be a bit high for some, so unless you are a fan of Agatha Christie (like I am), I would advise to wait for a modest sale.","February 8","true","10.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","3"

It gives you limited options to let you fail which, to me, defeats the purpose of inspecting when it essentially gives you the answers. Thus, I feel it is very linear and boring as your choices practically have no consequences on the storyline or end results.\n\nI originally bought it because I have read the book and am a fan of this genre, and heard the excited hype for the game but it does not meet the expected standards. Lastly, I have played the game for less than an hour and I am around 1/3 of the way through it - I would expect a game of this price to last a lot longer or at least be of higher quality than this.","February 17","false","0.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","10"

Her writing is sharp, her characters are full of color and personality and her murder mysteries are masterpieces.  She is the mama of modern murder mysteries.  So I was eager to play this game. You have to complete puzzles to advance the story and help in the detective work.  You can always get help from the game via the clue button. The most interesting device is the "using the grey cells" part of the game where you use different observations to make your deduction\n\nPros:\n- Great story\n- Superb voice acting (esp the rendition of Poirot) and music\n- Innovative graphics - sort of cell shading\n\nCons:\n- Frantic clicking to solve mysteries\n- Repetitive puzzles which do not help in detective work\n- Slow in certain areas\n\nWhile I liked the feel of the game and the way they translated the story to a PC game, the puzzles you have in the game rapidly turn repetitive.  Even more so, some puzzles do not help advance the plot at all. So you will find yourself trying to get the clue button and finish the damn puzzle.  The best feature in the game is the "grey cells" portion where you help Poirot make a deduction out of the observations made in the game.  I was actually looking for this everytime.  And the music is superb.\n\nOverall, Buy this game if it is on sale. Decent game to pass the afternoon.","February 12","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And considering that "ABC Murders" is one of the best detective novels, fans of good detective stories will definitely enjoy playing this game.

The puzzles and interrogations are the hardest parts in this game and offer real challenge to the player. Puzzles range from opening boxes to solving chinese word problems.\n\nInterrogations offer the biggest challenge to someone who isn't following along with the story and how the various characters react, as you have one and only one chance to ask or accuse. If you mess up a question, the story will move on and you will not have another chance.\n\nClues are handled differently, as you as Poirot says "Put those little grey cells to work" has you actually take conversations and clues to prove certain things. Ranging from the pych make up of the killer to why this young lady left her possessions behind.\n\nVoice Acting is a large part of adventure games and ABC Murders gets a talented actor for Poirot keeps the bar high. The various other people you meet are hit or miss, with the hotel manager as the low for me.\n\nOverall: I enjoyed the ABC Murders though it was a bit short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RipWitchUniverse/recommended/374900/","RipWitchUniverse","RipWitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RipWitchUniverse/","22 products in account","There are many things this game did wonderfully, such as the fantastic voice acting, the art style, and how the interviews adapt depending on what you chose to say. I really appreciate the achievements as it could have been realy easy for the developers to put in achievements based on ego points the game awards, but instead have them based on the story or investigating people, places, and objects.\nWhile the puzzles do seem easy, I found that the game does seem to weigh it based on which part of the game it is located in, such as in chapter one you have puzzles you can easily figure out (as a way to introduce looking around for clues) and the last puzzles you do (in chapter three) involve investigating outside of the puzzle.\nHowever, there are some things that more or less annoyed me personally or did not exactly make sense:\n-The Eagle Eye achievement\nI found this achievement very confusing as the clue given is "Poirot excels in observing human nature! You are receiving this trophy for having penetrated all the people's thoughts with a simple look". It just seems you only have to investigate people, but in reality you have to investigate everything. I'm not sure if it was only me that thought this, but nonetheless it is very confusing as most of the time, the game will not let you leave an area without investigating key items anyway (or clues that will be used later on).\n-Investigating items in inventory\nThe game tells you early on that you should look at items just in case you can interact with them, which is indicated by a hand on the side. I think this would hav worked better if this was either taken out and let the player figure it out or the game tells you when it uses it. This aspect does not come into play till the last chapter. A way I can see this being introduced better (or lack of): As the few objects you can investigate are used in puzzles, and the player already knows you can use items in inventory for puzzles, the player can figure out that these objects are involved, and in turn, see that they can interact with them (as the hand has already been associated with interacting already).\n-The signet ring\nOn the topic of items, one item got me: the signet ring. While first getting the ring, the game tells you the number on it, but not when you go to investigate it for a puzzle. WHen investigating it, it tells you that numbers are written on it and that's it. In both playthroughs I had, I couldn't find the numbers on the ring. I'm not sure if this was the case for everyone though.\n-Option the investigate the same items\nI found this weird, especially when Pariot says the same thing as he said when you investigated earlier. And with the Eagle Eye achievement, this can be annoying by thinking you would not have to investigate it again when in reality, you will have to get it again. I feel like these items should not have reset (in a sense where it recounts it) , but instead have an option to investigate it again.\n-Investigating the letters\nI found myself groaning at this part of the gameplay after the second time. Pariot says the same thing each time despite after seeing how the letters are from the same typewriter and already deducting facts about the murderer. I found this pointless considering it really was the same thing except with different letters.\n-Just some small things\nObvious investigations: Some deductions are very obvious to the point where Pariot should not have needed the player to deduce it themselves. Along with this, at one point Pariot does ignore an obvious item is missing and act obvilious later on(which did not make sense considering Pariot is supposed to notice these things).\nMost puzzles involve the owner hiding items, but these are usually not reset except for a few. You would think the owners would freak out and question why Pariot gone through them without permission (especially in a certain section) and could have made an interesting part in the game if the characters did notice (the game could just fast forward through solving the puzzle again to take away having the player redo it).\n\nEither way, I do recommend this game. As I wish some of the repetitive aspects were not as annoying (and Pariot's talking did not halt the player) this is a great experience.","June 3","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the outstanding Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishments I wanted to find another game that could capture what made that game such a masterpiece. While this game falls short of the excellence of the Sherlock Holmes game it does capture some of that magic. The story is an excellent take on the classic Agatha Christie novel. The game structure is broken out into nice investigation segments that mix questioning suspects, exploring and looking for clues combined with puzzles that in some cases reminded me of light versions of the Room. The voice acting is rough and I did have a few minor glitches, but overall I found the art style and gameplay to be very enjoyable and I felt at 7 hours it was just long enough to feel worth the cost without overstaying its welcome. Its a nice filler until the next Sherlock Holmes game.","April 26","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's much easier to translate action into a game setting than thought processes. If you happen to figure something out in this game before Poirot (a frequent occurrence), you still need to go through the song and dance of your supposedly intellectually superior detective figuring it out in-game. The mechanics are also faulty; at a couple of places the game got held up trying to figure out how to use a simple object, while also having to listen to Poirot name the object each time you click on it ("A bottle of solvent" heard more than ten times in a couple of minutes is something no paying customer should have to endure). At another crucial junction my interface mysteriously vanished altogether, requiring a restart. And, of course, like all detective games, the replay value is just about zero, unless you enjoy collecting achievements you've missed or hearing every dialogue option.","April 30","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keep in mind it behaves much like a telltale game.  It's impossible to "fail" at this game.\n\nThe gameplay varies, from observing people, to solving puzzles and making mindmaps about certain questions/motives.\nIf you're into shooters and action games, I'd advice you to skip this game. This is not for you. It's a more slowpaced game that you'll play to relax.\n\nThe puzzles arent groundbreaking or severely hard, and that's fine. Use logic and it will be a breeze.\nI found the storyline fairly good and it kept me interested.\n\nACHIVEMENT HUNTERS: This is fairly easy game to 100%. I'd say around 8 hours from start to completion. 2/10 in difficulty.\n\nI do feel that the price is very steep for the amount of content provided. 29.99 is simply too much for 6 hours of gameplay while loafing around. buy only if discounted.","April 27","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Neither I would to any fan of the previous installments of the Agatha Chrstie gaming franchise. The game has some good ideas combined with many horrible and repetitive mechanics.\n\nI have played for five hours and I think I will not finish the game. Puzzles are useless and seem extremely out of context. It seems like the game throws you puzzle after puzzle just fo fill content and hours of game. Then the observation mini puzzles are way too repetitive. A few of them -to identify characteristics of suspects/victims- could be fine, but you end up doing this process with almost everything.\n\nThere are almost no items to collect, up to now there were no combination of items, there were not any components of a classic adventure.\n\nSome good ideas brought from modern adventures are pretty bad implemented. While conducting interrogations, it seems it does not matter the choice you make. The suspects / witnesses will always give you the answer you are looking for. If you make a mistake, Poirot will make the correct question later. Maybe this changes later in the game, but I feel it will not.\n\nThen the "little grey cells" mini games are pretty straightforward. And then if you fail nothing happens. Poirot will not make any wrong assumption, it will just wait until you make the correct choice, like a triall and error minigame. It is absurd.\n\nThe story is not bad. After all it is picked from a novel by Agatha Christie. But is the only good thing.\n\nTo summarise, do not buy it. If you want a classic adventure game, this is not your choice. If you want a modern adventure game, then play something like Life is Strange. If you want to play an Agatha Christie game, pick Evil Under The Sun or some other installment (Murder on the Orient Express or even Ten Little Indians -And Then There Were None-).
