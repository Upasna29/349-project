The game is simple to get into and learn, offering some mental relaxation as well. There is no story, no bells and whistles or anything of the sort. It’s a matching game where you have to meet certain requirements to clear each level and progress through the game’s fifty-five levels.\n\nUnlike other matching games, this isn’t a match three. You can match two or more colored blocks to have whatever size combo you desire. Using the mouse, you draw lines connecting the blocks you want to erase from the field, something I imagine would be good on a touchscreen device. The issue I had with the gameplay was that you had to connect the blocks of the same color together, you couldn’t skip one.  It’s not a huge deal but when the blocks fall randomly it made it harder to set up combos. The game also has “Lucid blocks” which, when used, will clear the board, either helping you out of a tight situation or ruining a set up you had in the works.\n\nDespite the game mechanics trying to be different than other popular matching games, Lucid isn’t really that difficult. You can easily get through half of the game before ever reaching a speed bump. The game also doesn’t offer any other modes of play, once you’ve beaten the main fifty-five levels that’s it. There is also no level select if you want to go back and replay a level. The game keeps score for you but the score has no effect on the game and there is no leader board so I’m not sure of the purpose. The title does have achievements on Steam if you hunt for those.\n\nThe visuals are trippy, the music is trippy as well, it honestly feels like a psychedelic trip the entire time. While not the best game of its kind, it’s a fun time-killer. I would recommend grabbing it on sale or in a bundle, the lack of other features or modes really limits the lifespan of this game. It’s a small fish in a big pond, the matching genre is very saturated and Lucid could do better. But, it does what it can decently enough.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","March 4","true","1.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

In this game, you have to clear regions of same-color blocks, like SameGame, but with the baffling restriction that you can only clear a region if you can draw a path through every block. This leaves your options severely limited at all times.\n\nWith such limited options for moves, it’s next to impossible to set up any big combos or get out of trouble on purpose (about on par with Bejeweled / Candy Crush), and in the cases you do, the game could drop a Lucid block in the middle of it (which are supposed to be rewards) and force you to reset the board, destroying what you built.\n\nStarting level layouts seem to be hand-designed, but random skyfalls and target colors mean it doesn’t really matter.\n\nCompetitively, there are no game mechanics in place to prevent you from playing a level forever for unlimited score, except that getting stuck with no possible moves will zero your score. At about level 48, there’s a sudden difficulty spike as all objectives require regions of 3 or more, so playing through all 55 levels without getting a Game Over is highly unlikely. Oh, and no leaderboards!\n\nFor a game that tries to sell itself as relaxing, it’s a bit too far on the frustrating and stressful side, and certainly not something you can zone out to while playing. Achievement hunters should probably grab it on sale, as it’ll be in your 100% trophy case in a few mere hours, but for casual or hardcore puzzle fans, there’s so many better options out there.","July 13, 2014","false","7.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The goal is to get a specific number of tasked blocks to clear a level. Each task requires you to make color blocks which pushes up your multiplier. If you don't follow the task, the multiplier drops back to zero. Lucid blocks can clear the field, but they are worth crazy points at the end of a level if you don't use them. It's kind of counter intuitive in that the point system is really about pushing up the multiplier rather than going for the largest color blocks. Keep your blocks small and you push up the multiplier to the point where the lucid blocks end up counting for tens of millions of points each.","December 17, 2011","false","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/61100/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","TL;DR: An okay match-X game with addictive mechanics. However, it is techically aged.\n\nLucid is a matcher game, similar to the match-3 sub-genre. It's a very casual and quite simple game where you aspire for high scores and to survive through a level.\n\nThe basic rules\nThere's a grid of colourful blocks. You can clear them out by drawing over the full length of some colour group, without drawing over the same block twice nor omitting any blocks of the group. Because of this rule some block groups cannot be cleared.\n\nTrue to the casual genre, there are no time limits so you can device all you want to get the highest score ever. The only limit (and also the winning condition) is that you win the level once you have completed the sequence of cleared blocks of a colour given by the game. Clearing the right colour several times grants a combo multiplier that helps one to reach the high scores.\n\nFun and addictive\nWhile I usually prefer "hard" games, Lucid was a surprisingly pleasant experience. Deciding to beat a few levels grew into tens of levels and several hours. The high combos and large streaks are satisfactory to succeed. The reassuring exclamation of "good" every now and then when clearing a large amount of blocks strangely enough helps with the feeling.\n\nIn the early and middle levels the game allows any number of blocks for a matching clearing. Later, the levels get more difficult as the requirement becomes at least three blocks per clear.\n\nHowever, the last few levels had a requirement of a minimum of four blocks that was quite a chore (for me anyway) as it is easy to run yourself into a choke situation where it's impossible to clear a bunch of obstructing blocks. This easily leads to a losing situation, as the only way to lose is to find oneself unable to clear any blocks at all. Fortunately these levels were only few and after a few tries even I could beat them.\n\nConclusions\nAs for technical side of things, I experienced almost no bugs. However, while options are simple but adequate (just sound and music), note that turning down sound effects doesn't actually work. Also, the resolution options are abysmal: game supports only three fullscreen resolutions (1280x800, 1280x768 and 1280x720) and one windowed (1280x720).\n\nPerhaps the latter issue is an artefact that shows the game's age: it's from 2011, i.e. 5 years ago as of writing this. One thing to note is that the game doesn't come with a colour-blind mode so check the screenshots before buying to see if it affects you.\n\nI completed its 55 levels and 11 achievements (some of which are tricky) in about 6 hours. It's a nice casual game, but because of its age I'd still advice getting it on sale (which are every few months) unless you really dig these match-X types of games.","May 7","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With almost all of the achievements, I gave it a good shot. Every level is the same in that you draw lines over adjacent jelly cubes of the same color to make them disappear and to fill up a gauge to move on to the next level.\n\nBy matching cubes, you score points and there is also a goal color displayed that you should match to increase your score multiplier. In Tetris fashion, you're shown what cube color is coming up next. The only problem is that your score is meaningless since there are no leaderboards. Difficulty never ramps up much and the game remains far too easy and repetitive. Not even a timed mode or any challenges or unlockables. Pick any other puzzle game and you'll have more fun.","January 9, 2012","false","4.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

This  addition doesn't really add much more complexity, but Lucid was probably not intended to a brain-teaser.\n\nWhat Lucid does do well, while you play the uninspired and repetitive puzzle game, is play spacey sounds at you, ripple the game board, splash rainbows and flare effects everywhere and constantly praise you in a calm, soothing voice.  Perhaps this would be really appealing to someone in a highly altered state of consciousness -- but otherwise it's just a lot of annoyances slowing down play.\n\nI recommend this game only if you're a serious abuser of psychoactives, and you've already become bored with "Dark Side of the Moon" and the kaleidoscope sequence from "2001: A Space Odyssey".","July 1, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/61100/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","The main hook that separates Lucid from the plethora of countless other falling block puzzle games is the way you remove these blocks. Rather than guiding pieces through mid air to try perfectly filling in empty spaces or position them so they match with their similiars, here the board is already full and you have to use your best judgement to trace a line through blocks of the same colour to remove them from play and send all the pieces above them crashing downwards. Remove the required colour and minimum target number to fill a circular gauge at the side of the screen, the more blocks you remove each turn the greater the amount the gauge will fill up and complete the stage. But there's a catch, as there always is.\n\nWhile the minimum allowable number of blocks that can be removed in a single action can be as little as two, and with the upper limit only being whatever's actually available, if you want to remove a group of matching blocks then you MUST be able to remove all of the ones that connect to each other in that one action. Also, the line you trace has to be in a single, continuous strand that cannot cross over or repeat back on itself. So, for example, a T-shaped arrangement of blocks could never be removed because, after the starting point, the line you draw would have to move to one side or the other but then could not reach the remaining blocks without going back over itself and therefore could not connect all blocks of the same colour. It sounds kinda complicated, but trust me, it's a lot easier in practice.\n\nThere are 55 stages in total, and at first it seems like each one is simply a random collection of mixed colours that you remove with little thought, but you then begin to realise that the field of play isn't as haphazardly laid out as it first appears and there's actually an art to planning ahead and setting up the blocks to maximise your score and finish the stage more quickly. You can still randomly draw away at groups on a whim for the most part, but in later stages you can easily lead yourself into a dead end with no more viable options as the clusters of colours form shapes that are all but impossible to remove.\n\nUnfortunately there's a fly in the ointment, though it isn't so much the way it plays, but rather, everything else. The presentation is mostly passable, but you can't shake the sense that there's something of a cheap or unfinished quality to it, as if nothing about it feels... "solid", like there's a very unsatisfying disconnect between the player and everything you interact with. It's almost like the cursor is hovering over a sheet of glass the entire time and never really touching what's on the other side. This would seem to suggest it started off life as a tablet game (where it would be perfectly suited), but apparently this isn't the case.\n\nThis isn't a bad game, by any means, but with its lacklustre feel and complete absence of any additional game modes beyond the 55 stages on offer, what could have been a really great game instead, frustratingly, is only a good one for casual puzzle fans to enjoy.","January 14, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There are many blocks on the board, and your goal is to clear areas of two or more to clear them. The catch is that all connected blocks must be cleared at once by drawing a path through them that touches all blocks exactly once. Connecting blocks that match the goal color bring the level closer to completion.\n\nThe game tries to be relaxing in aesthetics and in sound, and it succeeds. I don't care much for it, personally.\n\nI'm not a fan of these sorts of puzzle games, since there is little reward for carefully-planned moves. I found this game boring pretty quickly, but I thought the same of Bejeweled, which is quite popular. If you like Bejeweled, then you may alo like Lucid. I don't think I'd recommend it otherwise.

It started out pathetically easy, but by level 50 the game had become fiendishly difficult (though the occasional checkerboarding seems a bit forced).  As of this review I still haven't beaten the penultimate level.\n\nThe line-drawing also adds a surprising amount of depth.  This mechanic lead to me starting to call shapes that couldn't be properly drawn "monstrosities", since if I couldn't somehow settle them into a better shape and eliminate them, they would inevitably begin to catch more of more of their color and spread like a spiky cancer through the board.  You have to be careful not to create them (or feed existing ones) if you can ever help it, but eventually one will slip through.  Often this can spell doom, but every so often you can manage to pull off a win before it gets too bad, which feels great.\n\nThe static starting boards are paired with randomized tasks to create the challenge.  On certain late levels it's even advisable to restart until you get better starting tasks, so that you can clear a designed big group and complete a task at the same time for a big head start on the completion meter.  More difficult tasks in the later levels also attempt to ensure that you can't manage to chain them to create a Lucid block, forcing you to deal with the beginning board's complications the whole way through, rather than randomize the board and make things easier on yourself.\n\nMy only complaints would be that the "zen" music gets grating rather quickly, and a personal complaint that I did not buy this to get a hard game.  Despite its difficulty it remains fun, though.  It's a pretty good puzzle game.","January 26, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It started out pathetically easy, but by level 50 the game had become fiendishly difficult (though the occasional checkerboarding seems a bit forced).  As of this review I still haven't beaten the penultimate level.\n\nThe line-drawing also adds a surprising amount of depth.  This mechanic lead to me starting to call shapes that couldn't be properly drawn "monstrosities", since if I couldn't somehow settle them into a better shape and eliminate them, they would inevitably begin to catch more of more of their color and spread like a spiky cancer through the board.  You have to be careful not to create them (or feed existing ones) if you can ever help it, but eventually one will slip through.  Often this can spell doom, but every so often you can manage to pull off a win before it gets too bad, which feels great.\n\nThe static starting boards are paired with randomized tasks to create the challenge.  On certain late levels it's even advisable to restart until you get better starting tasks, so that you can clear a designed big group and complete a task at the same time for a big head start on the completion meter.  More difficult tasks in the later levels also attempt to ensure that you can't manage to chain them to create a Lucid block, forcing you to deal with the beginning board's complications the whole way through, rather than randomize the board and make things easier on yourself.\n\nMy only complaints would be that the "zen" music gets grating rather quickly, and a personal complaint that I did not buy this to get a hard game.  Despite its difficulty it remains fun, though.  It's a pretty good puzzle game.","January 26, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many blocks on the board, and your goal is to clear areas of two or more to clear them. The catch is that all connected blocks must be cleared at once by drawing a path through them that touches all blocks exactly once. Connecting blocks that match the goal color bring the level closer to completion.\n\nThe game tries to be relaxing in aesthetics and in sound, and it succeeds. I don't care much for it, personally.\n\nI'm not a fan of these sorts of puzzle games, since there is little reward for carefully-planned moves. I found this game boring pretty quickly, but I thought the same of Bejeweled, which is quite popular. If you like Bejeweled, then you may alo like Lucid. I don't think I'd recommend it otherwise.

I know puzzle games are meant to get challenging in later levels, but a more gradual and consistent increase in difficulty over the span levels might have been better. Also I felt the difficulty between levels wasn't always consistent. For example I personally really struggled with level 52 and needed many restarts, yet got through level 53 on my first attempt.  In general though later levels will probably require several restarts.\n\nMy only other complaint is that the delete save button is directly below the play button, and is very easy to hit by mistake (especially with a touch pad). If you do your game is just deleted with no warning or confirmation window forcing you to start over.\n\nAll in all an enjoyable puzzle game, despite it's faults,  and well worth checking out.","March 1, 2014","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
