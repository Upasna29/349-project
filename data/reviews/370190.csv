The dull bosses that serve as bullet sponges rather than an example of any care in design is the icing on the cake.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/recommended/370190/","undox","undox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/","4205 products in account","Being this is a bullet-hell game, having fast-paced gameplay is expected.  However, the games suffered from wrong pacing.  In each stage, the player will go through a few minor enemies, and then fight a boss after only 30 seconds.  After that boss is defeated, a few more minor enemies and another boss will appear again after 30 seconds.  Having bosses so close to each other each, it lessens the pleasure of defeating each one.  If the stages had the bosses spaced a lot further apart, it would have made the action much better.\n\nOne thing that could be considered a plus and a minus is the fact that your ship is auto firing the entire time.  Logic says that this is good because you do not have to think about pushing any buttons in order to attack.  However, when you are trying to avoid the enemy bullets, this will cause both shots to blend together making it harder to avoid.  The way that the player controls the firing is by occasionally using one of its special shots.  However, there are times when defense is more important then offense.  Without being able to stop shooting when you want, being able to avoid damage is more difficult than it has to be.\n\nSpeaking of which, getting hit seems to have the wrong feeling to it.  If a shot does hit your ship, there will be a slight pause in the action.  Otherwise, things keep moving as if nothing happened.  In other games like Gradius or Raiden, getting hit will have a clear impact on your ship if it does not destroy it.  Seeing no damage does to your ship gives the false sense of security that it is still in good condition.  When you consider that there can be dozens of enemies and bullets on screen at one time, knowing how you are doing through your ship is vital.  The only time you know that is by turning up the difficulty to hard where only one shot is needed to destroy your ship.  Considering the volume of enemies, that could be suicide.\n\nWhile it is a decent amateur game, it is not one worth recommending.  This game is available at http://blackshellgames.itch.io/ruzhdelta for free.  If you are curious about the game, get it there.  After playing it, if you still it is worth paying for, do it then.","May 22, 2015","false","1.0"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","25","35","0","0"

To name a few.. Getting hit pause the screen for 1/4 of a second and it feels really weird. The sound is very very basic and doesn't really fit the game. 30 second of minor enemy between each boss is way too quick and make you feel less satisfy of killing each of the boss.. Having 3+1 stage just feel short and cheap...\n\nAny how .. it's a improved indie bullet hell shooter. There are much better ones out there but this one is quite cheap so you can win from different giveaway for free or just spend 1 dollar to pick a copy for a few minutes of fun...\n\nBeing a Touhou Vetern I was able to blast though easy difficulty on first try and i have no doubt that i can do the same with normal and brutal as i learn each of the boss better... I will however stop playing this game because it's just way to simple.\n\nI will not recommend this game for the same reason.. too Simple! I do however encourage developer to keep on trying and one day make a game that's better and have more content.\n\n4/10 would be my final rating.\n","October 8, 2015","false","0.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

It's up to you to avoid a maximum of them, though you'll be hit quite a lot.\n\nTrue, I've played 11 minutes. But it's enough to try the 3 stages and the 2 ships. Indeed, each of them has special attacks, which takes energy. However, it must be earned, I don't know how though. But each attack will be useful with your screen full of dangers. The first stage, for example, is beginning on a boss, even in the easy difficulty, where you have 200% for your life. After 1 minute, I was already out...\n\nThe graphics are reminding me of old games, as the soundtrack. Anyway, it's very bright and colorful, which is nice.\n\nHowever, Ruzh Delta Z isn't the game you're playing for hours, it's there when you need a break and when you need something different for a few minutes. What I know is that I'll probably never played it again, as bullet-hell games aren't at all my cup of tea. I won this if I remember well and I don't regret it.\n\nGiven the fact that it's not my cup of tea, I could put a thumb down. However, the game is well-polished, perhaps short, but well polished and at least, contrary to Exceed, it's in English. If I remain objective, the game deserves a thumb up. For the price, it's good. Would have it been higher, I would have been more negative,\n\nNah, the game is maybe sober but if you love challenge, Ruzh Delta Z is a good little one.","December 21, 2015","true","0.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"
