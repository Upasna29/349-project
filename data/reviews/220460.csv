The game itself is relatively bare-boned, as it does not have many different enemies, weapons, or environments.  What makes it an interesting game is the randomly-generated-world dynamic and the addictive, goal-oriented meta-game that involves collecting items (cargo).   Cargo Commander is one of those games that is fun to pick up and play on those occasions you want to play something with simple mechanics and that doesn’t require too much attention.\n\nCargo Commander is considered by many to be a rogue-lite game because it has randomly-generated worlds and a (quasi)single-life mechanic.  The randomly-generated worlds (sectors) are created uniquely based on the name given to them.  You can type in any series of alphanumerical units to create a new sector.  Once it is created, it remains the same forever.  This includes for all other players.  You also can visit old sectors which have already been created by other players.  I thought this was a fun and interesting dynamic; but be aware that this functionality of the game only works in online mode (as well as leaderboards and achievements).\n\nI think the way “death” is handled in the game is perfect.  It is not the kind of game where one mistake and death means the past two hours of gameplay meant nothing.  You still keep all the cargo  you collected— and since the whole meta-game revolves around collecting cargo, that means that you get to keep your progress even after dying.  That said, dying isn’t completely irrelevant or immaterial.  In each randomly generated sector you must reach at least a certain point without dying so you can retrieve the “sector-pass,” and gain access to a new area.  If you die, the sector restarts.  It generally takes 5-10 minutes to reach the “sector-pass” in each.\n\nThe environments are bare and repetitive, so don’t expect to be awed by the graphics.  But the soundtrack is rather catchy and fits the addictive nature of the game.  The gameplay is also quite simple and unvaried; the first hour of gameplay will be basically the same as the tenth.  But it is also this simplicity that makes the game enjoyable and addictive.\n\nPut simply,  Cargo Commander is styled to have simple mechanics and not require that much concentration, but with a long and “grindy” meta-game.  That common underlying style is then refined into a 2D-platformer with rouge-lite elements.  If that sounds like the kind of game you generally enjoy, then you will probably enjoy this thoroughly.  For others who are on the fence regarding the genre, you will probably get a few hours of enjoyment from this, but may then get bored.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","August 24, 2015","true","17.6"," 73 of 79 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","73","79","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/220460/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Players begin their career as a Cargo Commander in a perfectly square space station that functions as their home for the game's duration. The space station contains all the necessary tools for a successful career, including a computer for checking email and changing levels (known as sectors in the game), an upgrade bench for buying new equipment and upgrading the commander's armor and weapons, magnet control for attaching additional cargo containers for exploration, and even a coffee machine when in need of that extra boost of caffeine.\n\nAs players begin each day in space, they are given a defined number of loot items to gain and eventually a key that rewards access to additional sectors. If players die in the process of collecting the loot, they begin a new day and try again to acquire the specified loot. As cargo containers are brought crashing into the space station through use of the magnet, their exteriors are covered, requiring players to drill into them before seeing what treasure or trap is waiting inside. Once players enter inside a container, the 2D platforming aspect of the game takes control and tasks players with collecting loot items and dodging the attacks of enemies while fleeing for safety.\n\nEach container houses loot items that vary in rarity and value in addition to hostile alien creatures that complicate the process. After a short time, the cargo containers start to break apart as a result of violent wormholes which require players to grab the loot and rush back to the space station before their supply of oxygen is depleted. The entire process of drilling into cargo containers, frantically searching for loot, battling violent alien creatures, and finally rushing back to the space station is both a thrilling and extremely-gratifying experience.\n\nLoot and other forms of currency in the containers can, in turn, be spent on upgrades for the commander character that range from reinforced armor to extended oxygen while in space. The catch is that the upgrades are reset upon each day or after your character meets their fate, which creates a roguelike atmosphere of gameplay. As players advance in levels, which is determined by the amount and rarity of loot earned, they are rewarded with upgrade points that are replenished each day. More advanced upgrades include improvements to the space station, one of which is that it can auto-repair itself after losing walls from crashing containers.\n\nBeyond collecting loot, players can travel to other sectors that are simply just different leaderboards based on their given names. The only interaction that players have online is the competition of leaderboard scores and the discovery of other dead commanders within containers. It's unfortunate that the game did not include an actual multiplayer component as cooperative loot collecting would have been an absolute blast. After awhile, the leveling system and loot collection become repetitive as the gameplay, never evolving beyond the core mechanics. Day after day, players continue with the same menial task as aliens become stronger and loot more difficult to acquire. Without convincing a couple of friends to compete for the highest score of loot collection, the platforming entertainment of Cargo Commander becomes more mundane than engaging.\n\nThe presentation of Cargo Commander shines in nearly all of its aspects, from the pixel-shaded visual appearance, or the outstanding sound effects, to the lack of any sound while floating about in space. The most impressive graphical element is the destructible environments of both the commander's space station and cargo containers. Either using his drill or planted explosives, it's a thrill to tear apart any surface that is between the commander and his hunger for more space loot. In regards to the game's sound, details like the volume of the station's radio music becoming dimmer as the player floats further into space is a brilliant touch. The only downside with the presentation is that the game's environments of cargo containers never vary that greatly and after awhile can become just as mundane as the gameplay.\n\nThe elements of a 2D platformer, space, zero-gravity, destructive environments, and loot collection combine for an experience that is both entertaining and addictive for the beginning hours. As additional levels are gained and higher scores earned, the gameplay experience never quite evolves beyond its initial premise. Players that have a group of friends for online leaderboard competition will undoubtedly discover more value with the end game. 2D platformer and space enthusiasts are sure to find something they'll enjoy in Cargo Commander, while those seeking a more varied game will have to look elsewhere among the stars.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 8, 2015","true","12.5"," 56 of 69 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","56","69","0","0"

The levels ("sectors") are randomly generated, and it's up to you to rush into theses containers to get as much loot as possible before your inevitable demise.\n\nOn the one hand, the game will immediatly grab you. It's fast, it's fun to get loot, and there is a fair bits of tactics to get the most out of each container, without taking too much risk.\nThe game also has lot of dark humor. You had to provide for your family so you decided to take what is probably the worst job of the Universe. Your company doesn't care at all about its workers and their safety, they only care about their profit, and will pay as low as they can, while charging as much as they can for basic equipment. To not worry your wife about all this, you lied to her and she now write you thinking you're just a basic warehouse worker giving a very surreal feeling to her messages.\n\nOn the other hand, "finishing" the game, ie getting all the different type of loot feel more like a chore than anything. Each sector has only 5 or 6 different types of loot, and you have almost no way of knowing what you will get (you get some "scanners" that help you, but they are limited). So you go through a level, hoping to get the loot you're looking for, and if you're lucky, you will get maybe one new type of loot. But they are more than 80 to get ! That's a lot of sectors to explore, and the game doesn't have enough variety to make that grind really fun.\n\nIt tooks me 11H to get 2/3 of the items, but it felt twice as long and i stopped. Then a year later it took me another 13h to get the final third of the loot. That was pure grind, very repetititve and not fun. It's only my usual urge to complete games that made me finish that one.\n\nGiven the price of the game, it might still be worth it. It's fun for a while, you don't feel cheated. However, it's sad that it doesn't have lasting appeal. There are definitely better games out there.","March 15, 2014","false","24.3"," 88 of 129 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","88","129","0","1"

Basically no new concepts, enemies, weapons, abilities, etc. are added.\n\nThere's basically 5 or so different types of enemies that mostly vary based on size (this guy is the same as the last one except a big larger, with more health and more damage!). The cargo you collect has no meaning or purpose other than "collect them all because you can!"\n\nThe upgrade system can almost trick you into playing more, until you realize that the number of upgrades are tiny and they reset at the end of every day, so the only sense of progression comes from ranking up, which gives tiny, boring advantages (often something like "you start with this small upgrade without having to buy it!"\n\nThe general concept is "you activate a big magnet on your ship, then rectangular cargo containers crash into your ship and you run from container to container collecting items, ammo, killing enemies, etc." Except the enemies are limited, there's 4 weapons, and the building layouts quickly repeat themselves. It's vaguely amusing for the first hour or so, and then you quickly get tired of it.

It looks like a simple 2d platformer/shooter with some low gravity physics fun... and it is, but it's also much more.  Cargo Commander is impressive in it's ability to draw you in despite being a 2d 3rd person game.  You will freak out when hordes of aliens start to overwhelm you, you'll panic as you coast through the void of space as your oxygen rockets toward empty, the black hole ripping apart everything around you as you scramble to find a way into a pressurized container.  You'll feel the sense of isolation and frustration of being alone in space, away from your family.  The game is drenched in a purposeful pervading sense of loneliness.  It's a wonderful immersive game, and despite losses and defeat the game is designed where each trip adds up to some progress, making you stronger and more able to take on challenges next time.\n\nA note about the story elements of the game (spoiler?- speculation mostly):\nI have a theory about the enemies that litter the random cargo containers are actually mutated versions of your player character from alternate timelines.  There's some major weirdness going on with the black holes and the fact that you can continue playing where you left off after death.  Additionally the enemies drop Caps, the games currency which is also a literal baseball cap, identical to the one you wear.\n\nSummary: Pick up Cargo Commander.","May 5, 2014","true","4.4"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/220460/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Cargo Commander caught me totally off-guard. I was expecting something more traditional, with set levels and power-ups and some goofy story. What I got was a deceptively clever roguelike that started eating hours of my time, at least once I got over some rough patches.\n\nYou play an employee of Cargo Corp, sent off to the ♥♥♥-end of space in a boxy little junker of a ship to salvage equally junky boxes. Your ship is equipped with a magnet that, when activated, draws in a random assortment of giant space containers to smash into your ship and each other. Within these containers are the random bits of space junk Cargo Corp wants, along with enemies, hazards, and weapons to handle them. Connected containers usually have gaps to pass through where they collide, forming a rudimentary platforming level, but you can also drill through walls or spacewalk (as long as you can hold your breath) to get where you want to go.\n\nSurviving enough waves of salvage gets you a container with a sector pass, which lets you travel to another area of space with different containers and salvage. Sectors are random based on their name, and the navigation system shows you popular systems, unpopular systems, systems your friends play, random systems, and even let you enter your own name to create a new one. It's a neat bit of continuity between players, further bolstered by the player corpses you can find and loot in heavily-trafficked sectors, and postcards from other players you can find randomly, or fill out and shoot into space if you find a blank one.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, that's it. You call in waves of containers, loot them for cargo and resources to upgrade your dude (which reset for each sector), and get back to your ship before the "level" gets sucked back into space. There are basically two kinds of enemies in the game, melee monsters of varying size in the containers, and aggravating drill-squid things in space. You can find and upgrade a handful of weapons to deal with them, but combat is pretty thin and it's easy to get overwhelmed. The platforming isn't much better, with the random containers sometimes making regular exploring impossible and forcing you to drill out tons of walls or spacewalk around obnoxious areas.\n\nWith each sector essentially the same aside from items to find and container layouts, the game risks getting repetitive very quickly. I was about ready to punch out after 90 minutes or so... until I started paying attention to the story. Cargo Commander has a surprisingly dark, dystopian plot propping up the platforming, told through darkly funny emails from corporate and charming letters and packages from your family. As you tick off the the 88 different kinds of cargo to find, you rank up with the company, getting you new tools to speed up the process and maybe making progress towards getting home someday.\n\nThe whole package is far more compelling than I first thought, and I find myself returning to it whenever I have a free moment. The graphics are pretty basic indie 3D and the sound design works well enough, but it's the unique roguelike format married to an interesting world and story that keep it fresh. There are leaderboards for each sector and an endless mode to challenge if you need more variety, but even without those details Cargo Commander is worth digging into.","February 1","true","3.4"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

The sound effects and music are decent, however, the radio can get annoying fairly quickly. I like how the music volume is proportionate to how close you are to the home container. Once you gain a few (persistent) levels, you will unlock a music player, allowing you to use your own music. Keep in mind, however, that you must use audio files in .wave or .ogg format (never seen the latter before).\n\nThe controls are easy to familiarize yourself with, and the initial tutorial is quick and very helpful. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with action platformers and/or rogue-likes. One of the most difficult aspects of the game is balancing your risk (going deeper into containers further away from the home base) and upgrade path - failure to achieve a proper balance will result in you getting quickly steamrolled by enemies that get progressively stronger with each new wave.\n\nThe main idea behind Cargo Commander is to amass as much loot as possible. Each sector you are in will yield a total of 4 higher-tier loot, forcing you to travel to different sectors if you wish to collect all possible loot (and also advance in levels, because more unique loot = more experience gain). After completing a few waves, a cargo container with a sector key will appear, and if you collect it you will be able to use it to unlock a new sector. Unlocking new sectors allow you to either select a pre-existing one (all user-generated), or create your own. You can move to and from unlocked sectors for free. Dying will end your "run," bringing you to the score distribution screen.\n\nIf you manage to be the top scorer in your sector, your character will spawn with a golden crown. Besides the scoring competition, you cannot directly interact with other players. During your playthroughs, you will eventually come across postcards. If they are empty, you can leave a message on them for others to find. The pictures on the front are randomized, and you can write whatever you want on the back.\n\nAs you progress through the game and level up your character, you will gain new perks - like starting with 10 currency and an upgrade bench. Using the upgrade bench is essential to surviving, and you can tailor your upgrade path to suit your playstyle. For example, levelling up your armor (health) and weapons versus levelling up your oxygen capacity and speed.\n\nYou will periodically receive parcels from your family back on Earth, and you can purchase these by using any of the loot you have already found (until the total cost has been satisfied).\n\nEnemies spawn from crystals, which will keep spawning creeps until you destroy them (if you choose to). You can drill through most walls, and opening a container to hard vacuum to suck out your enemies is always fun. You can fly (or even skip) from container to container, however, the longer you stay in space, the higher the chance of scavengers spawning. This enemy type is weak, but very annoying - if enough of them spawn, you may have trouble staying alive.\n\nAfter a set amount of time, a wormhole will appear, pulling apart all of the containers violently. You must balance and risk moving further away from your home base in order to find more loot. A challenging part of this game is your character automatically orienting to match the plane of each container. Due to this, trying to move from one container to another can be difficult at first - you will eventually learn to use this to your advantage (ex: hurling yourself toward your home base by jumping out of a container at the right angle).\n\nThe rogue-like elements come in the form of procedurally-generated, randomized cargo container spawns for each wave and permadeath. The "main" loot (4 for each sector) is specific for each sector you play in, but all other loot types are randomized as well. There is a small, shiny, blue container that is typically a "treasure" container with at least 1 piece of main loot, however, it can also sometimes have useless items. As you level up (through loot acquisition), you will gain more bonuses like extra starting cash, an upgrade bench, etc. Using the upgrade bench provides bonuses exclusive to your run, and are lost when you restart. The difficulty progression also ramps up with a fairly relentless pace - if you skip too many containers per wave, expect to die very early.\n\nOverall, the game is very fun and challenging - and any rogue-like and/or action platformer enthusiasts should definitely give Cargo Commander a try.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","November 10, 2014","true","4.0"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","5"

TAKE THIS -> *Reading Skills*\n\nCargo Commander is a 2D Shoot em up, Collect em up (If thats a thing) Platformer. What you first notice about the game is it's very Retro-Style graphics.\n\nIn Cargo Commander, you play as a lonely man sent out to space to collect cargo in your cozy Home Container which has everything you need, including a maintenance system, and sector navigator, and console for all your information, a magnet that will pull cargo containers towards you, and COFEE. Every undiscovered piece of Cargo collected will progress you to your next level, which unlocks cool things such as a improvements to your home and your suit, and even a new mode. A very unique thing about Cargo Commander is your drill, available to your disposal at any time. With this tool, you can drill through almost any wall, ceiling or floor, and you can upgrade it to increase its speed. This allows you to modify routes inside randomly generated cargo boxes that fly at you from your (very powerful) magnet, so you can get cargo easier.\n\nAnother cool thing is it's upgrade system. In level 2, you get an upgrade table in your Home Box thing which allows you to upgrade things such as your drill, ammo, suit etc. Every upgrade you get lasts only for one day, which ends either manually, or when you die, and when it does, all your collected cargo is counted. To be able to upload your cargo, you need to be at your home with all the cargo collected for the specific wave, because if you die, all the cargo you collected after leaving your home will be lost.\n\nThere are also 3 types of cargo rarities. There's Common, Rare and Ultra-Rare, and each of these give you more XP. Enemies drop caps which are points you spend to upgrade things. Every upgrade costs a specicfic amount of caps, so spend wisely.\n\nIn every "Sector" you visit, there is a sector pass. A Sector Pass allows you to unlock new sectors at a machine called the Navigator, inside your home. Every sector isnt different at all, it just features a different leaderboards and a new sector. If you have surpassed a player in a leaderboard, you will be able to see the player's dead body in a random cargo box, where he died. You can loot this body for caps, and ammo for the 5 unique weapons featured in this game.\n\nI'm done my "Review" but there are many more features to this game I didn't discuss.

CG was the second Rogue-like game I played, the first being Dungeon of the Endless.\n\nPros:\n-Fun gameplay\n-Acceptable and fitting graphics, albeit not awesome\n-The types of cargo and their descriptions provide a bunch of laughs\n-Since the sectors are procedurally generated, but the name is the seed, you can both play places others visited (including discovering and looting their corpses) as well as creating entirely new sectors\n-While unfortunate impossible encounters are probably possible, they're extremely unlikely, so dying is at least your fault\n-If played strategically it should be possible to discover every type of cargo (with help of the scanner for the last pieces) without needing a walkthrough (I only needed a hint for 1 cargo type, because I spent my scanners too early)\n-Journey allows to infinitely travel a sector without pesky scroungers (those annoying flying space drills)\n-Weekly Struggle gives one random sector each week which can be played only ONCE, so it's nice for competitiveness (though there don't seem to be many players left)\n\nCons:\n-Short life span: The game can be finished with every achievement and trying out everything there is in less than 30 hours\n-Low replay value. Since you can't spend the cargo you find on anything after you received parcels, the replay value drops drastically down to Journey and Weekly Struggle\n-While at first it seemed rather polished I manged to find quite a few bugs in the end\n-At times the gravitational orientations can create annoying circumstances, requiring unconventional paths to circumvent\n-Supbar music (in my opinion at least, I'm sure others can like it more than I do)\n\nBugs:\n-Game breaking after playing Journey: After I played a Journey round I couldn't play another, and the game didn't exit properly so I had to manually kill the process\n-Red Cargo Commander: Sometimes when being hit your character turns red, but doesn't turn back normal anymore\n-Bad clipping: Occasionally enemies and other stuff can glitch through walls\n\nAll in all I think playing this game was worth it. Maybe I'll come back for another Struggle or some Journeys, but due to the low replay value I guess that's mostly it for me.\nIf there ever would be a Cargo Commander 2 though, the potential for a masterpiece is definitely there.","June 24, 2015","true","29.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

I'm glad I was wrong. This has become one of my favorite indie games now.\n\nYou play as a cargo commander; a worker for the company known as Cargo Corp. You travel to many sectors collecting cargo from storage units that have flown about in space. From what I've seen just about every sector is user made... at least the names are. This is a rouge-like game where the sectors are formed depending on the name, and I've seen some "interesting" names.\n\nAs I said before, you enter the sector and the first thing you do is activate the magnet inside your home unit, which will pull in storage units for you to explore. From there you search these units for cargo, which is indicated by glowing blue boxes with a "C" on them. You can drill through most of the walls inside and outside the container (and your home unit) to get around faster or to make a route to better deal with or escape from enemies. I always loved the drill since it opened new ways to move around the area. It also saved my butt multiple times.\n\nOh yeah, you though it would be easy to get that cargo huh? Well most of the time you'll find mutants that only want to kill you. You also have to worry about not running out of oxygen when floating outside of containers. Lucky for you you have the weapons to do the job. A personal favorite og mine is the magnabomb launcher. Why put holes in them when you can just blow them up into pieces? Either way all the weapons work wonders and feel great to use.\n\nAs you go through these waves of containers, you'll notice that you've been collecting caps. This is the currency of the game, and it allows you to buy upgrades for yourself. Very useful since things get very rough in later waves. Also, if you want to go to other sectors, you need to have a sector pass to unlock one. You simply get them from one of the early containers of the current sector you're in, but you can only get one pass in each sector, which is nice since it encourages people to try other sectors and not stay on one grinding for passes.\n\nThe work day ends when you either hit "End Day" in your home unit or when you die. After that you get to see how well you scored compared to others that played the sector... and it made me remember that I didn't talk about the online player involvement in this. While you won't be seeing others playing at th esame time with you, you can at least see their dead corpses from their demise in the sector if they did die. You can even loot the bodies! You'll also find postcards written by others, which is always interesting what I'll get to read as I blow through a ton of mutants.\n\nEhhhh, back to end of the work day stuff, the next screen you'll see is the cargo you've collected and your current rank. As you find new cargo, your rank meter will go up, and once it fills up, you rank up and get an award that sticks with you for the rest of the game. Some of the really useful ones is the upgrade workbench, a terminal that lets you repair your home unit and lets you use your own playlist for the music that plays inside it, and upgrades.\n\nThe game controls really well, and it does make you pay attention to what's going on around you, as a container can slam outside and push you around a lot. I do recommend putting in your own music playlist for your home unit when you get the chance, otherwise you'll only have the two home unit songs that it provides. Oh yeah, there's also a taunt button where all he says is "♥♥♥♥ YOU!", so yeah... take that DMC.\n\nThat aside, I highly recommend this game to everyone that's looking for a good rouge-like game. this one does not disappoint.","September 27, 2014","true","20.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

CC has a simple premise and simple mechanics: cargo containers crash into your ship, and you must go inside to collect loot and kill monsters. In doing so, you transition in between areas with and without gravity, which leads to interesting cavorting and shifts in view. After a limited amount of time, the containers break apart and you must race back to your ship before suffocating in the vacuum of space.\n\nWhere CC goes above and beyond is in delivering value beyond the basic game. The cargo you collect gives you credits to retrieve the mail sent to you by your family. Emails periodically appear in your inbox from various people as well. Through them, you learn the story of why you are a cargo commander. It's the kind of bare and yet tastefully presented story that you can only find in a game which is lovingly made. The various weapons and upgrades form an intelligent strategic layer which varies based on your playstyle. And as the game goes on, you start to get an idea of why there are so many monsters in those containers too. "Multiplayer" leaderboards for persistent levels were also a damn smart idea. What else do you need to find out in a review? It's a bloody well-made game, and it's probably on sale for $0.99.

The visuals and sound only serve to enhance this feeling.  Realists may use the "silent space" option, but the ability to use your own music aboard the ship is outstanding.  The controls are excellent, and they should be, for a relatively simple platform game.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay matches too well the drudgery of space salvaging.  Sectors may be randomly generated but offer little challenge.  With over eighty cargo types and only six types per sector, the game is an exercise in patience rather than skill.

This game isn't even random, as the maps are based off of words and are infinitely replayable (as far as I can tell).\n\nI've been playing roguelikes for a long time, and this isn't anywhere near what I consider in the genre. You've got classic genre-defining games such as Nethack, Moria, or Angband, and modern representations of roguelikes such as Tales of Maj'eyal, Dungeons of Dredmor and Sword of the Stars: The Pit. I see no shared qualities between Cargo Commander and any of those. No roleplaying aspects, character generation, permadeath, or any of the other qualities you would hope to find in a roguelike.\n\nCargo Commander is a platform puzzle game, which I don't care for at all. So, I'm giving a negative review as a warning to others that may have had similar expectations. If you enjoy platformers or puzzle games, I'm sure this is great, but I do not enjoy them. I really tried to like it, but found it pointless, arbitrarily challenging, and ultimately unfun. The "loot" you find may as well be nameless widgets, as collecting items are simply for the purpose of checking them off of a list for completion's sake. That's really the bulk of the game. Unlock a new place, try to find an item you haven't found on your list prior, repeat until you're done and unlock the next place. It's tiresome.\n\nI would recommend you look elsewhere if you're looking for a roguelike. If you're looking for a platform puzzle game, check it out.

You have to deliver cargo, which you collect in the levels called sectors, for your company. You are able to upgrade your character with a better suite, a better drill and so on. To upgrade your stuff you need to collect caps. Caps are hidden in cargo or dropped by enemies. There are three enemy types: small, intermediate, big. You can find better weapons in the sectors at certain points to kill the bigger enemies much faster. You start with a nail gun and you can carry two weapons. Every weapon can be upgraded with things like an autofire option or faster reloading. At the start of the game you have three terminals (nagivator, console, magnet) at your spaceship which looks like a cargo crate. With the navigation console you can travel to other sectors. You can travel to popular sectors, unpopular sectors, random sectors or sectors which you are naming. Every progress of every player will be traced and save for the leaderboards.\n\nYou can find in each sector a new sector pass to unlock new sectors and each sector has it's own type of cargo. Every new type of cargo found will level your rank at you company. At each new rank your company will deliver you a permanent bonus like a cup of coffee (faster run), a terminal to repair your ship, ammunition supply, a better drill, etc. If you die and you have collected the sector pass it won't be lost, but all your upgrades will be lost. Yes - death, travel to another sector or going to sleep will reset your upgrades - they are all temporary except the upgrades from your company. Story ... is available but only as text by reading e-Mails at the console. You have a wife and a kid who will send you parcels or drawings from time to time. The e-Mails from the company have some kind of humor, so it's not only text to skip - it makes you smiling, if you died the tenth time and reading an e-Mail from your company, that they are proud of their new all-time-dying-employee. ^^\n\nSomething missed? Ah yes; it's created like a tower-defense. You start your spaceship magnet to pull up a new wave of cargo. The cargo containers will crash into your spaceship and then you are able to enter these containers. The ship's side and all the platforms can be bored with your drill (except one type of platform) to make your way through, because your way will be blocked by walls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pixtar/recommended/220460/","pixtar","pixtar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pixtar/","225 products in account","'Cargo Commander' is a 2D game where you have to collect cargo to upgrade your character, to level up by new cargo types and to prove your cargo company that you are the best of the best - a real cargo commander.\n\nDesc: TL;DR. ^^ You are a male protagonist working for a cargo company. You have to deliver cargo, which you collect in the levels called sectors, for your company. You are able to upgrade your character with a better suite, a better drill and so on. To upgrade your stuff you need to collect caps. Caps are hidden in cargo or dropped by enemies. There are three enemy types: small, intermediate, big. You can find better weapons in the sectors at certain points to kill the bigger enemies much faster. You start with a nail gun and you can carry two weapons. Every weapon can be upgraded with things like an autofire option or faster reloading. At the start of the game you have three terminals (nagivator, console, magnet) at your spaceship which looks like a cargo crate. With the navigation console you can travel to other sectors. You can travel to popular sectors, unpopular sectors, random sectors or sectors which you are naming. Every progress of every player will be traced and save for the leaderboards.\n\nYou can find in each sector a new sector pass to unlock new sectors and each sector has it's own type of cargo. Every new type of cargo found will level your rank at you company. At each new rank your company will deliver you a permanent bonus like a cup of coffee (faster run), a terminal to repair your ship, ammunition supply, a better drill, etc. If you die and you have collected the sector pass it won't be lost, but all your upgrades will be lost. Yes - death, travel to another sector or going to sleep will reset your upgrades - they are all temporary except the upgrades from your company. Story ... is available but only as text by reading e-Mails at the console. You have a wife and a kid who will send you parcels or drawings from time to time. The e-Mails from the company have some kind of humor, so it's not only text to skip - it makes you smiling, if you died the tenth time and reading an e-Mail from your company, that they are proud of their new all-time-dying-employee. ^^\n\nSomething missed? Ah yes; it's created like a tower-defense. You start your spaceship magnet to pull up a new wave of cargo. The cargo containers will crash into your spaceship and then you are able to enter these containers. The ship's side and all the platforms can be bored with your drill (except one type of platform) to make your way through, because your way will be blocked by walls. Every container has it's own gravity field, in some of them you can toggle the gravity via a terminal. You can exit always into the space to move directly back to your ship or to other containers. You will move faster in space by using the recoil of your weapon. You have to hurry within each wave, because after all containers have been arrived you have only a short period of time left until a warp hole is opening and one after another container will be released/destroyed.\n\nPros:\n+ nice game concept (haven't played anything like this before and I don't really like space games ^^)\n+ you will get a feeling of lostness (not because of a confusing level but rather of the space around you)\n+ humoristic mails\n+ controls working fine\n+ nice gravity\n+ graphics are okay (how to make space and metal looking awesome?! ^^)\n+ replayability (to collect new types of cargo to level up)\n(+ steam achievements)\n\nCons:\n- not really varied (three enemy types, same environment, same procedure)\n- the handling of the magbomb weapon is bad (really bad)\n- story is weak\n- no cutscenes\n(- no demo available)\n\nRecommended, even if it's not on sale, because it's a nice concept which sometimes feels repetitive, but it's great fun to upgrade by having a lost-in-space feeling.\n\n7.5/10","September 6, 2015","true","31.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a bit like Spelunky meets Metroid Prime, a little. I've never been terribly great at those mashups. It's like Spelunky because all of the "sectors" are generated based on their name (I'm not using the word random because every time you play in the same sector it's going to be exactly the same. This is intentional and important though, because it has leaderboards) so you could make a sector for just yourself or if you told your friends what it was called you could have a private match, which is pretty neat. You call in waves of crates, which will all pile up around your home crate then you have a variable amount of time to delve into them, you could find cargo, caps, enemies, a deathtrap of a crate, the list goes on. When time expires, though, a wormhole appears and you have just thirty seconds to get the hell back before everything goes ♥♥♥♥ up and all the crates fall away (The disintergration is fully realised with its physics engine making all the pieces collapse or explode out) Then you upgrade yourself with the caps and store the cargo until you get bored or die, the first of which is surprisingly difficult, the latter of which is surprisingly easy.\n\nThe other mode is Journey, where crates just fly at each other at random intervals and directions and if they touch each other they stop for about 3 minutes until they disintergrate. It sounds simple but it's a bit scary. I didn't know that the enemies could propel themselves back into crates by shooting backwards, let's say. That's another thing, the vacuum actually does suck (in the objective, not subjective way) and making a hole is a good way to clear out a room.","March 19, 2013","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are armed with a mechanical arm that has a drill, nailgun, and other things can be installed into it. It can also be used to flail away at enemies or containers.  The idea is that you live in a recovery module that can become a giant magnet to attract other modules. Those modules contain spare parts and other goodies that you collect. To enter those other modules requires a quick jump through airless space. These modules are attracted in random numbers and you have a limited timeframe to search them before a wormhole destroys all the freefloating modules. These modules can also contain aliens that will whittle away your health and distract you. You can also use up your limited ammo attacking them. You need to balance your time by figuring out the quickest way to collect things before you find yourself flailing in space while the modules you were in become destroyed. All in all the gameplay is quick, light, and fun.\n\nMy only gripe is that this game seems like it would be a good fit for kids, but if you tap a key/button (it has full controller support) too many times or hit a certain key, your character suddenly starts spouting profanities (which are also flashed around your character). While it could be funny if that's your slant, it otherwise feels out of place, and a cry to try to get a certain demographic to play the game. I think the gameplay could stand on it's own without the strange humor, but I think it could potentially limit younger audiences, and polite society, from playing it. I give this game a conditional recommendation based on that premise.","April 29, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll admit, I never got that good at it and mainly bought it for the cards.  (Yeah yeah, so sue me!)  Anyway, being bored here is another huge manefesto of misspellings and bad jokes that I call a review.\n\nIs the game fun?  Well if you enjoy battling with undead co-workers (who don't look like zombies); if you lust after scouring for neon accented crates filled with baubles and trinkets; if you revel in the cold vaccumesqe of space then yes, you will have fun with this game.\n\nYou start equiped with a fist-gun ala Barret, and pressing the "F" key shows you're just as vulgar.  Regardless, our little chubby fister (Also a good title, if they want to use it.) has good reason.  His company has thrown him into the void, on a never ending quest to save up for his girlfriend! (Actually his wife, and artwork imparied child)  With country music pounded into his skull, on a never ending loop, he must use his cubed ship to ensare debris.  The debris is basically large cargo crates, but since you're also on the lookout for small crates I figured debris would be better.  (The verbose explanation defeated my plans...)\n\nAnyway, you use a magnet to get the "debris" to attach to your home.  After a short wait "boom" the thing arrives, and the level begins.  (That's right, this has roguelike elements to it! Woo!)  Navigating the maze that is the level, you pick up weapon upgrades (which do not stay with you at the end of the day, that makes sence if you know what it means.)  There are spawners spawning spawns that must be pwned (spwned?)  As well as the neon crates that you want to grab (these increase your level score, which is what is shared to all players on leaderboards.)\n\nAfter a random amount of time, and debris smashing into itself enlarging the level, a wormhole will open.  This destroys each crate, probably starting with the one you're in...(last to hit debris, to first to hit your house debris)  If you're blown into space, there is no worry.  You have a small supply of air that should last till you get back into the debris, or your home.  Anti-gravity maneuvers are a bit more skill driven though!\n\nOnce you're tired of gathering boxes, or you get the "end level item" you begin the End of the Day!  This calculates your score, and plasters it on the leaderboards.  (Or in my case, the trailerboards.  Boy did I stink!)  All in all this was a lot of fun, It's not my bag of chips, but like I said I just wanted the cards.\n\n7/10 (I can still respect a good game, even if it's not for me.)","February 22, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/220460/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Cargo Commander is a very interesting game, to me. It has some more serious aspects in its setting and story, but it covers it all up with tongue-in-cheek humour. It also has a very slow and game-y progression system, seemingly in place to justify the 10€ price tag.\n\n\nIf you look at the top reviews (both positive and negative), you'll see that the negative ones have considerably more playtime than the positives. There's a reason for that. The game gets very monotonous, completely desynchronized with its progressions pacing. It's one of those games that uses procedural generation and rare items to collect to extend its playtime in a ridiculous way. Reprisal Universe is a game that did something similar: the content is so sparse that the game loses a lot as a result.\n\nAnyway, this review will not be of much use to most people. If you want to know if the game is mechanically good, or whatever, you can check all the other reviews. I mostly agree.\nI liked the game, the execution is well done! Aside from the progression, anyway. The game has some little tricks that you have to learn, and it's a nice thing to pass time with. For a while.\n\nWhat is this review about, then? It's about how the game explores the darker themes.\n\nIn this game, you're stranded in space. You accepted a job of collecting cargo from containers lost deep in space. You're away from you family, with them not knowing what your job actually is. To top that, you're also victim of a big corporation, who has little to no regard of its employees, and uses a gamification system to keep them working, ranking up and give the illusion of progress. All that while doing the very menial work of collecting cargo.\n\nThere's a lot to think, with this premise. The game takes a humorous approach to it, though, which, in my opinion, leaves a big part of the game unexplored. It's a very mechanically oriented game: you're constantly trying to achieve something in the game, which doesn't leave much space for thought.\n\nHow does the game explore its themes, though? Well, there are mainly 2 aspects that I noticed. First, is how you encounter other cargo commanders -- players -- dead in some containers. You loot them for ammo, caps (upgrade currency), and the like.\nThe enemies also seem like mutated players. Confirming that you're not the only one out in deep space, and also that the company simply abandons its employees after death.\nThe other aspect is the mailing system. Every so often, you'll receive emails. Some are tutorials for a newly introduced system, some are from your family, and others are from the company, congratulating you on ranking up. Apparently, you'll also receive an e-mail from a lost employee asking for help -- but this one is very deep into the game, and I didn't get to that. Which goes to show how sparse the content is...\n\nThe most interesting aspect of these e-mails are SPOILERS how, eventually, the companies emailing system malfunctions, revealing the automated responses. They have <insert random compliment for - Obedience> instead of "we appreciate your loyalty" and things like that. When that happened, it gave me a very portal-esque feeling. Of how the company may have even ended, and there you were, still in space, now without any hope of every returning to your family... It can be a really dark game, at times. And that's awesome!\n\nWhile I do really like these aspects of the game, I don't think it takes a big advantage of them. For once, as I've mentioned several times already, the content is veeery sparse. Most players will probably not even get to that point, for the simple reason that the game doesn't really evolve much. It's interesting and new during the first couple of hours (perhaps a bit longer), but then it gets really stale. And getting an email every couple of hours really isn't enough to keep the interest high -- especially since the actual game, while random, gets a bit too formulaic.\n\nThen, there's the fact that these aspects are very disconnected from the action. It's a side thing, and players will treat as that. It's too game-y for it not to be like that, I guess.\nAlso, the fact that death is meaningless, kind of defeats the whole point, although this is a very feeble subject, for the time. I've seen a game called The Flock a few days ago -- apparently, it's a multiplayer game with actual perma-death. If you die, you can't play anymore. If everyone dies, the game closes.\nIt seems like a bigger game, so I people were very skeptical of paying for it. I'm assuming the skepticism would translate to small indie games as well. It's also a horror game, so that choice ends up influencing the game in a different manner... ANYWAY, I'm rambling.\n\nI'd like to see actual permadeath in some games. That would certainly make the player far more conscious of his choices, and hopefully enhance the experience, overall.\n\nIn this game, it doesn't happen, although it would have been a cool approach. Then again, not at all marketeable, so I understand why the game is like this.\n\n\n\nYeah, this was not a review at all. It was me rambling about some aspects that aren't even about the main game. On the positive side, I think I highlighted something that other reviews mostly fail to mention, so yeah.\n\nP.S.: I was experimenting with this idea of perma-death and multiplayer used as a "history"/mark, instead of competitive/cooperational play -- you know, finding dead players, sharing tips -- or traps -- like in Dark Souls...\nIf you're reading this, I'd like to know you opinion about it. Permadeath is risky, but I'd say it's worth it, if the game is explained accordingly -- and priced, I guess.\n\n","July 19, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Collect loot from space debris, avoid mutant creatures, and try not to die as you return to your "home container" before the work day ends.\n\nEasily one of the most downbeat (dare I say "grim"?) indie titles I've ever played, but it doesn't ever beat you over the head and it's entirely optional content. I honestly don't know if I'd continue the fool's errand of trying to collect all 88 cargo items if it wasn't for those little dribbles of a truly ♥♥♥♥ed up backdrop.\n\nAlso there's an endless mode you unlock a few "days" into the game.

Random words determine the shape and size and direction and contents of containers you have to deal with.

As you attract containers to explore, you can get more points to boost your equipment for a limited period of time and get even stronger equipment.\n\nThe game rewards those who explore and take risks, and the worst that can happen is you can end up in a sector that is too difficult to complete and you end up there for a while.

In truth, you're fighting for your life to salvage cargo from massive, crumbling containers in deep space, infested with the mutant remains of past salvage workers, littered with your predecessor's dead bodies, in the limited time before your home-ship's electromagnet triggers a wormhole to open and consume the cubes you've summoned.\n\nThe gameplay is a gravity-bending high-speed combat and exploration platformer with a rich upgrade system, with sectors generated by phrases you input, allowing you to visit sectors other commanders have before you (beat my high score on 'deathstar') to compete, or perhaps just to feel a little less lonely in the cold depths of space. Upgrades are short-lived, lasting long enough to finish the working day, and range from grippier boots to emergency oxygen tanks, from laser sighted revolvers to plasma-chambered shotguns, and as you earn promotions for your sterling salvage work your home ship will receive significant improvements as well.\n\nThe game is challenging, but you control the challenge - you decide whether to enter a particularly infested cube, you decide when to end the work day, and at the end, if you are killed in action or suffocate in open space, you'll be retrieved by medical robots and repaired, to wake up groggy for a new day.\n\nDon't forget to check your emails before you engage the electromagnet, and remember to grab a warm cup of coffee before you begin the working day...

CC is clearly a roguelike, despite it's friendly appearance. You have limited time per wave to clear cargo and former, now mutated employees from containers that smash into your home base for loot. Rank is basically your score, and increasing it will unlock the upgrade bench among other rewards. Killing enemies for caps lets you purchase upgrades (though, I hate that I didn't see an option to have more time). This game is intentionally hard, but I'm also not fond of the extreme time limit, ability to die easily from explosions, time consuming drilling, and platforming that's irritating when jumping around different gravity fields, wasting your precious time. Level design is repetitive and forgettable. The game has charm, but limited background music. Except those problem, I think my issues with CC boils down mostly to taste and not to quality.

I hate how the controls feel. I never felt in true control. It is perfectly responsive but that is not the issue. Jumping around is loose and inaccurate. Landing where you want is sometimes hit and miss. Attacking is a joke: your melee attack's hit detection is horrible. Sometimes I hit enemies, sometimes I sit there and try to while they hit me about four times but I never hit them. The ranged weapon isn't much better. It takes a ton of shots to kill bigger enemies and ammo is scarce. Floating around and drilling and navigating to other containers feels like a chore rather than fun. Keyboard controls are a nightmare, so I tried with my 360 controller. Jumping controls were better but aiming and attacking with both melee and ranged weapons was way worse.\n\nI am sure there are plenty of people to show that I am wrong and say that they had no trouble with the controls, I am in the minority I understand that, but it is not even just that. The game is just really odd and generic. If you think the controls are good then good for you. I have beaten some extremely hard games before and I never felt hampered by the controls.

Surprisingly collecting and hoarding cargo in different sectors gets strangely addictive as you tell yourself to go through one more round of cargo containers, searching for that one elusive super rare cargo.

It's one of those titles that is truly like nothing else. It's pretty simple, but there are a lot of unique elements that keep it fresh and the replayability high. You're a guy alone on a ship in space. You travel to various sectors (which exist online - I'll get to that in a moment) and use a high-powered magnet to crash giant containers into your ship, which you then explore in a 2D platformer style setting for cargo. There are monsters to fight on these containers and a variety of weapons to find. One of the really neat things about the gameplay is that other plays search these same containers when they play in the same sector you are currently in. If they die in one of the crates, you find (and loot!) their corpses. It's not a complicated game, but it has simple mechanics and goals that keep it enjoyable.","December 29, 2013","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You need to find 88 of them and that's gonna take some time. The game is not so easy at start but with time and level ups you get weapon upgrades, Cargo scanners and so on. On your search you will encounter mutants that you need to kill and they give you some caps to buy ammo or little upgrades for your next incoming load of cargo's. Once you die you lose everything and have to start over the level (a bit like Rogue Legacy but keep permanent upgrades) unless you have found a Sector Pass. With this pass you can travel to other sectors to search new containers. You also have a limited time to search. At first I thought it was annoying but in fact the time limit makes it more challenging and better, especially that you will unlock a mode called Journey where there is no time, well it is not that fun.\nMeanwhile there is a tiny little story in the background. I am not gone spoil anything but read your emails and pay your parcel deliveries :)\n\nThe game is not perfect, there are a few points that i would have liked different, for example traveling around space, a sector map like SPAZ did would have been excellent!  And the objects you found should be much more clear compared to the ones you still need to find. I am around 63 of the 88 now and i am getting a hard time to know exactly the remaining items i am looking for. a red square for example around the missing items would solve much! Sometimes i encounter a bug where i get stuck inside a cargo, so you need to wait a wormhole destroys it or you can suicide.\n\nAnyway I having a lot of fun and the permanent upgrades make it more and more enjoyable, it helps for example that i can start each time with 20 caps now :)\n\n9/10","December 31, 2013","true","36.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ammo and item conservation become the primary focus in later levels.\n\nI enjoyed this game enough to recommend it.","September 22, 2013","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Rush. No, leave it. Nah, skip it. 1 minute left. Don't bother. FFS, go! Get this and run back. 30 second. You won't make it. Stop killing and get back. 15 second. Wow, you are sol, no time to get there. Don't pick it up ffs, run to the exit... Game over. You lose everything.\n\nThat sums up my impressions. Constant time pressure kills the fun.\nYou can't explore. You can't kill the enemies. You can't collect loot.\nYou can rush though! Faster, faster, pfff, you are too slow. Time is up and you didn't manage to complete your the level. How fun... NOT.\n\nAll the game offers cannot be truly experienced as you are on a timer all the time. ALL THE F**** TIME.\n\nNice loot, strange enemies, fun combat, collectibles, randomly generated levels (which are in fact some cargo containers lost in space :P) - it all stays in shadow of a timer.\n\nBetween mission you stay in your base and do stuff, but that's just breaks between runs on another set on containers. You read e-mails from your family on Earth(?) and your co-workers, you improve your: tool, suit, boots and nailgun and you analyze the loot you collected. There is also a nice glassary which is a nice addition to the game. The collectible aspect is strong and the game is built around this, which in turn is a good excuse for more containers. It would all be nice if not the time restriction imposed on you to finish the current level.\n\nThe game has nice idea of sectors which contain different types of loot and of course different sets of containers. You can unlock new sector and replay them. In offline mode you can only play what you have discovered so far, no new things offline. New areas add variety and make game more fun. The problem is rogue-like nature of this game. If you die at any point you lose all your unlocks and you have to start the grind from scratch. You don't seem to keep the loot either. Another bad thing is: if you end your work day it means you finished your adventure in that sector. Replaying it will make you start the same level as before. Grind, grind, grind. What a waste of time.\n\nControls are good - you can rebind keys for both KB and controller. Graphics is good, and style is a mix of cartoon and celshading. Sound are ok and the music is great (western/redneck theme :P). Good performance.\n\nThis game would be fun, but sadly you don't have time to enjoy it as you are rushed in the main gameplay. Rogue-like nature also doesn't allow fun. It boggles my mind\nwhy devs torture their players. I have always though that games are supposed to be fun. Devs could at least make an easier mode and let the elitist skill obsessed nolifes play in their sandbox. I would love to enjoy this game in noob mode that doesn't punish you and allows exploration with no restrictions, cause why not?\nNot everyone is challenge obsessed and highly competitive.\n\nI can't recommend it. I have enough of rush in real life. I have enough of rogue-like experiences in real life. I play games to relax, not to get annoyed. Time is up. Get lost.\n","December 21, 2014","false","6.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

First off there is lots of light-hearted humor of the "Cog in the Corporate Machine type" The music that plays in your home base captures the mood perfectly. The gameplay is simple but engaging. Your job is to search Containers for cargo and get them back to your base. This is made harder by the fact that there is no clear route to do this and you will often have to make your own path through the containers. This "cut your own path" gameplay makes it fun and repeatable. The Sector system is a nice way to generate content and provide leaderboards.\n\nDefinitly a game to check out if you like platformers with Mouse-aimed guns.","November 10, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a drill that can break through a large number of walls and gives you the freedom to explore the cargo boxes your own way. There are four types of guns and you can hold two at a time, giving enough freedom in combat choices. Minor gripe would be a lack of ammo but that becomes less of a problem as you rank up.\nIt's not a game I can really handle playing lots and lots of at once but it's definitely an enjoyable experience to sit down and play a few different sectors. There's practically limitless sectors possible so plenty of replay value. And the cargo collecting aspect gives a sense of progression. The scanners you get in the middle of the game come at the right time too, helping you find the rarer cargo at a point where you've already gotten a lot of the more common ones. One thing I would've liked is invicibility frames, but ehh. I still enjoyed the game plenty, enough to finish the main campaign and all. I'd recommend it, especially since it seems to be on sale a lot.","November 12, 2014","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Imagine you live alone in space on a small ship. Imagine that your job would be to fly around with your ship untill you find a flying cargo and collect the lost items in that container. Got that?

Those tools are a drill which is used to drill through walls and other objects and you've got a weapon which is used to fight the monsters that inhabit the abandoned containers. The more items you collect in the containers the more points you get. But you only have a certain amount of time to explore a wave of containers because after a few minutes a black hole opens which sucks the containers inside. There are randomly generated sectors which consist of endless waves of containers. On the fith wave or so you can find a sector pass which can be used to unlock a new sector. Becuase of the fact that every sector is randomly generated the game could be played endlessly but for me it got boring rather quickly, What I've played was a hell of fun .

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/recommended/220460/","MysteryAlex","I Aten't Dead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/","258 products in account","Cargo Commander's the kind of game you really want to love but the longer you're around it the more flaws you see.\n\nThere's loads of things to upgrade, different playstyles, great atmosphere and soundtrack, challenging environments, nearly limitless worlds to explore, leaderboards, lots of collectables, and a button you can press to swear up a storm! Really if you're playing Cargo Commander for a few hours it's an awesome fun game with a slightly competitive atmosphere to it. The problems start rolling in when you actually attempt to COMPLETE this game.\n\nThere are 88 pieces of cargo scattered throughout the game world. You have about 20 scanners to help you find some of the harder to find ones, but once you attach them to a piece of cargo they don't come off. If you want to complete the game and return to your home, you need to collect every. single. one. This is where you NEED those scanners or help from friends in order to actually FIND those last few pieces. All the while you're replaying worlds and completing them to your best attempt, draining the desire to actually go around and explore the near limitless space available to you. On top of that, if you desire to compete in the leaderboards, each sector is only 12 waves long, effectively installing a top level cap on the sector. It isn't terribly difficult to complete all 12 waves either, as time goes on you'll find yourself getting through sectors with ease, often times holding onto a surplus of caps because you installed every upgrade along the way.\n\nThe absolute worst thing about this game is that it's mostly online only. There's a local game but that's a different save file altogether (for some reason). Online mode adds the leaderboards, the hundreds of thousands of sectors, and the random corpses of your failed fellow Cargo Commanders which hold stuff on them. Oh, and if you lose connection at ANY TIME while you're playing, then the game will freeze. If you don't get your connection back within ten seconds, you get instantly kicked back to the main menu. Everything you were doing during that in-game day will be lost as the game only saves after the results screen. So if you have spotty internet - like me - you'll lose fifteen minutes every now and again. Let's not get started on some of the bugs either.\n\nBut again, it aspires to be something great and for the most part pulls it off. Cargo Commander's fun, interesting, and packed with adrenaline, but the moment you start digging into it to see all it has to offer, you'll begin seeing a lot of the same, and just like its catchy theme, it'll begin getting on your nerves.\n\nPlay to experience, not to complete.","September 6, 2014","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basic gameplay is simple; you activate the magnet on your little spaceship, then run and gun through pods full of aliens trying to collect loot. Each 'sector' is procedurally generated based on its name, so there are a near-infinite amount of 'sectors' to explore. It does a great job of capturing the loneliness that must exist on someone away from their family, isolated in the void. Your son even sends you drawings! The one thing I don't like is the difficulty; because levels are procedurally generated, they don't really come in a learner-curve, and can be kind of mixed up. This wouldn't be so bad except you can't try out a new sector until you collect a 'sector pass' in a level you haven't found one in yet.

The gameplay consists entirely of collecting unknown cargo from various sized containers that you attract with your magnet. The only win condition is to collect all 88 or so pieces of unique cargo. You can only find 5 to 6 pieces of unique cargo per sector and you need to find sector keys to move on to another sector. Sectors are essentially the same void in space pulling in randomly generated containers.\n\nOnce you play through two or three sectors, you've pretty much experienced Cargo Commander.

The premise of platforming in space seemed like it would be fun and explorative; I was amped about the randomization. But instead of atmospheric looting, it's just a frantic dash through frequently inaccessible levels. The automatic gravity reorientation in particular was frustrating. I never reached the point where the random items collected seemed in any way meaningful; the promised upgrades simply didn't factor into what quickly became a tedious exercise in racing through boring stages. Overall, the design seems lazy and there just isn't much game here, and I am unwilling to slog any deeper into the mud looking for a nugget of entertainment. I had higher hopes for this one, despite some earlier poor reviews. Perhaps it will find a home with folks who enjoy repetition, randomization and quick turnover. But if you enjoy having more than a minute or so to explore a stage, the early part of this game are not for you. I have better things to do than wait for things to pick up.","May 10, 2015","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing too special but it does become addictive after learning the simple mechanics.\n\nYour job is to gather crates from different mini levels that come in waves and return them to your home space cubicle before a wormhole sucks everything up and finishes the wave. Each new procedurally generated sector (which is based on the names given to them) has 6 new items to hunt for based on rarity and you level up your character by gathering the materials from each sector. This is your main character level that stays persistent throughout your gameplay.\n\nOn the other hand, you can upgrade your weapons, life and other criteria as perks for the sector you're in. You die or leave the sector and your upgrades are nullified and reset to zero.\n\nYou can also unlock Journey Mode which removes the time limit of the normal mode but also your home cubicle is destroyed and you're forced to travel through continuous waves of containers.\n\nI don't think the game handles the rogue elements very nicely as the sense of progression is usually gone as soon as you find the 6 items in each sector. The only reason to keep playing that sector is high scores which I don't really care about.\n\nCargo Commander has a very nice atmosphere to it that truly immerses you in the vast loneliness of space and the horrors of running out of oxygen while drifting between containers. Your enemies are the mutated space zombies of other cargo commanders who have lost their lives (killing them gives you "Caps", the currency used to upgrade your character's arsenal) and while your home base has a cheerful vibe to it, everything becomes dark and forboding as soon as you leave it behind.\n\nThere are only 2 music tracks for the game that despite being pretty cool, become grating and repetitive after a couple of hours in. Thankfully you can play your own music (.WAV and .OGG only) by copying them into the game's playlist folder.\n\nThe precedural levels do start to look and feel the same with only shuffled platforms and enemy placements. Also, as long as you're in a sector, the levels will remain the same until you generate another sector.\n\nTechnically, the game can be a mess. It's frozen on me more than a couple of times and there's a lot of stuttering to be found in some areas. Nothing too dramatic but also very off-putting when you're surrounded by enemies and can't aim right because the framerate is all over the place. UI design for in-game menus are pretty poor.\n\nCargo Commander is a cool game marred by technical problems, very shallow overall game mechanics and a sense of utilizing but a fraction of the great innovations it has (drifting like crazy between space containers as a wormhole is sucking up everything while your oxygen is rapidly running out is a pretty exciting experience).\n\nBut I'll still give it a thumbs up because it was really fun while it lasted. It just didn't give me a strong enough reason to push on and continue playing after the first hours.","September 2, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not beautiful in regards to graphics but just the atmosphere of this game is amazing. There is one song that play's on the radio in game and it's just so lovely sounding and catchy. From the 3 or so hour's i've played on and offline, this has been the only song i've heard in the entire game. That being said it does'nt feel repitive at all and it's a nice little theme for the game. Now back to the actual game. In cargo commander you're a buff little guy who activates a magnet which pulls in large cargo crates to your small space shuttle.\n\nOnce they've made impact you have to go inside and get the precious cargo within and retrieve it back to your base without dying. Along the way there are a couple hazards. Such as rock monsters with little hat's who are gonna try and kill you when they see you, but don't worry, you've got a nailgun to fend them off!  Another major thing geting in your way is the fact that you are in space and to travel between cargo containers you must go into space without any protection, so you can die rather quickly if you aren't fast enough. The game eventually add's more containers as you progress into the galaxy, to add a bit more challenge to it.\n\nAll up this game is wonderful, if you're into fast speedy action games, this isnt for you. But if you're willing to take it slow and grab some cargo on your lonesome then this is the game for you.\n8.5/10\n\np.s.

In reality it's the needed "evil" to allow the possibility of "sharing" the maps alongside the postcard-messaging-system, which is yet another interesting addition to this game.\n\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a rather simple, easy-to-learn-game, this is well worth the asking price.\n\n--------\n--------","January 1, 2015","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The premise of platforming in space seemed like it would be fun and explorative; I was amped about the randomization. But instead of atmospheric looting, it's just a frantic dash through frequently inaccessible levels. The automatic gravity reorientation in particular was frustrating. I never reached the point where the random items collected seemed in any way meaningful; the promised upgrades simply didn't factor into what quickly became a tedious exercise in racing through boring stages. Overall, the design seems lazy and there just isn't much game here, and I am unwilling to slog any deeper into the mud looking for a nugget of entertainment. I had higher hopes for this one, despite some earlier poor reviews. Perhaps it will find a home with folks who enjoy repetition, randomization and quick turnover.

Nothing too special but it does become addictive after learning the simple mechanics.\n\nYour job is to gather crates from different mini levels that come in waves and return them to your home space cubicle before a wormhole sucks everything up and finishes the wave. Each new procedurally generated sector (which is based on the names given to them) has 6 new items to hunt for based on rarity and you level up your character by gathering the materials from each sector. This is your main character level that stays persistent throughout your gameplay.\n\nOn the other hand, you can upgrade your weapons, life and other criteria as perks for the sector you're in. You die or leave the sector and your upgrades are nullified and reset to zero.\n\nYou can also unlock Journey Mode which removes the time limit of the normal mode but also your home cubicle is destroyed and you're forced to travel through continuous waves of containers.\n\nI don't think the game handles the rogue elements very nicely as the sense of progression is usually gone as soon as you find the 6 items in each sector. The only reason to keep playing that sector is high scores which I don't really care about.\n\nCargo Commander has a very nice atmosphere to it that truly immerses you in the vast loneliness of space and the horrors of running out of oxygen while drifting between containers. Your enemies are the mutated space zombies of other cargo commanders who have lost their lives (killing them gives you "Caps", the currency used to upgrade your character's arsenal) and while your home base has a cheerful vibe to it, everything becomes dark and forboding as soon as you leave it behind.\n\nThere are only 2 music tracks for the game that despite being pretty cool, become grating and repetitive after a couple of hours in. Thankfully you can play your own music (.WAV and .OGG only) by copying them into the game's playlist folder.\n\nThe precedural levels do start to look and feel the same with only shuffled platforms and enemy placements. Also, as long as you're in a sector, the levels will remain the same until you generate another sector.\n\nTechnically, the game can be a mess. It's frozen on me more than a couple of times and there's a lot of stuttering to be found in some areas. Nothing too dramatic but also very off-putting when you're surrounded by enemies and can't aim right because the framerate is all over the place. UI design for in-game menus are pretty poor.\n\nCargo Commander is a cool game marred by technical problems, very shallow overall game mechanics and a sense of utilizing but a fraction of the great innovations it has (drifting like crazy between space containers as a wormhole is sucking up everything while your oxygen is rapidly running out is a pretty exciting experience).\n\nBut I'll still give it a thumbs up because it was really fun while it lasted. It just didn't give me a strong enough reason to push on and continue playing after the first hours.","September 2, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a "cargo commander", who lives in a floating home in the depths of space. You pull cargo containers up to your base via gravity generator, and it is your job to search these containers to find what else, cargo. The rarer the cargo is, the more unique items you add to your database. The more cargo, the higher your score in the sector you reside. You really feel the lonliness of space while isolated alone with no communication, but you still feel compelled to adventure and discover more of the void. It can have some glitches at times, such as being stuck between two containers and forcing you to die and end the mission as well as random texture issues, but the overall game functions pretty well.

If you have what little computer strength needed to get max graphics, it is stunning. And thanks to being a cartoony art style, even with minimum graphics, it still looks really good. Personally, I find it amazing how you can create your own sectors to challenge your friends or any random person who finds the same sector, along with having a very comedic item system.

Cargo Commander is a deceptively simple yet very engrossing game. If anybody tells you otherwise, there is even a "F U" button in-game you can introduce them to.\n\nSeriously though, drilling into containers 20 light years from anywhere in order to make money to send home to your wife and kid ( who send you emails and drawings/packages just as often as the corpoaration does), running through both containers and space (each container having its own gravitation field no less!) when a wormhole opens to swallow you and the containers whole, going one more wave to get another sector pass... hell, even just competing on that level's leaderboards is a treat, and wonderful atmosphere the game creates will both thrill you and break your heart every single time :) I'm not afraid to admit that this game moved me and resonated with me far more than I expected it to, and here is hoping it will for you as well!","December 2, 2012","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peanut/recommended/220460/","peanut","Hired Shoestring","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peanut/","328 products in account","Short Review:\n\nThis game is a nifty little Rouge-lite platformer. Worse than spelunky (well duh), better than Rogue Legacy. Has a great atmosphere and plenty of exhilarating spikes of tension. Plus it's funny!\n\nLong Review:\n\nCargo Commander. It sounds like the sort of self important handle I might have referred to myself with back when I played the space MMO Eve Online. Ah, those were the days; stick the ship on autopilot, make myself a brew, read the latest Andy McNab novel, deliver the goods, job done. Yet Cargo Commander shares very little in common with such tranquillity… except the space setting, and the brew… and I guess you might be able to replicate that inner peace with an incessant swearing session (just press the F key).\n\nCargo Commander plays out more like a day in the life of that guy from Alien. You know the one: the engineer; he’s very fond of his cap, sick of being screwed over by the company, and is the first to have his brains munched on. But at least now he can rest easy knowing that caps are finally receiving their due appreciation, serving as Cargo Commander’s much sought-after currency.\n\nSo, the deal: your new space-home is situated twenty light years from all forms of entertainment bar country music, emails from your wife and a coffee-machine (boasting +20% speed, seriously). Suitably bored yet? Then you might as well get to work.\n\nThis first involves turning on a magnet. Soon enough a massive space container comes crashing into your home. Initially equipped with your drill and nail gun, you voyage out in search of precious cargo.\n\nThe first haul is always relatively simple. You find your way in, hop on a couple of platforms, drill through a few walls, collect the cargo, return home and deactivate the magnet. That last bit, from here on out it won’t be relevant. The next time you activate that magnet you will be greeted with five or so maze-like containers, more often than not chock-full of slavering mutants. As you can imagine, this makes your job a fair bit more time consuming, not least deadly. In fact it tends to consume just about enough time for you to discover that this space-magnet technology ain’t all that stable; it invariably opens up a wormhole intent on greedily dragging the containers and their cargo back to where they came from.\n\nThe moment the container you’re in disintegrates  you are faced with two immediate difficulties: 1) a lack of oxygen; this may cause a slight shortness of breath, 2) the cargo you couldn’t reach in time is now floating out into the nothingness of space. See where this is going? For me, this situation results in either an act of defiant heroism or a motionless body forever floating through cold space. Succeed and the breathless dash back home is greeted by the comforts of music, coffee, and seeing your score edge ever higher.\n\nCargo Commander has to be one of the funniest games I’ve ever played. It employs a similar brand of gallows humour to Portal 2 but unlike other attempts (Penumbra: Black Death) the comedy fits the ridiculous-♥♥♥-fatal gameplay like a glove. Dare I say it, Serious Brew’s comic concoction seems more natural than even their peers. For instance, after scraping just enough to pay for one of many delivery fees (seemingly subject to hyper-inflation), our hero receives a crude, cutesy picture drawn by his son. N’awwwww, wait what are those faint words on the other side of the paper? “EVICTION NOTICE”. Your family’s grim situation couples tragically (hilariously) with your lowly job collecting cargo, most of which is of equivalent worth as an old boot to a fisherman.\n\nOnce you’ve survived a few cargo hauls, hopefully scavenging enough caps to spend on a few upgrades, you’re presented with the chance to McNab (crap review in-joke alert) yourself a ‘sector pass’. Or, in other words, your ticket outa this hell-hole. Destination: another hell-hole. Only by snatching these green-glowing boxes can you progress through Cargo Commander’s ‘story’, which essentially revolves around climbing the greasy corporate pole from Deckswab Trainee to Boss by collecting new types of cargo. So it’s fairly annoying when you miss a sector pass, and it is in this context that the game invites you to abuse your F key and bask in the ensuing profanity uttered by your character.\n\nSay, however, that you do manage to grab that sector pass, well here’s the interesting bit: Cargo Commander‘s sectors are randomly generated based around a name, so you could either compete for high-scores in the currently popular ‘Moon’ sector or head to ‘Rotherham’ as I did. I’ve heard it’s the new Berlin.\n\nImportantly Cargo Commander is the sort of game that rewards clever play in the face of adversity. Running out of ammo and faced with a slew of mutants? Drill through the container hull and try tempting those idiots into deep space by playing the human carrot. Too many obstacles between you and your cargo? Hold your breath, float your way around the outside the container and drill yourself a new, convenient entrance!","July 15, 2014","true","35.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
