"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlespigots/recommended/211400/","littlespigots","...","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlespigots/","73 products in account","Initially Deadlight appears to be a slow burn: the combat is scarce and tense, the platforming is contextually sensible and the 1980s dystopian Seattle setting is beautifully realized both visually and atmospherically. I spent the entirety of the first act, about 45 minutes give or take, pleasantly surprised and had been fully immersed and engaged; sure there are a variety of control issues and the keyboard setup in general could be irritating at times, but rarely did the game venture into territory where the difficulties were prominent and in the foreground.\n\nWhen the second act came around I was introduced to a character named The Rat who inexplicably stole my items and in spite of professing an interest in helping me, made me traverse a series of makeshift traps in his underground lair. I tried to suspend disbelief and bear with the jarring transition into Crash Bandicoot insta-death and artificial difficulty induced by repeated (and clearly intentional) blindsiding moments/fake outs and I tried not to think much of it when my character decided to just go along with it in spite of risking his life for no discernable reason, going so far as to helping the man find his teenage son after the gauntlet was through. It's a game afterall and though it seemed uncharacteristic of the entire introductory segment, perhaps it'd be a detour and I'd get back to the funereal feel of what came before.\n\nUnfortunately that's not the case. Led by The Rat and his pseudo-philosophical banter I dodged saw blades, pushed about a dozen blocks in order to traverse ledges, and spanned an impossible arena of challenges he was the architect of, each one becoming less and less about building tone or a convincing universe, and more and more about throwing out visual stimuli and a kitchen sink approach to finding methods to incorporate the game mechanics. Problem is, there's no depth when you turn the maps into obstacle courses that discourage skill in favour for trial and error, and faced with the irritation of both the change of pace and the rehashing of the same mechanics ad infinitum (wall jump awkwardly onto hanging wires, push blocks, barrel through doors) it became apparent that I had clearly mistaken the game's intentions.\n\nThe platforming is never fleshed out to require player aptitude; everything is so specific as to almost be a button prompt or a quicktime. Nowhere in the game did I feel like it was anything akin to what you'd find satisfying about any old school side scroller because it's less about precision and timing and more about whether there's an unfair obstacle that could come as a surprise, usually resulting in death. You follow linear corridors, do plodding "puzzles" and repeat the same motions over and over, sometimes with combat smashed awkwardly in between.\n\nThe argument could be made that, due to the theme, the platforming isn't intended to be in the same vein as its forefathers, but that brings up the question "Why is it a platformer then?" and Deadlight refuses to answer more often than not. If early Survival Horror utilized tank controls and shoddy combat mechanics in order to heighten tension perhaps Deadlight's messy controls and atypical form could be attributed to a similar notion, but I think that'd be incredibly generous. What it mostly comes down to is that the game happens to not be good at much, and the faster the tempo the more clear the blemishes tend to be as a result of it actually having to rely on the platforming for core gameplay as opposed the situationally pragmatic fashion it was initially applied in, in spite it not being fun, nuanced or fluid enough to do so potently.\n\nYour character will refuse to do things you've seen him do prior in identical situations at times, failing to make a jump or spinning ridiculously while you're being torn limb from limb. The levels are nonsensical set pieces after the first act and none of them feel particularly thrilling or earned for that matter, just a bunch of archetypal content strewn and spattered about without rhyme or reason so your protagonist has an excuse to jump onto buses suspended from wires, evade helicopters and bounce off walls.\n\nI could discuss the hollow plot, the fact that there's a substantial bug that cut my audio out in every cutscene, or the platforming animations largely consisting of you missing jumps and being teleported toward the ledge anyway, and I could elaborate on the inconsistent characterizations, the lack of direction or the complete misuse of the gameplay resources and so on but ultimately Deadlight is a game that had an amazing amount of promise and squandered it by the time its demo length intro has finished only to repeatedly remind you that what you anticipated and likely even enjoyed at first is not what Deadlight truly is, even if it's afraid to admit it or ultimately (and likely) isn't even aware of it.\n\nRecommended Instead:\nLimbo\nShinobi III\nEating Out Of The Trash","September 16, 2014","false","7.6"," 486 of 595 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","486","595","11","16"

The PC port however appeared to solve all the problems the console version boasted, from the bugs to the clunky controls. I can assure you, after having played both the Xbox and the PC versions, that the PC port is better. However, the port available to buy on Steam still suffers from a lot of problems, problems that detracted from the game and caused me to quit the game in anger several times. "Deadlight" is one of those games that looked fantastic on paper but failed to deliver what most expect from not just a zombie game, but an action/adventure game too.\n\nGameplay - 2/5 stars - The bugs, the performance, the controls, the cutscenes... they angered me to the point where completing the game seemed like a chore. The parkour is fun, I'll give the game that, but the combat is way too easy due to plentiful ammo. The controls were also extremely clunky. I suggest that you change the key bindings the second you boot up the game, for some keys are in the most awkward of places.\n\nStory - 3/5 stars - The voice acting (in some cases) is really well done and the story arc, though cliche, is made interesting due to the collectibles scattered throughout the game. I find the lead-up to the infection in zombie games to be the most interesting part, and the fact that "Deadlight" is set in the mid-1980s helps create a unique backstory to the zombie outbreak.\n\nSound - 2/5 stars - Not much to say here. The music was atmospheric though it starts to loop and it can get annoying when you have to retry a section over and over due to the previously mentioned controls. Just generally mediocre I'd say.\n\nGraphics - 4/5 stars - The game's art direction is cool and refreshing. I'd love to see more games harness this kind of art direction, just like how I wish more games harnessed cell-shading. Despite the visual style, the graphics are great (when they aren't being crippled by glitches and frame-rate drops).\n\nPrice - 4/5 stars - For $14.99, you get around 4 hours of gameplay, excluding hunting for collectibles. Not too shabby, and the deal get's even sweeter if you can pick this game up during a sale. There is some replay value too.\n\nOverall - 3/5 - Honestly, "Deadlight" can be worth the $15 if you're accustomed to technical issues. At the end of the day, I recommended this game to some friends and I'd recommend it to you too. It may sound like I loathe the game, but I think the game was actually okay. It's just that though: "okay." Perhaps "Deadlight 2" will solve all the problems presented in "Deadlight," if Tequila Works develops a sequal that is.\n","November 25, 2013","true","4.1"," 291 of 371 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","291","371","0","11"

C+ at best.\n> Story - pretty run-of-the-mill storyline. Nothing new here either. Cringe-corny in some parts though.\n> Weapons - they are few in number, and you only find your first one after more than half the game has elapsed.\n\nThe Bad\n- Zombie difficulty - you can hit them with your axe all day and they won't die unless you do an executing move.\n- Glitches - there are a few, zombies glitching through closed doors, getting locked out of a room when the game assumes that you are still in it.\n- Voice acting - the main character's voice actor is average at best, but some of the other ones are awful.\n\n\nThe Ugly\n- General difficulty - often there are some really trivial things to do that takes ages, and is really frustrating. Not only that, there are a huge amount of instances where you need to do something pin-point perfect - like we are talking literally 0.1 seconds. Add a few of those in a row (or one is really enough) and it takes the fun out of the game.\n- Controls - It feels like the guy only does what you tell him to about 75-80% of the time. Turning is very slow and he, in general is slow to react. You will die a lot of times due to them.\n- Save points  - some of them are put in really inconvenient places, where you might have to run through an empty area again/ listen to some piece of dialogue again/ wait for him to crawl or jump from some space again. Or some/all of these at once. Add that to the first two points of 'ugly' and it makes you want to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up.\n- Nightmare mode - don't even.\n\nThe Verdict\nA fun game until about halfway through (shortly before you meet The Rat), and then it loses it's charm, as it becomes overly punishing and the cracks show through. The difficulty at this point increases significantly, and it really becomes a game for the discard pile, which is a shame. I can't stress enough that this game is extremely frustrating to play. I never knew what 'low reward' for a game meant until I played this game. The visual design of the game is outstanding, but some relatively small changes in the gameplay would make this game much better.","June 17, 2015","false","5.4"," 122 of 151 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","122","151","3","10"

Simple to learn, fun to play, aweing to look at: all of the makings of a good game are present.  Beyond that solid foundation, Deadlight also boasts its own unique charm that ushers it into an elite echelon within its genre.  It can be quite difficult, though, and may be best enjoyed on a low difficulty just relishing the aesthetics and savoring the experience.\n\nThe gorgeous backgrounds and graphic-noir character models combine to create a very atmospheric experience— which is often difficult to achieve in a 2D game.  I personally feel that the aesthetic appeal alone merits a playthrough.  This immersive atmosphere of the game is coupled with a decent - yet minimal - storyline to create a sense of purpose as you progress through the campaign.  Perhaps not the most enthralling fable, but the narrative serves its purpose.\n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty simplistic in nature, yet the game itself can be quite challenging in certain parts, especially on the high difficulty.  The controls are not quite as fluid as one may hope, and unfortunately you may die a few times as a direct result.  This isn’t that bad for the average gamer as the checkpoints are frequent; but if you want to go for the “no-deaths” achievement (win in Nightmare Mode), you may find this significantly more troublesome.  I found the “normal” difficulty to be perfect and extremely enjoyable; but I admittedly found the Nightmare Mode to be not worth enduring for the final achievement.\n\nIf you are OK with just enjoying a game for the experience, and don’t need to 100% every game— it’s probably safe for you to assume Deadlight isn’t as overwhelmingly and generally difficult as some other people may lead you to believe.  However, if you are someone who wants every last achievement, you may need to be prepared for some frustration.\n\nYou should also be aware that Deadlight is not very long.  It only lasts about 4-5 hours on the “normal” difficulty.  I found it to be a pleasing length as I felt the game had served its purpose by the end; I enjoyed the experience and was ready to move on.  You will have to decide for yourself if it sounds too short or just right.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 10, 2015","true","6.3"," 91 of 108 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","91","108","2","0"

While it's unnecessary to go into excessive depth, this game is fun. Sure there's some parts where are more trial and error than any sort of lack of observation on your part. But the game reloads quick, has merciful checkpoints and this is only an issue a few times. The melee system does feel a bit wonky, as you never really know how to score a fatal blow in one hit.\n\nI found the plot to be quite neat. Sure it was nowhere unique and you can probably guess what would happen. I didn't but then again I wasn't really trying to decode some deep story. The running and jumping feels pretty solid in my book, some people might struggle with it. The physics feel well implemented and the movement and puzzles reflect that.\n\nI have a feeling that retro gamers like myself will appreciate the effort that went into keeping things “old school”…I know I did. If you’re into platformers at all, then you can’t go wrong in giving “Deadlight” a try.","January 1, 2014","true","5.8"," 156 of 208 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","156","208","2","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/211400/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","291 products in account","Deadlight is an action adventure platformer developed by Tequila Works, S.L. and published by Microsoft Studios. The game follows the journey of Randall Wayne, a man searching for his family across Seattle during the aftermath of a 1980's event that has decimated life on earth. Welcome to the zombie apocalypse. Randall inadvertently gets separated from the group of survivors that he is traveling with and spends most of the course of the game trying to reunite with them and find a safe haven. When you start the game you know very little about what has been transpiring but over the course of the title you manage to find various journal entries that slowly begin to shed some light on the horrifying events that have taken place since the end of the world started. You'll have to stay alert and be quick on your feet because, like in any great zombie game, death could be just around the corner.\n\nDeadlight incorporates oldschool gameplay in the style of the 2D platformer which is a method of gameplay that once dominated the industry a long long time ago but is seldom used today outside of indie titles. I myself have always been a fan of the sidescroller so I was very much looking forward to playing this game. In my opinion, sidescrollers are best played with a control pad but since I don't have one I was forced to use a keyboard and this was not a problem.\n\nVisually this game is quite stunning. It uses a mix of 3D environments and highly detailed models combined with 2D sidescrolling gameplay with all of it presented in beautiful HD graphics that really enhance the atmosphere of this decimated world. The sound quality is also very well done and really immerses you within the game. Gunshots, the wind blowing and dogs barking it all sounds splendid.\n\nThis game was really a lot of fun and the puzzles were challenging but I'm not too bright so you may disagree. Wanting to know more about Randall's life and the events leading up to and after the apocalypse kept me playing through to the end as I desperately tried to avoid certain death at the hands of bloodthirsty zombies and sheer stupidity. Deadlight really gave me a healthy dose of nostalgia from the good old days when platformers were king but the gorgeous high definition graphics and top notch sound quality quickly brought me back to the present. This title proves that you can indeed have the best of both worlds. Fair warning though as this game is quite short in playtime. I was able to finish the title in about six hours so that means the average gamer could do it in four or five...I like to dawdle. Yeah, zombies everywhere and I'm standing around dawdling...not too smart. If you're looking for a good indie title with casual gameplay that you can pick up and put down then give Deadlight a try...it's short but recommended.","May 22","true","6.5"," 44 of 44 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","44","44","4","11"

I need to find my family.\n\n...\n\nBut hey, I do anyway, because this game (or rather, this port) is very clumsy. The physics is buggy, the response time is delayed, and the axe is apparently made of rubber.\n\nMost actions will result in your death, which would be completely justified had it been due to the challenging nature of the game, but instead most of it will be the result of faulty game mechanisms and strange quirks of the level layout. These errors can be ignored (albeit with some difficulty) during the initial playthrough, as the checkpoints are frequent and forgiving, but once the postgame "Nightmare Mode" is introduced, this becomes a whole different story. When there are only 3 checkpoints in the entire playthrough of the game, frustrating doesn't even begin to describe the task of completing this mode (That alternate hat Randall wears was pretty neato though).\n\nAs a port of the original XBOX game, this game also suffers from strange mapping of the controls. Well, maybe it's part of the challenge to press Shift and Ctrl while moving. It just feels like the controls were mapped by someone not accustomed to keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe art style was slick, the sidescrolling gameplay was a great idea, and the entire concept was generally pretty awesome. What this game suffers from are ridiculous response times and funky physics in a port that wasn't really thought out properly.","January 1, 2014","false","14.7"," 204 of 290 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","204","290","0","4"

All the pitch black cadavers lining the empty, cold, and harsh streets while the sun shines down brightly and creates glare on your screen is simply a sight that should be seen. How they mix the pitch black bodies with the bright surroundings around them is simply put; amazing. I must also mention the soundtrack. The music fits the mood rather well, and helps immerse you in the world.\n\nGameplay: 6.0/10 - Although the idea was original, especially for a zombie game, Deadlight fails in many areas. It's basically a simple, linear, clunky, and slippery platformer. All the surfaces you jump on feel slipper and the controls are clunky and sometimes have a bit of a delay. The game is also very linear, in the sense that there are no real, "secret," areas and you just end up following the cookie trail that the game gives you. You also get some weapons in the game like a revolver or axe, but they aren't anything unique. For the long ranged weapons it's a simple point and shoot, which is basically the same for the axe or any other physical weapon. Simple, but not too clean.\n\nPlot: 6.5/10 - Other than some great story telling, the plot ends up being a little too cliched for me. As I said, they tell the story in a great way, but the actual story isn't that great. They also did a good job at making you feel for the protagonist, Randall Wayne, but once again the main premise feels old.\n\nOverall: 7.0/10 - Good.\n\n"The game is visually stunning, but doesn't do much more to make it special"\n\n- Marcus","November 26, 2013","true","9.6"," 118 of 158 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","118","158","0","0"

I want to love this game, but it's a one-way relationship.\n\nThe first hour-or-so will be an enjoyable stealth-based platformer, before you're introduced to The Rat and his one-hit-kill maze of twitch platforming, relying on millisecond-perfect reactions to make progress. Expect to die 20+ times per trap.\n\nAfter this area, you'll begin to see small issues with the game itself... Odd checkpoints placing your further back than your progress, requiring you to bring lifts back down for you to proceed; Audio being reliably cut off, losing huge chunks of dialogue and replies; Awful hitbox detection that allows you to be hit from behind an enemy, and equally bad enemy AI that will ignore specifically placed distractions and beat you to death while you're being held by another; A broken standing-jump mechanic that will send you flying to the side if you're not perfectly still; and an interactable environment that is impossible to tell foreground from background, leaving you plummeting to your death where you thought there was a walkway.\n\nSo what's good about the game? Well, it's not the story as told by the cutscenes or the overly-raspy voice-actor, but the journal was a delight to read, and hidden pages of it, though making no sense, are a nice collectable to have and tell you more about your character than the game itself every will, besides the odd grunt of his wife and daughter's names.\n\nA gritty, 3D side-scroller based on luring and evading enemies is a rare commodity, as far as I know, and this game captures the world and its parkor exploration very nicely, though the liklihood of your character actually being able to move like that is questionable. The enemies themselves are your typical zombie-type, but feature eyes that glow red when they're being aggroed, which I suppose is nice, if a bit too 'gamey' for the real world they're trying to create. And once again, this is some magical universe where zombies have never been conceived of, and are instead known as 'Shadows'.\n\nI will let you make your own mind up about this game. If you're a big fan of platformers and zombie survival, you might find something you like... but for the casual player, there is far too much confusion and overly-punishing mechanics for me to recommend this game.","January 3, 2015","false","5.9"," 126 of 172 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","126","172","3","0"

If it sounds an awful lot like that other first person parkour action platformer in a post apocalyptic zombie infested game named Dying Light, you'd be wrong. Dead wrong. No, this is a game more about traversal than fighting waves of the undead that are named shadows. Everything in the foreground is black and shadowy including the zombies, yourself, the terrain, ladders and so on. The backgrounds are beautiful, diverse environments that you won't get to explore so much as gaze in awe of throughout the game. This makes the game feel a kin to Limbo, but in color without the painful and vague puzzles.\n\nIts really a five hour journey that takes you through the city. From your safe house, through the city, up buildings, underground in a trap laden labyrinth made by a madman, to trailer homes of suburbia, a stadium, a hospital and even a militia camp. That's what I took away from this game were the beautiful vistas that looked like a team must have spent a lot of time on for what is essentially a budget title.\n\nBut how will you get there? You've got a lot of land to cover, piece by piece. Climbing ladders, hanging from ledges, sliding down rooftops, jumping over gaps, running from helicopters, wall jumping, crouching under doors, rolling from high leaps, crawling through air ducts, pulling boxes, pushing over things to barricade doors from zombies. You can even yell, call and taunt zombies to your location. Its all simple and easy. You'll even get a fire axe that can smash open doorways and boarded up windows. It can also smash through zombie heads! Its not a gory game though. You won't see blood in the game, but you will see art blood in the cut scenes.\n\nYou've got stamina so every time you swing the axe, that stamina goes down. You'll get slower with your swings, everything will become slightly blurry until you rest. This makes you vulnerable to zombies. Normally you can button mash to shake them off you, but when you're groggy, you're susceptible. Even with one block of health left, you can still do a good job of shaking them from  you, unless a zombie sneaks up behind. Fighting zombies is a rare part of the game, most of the time you just avoid the ones in the foreground and the ones in the background shuffle to the foreground. When you kill a zombie, they disappear into smoke after a some time goes by and they'll appear in the background to do it all over again.\n\nThe stamina drains as you hang from ledges or wires. Once your stamina is gone, you fall most likely to your death. Speaking of death, there are electrified pools of water that you'll need to turn off the power to get across.\n\nI can't call the game a survival horror, even though there's zombies and limited ammunition. You'll get a revolver that you need to load each bullet and its quick enough. Shooting involves using the right thumbstick to aim a full 360 degrees and pulling the right trigger to fire. There are of course keyboard controls, but its a game from Microsoft, I'd recommend using the 360 controller in this case. You can find more ammunition on bodies strewn about the game. I never felt like ammo conservation was an issue. The same body will always have more ammunition. There's also a shotgun, which ammo is very limited and a slingshot that you'll get for one part of the game. This slingshot has unlimited ammo and you can always bounce your rocks off walls to hit triggers. Other than that, you'll need guns to shoot out windows, locks and other things. The game always makes sure there's an ammo corpse somewhere.\n\nEverything you'll need is highlighted with a slight glowing tint. You can turn this off, but it really helps and at some point, I think the game realizes that you know what you're doing, so the tint becomes less present. There are twinkling sparkles on ledges. There's a big emphasis on ledges and climbing, you can even hang from a ledge and drop down. Otherwise, falling great distances hurts if not kills you. Oh it also kills the zombies too.\n\nSince you're so burdened with stuff, you can't swim, which makes for some brief water puzzles where you'll raise and lower the water. With all of the light puzzles in the game, I never felt like anything was too difficult or vague. Its an easy and enjoyable journey through Deadlight, but there are moments you'll need to run and get things correct. The last moments of the game it seems like a puzzle against soldiers in order to do the right thing at the right moment. If you jump off a fence, you'll get gunned down, but if you drop off the fence, then you can shoot the soldiers. Stuff like that. Other times, you'll need to run to avoid zombies chasing you or a helicopter's gunfire.\n\nFor the most part, zombies are a big part of the game, but other times its about a para military group chasing you. Its really just a helicopter. There aren't any soldiers outside of the final moments of the game. Your biggest foes are still the zombies.There's a sense of dread as they come closer or overwhelm you, but for the most part, they're easy to avoid either by taunting to lure them in and jumping over their head to knocking them down and running past.\n\nAt some point, the danger becomes traps as an old man forces you to run through his rat maze to the end. You'll need to be quick to avoid falling spike traps, crumbling platforms and its all interesting stuff and the traps look believable within this art style and setting. I just know some people that play zombie games only do it for the zombies, but this is a game about traversal and staying alive, the zombies are just in it.\n\nIf you die, you'll merely restart from the last checkpoint. I can't say that the game is too death heavy outside of a few rare points. There are health packs here and there, but every death refills your health, so they almost feel pointless. There are a lot of other collectables and secrets. I can't say there's too much exploring or secret areas, it feels like a very linear experience, but still a fun, enjoyable one. For those that find the game too easy, once you complete the game, there's a nightmare mode with no save and only one life. Its possible I'm sure.\n\nThroughout the game, you'll hear your character Randall Wayne talking with his smoky gravely voice, explaining things. So you'll always have a hint at what to do or how to do it. He's a good character, but his voice seems out of place from everyone else in the game. Its only noticeable in cut scenes. To flesh out who Randall was, there are a few flashbacks that hint at things as well as explain how he learned to fire a weapon. There are a few nightmarish hallucinations where the skies turn red and zombies in the background are giant.\n\nBetween the actual game, there's beautiful yet grim artwork during cut scenes. I'd much rather have these sort of still frame art style than something in the game's engine. There are a few things done in the game where you lose control, but they're brief and rare.\n\nI did manage to find a few bugs here and there. Pausing coming out of a save seemed to freeze the game.

However, it ends up being more like Canabalt with delusions of grandeur, being in large part concerned with running to the right.\n\nThe game lacks direction and can't seem to settle on whether it wants you to have weapons or not, taking them away and returning them capriciously. The setting is similarly inconsistent; although largely urban, a fair chunk of the game takes an inexplicable detour underground to what to all intents and purposes is a puzzle dungeon, a series of trial-and-error traps and jumping puzzles that drags on far longer than it needs to.\n\nWhile trial-and-error gameplay is not particularly egregious in and of itself, Deadlight's poorly designed approach often means that you can suffer instant death from something you had no chance to anticipate; rather than finding the best solution for a challenge, it's more a case of rote memorisation. This is certainly not helped by finickity controls and a number of bugs; one particularly aggravating example was near the end of the game, where I'd repeatedly have to restart a checkpoint only to find my character spinning on the spot, unable to do otherwise.\n\nIn terms of story and characters, Deadlight leaves no cliché unturned, with the characters being barely more than stereotypical ciphers and the story, such as it is, loosely stitching together every zombie trope in the book. There is some genuinely atrocious dialogue in the game -- some of the worst writing I've come across in a long time -- delivered with at best forgettable voice acting.\n\nAlthough clearly tolerable once through, despite its many flaws, it's impossible to recommend due to its brief duration and frustrating gameplay. Crucially, there's nothing here that hasn't been done better elsewhere; it adds nothing to either the puzzle-platformer or zombie apocalypse genres, and even its two-hour length feels like a waste of time.","March 23, 2014","false","2.4"," 160 of 229 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","160","229","0","0"

You had to beat Prince of Persia in  under 1 hour to win the game, think of that. :D\n\nNow Deadlight is very similar to PoP to the point that it is all about finding the right timing to execute your jumps and other actions.

But at the same time it's very precise. I highly recommend playing with a controller though.\n\nThe only letdown there is, like it was with PoP, it's too short.

Each level takes you across a fantastic imagining of a post-apocalyptic Seattle (circa 1986), featuring both indoor, outdoor and underground elements, with hauntingly beautiful backdrops making for some of the best visuals, atmosphere and tone in recent gaming memory.\n\nGameplay | Sound | Other: Gameplay is focused heavily on platforming and solving puzzles to help your character circumnavigate an increasing number of obstacles. Several sections also feature a timed element that naturally increase player stress-levels as you scramble to get to the end - heightening the immersion element of actually ‘running for your life’. Importantly, frequent checkpoints are well spaced throughout to ensure frustration is kept to a minimum. Your character will discover a few weapons - an axe, revolver etc - along the way, but ammunition is severely limited to reinforce the point that confrontation with the hordes of undead is generally discouraged. Sound Design is excellent and immersive overall, and controls are well optimized for both K&M and Controller.\n\nFlaws: Unfortunately, the game is not without some major missteps – Gameplay is restrictively linear – and the lack of any real challenge or even variation in puzzles, ‘enemy AI’, weapons or fighting elements make the game highly predictable and repetitive about a third of the way through. Additionally, a shallow plotline, lack of sidequests, no customization options, and relatively few collectibles make for low replayability overall as well. Finally, the game also tends to be buggy in spots (with sound randomly cutting out during cutscenes), no ‘Restart | New Game’ option, and if all of the above weren’t enough, it’s terribly short as well with average playtimes running between 3-5 hours.\n\n‘Deadlight’ is a gorgeous looking game no doubt – but look under the hood and many inherent issues become quickly apparent, leaving the gamer feeling like they are just going through the motions without much of a plot or challenge to distract from proceedings. While extremely hard to justify at full price, On Sale (at $2.99) it’s worth a casual playthrough if largely for the visual experience alone.

The first half of the game (around 2 hours) isn't too bad, the protagonist Randall is introduced along with the basic mechanics. As the game spills over into it's second half however, it decides to just throw scenarios at you where you literally can't guess what's going to happen, unless you're the MacGyver of gaming. So you end up in a vicous cycle of dying constantly and getting slightly further each time. Ultimately, it can end up taking around 5 minutes on one small puzzle section, and these sections get more persistent towards the end.\n\nOn top of that, the only thing strong about this game is its visual presence and how it incorporates set pieces. However, even the really cool moments where it actually feels like you're playing a decent game are soiled by constant deaths, the ending sequence with Stellar was particularly bad.\n\nI can understand making a platformer 'challenging' but throwing death obstacles in the final leg of the game and ultimately negating the impact of the cool part is a sure-fire way to sour the experience. In the last quarter of the game you're just wishing it would be over, and it's only four hours long...dear oh dear.\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust checked out Nightmare Mode as well. It's just the normal campaign except you're not allowed to save, and if you die you are sent back to the start of the game. That sounds like as much fun as putting your testicles in a blender and then drinking the ball fluid.","June 13, 2015","false","4.3"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","40","47","9","0"

The dialogue was definitely lacking.  If I had to here Randall talk to himself in the third person one more time I was going to take an axe to my own head.\n\nMost other reviews hit it on the head when they mentioned the clumsy controls, bad physics, and poor layering.

Some of the level design was pretty interesting but there were times where getting caught on a fence and shot by the helicopter, jumping when told to and magically hitting an invisible wall leading to either, again being shot by the helicopter or, more often, falling to my death, randomly crouching instead of rolling, or jumping off of hanging obstacles onto platforms and sliding right off to either die or have to repeat just got infuriating and painful.\n\n\nI felt like I would have left this game pleasantly surprised if it had been a flash game, which is kind of what it felt like.\nHowever, this is the first game in a long time that I can say that I regret purchasing, even discounted on the summer sale, and will NEVER play again.","June 29, 2014","false","4.5"," 99 of 149 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","99","149","0","0"

Nope, you can't grab onto it yet. You need to walk, stop, then jump straight up again. Otherwise you'll jump 15 feet away from the damn thing if you happen to press a direction while jumping.

For the first third of the game the atmosphere is great and it really manages to draw you in. What you're drawn into, however, is a total mess.\n\nI think the game suffers from "devs not having others try their own game" during design phase. Everything works, but one can certainly be forgiven for thinking it doesn't. There are not enough mechanics explained so when it comes time to use them the player hits a wall until they figure it out. A good example of this is the tutorial flashback where it shows you to fire a gun.  It tells you the button to load the gun, then says to shoot the can. It doesn't tell you that you use the right stick and RT to do so, it just tells you to shoot it. So if you're dumb like me you mash the buttons until you realize you actually aim the gun using the analog stick (why would I presume that devs?). This isn't so bad in a tutorial with no danger, but combat and running past zombies suffers from this as well. And then there are certain bad design ideas like mysteriously jumping up higher when there's a ledge to grab onto.\n\nUnfortunately the controls are pretty clunky even if you do know what to do. This isn't really a surprise since it is an analog stick platformer and going for a horror setting and there's this ridiculous notion that a "good" horror game needs bad controls. Even if you know what to do hand-to-hand combat is extremely frustrating. You'll swing in the wrong direction all the time. While you're attacking you'll move forward but the enemy won't and they'll end up on the other side of you. To jump straight up you seemingly need no momentum at all instead of just taking your hand off the stick, things like that.\n\nAll this combined with some gotcha gaming level design leads to you dying a lot. And dying a lot WILL destroy the atmosphere, especially when it's in the same place over and over. Keep in mind this is with the game TELLING you what to do, more or less. What you need to do or where you need to go is often flat out pointed to with an arrow or highlighted with blue. The running sequences should be scary. I mean, there's a horde behind you. Unfortunately they're just annoying because you get tripped by chairs or get blocked by a zombie and the game doesn't tell you outright how to get around them. And when you figure out the game's already over because it's so short.\n\nThere are also some technical issues. I hope you're not like me and use in-game volume controls. Said in-game volume controls do not apply to cutscenes. If you are unfortunate to find this out the hard way enjoy being deaf. The second is that pausing often causes extreme hangs. I've found the only way to fix them is to ctrl+alt+delete, then alt+tab back in.\n\nI did enjoy everything quite a lot before the Rat Labyrinth (you'll see if you play...) but after that the game just felt like a disaster.

Resolution goes up to 1920x1080 for me.  You can turn on/off Object Highlights, Hints, Vibration (for controller,) and Subtitles (under Audio Settings.)  Keyboard and mouse controlls can be re-mapped, though I used the controller (which cannot be re-mapped.)\n\nI was immediately sucked in by how atmospheric the game is, reminiscent of a cross between This War of Mine, I Am Alive, Mark of the Ninja, and Zafehouse Diaries (because ZOMBIES!)\n\nThe game is really an action-platformer at heart, but the driving story and deeply environmental graphics, sounds, and voices make it feel much like an adventure.  Cinematics can be skipped (but why would you want to do that?) and consist of sepia-toned images with voice overs.  You will play through flashbacks, and there are diary entries you will find which add to the story, as well as little extras like the ID of strangers, newspaper clippings, first aid kits... Oh, and don't forget bullets!  There are also a few "handhelds" to be found, which are games to play within the game.\n\nThe controls for run-jumping can be a bit sticky at times, but the auto-save function ensures that you don't have to repeat too much if you die.  Speaking of running, there ARE running sequences similar to -- but not as hair-pullingly frustrating as -- Ori and the Blind Forest.  I had to repeat these sequences three to five times, max, and they're not very long.\n\nSome areas are puzzle-heavy, whilst others are action-heavy, depending on where you are in the story.  You can always go back to the main menu and choose 'Select Scene' if you think you've missed something.   There are three chapters to choose from, and each chapter has specific scenes you can go back to, complete with information on how many secrets you found;  ie. 2/3.  Great for those who like to 100% their games!\n\nFinishing the game unlocks Nightmare Mode, which is the same as the standard play, except that the game only saves between each chapter.  Nightmare indeed, especially when you consider that the controls for jumping WILL mess you up, and you WILL die.  I think I'll just skip this part.\n\nThere are achievements to be had, but I can't see getting all of them.  For one thing, you'd have to meet a friend on the leaderboard for one of them (solution HERE -- Thank you, P0nz!,) and you have to complete Nightmare Mode, sooo... Yep, I won't be getting all of them!\n\nI absolutely loved most of the game, but the final area of the game was too much action and not enough thinking for my tastes.  Overall I'd say it's absolutely worth playing!","May 8","true","16.2"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","5"

Braid,Limbo, Trine, Bionic Commando, and perhaps a few others I failed to mention.\n\nThe game takes place in 1986 during the world zombie outbreak.\n\nThis game has it all, zombies, an intensive narrative, more or less realistic combat, shortage of ammo, expansive and realistic environments, human conflict, back story, gore, puzzles. Once you beat the game you get the Nightmare mode unlocked, wherein you have to beat each of the three long acts (each with 4-5 scenes) without dying. Once you do so you unlock the alternate ending. This achievement is so hard that I haven't seen anyone on the net post the alternate ending yet.\n\nOne level I would take out is the one in the sewers, it was quite a torture I might say. Everything else looks great: detailed ambiance levels, the physics, the animation, the chase scenes, the cliffhangers, being outnumbered, using environment to kill foes, outstanding soundtrack. There are plenty of Easter eggs: such as three handheld video games, miscellaneous items, pieces that help complete the story as well as ID of famous serial killers and such.

I really enjoyed the art style and the attempt at a 2.5 D environment. It could have been an atmospheric horror game or a creepy adventure game based just on the presentation.  Unfortunately the platforming is inconsistent, the objective of each section not always clear, and the combat laggy and unresponsive.  For me this resulted in lots of deaths.  There is no punishment for this as you start over at the last checkpoint which is usually a few seconds from where you died, but for a game who’s art style and audio went to a lot of trouble to create a sense of immersion constantly retrying a check point because I didn’t understand what to do and got swarmed by the undead really takes you out of the story.  There are three chapters to this relatively short game.  I started in on chapter 3 and after dying a handful of times decided to move on to other things, not so much because the game was too hard to complete, I could have forced my way through, but I totally lost interest in the world the game was trying to create.","January 16","false","3.6"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","3"

Anyway, developer did an interesting experiment with platformer genre and zombie theme. The result is a gorgeous looking 2D platformer, where a common protagonist (not a strong hero) tries to survive and find his family in zombie ravaged Seattle.\n\nThe States are created to look as it was 20 years ago with no modern gadgets like phones. Cutscenes feature a comic style, but also are dynamic and fits the theme well enough. Story is a bit slow, but gets very interesting at the end of the game. Personally, I loved the ending and it felt very profesionally realised with strong emotional impact.\n\nGameplay is fun and really tries to capture everything about the apocalypse. There are a lot of jumping, climbing, some puzzles and necessity to conserve ammo by using lethal weapons whenever possible. Unfortunatelly, there is no customisation of various weapons and even no inventory at all.\n\nDeadlight, with its focus on storytelling, feels like an indie The Last of Us, but lacks its planning and deeper gameplay.\n\n8.5/10","February 5","true","5.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","3"

The problem is that most parts of the game will kill you the first time.  You then replay the section knowing what the trap is and hopefully avoid it.   Some sections have short gaps between checkpoints, some large.  So you might end up doing a long bit again and again as you discover each trap.  Worse, sometimes there are dialogue bits that you heav to hear over and over again.\n\nAll this constant reloading is made worse by the delay in first asking you to press a button to reload, then taking a while to reload.  I'm dead (again), there is nothing I can do except reload, why bother asking and delaying me?  The strangely long load time along with a couple of times the menu seems to get stuck hint at a poor PC port.  BTW I particularly wouldn't recommend this without an XBOX controller.\n\nThe game also suffers from giving you a limited supply of ammo for guns - you're clearly only supposed to use it in a worst case scenario.  I found that meant I just horded it and never used it, though towards the end this did improve.\n\nFor the postives, the story is OK, though a bit hammy - the whole Rat man bit is quite poor. Where the game really shines is graphically, the art direction is great.\n\nI picked it up for a few quid and got more hours out of it than I wanted to.","August 30, 2014","false","3.6"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","1"

Comic art style of cutscenes are also pleasing. All of those visual effects allow to feel the mood of postapocalyptic world.\nMusic and sound effects are also suitable. What I found a little bit annoying was voice acting - very unnatural and affected.\nI can't complain about controls, they're pretty decent.\nThen why negative review?\nFirst of all - bugs. There were few moments in the game that after performing some action, character acted randomly. For example when you were jumping to the banner or fence, he was automatically rolling to the opposite side and hanging there or after moving to the edge, he was making a long jump. It was pretty annoying especially when it was causing constant deaths. Cutscenes were also problematic because second one and the ones after were always muted - it required restarting a game after every cutscene.\nSecond of all - plot. It started interesting, after a while got predictible and finally at the end left me with impression "What? And thats it?".

The gameplay in general feels bad. Swinging the axe doesn't have any weight behind it, plus the unconsistant hitboxes .. oh man.

Let me start on a positive note. The visuals are beautiful. The zombies hide in the shadows and the lighting effects are great. I can imagine this may be a point of frustration because it may be difficult to see baddies or where you are supposed to go. The other visually appealling aspect of the game are the cut scenes. They are stills with slight movement, similiar to the original InFamous. Great style in that game and great here, too.\n\nNow time for all the bad things. The execution of the story is not the greatest. You get bits and pieces revealed to you as the protagonist remembers a traumatic event. Speaking of the protagonist, I found the voice actor's voice-over  to be annoying and cheesy. Controlling the protagonist is, at best, frustrating, and, at worst, impossible. There is typically a half-second delay before your button presses are actually executed.\n\nEven once I got around the bad response time of the controls, there was the constant failure built into the maps. Most of the areas are designed to kill you as soon as you enter them then you figure out how to survive. This does not make for a fun game. Progress...die...learn...progress...die...learn. This happens over and over again. There are some maps where as soon as you walk through a door, the ceiling collapse. It is completely impossible to know what you are supposed to be doing unless you have already done it. Not good game design.\n\nOverall, y'all should take a pass on this one.","January 1, 2015","false","4.6"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","1"

Let me elaborate on why this game is a waste of your time: it lasts around 3 or so hours, has a lackluster, flimsy and predictable story full of plot holes, is riddled with weird bugs (people with lower system specs and possibly Nvidia cards have it the worst), has cringeworthy voice acting, sometimes completely unintuitive (as in, "Why is THIS even over THERE?") level design and in the end makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, but boy, does it try. It tries so hard, but then just kinda tumbles over and faceplants into the ground. And stays there. Forever.\n\nIt's like a terrible Hollywood SF/action flick with zombies. Overdramatic, cliche and simply badly written.\n\nOn the bright side, the atmosphere is hauntingly beautiful and the concept art is gorgeous, and that's about it. By the looks of it, a lot of cool stuff was cut out of the game, I'm not sure for what reason (I doubt it was budget constraints), and so this is what we all get in the end. I could spend a lot of time praising the art direction (Have I mentioned that it's great? I know I did, but it's GREAT), but the art direction alone couldn't save this game from being an almost out-and-out flop. Which is a real shame. It could have been something SO much better.\n\nIf you're a hardcore zombie apocalypse fan, sure, give it a whirl, but for the love of god, don't buy this at its full price. Or just stick to peanut butter till something better gets released. Damn, now I'm hungry.","September 3, 2014","false","4.7"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","18","26","3","4"

The enemies move in a 3D space and you don't and this leads to some confusion as to which enemies are blocking your path and which aren't, which is terrible game design in my opinion.

It's got stylish graphics, slick animations and zombies (I'm a big fan of zombies). But it also has some psychopathically difficult segments that ruin the fun. Actually, psychopathic is probably not an accurate description; I don't think the developers /intentionally/ made the game that hard; I just think they failed to, you know, properly test the gameplay. The difficulty level is all over the place; the hard segments are more often than not a challenge because of unresponsive controls. One segment took me over forty attempts to get past, and I when I finally succeeded it wasn't because I did anything different from the dozens of other times; the controls just worked for once.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/recommended/211400/","chlorique","Chlorique Queas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/","696 products in account","A Review About Deadlight\n\nIntroductionLet me just state one thing clearly first, Deadlight is a very polarizing game when I played it so this recommendation is more towards neutral. With that said Deadlight is a zombie apocalypse 2D action platformer video game. The game has player character traversing a 2D plane with 3D environment with you assuming the role of Randall Wayne on a quest to find his wifey and daughter in this zombie hellhole with Randall narrating the his thoughts on the state of the dying world as you play along.\n\nNotice the lack of survival in the genre list and that is because its not survival at all but rather a a linear experience with PC simply going from point A to point B jumping from platform to platform before triggering yet another cutscene. Not that Deadlight platforming section is terrible, it's good but I'll touch on that later. For now, the review.\n\nSound DesignExcellent, truly marvelous, and atmospheric. If I don't count some of the voice acting that is within Deadlight overall I can say that the sound design is spot on, there are moments where I actually got spooked due to the sudden change in music, audio cue and etc etc.\n\nMeanwhile the voice acting especially for the PC is incredibly gravelly, like very much so. It's like he is incapable of speaking without a slight growl all the time. But if we ignore that [and a few other missed issues] it's actually pretty solid!\n\nGraphicsCutscenes are rendered in still comic book art style and well to give a short opinion, it looks good but nothing to shout about. You have to get used to it seeing as it pops up quite often.\n\nAs for the actual graphic itself, I don't have much to say about it other than the fact at the time I'm reviewing this game it already looks kind of dated with a seemingly muddy filter covering the whole screen. The texture also looks muddy as well. I'm just gonna go ahead and say it looks ok for the atmosphere they were aiming for but not for the gameplay itself since zombies can sometimes blend in with the environment and effect glitches are plenty for the zombies as well.\n\nPerformance, Controls, Option Menu, Bugs?Option Menu is disappointing. You have resolution controls, gamma, vsync but no individual graphical option settings. Instead they give you a slider with options from low to high and that's it. You can rebind control keys for keyboard but not for controller  and it plays better with a controller anyways except when it comes to aiming,\n\nNow as for Performance, my computer isn't actually that powerful but I still find it baffling that I cannot run this on low at 60 fps. There are also random lag spike whenever the game loads new assets.\n\nAnd bugs oh boy, Zombies can apparently grab you from behind doors at times, I even got stuck on a moving platform with my Character unable to respond to my controls. Certain sections also contains a lot of bugs that will be fixed upon reloading a checkpoint.\n\nThe character also sometimes does things that you didn't tell him to do and when it's located at the beginning of an area forcing you to redo it all over again it gets aggravating fast.\n\nGameplaySimple stuff, you have walljump, ledge grab, and all those fancy smanky parkour moves so you can move around the environment nimbly. For dispatching zombies for those occasional moment you have several weapons and some can be aimed. The basic axe won't kill the zombies no matter how many times you hit them unless you use the finishing move on them while the gun will kill them in 1 shot provided you aim for the head because otherwise they can still chug along just fine.\n\nWhile in the game you can collect collectible secrets, ID cards, and diary pages but these are just fluff. They don't serve a purpose.\n\nPretty much that's it, gameplay has you going from point A to point B while parkouring along solving easy puzzles and not end up as zombie bait.\n\nConclusion And CritiqueStory - Too short, the plot twist is hideous and the ending itself is a terrible way to end a game. The whole big exposition they hyped to you about throughout the game turns out to be something that if you're genry savvy you can see from a mile away.\n\nInconsistent Tone - At first the story is about zombies wait sorry no, shadows. I hate it when zombie game pretend to not know the word zombie anyways, at first it was a story about shadow, then they shoehorn in an organization that we never even need to interact with, somehow everybody you interact with don't really move the story in any meaningful way, and then it very laughably tries to switch the main theme of the story halfway through before hurrying up trying to get back on course but by then it's too late, the train has already derailed.\n\nThe Ending - I will not spoil it for you but the ending of the game goes contrary to what you have been allowed to do i-game. Cutscene Dissonance Disorder. Thank goodness the whole thing was short because it felt like a slight waste of time.\n\nPadding - There is so much samey environment that you will have to go through but at the end of the day the whole game is still short and it feels so unfulfilled and this combined with the myriad of issues almost tipped me to give it a solid no.\n\nBut the platforming section is unfortunately [or fortunately?] quite good so if you already have this game you might as well give it a try and rage at the story like I did. Plenty of issues, plenty of bugs, but a few saving grace kept this from being a bargain bin deal... actually scratch that, get it on sale or from somewhere as long as it is not full price. It's not that good to warrant the full asking price.\n\nScoring Methology:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: C- Passable. But just that.\n\nCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/211400/","November 28, 2015","true","3.2"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

Zombies, platforming and survival? Sounds like a match made in heaven!! Unfortunately the concept wasn't excecuted as well as I hoped. The beginning chapters were rather wonderful, having you run through Seattle avoiding "Shadows". When you pick up a gun, you think "♥♥♥♥'s gonna get real" when you're only given a few bullets. Survival much?\nThis is when the game takes a bad turn though. You meet "The Rat" and he brings with him a frustrating chapter of nonsensical platforming that don't follow the story. He has you avoiding traps while trying to talk to you about his lost son or something. This really broke the immersion and grittiness of the game for me. The iffy controls didn't help either. I remember spending about 30 minutes just trying to jump over some spikes and roll afterwards. I was using a controller and he just WOULDN'T ROLL! Eventually he cooperated, but by that time I was all annoyed.\nThe story, while horribly cliched, has some nice pacing and fantastic comic-style cutscenes. Some of the voice actors, especially Randall, sound like they're trying way too hard to be gritty and rough. Still, credits for the pacing, even thouhg some scenes are almost direct copies of certain ones from Walking Dead.\n\nTo summarise;\nPROS\n- Great visuals.\n- Audio is immersive.\n- First hour is spectacular.\n- Being chased by zombies is proper nerve racking.\n\nCONS\n- Tempermental controls.\n- Story is very cliched.\n- The Rat.\n- Randall seems super-human sometimes.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nBuy on sale, don't expect too much.

Deadlight is an atmospheric, post-apocalyptic 2D platformer with some combat in it. I'll keep it simple and tell you what is good and what is, well, bad.\nGood stuff:\nAtmosphere: graphics, sound, music: everything is chosen very carefully in order to create this amazing post-apocalyptic world. Without a doubt the best part about Deadlight. I also liked the graphic novel artstyle used in the cutscenes.\nCombat: while melee combat can be somewhat klunky, gunplay is solid and doesn't feel forced like in other platformers.\nStory: while the twist wasn't too much of a surprise for me (OH BOY I KEEP FINDING THESE ID TAGS I DO WONDER IF MY SUBCONSCIOUSNESS IS TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING) the story still is solid and Randall is a character you'll truly care for, although it's obvious he has got a few screws loose. The many collectibles, including Randall's diary, are also a great addition to the main story and may make you want to replay the game to gather them all.\nVoice-acting: voice acting is solid and while Randall's gruffy voice isn't everyone's cup of tea, I kind of liked it.\nBad stuff:\nControls: platforming often feels a little awkward. Now, I didn't make too much of a deal out of this, even in the parkour segment in the second chapter (to all those people that are whining about that part: git gud plebs), but I still felt frustrated by how often I died because Randall sometimes controls like a stone with legs and sometimes like Sonic The Hegdehog's long lost alcoholic brother. And don't get me started on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fence climbing. WHY WOULD YOU ASSIGN THE KEYS YOU USE TO GO LEFT AND RIGHT TO JUST SWITCH. You just should've made it that if I press right, I go right on the fence, and if I press left, I go left on the fence. But no, we had to find ways to make the player die so he needs more time to play the game so we can justify the price tag.\nLength: you can easily complete Deadlight in 6 hours and, besides the collectibles, the three minigames and the Nightmare Mode, there isn't a lot of stuff left to do. I bought the game for a key and one refined metal (thanks for that one David, by the way) and I consider that to be a fair price.\nSome really dumb design decisions: most notably the autosave system. Plenty of  checkpoints, sometimes, but you always have to restart from the beginning of a chapter instead of said checkpoint. Why? It just doesn't make any sense. Some of the clunky controls earlier mentioned go here as well. And let's not forget about the sometimes confusing 2.5D: is that one object over there one I can use to climb on or background that will make me fall to my death?\n\nOverall, I give Deadlight a 7/10, and that's because I was a fan of/didn't hate the majority of the game to death. Buy it for a few keys from a trader, though ,because it's not worth the 12 EUR you normally ought to pay to play it.","July 5, 2014","true","6.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

I will go with Yes, but I ultimately grew frustrated with this game and didn't quite finish it.\n\nGraphics in this game are outstanding. The backgrounds are detailed and atmospheric. The use of shadows is great also, especially the way the characters are all silhouettes.\n\nDeadlight has a solid story in a tired genre with good voice acting even if the main character is a bit of a cliche tough guy.\n\nAs I proceeded through the game I had a lot of fun with the puzzles. There are times when you have no weapons and have to find ways to defeat traps/puzzles by using the zombies instead of fighting them, which is interesting.\n\nThere isn't really a lot of combat if you're looking for an action game. You will spend most of your time evading or running from enemies. Weapon selection is limited and at times non-existent. I thought it worked well for this game, since the game design doesn't require you to fight that often.\n\nDeadlight is full of Steam achievements, some of which are obtained just by reaching checkpoints, so it regularly rewards you with a sense of accomplishment.\n\nOn the downside, the game can be frustrating. There's a lot of trial and error. Sometimes the color scheme of the game can make it difficult to discern certain objects. I fell through floors I thought were there a few times. On the plus side, checkpoints are very frequent, so you can afford some trial and error. Save points are frequent too, but if you quit the game, be prepared to repeat a few checkpoints, which is really no big deal.\n\nHere's the MAJOR problem. This game is a port from XBOX Arcade, so it was designed with a 360 controller in mind. The conversion to keyboard and mouse is not pleasant. I eventually just gave up after COMPLETELY failing to outrun a helicopter through an obstacle course about 25 times. It requires fast reflexes and precision timing that I just couldn't manage on a keyboard (but maybe you could). You need to sprint away from the copter, then basically stop and inch your way up to fences, because if you hit jump while moving you will just bounce off the fence. Fence climbing in general is frustrating. Sometimes it would just take too long for the character to interact with the fence to get away from the helicopter in time. If you ARE using a 360 controller it may work better for you. I tried a PS2-style Logitech PC controller but couldn't remap the pre-configured 360 controller commands. Even my L1, L2, R1, R2 buttons weren't doing the same as the 360 buttons.\n\nI was disappointed that I ultimately put this game down (at least until I get a 360 controller I guess), because I really liked the puzzles, graphics, and atmosphere.","December 22, 2013","true","3.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","3"

Deadlight is a game that is a fun diversion when you are low on time but still wanted to get something accomplished.  With checkpoints that are extremely close to each other, you'll never find yourself far from the point that you died at, and that's a good thing considering how often you'll be dying.\n\nThe story is decent, but nothing groundbreaking.  The plot twists in themselves were predictable.  However, the mechanics of the game itself are fun and offer a challenge.  Predominantly a platformer, the game also has melee and ranged combat that are an enjoyable addition to the game.  It seemed that, for the most part, they were best used as an emergency Plan B, however, as the vast majority of the game could be completed without their use and firing one off attracted more of the 'Shadows'.\n\nI would recommend this game to fans of both platformers and the zombie apocalypse scenario.  It's fun and definitely worth the purchase if you're paying less than $10 for it as I completed the game in under four hours (granted, there is a Nightmare Mode that I have not played) and the full $15 seems a little steep.","January 25, 2015","true","4.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The story is voice acted superbly and leaves you wanting to know what happens to our heroin next ergo playing for hours.\nI most definitely recommend this game to all.","November 25, 2013","true","2.9"," 36 of 63 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","36","63","0","0"

Deadlight is exactly what it says on the tin. 2D sidescrolling zombie shooter/platforming game.\nPros: It's a beautiful game, the environments are to die for. The comic cutscenes are pretty decent, too. Some of the platforming is pretty intuitive.\nCons: Its story is nothing special. If you've played other zombie games, you've played this one. Most of the puzzles and platforming challenges will kill you on your first, second, or even third tries. A game with load times like this should not be having you play trial-by-error. The controls sometimes lag and can result in a quick and frustrating death, especially when you're trying to activate something before zombies can get you, as the window to activate most things is far smaller than it should be.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend it.

The backgrounds are more detailed than 90% of big budget AAA titles. Zombies shuffle around in numbers rivaling a Dead Rising game. Hands down the best looking platformer ever made.\n\nThat said...the gameplay and story bite.\n\nThe writing is atrocious, and they cram tons of it down your throat with cutscenes and diary entries galore. Do yourself a big favor and don't waste time on reading the diary.\n\nThe gameplay seems at first to be a tense affair as you parkour to avoid hordes of zombies. The game is at its best when you're trying to stay one step ahead of pursuing zombie packs as you vault from roof to roof. Sadly, this doesn't last long. While the game is gorgeous, it does a poor job of highlighting what you can interact with. The majority of your deaths are going to come not from challenges, but from trying to jump to a ledge, only to find that it was part of the background and not something you could grab on to.\n\nI could stil forgive that if the game was all tense zombie chases, but the entire middle third of the game shifts to an awful sewer level that serves as a literal obstacle course. Some hermit wants to see how agile you are, so he has you run through courses with wooden targets and zero zombies. You carry around a slingshot going PLINK PLINK PLINK against wooden targets that release ramps. This section lasts a good hour or more. WHO IN THE WORLD THOUGHT THIS WAS MORE FUN THAN THE ZOMBIE HORDE LEVELS? The sewers have the same amount of insane background detail as the rest of the game, so it's not even like they rushed it to lengthen the game; the same amount of effort went into creating that snoozefest portion of the game.\n\nSo, that's two-thirds of the game with tense zombie chases dragged down  by falling through illusionary platforms, and one-third of the game an unredeemable boring obstacle course. The whole time you get carpal tunnel from hammerin gthe mouse button to skip the diary and story scenes. It's a darn shame because words cannot describe how gorgeous this game is. Even though Mark of the Ninja's gameplay is infinitely better, I had trouble enjoying it after this because now I expect every platformer to be this visually breathtaking.","June 29, 2014","false","3.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The first act shows it can work having an alright story with a bit of mistery and a good narrator/main character. But they should have left it at that. The second act already has a dubious storyline with a repetitive try-and-error-gameplay, but the third is really awful. You have to try every section again and again to learn by heart when new scripted events like falling ceilings, shooting bad guys or even full or empty guns in your inventory (yes, that actually happens!) pop up, kind of ridiculous. Add to that the numerous collectibles like ID cards and lost pages from your own diary, that lie around everywhere and the developers have destroyed every bit of immersion they were able to create in the first act.

Your character has lost his family and must survive.  The game doesn't offer anything necessarily new.  But what it does it does very well.  The movement of your character is fluid and works perfectly well with both mouse/keyboard and a controller.  The intensity of dealing with zombies with only an ax at first adds a level of immersion that once you find a gun (though ammo is sparse) it takes away from that intensity and immersion.  The levels themselves are well designed, but the each level can be accomplished in pretty short time.  The reason why I have so much time on this game is not because the game is long, but because there are some good achievements in this game to keep you searching for more memories, IDs and other clues.  Overall, it's an easy game, though you can play nightmare mode, and a rather short game that takes an already successful recipe for platform action games and creates a great zombie game for anyone to enjoy.","January 3, 2015","true","15.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I tried to write as good as i can.\n\nWhat is Deadlight?Well. It's basically a side-scrolling Platformer with a Zombie Setting. I know the market is getting "overrun" by Zombie games recently. But i hope i can make you understand why THIS one is really special and diffrent. Deadlight is not a Sandbox type of Game. It's a Story driven linear Adventure and it's a damn good one. And even tho it's relativly short (took me about 4 Hours to beat) it is still worth the Money.\n\nGameplayLet's start with the most important thing. The Gameplay. You basically run from the left side of your screen to the right side of your screen. There is Combat, Jumping and some Puzzling involved tho. Zombies (called "Shadows" in the world of Deadlight ) can become really dangerous once you are outnumbered. And i have to be honest here. I died more than once because i underestimated the Situation. There are Weapons in the Game. You get a Fireaxe, a Revolver and a Rifle at some point. But both guns can run out of ammunition (tho i almost never had that Problem) Shooting works actually pretty good in this Game. I played with my 360 Controller. You aim with the right stick while you shoot with the RT. That works pretty good actually. Most of the Time i spend shooting at some objects like locks and so on, rather than Zombies.  Close Combat works ok i think. It's nothing special really. You basicly Hit B to swing your Axe around. That works pretty good for what it is and the Stamina System in the Game provents you from Hack & Slay your way thru bigger groups of Zombies. the jump mechanics also work pretty good.\n\nStoryI have to be honest. The Story isn't that great. You play as Randy Wayne. A Canadian from B.C who is on the lookout for his Family in Seattle aswell as his friends who got caught by a Group called "The new Law". So basically the entire story is based on you finding them. It's really nothing special and we've all have seen that stuff million times in other games. It's not bad don't get me wrong. It makes sense for what it is but don't expect something majestic outta it. It won't blow your mind.\n\nGraphicsThe Game looks good. It really does. It's not Crysis of course but it gets the job done and it definitely delivered a good atmosphere. Light effects are decent and the Levels look like the Dev's really put in some love and time. I can't complain about it.\n\n\nSo i recommend this Game. If you don't wanna pay 10 Bucks for it (which i think is actually a good price for this game) then just wait for a sale. But it's really worth checking out. even for people who don't like the Genre (like me for example).\n\ni would rate Deadlight 8/10\n","September 1, 2014","true","4.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Don't get this game unless you get it really cheap: $3-5 U.S. tops. I'm running this review off of my memories of playing the game several months ago. It definitely left an impression, so let's get on with it.\n\nI'm not writing a really long review this time. Just the basics. It's pretty simple really. Deadlight is an atmospheric side-scroller. You have obstacles in the form of environmental hazards, zombies, unfriendlies, and, of course, obstacles which you must hurdle, climb, dodge, slide past, leap, and time to avoid/survive. There is a very loose storyline that is way too predictable, so if that matters to you, you may just want to skip it. The graphics/atmosphere are actually okay for what it is. Overall the game is a pretty typical side-scrolling platformer, but there are a few pleasant surprises and only a few irritatingly, mind-numbingly, platformer-typical moments of inane aim-twitch-jerk-with-just-the-right-timing @55hat-ery/@55clown-ery. Some odd bits are thrown in for flavor, but mostly I found these elements annoying and distracting from what the game does well. It's almost a runner, somewhat parkour, somewhat zombie survival, with moments dedicated to each of these elements. Think post-apocalyptic urban Indiana Jones/ninja and you might be getting close to the feel of this game. Some elements are too trite and stereotypical to the genre, and there is very little replay value, BUT for a few hours of pleasant distraction it's decent. I recommend it; just don't spend more than what you'd pay for an okay cup of coffee and you'll be alright. And that's about what it's worth to me, a decent cup of coffee: not great, not awesome, but pleasant enough for the short time you spend with it, and it will pump you up a bit, but not too too much. And, although it should pleasantly distract you for considerably longer than that cup, at least you won't have to worry about it getting cold before you've finished with it.","August 28, 2014","true","15.2"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","1"

Not bad, not good, just okay.\n+ Nice art style\n+ Theme\n+ Sound design\n+ Satisfying combat\n\n- Length\n- Voice acting\n- Story\n- Clunky jump mechanics\n\nThe game is a 2.5D action platformer with some shooting and light puzzle solving. The art style is the strongest thing about this whilst I feel the length, voice acting and story could have been much better.\n\nI completed this within 3 hours. A lot of that time was replaying parts with cheap deaths (falling buildings, sizeable hordes) as some scenes need to do remember how you died to avoid it, only to die again at the next jump, it can be frustrating at time. My major gripe with the mechanics is if you're too close to a wall, you cannot walljump and this caused me to die more than I'd like to admit. Also, jumping on to something directly above you can be quite clunky as you need to be super precise. The melee weapon and shooting feels quite good though with plenty of weight behind hits. The voice acting is sub-par all over but the main character got on my nerves and made me cringe constantly, he just did not suit the part and a lot of his acting seemed forced.\n\nIf you're into 2.5D action platformers, you will probably enjoy this and for that reason I recommend it. If you're interested due to the theme alone, I would say avoid this unless the price is right (as of writing it is £9.99). I believe I got it in a bundle, so it was a good buy for me.

Took me two days. It's a short game and never overstayed its welcome. To be honest, I could have gone for 3-4 more hours if they were diverse areas (forest, snow). It's fine as it is. FYI, KB/M feels not right with this one. Played it with my DS3 and it was just perfect.\n\nThe game puts you in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse where you promptly get separated from your wife and daughter. The story revolves around finding them. It's a very focused affair. Don't expect any side story or even much in terms of other characters. Very to the point.\n\nIn 2.5D fashion you're fighting zombies with an axe, pistol and shotgun but don't mistake it as a true action game. Even few zombies can overwhelm you quickly. Often I found myself pushing them away and just running away to higher ground. Besides combat there is a lot platforming which is OK. Nothing spectacular as you don't do free-form jumping. There's not much to do wrong or different as intended.\n\nThe real star here is the desolate world and atmosphere. I wished throughout for an open-world game in this vibe to carefully sneak through a lost, zombie-ridden city. In that, not feeling overpowered in combat was the right decision.\nThe only downsides were a specific early area (Sewers) since that felt totally unrealistic and was totally different and unfitting compared to the rest of the game. Other than that, there are tidbits of aspects when society crumbles but they were never explored too much. Shame.\n\nI liked this game a lot. Ending was great. It's short and good.

Afterwards you don't even get your stuff back, despite it thematically making sense that you would.\n\nThe visuals and initial gameplay are very well executed, but it's not enough to give this a recommendation. The quality of the voice acting is all over the place and as I said above, the second half of the game is just frustrating instead of challenging. The gun and slingshot controls are wonky to control with a mouse.\n\nThe game also starts off with 2 side-characters that you get seperated from, with no explanation of who they are, how they met or what they may have been through. When one of these characters lies dying when you find him, the game expects you to have some sort of emotional reaction. But since you know absolutely nothing about them aside from their name, you obviously don't.\n\nSo no, not recomended. The puzzles are far too simple, the platforming is tedious, the story makes little sense, characters are completely forgettable, the controls are wonky and the gameplay is inconsistent.\n\nPS: 'Shadows' is a terrible name for zombies. I'm all for originality, but 'SHADOWS'?\nIf you're going to put the most cliche video game enemies in your game anyway, you're not going to redeem it by naming them anything other than 'zombies' or 'infected'.","March 8","false","2.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Unfortunately, the clunky control scheme will have you failing simple jumps, dying over simple mistakes and being ripped apart by zombies quite regularly. For a story based platformer, I didn't find myself rooting for the hero or even care about his companions, especially when each of them seems to have a shorter life expectancy than a femal black stoner in a horror film. When you finally do keep a companion alive what results is one of the most frustrating escort quests in any game, where a fast paced "chase sequence" is jarringly broken over and over again while you stop to open doors or help your otherwise useless companion up ledges.\nThat's one of the fundamental problems with this game - it's poor pacing and direction. Sections where you would surely be making a quick escape are full of jarring climbing sections that you seem to take at a rather sedate pace, utterly destroying any tension. There are a few headscratching puzzles that are genuinely fun to solve, and larger open areas that are basically big obstacle courses, but they're so few and far between that the constant running from room to room will eventually become dull. As well as that the pretty graphics, this game's saving grace, quite often clutter the screen making it difficult to determine where you're meant to go.\nTo sum up, Deadlight is a good idea, it just isn't fun due mainly to poor pacing and slack controls, something that's unforgiveable for a platformer, and proves that good graphics do not make a good game. It's not the worst zombie based game I've ever played (that accolade goes to Trapped Dead), but I wouldn't rate it much higher.\n\n3/10\n\nContext - 2\nChallenge - 4\nCatharsis - 3","January 24, 2014","false","3.3"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

Is either going to be a delightful gore fest with pure “kill everything that moves” mechanics, or a survival low pace experience with a big world to explore and bake beans to collect. When you first see Deadlight you might think that this is not an exception if you see the post-apocalyptic setting, character layout and the zombies, but at the same time is a 2D puzzle side scrolling. But it can embrace those factors and go more than just that, taking the whole kill stuff, oh god I am being overrun, to another perspective.\n\nThe game takes place in the post-apocalyptic Seattle when the site gets invaded by zombies. The story doesn’t touch the theme of how this happen until you go to a certain location in the game, so you will mostly uncovered through collectables notes from Randall´s diary, which by the way is the guy who you will play at. He gets separated from his surviving friends after a zombie attack, being the main mission to reunite with them as well as to find his missing family that he lost track of. The plot seems solid at the beginning, as Randall progress he also encounter other threats and revelations that you might not see coming. Problem is that it gets so complicated that in the final stage of the story it all can end in a blind, you will be left with quite some doubts about why this may come to that. Above all this, story is strong enough to bring pace and for you to continue through it.\n\nSo what genre is this? Well don’t get confuse, this is still merely a 2D puzzle platform just like Limbo. The difference is that the challenge that you will encounter is how to evade the zombies (or Shadows as they call them) on each stage and that’s when the level design really shines. You are going to be moving boxes, jump fences, move through houses, electrify stuff around, climb buildings and drop buildings, in order to reach your objectives. The game take place in 3 big areas, some of them are more action packed and some more puzzle base, making the journey less repetitive than just run for zombies or move tramps. That is not only the game´s focus, you will have to kill the infected shadows allow the way if you want to reach the end of the game. Luckily Randall count with melee weapons as well as handguns and shotguns, but with limited ammo and a not very accurate combat system, it may not be a good idea to just fight your way through. Is this combination of elements between levels that make you solve how to avoid the zombies, and waste the less amount of ammo and health as possible feeling like is just the right time in the right moment (obviously since is design as a puzzle solver) without losing pace that this is an apocalyptic adventure.\n\nNow in terms of graphics and music, you’re looking at a gorgeous game full of lights and rich art environment, using the 3d base unreal engine in combination with 2d environment, just a charm for the eye, but you will see most of the characters in black as they are simulated to look in the darkness with the sun in the far end of the map (except for the maps that are on the subway or in deep close rooms). The cut scenes are made with standard animation and a particular illustration that give essence to the invasion theme. Now all this really made the tittles game some name, but sometimes you will get confuse by the perspective and the fact that almost everything is dark (again because of the sun position). For example you may think that you can jump to a crate but really the crate is just part of the environment, since you are in one different layer, same goes for the zombies, items and platforms, they can be on your layer or on a background one.\n\nIn terms of sound the game also shines, just the right effect that you want to heard every time you slash a zombie, or shoot it, making that satisfaction gratifying for the gore fans, other sound like objects falling off the building or windows breaking give the levels the feeling that the game wants you to take it for, follow by low calm music. So overall in terms of sound and visual effects the game doesn’t let down (unless you count the lack of PC graphic settings).\n\nSo in short lines, we have a puzzle base platformer in which you survive by killing the less amounts of zombies possible or avoid them completely, with the solid objective of finding your family and uncover one or two dark little secret that kind of cause this whole mess.  Despite some perspective problems, glitches and some level design decisions (may even include tediousness of the checkpoints), you got yourself an existing survival theme platformer that will consume 4 to 6 hours. A good purchase for the survival and 2d platform fan.","January 12, 2014","true","4.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Narrative voice is charismatic and good to listen. And zombies. And... That's it.\n\nMechanics is simple, way too simple. Additionally it is irritating and buggy. The story that should be another first squad player in this type of game is again too simple, boring, disappointing and I must force myself to finish it. I am not afraid, curious or sad with all that is happening in the Deadlight. And I should (and I am not any robotic creature in case you got that impression from 'machinery' thing in the very first sentence). Although ending is quite dramatic and full of tension it doesn't make up for the whole game. The same is music - I've noticed it on credits screen. And last nail: Deadlight is the worst optimized game I've played in a very long time. My fantastic ultrabook with i7 on board and hd 4000 chuckles heavily.\n\nLost potential, but still a unique game in its genre. Wait for a discount and give it a try.

Getting over a fence can be a chore (and whille speaking of controls, use a gamepad if you can, keyboard controls are awful). Thankfully, the checkpoints are abundant so you can re-try and die faster... Unless you quit the game. Then you'll need to repeat most of the level. Cuz.\nMelee combat is pretty weak. Attacking with the axe is awkward and zombies hit pretty hard and can grap you pretty quickly, making not using the pistol or shotgun against more than 2/3 zombies a madman's dream.\nRegarding the firearms, the shotgun feels very underused... you get it more than halfway through the game and loose it soon afterwards, and isn't particularly useful or used in any way for the puzzles.\nThe puzzles you find are pretty simple too, and that feels right. They don't break the rythm of the action or platforming and are well integrated.\nThe story is... decent for a game like this. The "main" story is predictable and simple most of the time, it was obvious the devs were focusing on the protagonist's past, wich most of the collectibles in the game refer to in someway. The end-twist was pretty predictable too.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, if you find yourself thinking "Should i get Deadlight?" all i can say is, if you want to keep busy for an afternoon and you both like plataformers AND aren't tired of the whole zombie apocalypse, get it during a sale. Or in any future possible bundles. 15€ is WAY too much for such an overall "okayish" game that lasts 5 hours.","September 6, 2014","true","5.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Zombies) take over the streets.The protagonist,Randal Wayne,a 33-years-old man who used to live in Hope,Canada,a town on a mountain (i guess),seeks his family,his wife and daughter after they got seperated during the shadows* outbreak.Randalbelieves they are located in the Safe Point.Safe Point is a safe place as the radio broadcast suggests.Many people have gone there,and Randal  believes that his family is one of them.\nThe game is short.In about 4-5 hours,the game is completed.but what do you expect from a 2D game after all?\nOk,of course playing with a controller is much better that keyboard in many games,and 2D games are one of them.Although many people complained about the controls being bad,i didn't have a problem with them.\nThe truth is,the game is pretty buggy.from cutscenes without sound(this is fixable,but still the developers should have updated that) to floating zombies.Plus,one of the biggest negatives of this game,is that objects confuse you.How?some of them are background,some of them are not.Imagine that you try to jump to a platform,however this platform was a background,and you fell to your death.Great Success!\nSo,you would ask why i would recommend this game.It Depends on the money you will give for it.I bought it pretty cheap,and it was worth it after all.of course,i DO NOT RECOMMENT IT FOR ITS ACTUAL PRICE,but if you find it in a deal,then i suggest you give it a try!\n\nGraphics : 7,5 / 10\nGameplay : 4 / 10\nControls : 5 / 10\nStory : 7 / 10\nConclusion : 5,8 / 10\n\nHave a good day!","August 25, 2014","true","11.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You are playing as Randall Wayne, who is searching for his wife and daughter. You could say that it is nothing incredible, despite the fact the world is over. Unknown virus spread through Randall's homeland, turning people into wild beasts called "ghosts". In this post-apocalyptic environment Randall wants to survive and to find his family members, being surrounded by infected from one side, and by his flashbacks on the another side.\n\n"Deadlight" is a classic platform game which includes puzzle riddles and some tasks requiring agility to pass them. Apart from that, the graphic and whole atmosphere is noteworthy. You can see beautiful landscapes of the city, suburbs or sewers, making a great background to the actual game area on which you can climb, run, hit... or even whistle to drag enemies' attention. There are also cutscenes made in drawn-slideshow style that tell the story in it's crucial moments. Randall can also fight with different weapons: fireaxe, gun or rifle. Ammunition is limited, so even when you get shotgun, you won't turn into a person who defeats all enemies without much effort.\n\nI must also say some words about the achievements. I enjoyed getting them. Some of them are easy (like beating a certain chapter of the story) or harder (like beating the game on nightmare difficulty), but in general you can get over in my oppinion 50% achievements unlocked easily by just finishing the game.\nThe difficulty level is balanced - the game is not too easy, but it's not too hard to pass either.\n\nAbout disadvantages... well, I can say it was maybe too short. It might be worse if the story kept on extend, so (oh well)  I believe the creators calculated the time needed to pass this game correctly. These several hours spent in post-zombie apocalypse world and atmosphere of being hunted are enough to love this game (at least that's my oppinion).\n\nWhat will be the end of Randall's history? Will he find his family, or is there any cure for that terrible illness that brought apocalypse to Deadlight's world?\nTo know the answers, you must check it out by yourself by beating this game, 'cause it's totally worth it!","November 9, 2014","true","4.3"," 24 of 44 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","24","44","0","1"

With it's more or less 'flight over fight' playstyle, it forces the player to flee when the numbers of the deemed "shadows" exceed that that of more than two. I personally found it to be a very enjoyable twist in the series, opposed to games such as Left 4 Dead that give you the option to fight whilst keeping a steady movement pace, Deadlight encourages the player to keep moving at all times, only slowing them down with numerous puzzles and sequences of contraptions concieved by survivors.\n\nHowever, beyond the hordes of undead and traps that could massacare Randall in a blink of an eye, the real threat lies within the game's controls. Unresponsive, clunky sequences result in a very unenjoyable experience at several points of the game that make you just want to walk away from the computer. Several stages of the game feature fast-paced parkour over fences and under obstacles, but fail to properly display the full potential of such a mechanic due to Randall prefering to hang onto a ledge whilst  looted helicopers rain hell from above you  or hordes of undead threaten to rip you limb from limb.\n\nOverall the game has a very fun premise but falls short of something that could have been an amazing experience for the player to enjoy for hours on end.\n\n7/10.","December 30, 2013","true","4.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

But play past the first act and it regrettably develops into the most infuriating excuse for a platformer.\n\n*Spoilers ahead*\n\nYou meet this man called "Rat". You're cornered by a horde of zombies during a cutscene and the Rat drags you into a sewer saving your life. Nice guy? NO! He decides to strip you of all your weapons and then put you through the most mundane obstacle course  ever created! He's some crazed man that sensed the outbreak happening and built and under ground killing chamber.

At this point the game had lost all off the tension and atmosphere it had crafted at the beginning.\n\nOnce you're forced to move through the environments at speed (because of helicopters gunning you down from this stupid "military") the the controls become as slow as a zombie with no limbs trying to climb a hill, they single handedly crush the experience from the middle to the end of the game. I had to repeated a scripted section where you run through a house that's collapsing over 30 times because it controlled that appallingly.

Possibly the most frustrating and disappointing game I've ever played.  Cannot recommend due to god awful controls and "trial and error" gameplay.  I swear the devs made this game just to watch me play and then laugh every time they trick me.  Much of the game you will have to die first, then figure out how not to die the next time.  Controls (using a gamepad) are downright sloppy, inconsistent and unpredictable.  Sometimes control is yanked right out of your hands for no good reason (like when you get the shotgun).  Minor bugs like pushing esc or start and having the game freeze up for 30 seconds while the menu loads only add to my frustration.  Plus the checkpoint system is ludicrous, dying/reloading takes forever and its just not FUN to die.  I say that after playing hotline miami, where I never felt like dying was cheap.\n\nThe thing is, its a very good looking platformer, in a very good environment and a decent backstory.

The screenshots do not do the game justice, and if you are able to play on medium to max settings, you will be greeted by a beautiful, dark world resulting from a zombie apocalypse. The sound and music is also very good, and adds to the seemingly hopeless aura projected by the story. The cutscenes are nice, however, if you have problems with the sound playing, make sure to check out the steam guide detailing how to fix this - you don't want to miss out on the writing.\n\nThe controls are pretty straighforward, and you are reminded of the controls whenever a new mechanic is introduced (or if you appear to be stucked). The tutorial (control) popups can be a bit noisy/intrusive, as they will appear in the middle of the screen and will show both the xbox controller and keyboard controls. The learning curve is minimal to moderate - the puzzles are not very challenging, and the game seems to be more of a storytelling narrative. You can choose to fight the zombies - referred to as "shadows" - but most of the time it is more efficient to dodge them with some light parkour tricks (like jumping over vehicles or leaping across large gaps. The game provides checkpoints pretty regularly.\n\nOverall, the gameplay and feel of the game is quite fluid - strengthening the atmospheric element as you continue to experience the story. For the achievement hunters, there are a number of "secrets" and collectibles, however, most of them are easy to find if you just explore the entirety of the levels (which usually consists of jumping across to a ledge you don't need to use). The feedback in the game is very helpful, always showing you when there is an object you can interact with.\n\nWhen using melee attacks, your stamina bar will deplete - when you have low stamina, the screen will have a beating, tunnel vision effect, which I found to be a very nice touch. Headshots with the revolver are also cool to see. You can also taunt enemies to draw them toward you (so you can jump over them, or use traps like dropping a car).\n\nPersonally, one of the coolest, most rewarding things to do in this game is to progress through an area quickly, continuously leaping and wall jumping until you get to the next checkpoint. The smoothness and fluidity of the gameplay makes these speedruns look amazing. You might, however, also miss collectibles if you proceed too quickly.\n\nIf you are into the zombie theme and enjoy atmospheric puzzlers with a nice story, give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n","September 5, 2014","true","4.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","1"

Far too many aspects are frustrating or badly designed for it to be worth any of your time or money.  If you need further persuasion than that - read on:\n\nI bought and played this game after watching the trailer - and for what it shows it's accurate enough.  Parts of the game do look stylishly good and there are some free-running sections which work well and are even exhilerating.  But in almost every other aspect the game falls flat - and is on the whole entirely frustrating.\n\nThe story is abysmal - punctuated by truly horrible voice acting that will make you cringe and which is, for the most part, unskippable.  Additionally you are likely, even certain, to be forced to relisten to this terrible dialogue due to the checkpoint system and the game's mechanic of progression through death (or just plain old bugs).  On many occasions there will be no way to know that an upcoming location is deadly until you step into it - and you will have to repeat lengthy sections through no fault of your own.  This will get very old very quickly.  Especially in locations where the finicky and unreliable fence-climbing controls will lead to your demise right at the end of a section that you're now replaying for the fifth time.\n\nThere is no aspect of inventory / ammunition management or conservation as you will be given all the ammunition you need directly before you need it.  Find a box of shotgun shells? Zombie hoard dead ahead. Two bullets? Lonely zombie coming up.  Any ammunition you bother to save will periodically and suddently be taken from you by "plot developments".\n\nThe only redeeming feature is that it ends very quickly and suddently.\n\nDon't buy this game.","November 25, 2013","false","5.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","1"

If you love some 2D graphic similar to Shank 2 or Bleed (Other 2D great games), this is really fit you then! The story take place around 1980s, and there are a huge zombies apocalypse. The main character are Randall Wayne, searching through the town for his lovely wife and daughter. It takes some strategy through many obstacles and free-running pass through lot of zombies. At the beginning, you start with your bare hands, later on, collect weapons and start to fight through your day! I would rate this 9/10, here are why:\n\nPros:\n- Truly amazing graphic in 2D ( Made by Unreal Engine)\n- Satisfying gameplay and story plot twist (Spoiler Alert!)\n- Fanstatic free-style-running (parkour)\n- Amazing voice actor and magnificent art\n- Great sounds\n- Have trading cards and steam cloud\n\nCons:\n- Some places are really glitches and/or bugs ( trust me, you WILL find it)\n- If you play 4+ hours, you should've been done the campaign (Short game)\n- Don't have multiplayer or co-op ( Would've been cool)\n- Somewhat realistic, combat is inconsistent\n\nHere is my opinion for this game:) Hope to help someone out before buying this game!

A lot of the environmental puzzles are really well designed and there's a feeling of exploring a grimly beautiful diorama.\n\nA few of the chapters had really fun gameplay elements, but felt like they were completely un-needed for the story. The game has a 'twist', and quite a modest attempt at putting a lot of thought behind it all, especially in the form of diary pages, which you find as you explore. However, this level of the story requires quite a lot of patience reading through the pages you find.\n\nThe game has a well implemented checkpoint feature, respawning you generally just a few moments before you made your fatal error. Each scene is a puzzle and the game generally doesn't punish you for making a mistake. I did encounter a couple of moments where I was set back about a minutes worth of gameplay, which felt frustrating but only by comparison to how good the system usually was.\n\nOverall, good clichéd fun and an interesting merge of gameplay and genre.","February 4, 2013","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I'm not sure if the developers were going for the Limbo "trial-and-death" style gameplay. Most areas were pretty simple, but there were a few that required repetitious deaths to figure out.\n\nThe game ships with no sound on the cut scenes without changing a file in the installation directory. It is a known issue on the forums and easy to fix, but it left a bad first impression.\n\nOverall, there wasn't anything that really excited me about Deadlight--thankfully I didn't pay much for it.

Both the visual fidelity and the detailed and lovingly crafted levels build up a nightmarish atmosphere and underlines the horror of a zombie-infested city.\n\nI won't talk much about the story. While it isn't exactly innovative, it's the way the story is told that keeps you going on. Secrets you find across the levels give you an even deeper insight of what happened and why. Oh, and the ending comes with a pretty surprising twist...\n\nAs mentioned before, the game focuses on the survival aspect, so while you do find guns in the game, you rather rarely find ammo for them and mostly end up using the guns to shoot padlocks or other 'puzzle' elements.\n\nGameplay-wise, Deadlight doesn't exactly re-invent the wheel and comes with the typical platforming and combat controls. There are no special moves, whacky weapons or the likes, so it's all pretty much basic platformer-101.\n\nSince this is a platformer, there is a lot of, uh, platforming going on. Most of the time not really challenging, you come across a couple parts where things can get quite frustrating, e.g. where you have to escape a collapsing building and stuff like that. Luckily enough, the checkpoints are placed pretty well, so you rarely end up having to re-play a large chunk of the level in order to get back to where you died, but still, I feel like a bit more fine-tuning wouldn't have hurt the platforming aspect of the game.\n\nAccording to the ingame stats, it took me 06h46m to beat the game. That involved 100%-ing the game (finding all secrets and bonuses), quite a bit of trial-and-error and a whole lot of dying. Personally, I think that's pretty much the right length for a game like this but it surely can be beaten in 5 hours or less if you don't care about finding the secrets and don't die as often as I did... :D\n\nSo, Deadlight won't exactly win any innovation awards, but it certainly approaches the zombie genre from a slightly different direction than the typical zombie-slaugher games, which works out really well. Together with the solid platforming mechanics and the gripping story-telling, Tequila Works managed to release a detailed and pretty impressive debut game, so one can hope they keep up the quality for a possible sequel.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out!","March 31, 2013","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I found it in my library one day and after watching the trailer I decided to give it a try. It somehow reminded me of Mark Of The Ninja, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Left4Dead all together and this couldn't be a bad thing.\n\nThis being said, it's not much to say about the game.\n\nThe game looks great and has an awesome artistic direction as well as a nice story (wouldn't call it good but it's enjoyable. The soundtrack is very good and fits perfectly with the somber atmosphere of this game.\n\nNaturally, being a platformer,  there are a lot of simple puzzles to solve. In fact, the second chapter (the game is split into 3 chapters) of the game is full of them and it feels like it was especially designed to have as many puzzles as possible.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has it's issues.\n\nThe most annoying thing is the clunky controls that can make the game frustrating since it has many trial-and-error moments\n\nButton response is slow and extremely unresponsive. Same goes for the aiming system.\nTrying to jump of a fence can make you jump back to the side you're coming from, in the middle of the zombies.\nTrying to make a sprint right after jumping down from a fence or windows usually doesn't work and you have to try holding the sprint key a few times.\nJumping while you are sliding down on a wall or floor doesn't work as it should or takes too long to respond, making you miss the jump window and retry again and again. Sometimes, jumping when running won't work so you'll find yourself stumbling upon boxed all the time. And since getting up is slow, you'll most likely end up being eaten by shadows.\n\nIt also has some bugs in the last chapter of the game. Reaching the top of the stairs that end up with a shaft causes the shaft to close before you get out, pushing you out of the map. Also, this happens when you try to get inside a building or room through a window. The window opens before you can get on the other side and you get stuck there so you need to restart the checkpoint.\n\nThe last chapter unfortunately is full of bugs and the controls feel worse here. Escaping the military base is a nightmare. I encountered all those bugs there. Also, the interact button as well as using the ax to break things are extremely unresponsive here.\n\nOf course, these problems won't occur when you use a controller showing that this game was designed with a controller in mind, something you can see in the videos in the extras menu, after you finish the game.\n\nHowever, leaving all these problems aside and the fact that the game is very short (you can finish it in less than 2 hours on your second playthrough), the game is enjoyable and fun to play and definitely worth a few bucks.\n\n7/10","November 2, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not that much you will say, and I would agree, except that the game is not very long to finish (4-5 hours), so I think the amount of differentiation between weapons, amount of levels and types of enemies is just right.\n\nIt is clear that originally Deadlight was intended as a low budget indie title, and it is a shame that the developer had no more resources in order to extend and deepen Randall's personal story, maybe with more flashbacks from his past, or even only with more levels, enemies and weapons. 2.5 graphics are just perfect to represent this diseased world full of oppressive atmospheres, and the main musial theme is really awesome, so moody!!\n\nDo not let the abused zombie theme fool you, Deadlight is a nice game if you like the genre, it offers the right amount of contents and fun for its price.

It is recomended on sales 5 - 7 euros is a good price for this game.","March 4, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Nice sound effects and music.\nThe storyline is a bit raw and the script pretty short. You find yourself directly put into a character who is already in a path of searching his wife and daughter after the apocalypse occurred.\nThe length of the game is VERY short that's for sure. Leaving space for a sequel [especially the way it ends (?)].\nThere are some bug reports all over the net, I had no problems at all.\n\nTotally recommended if you are into it! zombie killing ftw x3\nAnd worth getting during special offers cause the game really is too short for its price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleetcommand/recommended/211400/","fleetcommand","FleetCommand","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleetcommand/","521 products in account","What does the store say?\n"This visually stunning Cinematic Survival Platformer will challenge you to run, jump, climb, and struggle for your life as you look for answers and the ones you love." - by an unknown PR guy\n\nThat's what you can see on the store page. "Cinematic Survival Platformer". Every word starts with a capital letter. Deadlight is a platformer which truly will challenge you to run, jump, climb because you cannot really do any of those.\n\nI put some pixels here...\nOkay, let me be clear: I love the visuals. The creators of this game were real artists and I admire what they have done with their post-apocaliptic Seattle. I even loved the music, but that's also art. What I didn't like though is that this game calls itself a platformer while that's the weakest part of the whole thing.\n\nWho's in control? Not me.\nThe controls are inconsistent and unresponsive. Wayne (the protagonist) keeps missing jumps or just doesn't jump or sticks to the wall and you can't jump from there. You try to jump off from that ledge and he just decides to stick to it and not going anywhere. And, as you might expect: this results your death. Not for you not being able to figure out what to do but because Wayne loves hanging on ledges even when the whole building is collapsing on his head.\n\nOr even better: you realize that you have to pull a box in the appropriate position to get through an area and you feel you achieved something. You solved a puzzle. But you're wrong, my dear! Here comes the frustrating part: You try to jump on the box and you keep missing the jump either because Wayne jumps too short or too long and you slip into water and you die. You die because you control the only man on Earth who has survived a zombie apocalypse but can't swim. So what usually comes is that you have to wait until Wayne drowns then you have to press a button to get back to the latest checkpoint. So the screen fades, a loading screen appears for no reason then usually you have to wait through some unskippable animation or act or you just have to listen to Wayne's word-saving wisdoms for the 15th time in a row. First it's nice, and okay for the second or third time. But after that many retries you just want to ragequit and uninstall the whole thing. And the game is full of these.\n\nPros and cons\nWhat I like about this game:\nThe visuals are stunning! If there's one reason I'd really recommend you to buy this game, this is it! For real! Love it! Love it!\nThe music is quite good. And I would listen to the music during the helicopter chase again and again!\nI loved the ending even if the story basically is full of cliches\nWhat I don't like about this game:\nThe controls are unresponsive. Missing jumps, not doing what you'd expect you should be doing, etc. This is unforgivable when your survival depends on it!\nThe monologues and dialogs are dumb and inconsistent with the story. You have two weapons with full mags then comes a cutscene and Wayne ooops, he's out of bullets. How unfortunate. You should have looked in your gun, Wayne!\nThe story elements are also dumb and incostitent. You die from a few bites, but your unarmored and hung up friend is attacked by a zombie and all he can do is to kick the zombie in the face. Then you go like "okay, save Ben" and you wander around on the map for 5+ minutes to get to him and look, what happens: he's still alive! Proskills! We should have played Ben as a protagonist instead of Wayne!\nThe collectible things include three handheld game consoles throughout the levels. If you get them, you can play the games on them (80s style quartz games). I got two of the three and had more fun playing those games for 10 minutes than playing Deadlight hours. This is a shame.\nBuy it for the visuals if you can live with all these flaws. Otherwise it will just drive you mad.","December 29, 2014","false","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The idea of the game is admirable - a zombie platformer - but that idea can't carry the whole game when the story is very mediocre at its best and the clunky controls cause occasional frustration, not mentioning how campy most of the voice actors sound. Also it lasts barely three hours and there even is one 30 minutes lasting part which is completely pointless and out of place, something what the creators should have cut out before the final version of the game and replace it with actually a relevant sequence. So why do I recommend this after all these negative things? Deadlight's graphics look great considering it's a sidescroller game, and some scenes are really enjoyable when the controls and the story's lousy writing aren't bothering you. You could spend your two hours in a worse way than playing this game. The main point is the price of Deadlight: if you can buy it with some pocket change, go for it, especially if you're always ready for another zombie adventure. At full price? Not worth it.\n\n*After you finish the game a difficulty mode called "Nightmare mode" unlocks, urging you to repeat the game. It contains an alternative ending, but I didn't feel like wanting to play the game again any time soon so I watched it on YouTube. I prefer it to the original ending, so if you want to experience Deadlight again with a better ending you should, or you can just do as I did.","January 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're suddendly separated and embark on a journey to find what happened to them and with hope to also find your wife and daughter amidst the chaos.\nDeadlight is an ok platformer with a simple yet intriguing storyline and great atmosphere: it's a shame that it tries, sometimes succeeding, to ruin your fun with awkward controls and some frustrating sections.\n\nPROS:\n\n-good graphics and art style showing a destroyed Seattle, the areas you'll explore and the background scenery are truly bleak and beautiful in their own way\n\n-good soundtrack\n\n-the voice acting is pretty good especially on the main character\n\n-Randall Wayne is a well-written main character, a man stopping at nothing to survive while also being haunted by its past\n\n-the zombies are actually menacing and very dangerous (in part, sadly, due to the awkward controls)\n\n-decent plot with a good ending section: there's also an alternative ending- unlocked by beating the atrocious Nightmare mode- that gives you a different take on the events of the game, I recommend you look it up on Youtube once you've finished the game\n\nCONS:\n\n-controls are sometimes unresponsive or extremely finicky, grappling a ledge or a ladder won't work properly unless you're positioned exactly right next to it, sometimes it'll take a split second too long to actually start jumping or running- due to delay in controls- and this'd easily spell your doom\n\n-combat is so-so as firearms work well enough but melee combat is overly random: sometimes you'll decapitate or trip a zombie with a single hit while other fights see you bashing their heads repeatedly with little to no effect before getting overwhelmed and eaten\n\n-some levels delve into trial and error affairs requiring you to memorize the whole sequence while also hoping the controls won't let you down: this isn't fun and can get frustrating\n\n-Nightmare mode, where the game saves only at the beginning of each Act, is an asinine proposition considering you can often die due to unresponsive controls\n\n-some assorted bugs due to it being a lazy port such as framerate drops, the game hanging and sometimes crashing while trying to access the start menu etc...some of those can be solved through workarounds posted on the forums but it's unacceptable nonetheless\n\n-pretty short and linear, no real replay value\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515362638\n\nDeadlight does as many things right as it does wrong...the unresponsive and sometimes buggy controls, paired with some overly difficult sections, can really get in the way of your fun: this gets very clear during the second half of the game, with a few acts sporting truly annoying scenes where a single mistake or bug in the controls will see you die. Thankfully there's always a checkpoint near so you won't be losing much progress and it's not as bad as some reviews make it out to be, even though I'm not really into the genre I managed to get through said sections in a few tries.\n\nWhile dodgy controls in a platformer are an unforgivable sin the game does manage to pull itself through thanks to a story that, while surely full of survival/ zombie cliches, is quite engaging and features a few twists to keep you interested. There's also a great atmosphere to be found in the game's bleak graphics, Seattle is truly a zombie infested ruin with abandoned vehicles, crumbling walls and corpses everywhere. Last but not least Randall was an enjoyable character to control with a strong voice acting and an interesting take on things through both its thoughts and diary pages.\n\nDeadlight is a decent game overall if you can be patient with its obvious shortcomings and I feel it's worth a playthrough for any zombie fan: do not buy at full price though since it's simply not worth that much, wait for the big sales where it's under the 2$ mark.","September 10, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If not - here is the concept in broad strokes: Due to some mysterious reason (either virus outbreak, genetic mutations or just something strange in the water), the recently deceased start rising back as flesh eating zombies (which from now on will be referred as shadows, to be consistent with the game nomenclature), killing and infecting everyone they scratch or bite. Only a selected few manage to escape the outbreak, and this is  where  the struggle for survival begins - not only from the shadows, that are just looking for an healthy snack - but also from ruthless groups of survivors that prey from the weak.\n\nSo, it is in this setting that we find our character - Randall Wayne -  traveling alongside a small group of survivors in hopes of finding a reported "Safe Point" in Seattle. We meet the group when a member just got bitten (as invariably happens) and head shot by Randall for the greater good . It is common knowledge that gunfire will attract shadows to you as fire attracts moths, so soon enough the group is overrun by shadows and Randall is separated from all the others. I could continue telling the story, but all in all it is textbook generic and doesn't bring anything that we haven't seen before.\n\nHowever, the story is not the big selling point of deadlight. For all old timers that kept on playing games from the 80's and 90's, this is a good opportunity to play a 2D platformer that has a similar feel to the original Prince of Persia.\n\nThe atmosphere of Deadlight is also a very strong point. The backgrounds on all sets are amazing, very detailed and bring a certain degree of dark realism when portraying a dying world. It is interesting to see that the opposite happens with the characters that bring life to Deadligth's universe - they are mostly dark outlines of them, shadows as it may - which makes the choice of denominating the zombies as "Shadows" an intriguing creative decision, to say the least.\n\nThere is also a never ending supply of shadows. Stay too long fighting in one place, and more will come. Fire a couple of shots, and soon enough you will be  be swarmed. Bullets will not settle the score - they will only buy you extra few seconds to escape. That being said - it is also quite possible to finish Deadlight without firing many shots, as long as you time your actions just right.\n\nThe controls are all you can expect: They are responsive and simple. However, they also bring a negative point that clearly indicates that this is a console port - they are mapped in such way that makes the combination of some actions (double jump or sprinting + crouching) an awkward task. Most people will find this as a perfect excuse to unleash their rage  and justify their failures every time Randall dies...\n\n... and he will, that I can guarantee!!! Even though there aren't any particular difficulty spikes, there will be plenty of events that will catch you off-guard. From platforms falling, being swarmed by shadows, shot by humans, or situations that will require nimble fingers, there will be plenty of opportunities to get Randall killed. But not to worry, Deadlight auto-saves regularly, with checkpoints conveniently placed to let you retry as much as you like until you reach a state of perfection.\n\n\n\nTo simply sum it up in one sentence:  the mechanics, the puzzles and level construction - all of those elements blend quite nicely with the dark environment and great visuals of Deadlight.\n\nIf you are feeling inspired, it is likely that you will be able to finish the main story in one sitting. Even in the hardest setting, it took me only a couple of hours to accomplish that. However, it also brings great replayability value. Each act / scene will record the time taken to complete, and you will be compelled to play them over and over again, just to find all the secrets or to improve your time. The plus side is that you can select the act / scene you want to play, as long as it was completed once. This is a great feature if you want to train the most difficult parts before tackling Nightmare mode. And what is "Nightmare" mode, you ask? Upon finishing the first run, we are given the opportunity to play Deadlight in a mode where there are no check points - meaning that you only have one shot to complete it from start to finish. Die once, and you are back to square one. Personally, I haven't completed this one, but a little shadow told me that people who have will gain access to an alternative ending that may be rather enlightening.\n\nSo, if you have Deadlight lost in your steam library, just enjoy it, and let me know how it went.","May 28","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Although, if you play through the game on Nightmare mode, I guarantee you you'll be surprised -- the secret ending may make no sense at all, but at least it is unexpected.\n\nTwo final notes: there's no in-game reward for gathering all the collectibles, so it is safe to skip doing that, and this game has absolutely no Metroidvania aspects at all -- it is a perfectly linear platformer from start to finish.\n\nAll in all I can't recommend Deadlight but if it is on sale for cheap it might be worth it for a few hours of themed jumping puzzles.","June 29, 2014","false","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A side-scroller that uses Unreal Engine 3! No wonder the game looks beautiful. Developed by the Spanish Tequila Works, Deadlight is a survival horror platformer game taking place in the '80s during a zombie outbreak. I guess there were two reasons for picking mentioned era: best platformers we refer to as classics were made in those days and as there were no internet and mobile phones at that time the game can really grasp the atmosphere of isolation during the incident.\n\nThe game was criticised for its controls - I agree as there are stages where I needed to try and try again after dying many times as I was not able to carefully plan a jump. Also, while the game looks stunning you do not really have a lot of time to look around as the infected are approaching and quick reaction is necessary.\n\nOverall, this is a very good game. Somewhat short and can be maddeningly difficult, Deadlight proves there can be a need for sidescrollers out there and these can be made by utilising modern day's technology.","March 23, 2014","true","8.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It woud be a pain to use it in several levels.\nThe death run level? Good luck using the keyboard with default keys. Try switching between the LShift and LCtrl keys and pressing them with your pinkie.

It's a very fun game with a decent apocalyptic story. The gameplay is very fun, but also a little frustrating at times. All of the people saying the controls are bad are probably playing with a keyboard and mouse... It's meant to be played with a controller. Overall, I would recommend this game. I beat it in a little over 6 hours according to the game's menu, so it's definitely not a very short game for $15. In my opinion, the game is well worth a shot.

The play time is not wrong, the game takes around that long to finish if you die as much as me because I didn't press a certain button with a millimetric precision at the right time.","December 29, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you can see, I have 5.3h on record, which is how long it took me to beat it. Most people probably beat it in 3 or less because I'm terrible at platformers. With that said, I have no regrets with this purchase. There was a compelling narrative (even for a zombie apocalypse) and a few plot twists along the way. It does do the notorious "nightmare mode unlocked" once you beat it which is pretty lame, because there really isn't much point to a second play through unless you really want to test your platforming skills...but if that's the case I would recommend Castlevania lol.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to hardcore platform gamers because as far as camera and controller issues are concerned, there are some problems. It just surprised me that I'm one of the last types of players you'd see playing a platformer and yet I enjoyed it. So if you aren't much of a platformer and often find yourself not finishing games for whatever reason, this is a good segue into the genre. It's short. The story is compelling. There is a decent amount of enjoyable challenge on normal difficulty (if you aren't much of a platformer), and the cutscenes and ending are rewarding. Great for a sit-down play-through when you find some free time.","December 29, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since it was in the Steam Sale for a few bucks, I got it.\nAt the beginning the game was really fun, I liked it and was interested in learning more about the characters background.\nLater on I was really annoyed by this game. The playthrough felt like work.\n\nGraphics are really nice, especially when you got the city in the background, which makes a great atmosphere. The game runs good also.\nThe Controls felt good, altho sometimes I had problems with the timing. I was playing it with a Xbox 360 Controller.\n\nAnd thats where the game deserves criticism. It's SO linear. No surprise and not even bad for me in general, but it's so extreme, there are hardly any alteranate routes to use, and if you're not exactly performing how the game wants you to, you simply die. Over and over. You need to stand at the exact point, shoot at the exact time e.g.\n\nI like hard games but this made me mad. Doing the same Sequence 10 times and experiencing glitches (which make you die..) really kills the fun.\n\nThe dialogues are bad, the story has major flaws in it's solution and the whole game doesn't make you care about the characters or the world in general.\nIt feels like the engine, gameplay etc. has a big potential, but the boring story and foreseeable end really made me dislike the game.\n\nThe good gameplay and nice graphics can't make up for that.\n\nWhen finished, 'Nightmare' mode got unlocked.

If the ending hadn't made me want to dropkick my monitor, I might be able to recomment trying it for that price.\n\nGo play Limbo instead.","December 29, 2014","false","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After I just beat it, all I could think of was "That's it?" Lame story, terrible voice acting (more than likely the script), very infuriating level design challenges and clunky AI all wrap this up into a less than stellar title.  I'm glad I bought it on sale.  The only fun part was the middle Rat man section, where there was a little creative challenge. But after that it was stupid stray bullet deaths (literally shot in the middle of a running jump, and fell straight down into the water), and a poor ending.  The comic book bits were drawn nicely, but seemed more like an easy out for the developers to transition between stages.  If they can animate a helicopter shooting you from a rooftop, they can animate the crash too. Overall, I was left wondering when the real game would start.\n5/10","December 4, 2013","false","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There were a couple of places that were incredibly frustrating because there was no room for error, yet the controls are imprecise.

However, I still enjoyed the game overall. The atmosphere is great, and the puzzles are entertaining. Not worth the full $15 in my opinion (I completed the game in slightly more than 3 hours, which means I could have just gone to see a movie and spent less money for about the same amount of entertainment, and we all know how much movies cost these days), but well worth picking up on the cheap during a Steam sale.","December 29, 2013","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Odd combo you might think, but much like games like Trine it takes it's 2D plane and packs in an AMAZING amount of detail all over that really set the scene of post apocalyptic Seattle. You play Randall, a man who has survived becoming a "Shadow" and is trying to find his family and reach a safe haven.\n\nThis is a first impressions review:\n\nTo start off like I said the detail is amazing, growing up in the Pacific Northwest seeing the detail they put into the areas really made me happy and gave a me a nearly home feeling (despite the fact it was destroyed). The game has a nice flow to it and controls pretty smoothly. The character so far is believable and has a reasonable enough agenda. And he looks exactly like a rough guy from Seattle would.\n\nThe fact that you rather avoid zombies than kill them due to stamina and lack of ammo really brings in the survival horror feel for me, and the planning in obstacles really polishes the side scrolling bit. My pet peeves arise from two things however, one some of the obstacles are a bit tedious, seeing as they might require a still jump but naturally it's hard to place yourself under it and you end up jumping all over and wasting time. The second is a stricly mouse and keyboard issue, the aiming of the gun being just a bit too stiff to really gun down a zombie about to bite me.\n\nOverall this game is definitely worth getting from what I've seen in just my first hour of playing.","February 4, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything looks excellent and there's a good amount of depth to each location to help break up the 2D side-scroller feel. You play a character named Randall, who's been separated from his friends and family and is looking for them. The storyline is pretty throw-away. Around the 2/3 mark the game really starts to lose steam and resorts to some pretty cheap instant death traps and timed segments that rely on precision jumping skills. Unfortunately, the game's controls aren't quite as precise as they need to be to accomplish these sections without dying repeatedly due to your character being unresponsive to your inputs. More than a few times Randall will just stay attached to a wall or fence, refusing to jump, despite the jump button being pressed repeatedly. This gets really frustrating really fast. It's a pretty short game too, only taking a few hours to complete. I'd recommend picking it up if you can get it for $5 or less.

The puzzles aren't very complex or challenging, but they are thought-provoking enough to keep the experience engaging.\n\nMany of Deadlight's greatest features are due to the appropriately gauged ambition of its designers. The development team knew that they could not make everything work with a low budget and so few hands on the project. For that reason they stuck only with things that worked for the game. What you're left with is a short, sweet, highly atmospheric and engrossing indie platformer.\n\nThe setting is very unoriginal and the controls sometimes seem a bit awkward when using a mouse and keyboard, but every aspect of the game reinforces its creepy atmosphere – and this is why Deadlight succeeds. Grab it in a sale though, because the 4 hours it takes to complete the game are not much for £10 – even with the unlockable extras that the game has to offer.","June 11, 2013","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is divided into three acts: The first act plays like a high-quality survival-horror platformer with limited focus on combat. The atmosphere is terrific and this is by far the high point of the campaign. The second act, though, stumbles horribly into a platforming/puzzle-solving mess that's made annoying by the game's awful controls that just never feel right at all. The third act strives to get back to the style of the first act, and at times succeeds in doing so, but unfortunately it's just not able to recapture that early magic.\n\nFrom a visual standpoint, Deadlight is simply stunning. It has a really great art style that will make you stop and admire the gloomy Pacific Northwest backdrop. The game also features some top-notch sound design. From a story standpoint, it's mostly a forgettable tale that's riddled with bad voicework.\n\nDeadlight feels like a game that really could've been something special if the devs had stuck to the formula of the first act, tightened the controls, and made the puzzles more challenging than they were. Instead it's a game that begins to fall apart after the first 90 minutes before picking itself up during the final stretch and crossing the finish line with a limp. Decent yet disappointing.","July 14, 2013","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything looks excellent and there's a good amount of depth to each location to help break up the 2D side-scroller feel. You play a character named Randall, who's been separated from his friends and family and is looking for them. The storyline is pretty throw-away. Around the 2/3 mark the game really starts to lose steam and resorts to some pretty cheap instant death traps and timed segments that rely on precision jumping skills. Unfortunately, the game's controls aren't quite as precise as they need to be to accomplish these sections without dying repeatedly due to your character being unresponsive to your inputs. More than a few times Randall will just stay attached to a wall or fence, refusing to jump, despite the jump button being pressed repeatedly. This gets really frustrating really fast. It's a pretty short game too, only taking a few hours to complete. I'd recommend picking it up if you can get it for $5 or less. Overall, I'd give it a 6/10.","February 1, 2013","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sometimes you'll tell your guy to switch weapons like FIVE TIMES IN A ROW AND AUUGHHHH I DIED AHHH.  Then as soon as you respawn he just switches weapons five times in a row.  Sometimes you'll press pause, and it takes a solid 2 minutes for the pause menu to come up.  Sometimes you'll aim your gun and pull the trigger thinking a zombie is about get splattered but it just does absolutely nothing instead.  The controls and general layout of this game are atrocious.\n\nThat being said, I still keep coming back to it.  Normally I would have long abandoned a game that felt this sloppy, but I really like it for some reason.  If you can pick this up on sale, and can put up with restarting the same checkpoint 800 times in a row because your "guy" didn't quite do what you wanted, pick it up.

The platformer elements with the background really creates a feeling where there's no fighting off zombies, only running away or finding a shelter.\n\nAnd while the game itself is fun, there are some thing that could've been improved. Too many a times you can find yourself in a situation where you need to do exactly what the level designer had in mind or you're dead. Not standing exactly where needed, a bit glitchy jumping, or action sequences where it seems you did everything right, yet you're reverted back to a checkpoint - and then it turns out doing the same thing second time actually works.\nIt's not really bad enough to annoy, but it is sufficient to break the immersion.\n\nOverall a fine, short game for one evening.","September 17, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What Deadlight lacks in 3D in has in depth of perspective. This game was truly well made and had very few flaws, but it did have two in my eyes.\n\nThe backgrounds that were full of depth, movement and detail made you feel engrossed in a dying world. Yes this game is a side scrolling game but you will barely notice as the developers make the 2D palette look truly deep. The music and sound add completeness to a world that you both fear and admire. The game overall was straight forward and not overly difficult but yet it still wasn't a cake walk. I did feel at times when you failed a certain point and it made you redo an entire segment that required precise jumps and actions; was frustrating. I felt like at the times the overall story lacked some definition and forced you to read diary pages in order to fill in the blanks; I don't want to sit and read through pages of story.  The ending will be somewhat expected and not overly shocking, but you will enjoy it on some level. Overall the gameplay which consisted of tough jumps and some shooting was enjoyable yet not groundbreaking.\n\nIf you appreciate great artwork, zombies, great gameplay and decent audio then Deadlight is the game for you.\n\n+ Amazing Artwork\n+ Enjoyable Voice Acting\n+ Fun gameplay\n- Frustrating punishments for small mistakes\n- Lacking story that forced out of game reading.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10","February 10, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the start your a little in over your head, the zombies are out in force and you have to run, run where? well to find your family obviously (seriously... every time.) But who cares the art style is beautiful, and the gameplay is fun.\n\nAxes, Guns and Delusions\nBring you axe, bring your pistol, bring your shotgun and dont forget to pick up the pieces of your journal along the way, but dont ask me how all these pages got ahead of you, I honestly dont know but its a nice feature to flesh out the story and take a break from the Linear for a little light reading.\n\nThe Characters (Spoilers, Spoilers everywhere!)\nIts hard to really describe any of the characters as you get about 5 second with them each before they suffer a horrible death. Right from the start we see ourself killing a zombie bitten friend and then were split off from the others in a hearbeat, when we finally catch up with a member of our crew he is within the last seconds of his life, and our final two members are kidnapped by the new law. From the three of us left, two die, ill give you two guesses. There is however one reclusive character we meet who is more fleshed out and actually very interesting "The Rat" and he's build himself a junkyard fortress of Death underground, thats just awesome right? it is.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.5/10\n\nWhy I gave this Rating:\nIf I was to rate this game on atmosphere alone it would get 10/10 for being one of the more beautiful/atmospheric zombie games i've played (Beautiful being an odd choice of word for a zombie game but still.) As a whole the game followed a pretty generic storyline, and a short one at that, I completed the game in a single 2-3 hour sitting; this isnt all bad however for as short as it is its memorable and doesnt burn you out from endless levels. The fact that you learn very little about the personality or anything for that matter for the vast majority of characters introduced (including the new law, our evil enemy faction) also affected my rating. Overall I enjoyed this game and if what i've wrote is "your thing" you will to.","February 12, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Picked it up on the xbox when it came out and again on steam during the sale.\nThe game presents itself so well for such a simple design of side-scrolling. There is a lot of interaction with the environment and the backgrounds offer a lot of involvement with gameplay. Zombies lie waiting, feasting on a fallen survivor and when you make your move past the group, they will come into your plane and chase you down until you can trick them into falling into a crevasse. The attention to detail is highly impressive, too. When you wade through low, muddy waters, you will see your feet kicking up piles of mud. Everything about the game has some bit of detail to it.\n\nIf you're on the fence about Deadlight, I can highly recommend the game. It is worth more than a blank check, let a lone $3 on sale.

In every level there is a lot of details. You always try to find some secrets. That makes gameplay longer. You can't forget the story with your journal,sinematics and with the secrets in the game.\nDeadlight has very nice soundtracks. The soundtracks change in every scene so you can't get bored while you are playing the game.\nTo the other zombie games,Deadlight is more storyline and parkour based. And that makes the Deadlight different from the other zombie games.\n\nBut Deadlight still has some bugs. And the artificial intelligence could be better. But anyway,they don't make the game unplayable.

After I just beat it, all I could think of was "That's it?" Lame story, terrible voice acting (more than likely the script), very infuriating level design challenges and clunky AI all wrap this up into a less than stellar title.  I'm glad I bought it on sale.  The only fun part was the middle Rat man section, where there was a little creative challenge. But after that it was stupid stray bullet deaths (literally shot in the middle of a running jump, and fell straight down into the water), and a poor ending.  The comic book bits were drawn nicely, but seemed more like an easy out for the developers to transition between stages.  If they can animate a helicopter shooting you from a rooftop, they can animate the crash too.

Not standing exactly where needed, a bit glitchy jumping, or action sequences where it seems you did everything right, yet you're reverted back to a checkpoint - and then it turns out doing the same thing second time actually works.\nIt's not really bad enough to annoy, but it is sufficient to break the immersion.\n\nOverall a fine, short game for one evening.","September 17, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I picked it up for £1:99 in sale and would say it was worth that all day long. can be frustating at times but thas what strives players to play at times. The look of the game/graphics are good as u can see in the vids and the gameplay is well done. hope this helps to anyone that wants to buy :-)","January 9, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it is rather short (approx 4 hrs), for $3.74 it was well worth it. If you like platformers, have a zombie fetish, or like the art style, you should really play this.\n\nPros-\n- Parkour + zombies\n- Generally smooth and intuitive controls\n- Detailed environments\n- Nice art style\n- The ending was somewhat unsatisfying (my personal opinion, not everyone will agree)\n\nCons-\n- If you are looking for a combat heavy game this is not it\n- Mediocre voice acting\n- Some minor bugs\n- A few frustrating segments\n- Nothing surprising. The gameplay is consistent through the entire experience.

You play as Randall Wayne, who at the start of the game is cut off from his group and has to find them, his family and get to a safe area. Graphically the game is great, the locations are beautiful, the 2.5D perspective really works to produce some stunning levels. Gameplay wise the game consists of platforming and fighting zombies or "shadows" as they're called in the game. The platforming is basic, jumping, climbing,running and avoiding traps, but it's not too easy and can be challenging at times. Fighting in this game is done realistically, your main weapon is a fire axe and you are not superman so you can't just endlessly swing it without getting tired, the less stamina you have the weaker your attacks, Randall can handle one shadow no problem but more than 2 would easily kill him, you can also use a revolver or shotgun however ammo is scarce and it attracts even more enemies. You can also collected pages from Randall's diary, IDs of strangers and items that cause memories throughout the levels.The story is alright and the ending is satisfying. After beating the game you can unlock a nightmare mode. I would recommend it if you see it on sale!","June 29, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He talks to other survivors, and then zombies kill them and he kills the zombies. There are flashback scenes, and grittily stylized 2D motion comic cutscenes. Eventually the zombies are replaced with the worst kind of men--mad men. They are even worse than the underground platforming dungeons of the rat men who literally call themselves The Rat in an epic blunder clearly lacking any degree of subtlety or self-awareness. There is no subtlety in this world. Only death. Memento mori. RIP.\n\nBut during all of this thrilling and very thoughtful storytelling, there is something... wrong. There is something off about this whole experience. Maybe you don't realize it yet, but the main character does, slowly. As the story progresses and things reach their ultimate conclusion, all is suddenly brought to light and the darkest innermost secret of the world is revealed.\n\nYou bought a bad video game.","February 11, 2015","false","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fast-paced paths work well and the player is required to work when running through the environments however there are some snag which which got me pretty frustrated.\n\nThere are several cons:\n\nAs mentioned above, the fast-paced stages are let down by snagging which become frustrating when in a chase.\nExample: running from a chopper and the player gets keeps volting the same fence instead of dismounting.\n\nA few of the controls do not make sense & feels like the Keyboard controls were shoehorned in after being designed for a gane pad.\nExample: you have to hold shift and somehow hit control at the same time to roll.\n\nThe melee weapons are vitually useless. You can not tactically kill a hord if you are using a melee - believe me, I tried.\n\nThe pick-up-item is far to slow for the pace of the game. Many occations I have stopped to pick something up and by the time I have been given control of my character again, I am dead.\n\nThe above cons are not big deals. I do think using a game pad would stop the repeated volting on fences - it would also solve my issue with the control issue. The melee part only really became aparent a few times in the game where I was forced to fight.\n\nOverall a good game.

Everything looks excellent and there's a good amount of depth to each location to help break up the 2D side-scroller feel. You play a character named Randall, who's been separated from his friends and family and is looking for them. The storyline is pretty throw-away. Around the 2/3 mark the game really starts to lose steam and resorts to some pretty cheap instant death traps and timed segments that rely on precision jumping skills. Unfortunately, the game's controls aren't quite as precise as they need to be to accomplish these sections without dying repeatedly due to your character being unresponsive to your inputs. More than a few times Randall will just stay attached to a wall or fence, refusing to jump, despite the jump button being pressed repeatedly. This gets really frustrating really fast. It's a pretty short game too, only taking a few hours to complete. I'd recommend picking it up if you can get it for $5 or less. Overall, I'd give it a 6/10.","February 1, 2013","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It´s really sad that it suffers from the same problem many console ports and muti platform games suffer: akward and unresponsive controls. Jumping on and off things, especially when it has to be quick, made me almost break my keyboard multiple time and having to press shift and w too run and then press ctrl too roll is really akward. I haven´t tried using an xbox controller but that´s no excuse for not adapting the controls to the platform.

During the playthrough you will feel the anxiety, the adrenaline and the need to hold on. You will learn that fighting with all your forces is not the only way to stay alive, in fact you will discover the power of hope. The story-line as you probably have already understood is enjoyable.\nThe downsides of this games are its longevity and some sporadic annoying physic bugs.\nThe story-line last from 4 to 5 hours, than you unlock a new (more difficult) story mode, and it can last longer if you decide to obtain all the available achievement, but it is definitely short. About the bugs, at least they don't show up while playing (except for this one time that I find myself standing on a ledge and the zombies keept crossing from one side to the other side of the ledge without beeing able to catch me), but they happen with dead-bodies collisions.

The melee options are clunky and awful which I do really like, but the shooting trivializes the challenge in the end segments where you have unlimited ammo.

Also any atmosphere that the game tries to build up as being somewhat based in reality goes out the window when the character you play as does super human feats often at times when his life is not in immediate danger.\n\nIt just feels like for every good idea they had, they paid for with two bad ones.

Good story, gameplay, graphics are decent for a sidescrolling 3D game, etc. etc.\n\nI shouldn't have to talk about it being a post-apocalyptic game, there tons of those now these days as it is, how does it compare to others? Well it doesn't particularly stand out. It's not overly outlandish but at least it's not I Am Alive, which sucked.\n\nI guess my biggest gripe with this game is, well there's two things, one being the cut scenes. I can understand an indie studio wanting to focus on gameplay and perhaps because they were short on time, they opted for motion graphics. Yet some of the cutscenes are still fully 3D so the mixture of those felt awkward and out of place. This game never came off as being comic bookish. My other issue was something menial, the fact that zombies paths are suddenly blocked when they could just as easily go around that object seeing as most of the zombies in the game come towards you from the background anyway.\n\nThose are really my only two complaints, otherwise, pretty good indie game.

Deadlight holds itself as a puzzle platformer, with Assassin’s Creed jumps and traps galore. Think Prince of Persia meets The Walking Dead, and throw in a few traps for fun. Although the game is pretty short, taking me around 5 hours to beat; it makes up for it in ingenuity and atmosphere.\n\nThe story is touching, Randall – you – is searching for his wife and daughter amidst the chaos of the end times. The real enemy beyond the zombies is a group of renegades who call themselves “The New Law”. They are a sadistic group who take delight in torturing and killing innocent survivors. Separated from his survivor group at the beginning, Randall’s journey will introduce him to The New Law but he will still meet a few new friends on the way.\n\n1980’s Seattle is really a beautiful setting (besides the dead people and destruction). The HUD is very non-intrusive with only a small health and stamina bar, leaving plenty of screen space for the visual delights. The background looks amazing: varying between dark gritty cityscapes, dark gritty warehouses, or even a dark gritty sewer. Okay, there’s not a lot of variety in setting, but it’s so pretty you won’t even care. The environment can be shiny and heavy with rain, or even have a crumbling building in the background, all-in-all the effects employed are beautiful.\n\nThe lighting can come from lonely street lamps or neon lights: giving the zombies a Christmassy glow. This isn’t the zombie game where you’re a one man killing machine; these zombies will tear you apart if you get more than two at once, so you really want to run away. The sounds of these shambling “Shadows” (as the game calls them) is quite unnerving. You never know if a dead body you pass may climb up and greet you. The music isn’t too intrusive, but makes use of classic horror “creepy ambiance” sounds: a DUN DUN at a surprise, a constant hum to build suspense in an area, or just some soft music to add a somber mood. Speaking of ambiance, the almost constant downpour in Rain City adds a serious tone to the usual jubilance of constantly fighting for survival against hordes of the undead. Our protagonist’s gravelly, serious voice guides us through this desolate world and feels comforting, always calm in the face of tragedy.\n\n\nThe gameplay and controls typically feels pretty solid, the controls being standard for keyboard controls, with the option for a USB Xbox controller. The aiming is tight and straightforward, and the platforming is what you’re used to with Assassin’s Creed or Prince of Persia. A large problem is when trying to jump vertically, sometimes Randall won’t grab the ledge unless in the exact right spot or he’ll just jump forward into a puddle of electricity or horde of zombies.\n\nWhen backed into a corner, Randall can fend off the horde with a fire axe or a few different guns discovered throughout the story. The first gun you get is a revolver, and it takes Randall into a flashback to his first time with a gun and learning to shoot, giving a tutorial without it feeling like a classroom lecture, quite refreshing. Later on, you unlock a shotgun and an assault rifle, both useful for clearing a pesky zombie horde when running isn’t an option.\n\nOverall, Deadlight is a great story driven game -- If relatively short -- and offers an interesting perspective on the zombie apocalypse, running away taking priority to fighting, and with the climbing and jumping elements. Where Deadlight really shines is the environment. The broken city and serious tones give the setting the perfect mood to combine with danger and a feeling of loss. A game as colorful as it is lighthearted, I definitely recommend spending $15 -- or less if you wait for a Steam sale -- to experience this game, whether for the compelling story or the amazing atmosphere.\n","November 29, 2013","true","17.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I don't know if it's because it was ported poorly or if it really does just have horrible mechanics, but they're there either way. There are also a LOT of glitches, audio, graphical, and wall-clipping alike. The story and voice acting were painfully bad at times. But the combat was the thing that annoyed me the most. Zombies will straight up cheat sometimes and instantly stand up after you knock them over; your character will turn around for NO REASON mid-battle and swing away in the wrong direction; zombies can move on the z axis while you can't, which looks neat, but offers them the opportunity to attack you while you can't attack them. Also, I don't think I've ever played a game where I liked the main character less.\n\nDespite the many, MANY things that annoyed me, I did enjoy parts of this game a lot. The beginning is especially good. The sewer part I didn't mind as much as everyone else seems to (though I have a thing for run-down industrial aesthetic, plus it reminded me of LIMBO). The end bit was the worst to me. The art was beautiful throughout, and the music was nice.

The atmosphere in this terrific game is intoxicating, voice acting is great, the scenery is gorgeous, and the story will keep you coming back time after time until you finish. There's a perfect mix of tense action, puzzle solving, and quiet down moments.\n\nGameplay consists of simple platforming and challenging combat. However combat is so discouraged in the game that it's almost always better to avoid the Shadows than to actually confront them, which only makes every forced encouter a hair raising experience. Unfortunately, there are some frustrating "trial and error" times where you might have to restart 5 times to get it right. This breaks the atmosphere and absorbing nature of the game, but not enough to make it an experience changer.\n\nI cannot say enough about the art direction of this game. The background is truly the star here. To just pause for a moment and look at what's behind you is sometimes breathtaking. This is a beautiful game. The music is also fantastic, which is actually best experienced by just sitting at the main menu and listening. The cut scenes are drawn comic pages with something moving in them. This is slightly offputting as the rest of the game is so gorgeous, it would seem that the cutscenes deserved more love and attention than they received. However the great voice acting makes up for most of this.\n\nThe story follows Randal Wayne as he attempts to find and save his wife and daughter while alos taking care of other survivors he's grown close to. The story is gripping and sometimes heartbreaking, with a ending that is completely out of the blue; I never saw it coming. The game somehow manages to change your entire perspective on the main character and the game itself, all in one final extremely well put together cut scene.\n\nSo should you buy it?\nThe answer to this comes with a question: are you a gamer who plays for the experience or for the simple purpose of playing a game? If you enjoy an immersing experience, then by all means this is for you. However if you only play games because of good gameplay (COD, TF2) but not because of the story or experience they present, you might find yourself bored.\n\nSynopsis:\nDeadlight is a fantastic EXPERIENCE. Gameplay may lack in a few areas, but overall Deadlight is a beautiful game that deserves all the hype it has recieved.","April 8, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Deadlight holds itself as a puzzle platformer, with Assassin’s Creed jumps and traps galore. Think Prince of Persia meets The Walking Dead, and throw in a few traps for fun. Although the game is pretty short, taking me around 5 hours to beat; it makes up for it in ingenuity and atmosphere.\n\nThe story is touching, Randall – you – is searching for his wife and daughter amidst the chaos of the end times. The real enemy beyond the zombies is a group of renegades who call themselves “The New Law”. They are a sadistic group who take delight in torturing and killing innocent survivors. Separated from his survivor group at the beginning, Randall’s journey will introduce him to The New Law but he will still meet a few new friends on the way.\n\n1980’s Seattle is really a beautiful setting (besides the dead people and destruction). The HUD is very non-intrusive with only a small health and stamina bar, leaving plenty of screen space for the visual delights. The background looks amazing: varying between dark gritty cityscapes, dark gritty warehouses, or even a dark gritty sewer. Okay, there’s not a lot of variety in setting, but it’s so pretty you won’t even care. The environment can be shiny and heavy with rain, or even have a crumbling building in the background, all-in-all the effects employed are beautiful.\n\nThe lighting can come from lonely street lamps or neon lights: giving the zombies a Christmassy glow. This isn’t the zombie game where you’re a one man killing machine; these zombies will tear you apart if you get more than two at once, so you really want to run away. The sounds of these shambling “Shadows” (as the game calls them) is quite unnerving. You never know if a dead body you pass may climb up and greet you. The music isn’t too intrusive, but makes use of classic horror “creepy ambiance” sounds: a DUN DUN at a surprise, a constant hum to build suspense in an area, or just some soft music to add a somber mood. Speaking of ambiance, the almost constant downpour in Rain City adds a serious tone to the usual jubilance of constantly fighting for survival against hordes of the undead. Our protagonist’s gravelly, serious voice guides us through this desolate world and feels comforting, always calm in the face of tragedy.\n\n\nThe gameplay and controls typically feels pretty solid, the controls being standard for keyboard controls, with the option for a USB Xbox controller. The aiming is tight and straightforward, and the platforming is what you’re used to with Assassin’s Creed or Prince of Persia. A large problem is when trying to jump vertically, sometimes Randall won’t grab the ledge unless in the exact right spot or he’ll just jump forward into a puddle of electricity or horde of zombies.\n\nWhen backed into a corner, Randall can fend off the horde with a fire axe or a few different guns discovered throughout the story. The first gun you get is a revolver, and it takes Randall into a flashback to his first time with a gun and learning to shoot, giving a tutorial without it feeling like a classroom lecture, quite refreshing. Later on, you unlock a shotgun and an assault rifle, both useful for clearing a pesky zombie horde when running isn’t an option.\n\nOverall, Deadlight is a great story driven game -- If relatively short -- and offers an interesting perspective on the zombie apocalypse, running away taking priority to fighting, and with the climbing and jumping elements. Where Deadlight really shines is the environment. The broken city and serious tones give the setting the perfect mood to combine with danger and a feeling of loss. A game as colorful as it is lighthearted, I definitely recommend spending $15 -- or less if you wait for a Steam sale -- to experience this game, whether for the compelling story or the amazing atmosphere.\n","November 29, 2013","true","17.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Being a platformer, I expected a more two dimensional approach but utilizing the Unreal Engine 3, they managed to pull off a fully 3D experience whilst retaining the old school platforming style. The lighting, animations, and effects really bring the game to life and have all been made to a very high standard.\n\nI honestly couldn’t stop playing Deadlight at some parts. The story and characters kept me interested and I was always looking forward to the next level. The game does well to keep your interest by becoming increasingly cinematic. Flashbacks, dream sequences, strong cut scenes, all do well to make you feel like you’re part of a long film with a beginning, a middle, and an end.\n\nThere was a significant problem with Deadlight though.  I fully completed the game (with the exception of nightmare mode) over a 2 day period of about 7.5 hours. Roughly 5-6 hours in campaign length, on hard difficulty. There were parts I had to do over and over again and several areas where I just stopped and looked around.  So some people might have even beaten it in even less time. The game does warrant a second playthrough, but the Nightmare mode is proving to be too difficult for me. Playing through the entire game without any checkpoints and perma-death is balls.\n\nSo Deadlight is a great game. Solid story, interesting gameplay, and very visually appealing. I only wish they made the story that little bit longer as I didn't want it to end so soon.\n","January 9, 2013","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As a husband and father of 3 (2 sons & a daughter) you'd think I'd connect with him, but absolutely not, he's whiney and a ♥♥♥♥♥. He is not a manly man despite the fact he's a Canadian Mountie who spends all his times in the wood. Again, not a manly man, a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nYou can choose to use guns but you'll be penalized. A gun shot will bring in more zombies than the original shot was worth. The shotgun is about as effective as throwing rocks at someone from a mere 10 feet away. I tried to use a strategy where I'd lure the "shadows" (aka zombies) into a spot below me, about 2 feet below my feet and it was 1 shot per zombie, no spread, didn't kill them. I own a Remington 870 12ga, I now how disgustinly powerful a shotgun blast is, I literally tried to find opportunities to use this gun and it is ♥♥♥♥ poor. In addition you can't use it on humans, they'll shoot you before your kleenex buckshot tickles their nose. I found, more often than not, I would shove or hit zombies once and then *~magically~* jump over them while they were dazed. The zombies have a "belly-high wall" that you can jump over their animation with. Yup. You can vault 6 foot high zombies if you only aim the jump for their chest.\n\nI heard the words "The safe point is no more than a trap used to hunt the survivors" around 30 times. See this youtube video: /watch?v=0bFpTmpBS80 . This game demands absolute platforming perfection in multiple instances after being fair and semi-lax the majority of the game.\n\nAnd last and definitely not least, my absolute biggest gripe is the xbox port over. Every ♥♥♥♥ing command is in xbox language, press RT (right trigger), Press "A" to continue, Repeatedly tap "B" to escape. WHAT IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING ASK ME TO DO IN ♥♥♥♥ING COMPUTER KEY LANGUAGE?

The story is written well enough to keep you pressing on til the end, but it's more of a means to an end. The game mechanics are pretty responsive, and the game itself isn't overly difficult. However, there are a few moments that'll make you grit your teeth and want to yank out your hair - mostly timing-based moments, or when you swear you hit jump, but the character just didn't do it, etc. You're looking at about 6-8 hours of gameplay, depending on how thorough you want to be.","June 20, 2014","true","7.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Can't tell whether it wants a grizzled survivalist cliche or shell shocked family man for its protagonist, so our guy is awkwardly both. Deadlight's buggy controls let down genuinely suspenseful moments, where gloriously orchestrated frustration and desperation get drowned out by the more pressing tale of man against his keyboard.\n\nThe main issue though is that the poor devs didn't realize that in games like this, less can be more- take out the cut scenes and dialogue and let the player fill in the blanks. We can be clever like that. Worked for Limbo, would've worked here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Splain/recommended/211400/","Splain","Splain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Splain/","85 products in account","Splain’s View – For the full video review with gameplay click below\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNTbisM0nuY\n\n\nIntroduction - Deadlight is a brilliantly illustrated single player game that takes place in a zombie filled, post-apocalyptic Seattle in the 1980s. However it is not your typical modern zombie game by. It is a platformer, that at first touch, feels very Odd World meets Prince of Persia. You are playing as a man who is in search for his family amidst the chaos that was Seattle. Along his journey you can find diary entries of his past that are very interesting to read. You can also find many other tidbits about the world you are in, including radio broadcast, television broadcast and notes left by once survivors. You are limited in weapons and ammo, forcing you to play smart, using the environment to your advantage in a very parkour manor. This is where the game really shines. While the environment can help you, they can also hurt (usually kill) you. The gameplay is all played out in dramatic fashion which equals the best action scenes of any movies.  You will most likely die often, but that is okay, there are many save points so you can try and try again. You can expect to beat the game in 5-6 hours. Now for the ratings.\n\n1.	Story - 8/10 The story is done very well in this game. You can flesh it out by playing through the game and finding diary entries along with other reports hidden in the game. None of them are handed to you though, so make the most of your exploring if you really want to learn more! The diary entries mostly fill you in on the character you play, which helps explain his personality and motivations.  After each (level?) there is a cut-scene drawn out in a very unique style, which fits the mood of the game. It is a great story which makes you feel your purpose in the world while also giving you an attachment to your character.\n\n2.	Difficulty – 8/10 This game is very hard. I doubt anyone has beaten it without dying a few dozen times. The good news is no game over and many save points in which you will restart from. Many areas of the game seem to be trial and error, and often I felt I had accomplished something great when I would beat something on the first try. The difficulty adds a challenge to this game which is very rewarding, not just at the end of the game, but at each save point!\n\n3.	Visuals – 9/10 This is probably the most subjective area of the game. If you are not into platformers you would probably rate this around a 6. But being a platformer the graphics and animations throughout the game are top notch! When you dive through a window or bust through a door it is a completely satisfying and entertaining to see. The zombies in the background you see will often run right up onto screen after you, which is terrifying when you see dozens in the background. And I can’t forget about the environment in general. The post-apocalyptic Seattle in makes you truly feel that it is the end of days.\n\n4.	Audio – 7/10 Some of the voice acting in the game is great, especially the lead narrator, but some of it is sub-par. Also some lines are scripted perfectly while some come in at awkward times depending on how fast you are going through the scene. The sound effects in the game  are about average.\n\n5.	Gameplay – 7/10 The gameplay is very fast paced through much of the game. The motions of your character as you control him through huge stunts make you feel like you are on a very epic scale and you usually are! However there are times when the controls feel a bit clunky and they actually got me killed more times than I would care to admit. This did not ruin the game at all though, it would probably be better played with an X-box controller as opposed to a keyboard ( I went keyboard).\n\n6.	The Final Verdict – 8/10 This is an entertaining story in a very beautiful post- apocalyptic Seattle. It is great as a platformer and makes you play with strategy. It is very easy to die, but not particularly a hard game to beat because of the consistent save points. It is very rewarding each time you reach one of these save points and typically entices you to play though to the next one to see how you make it out or if you even will. The character development is done well through inserts in the game, the narrative and the cut-scenes. The gameplay is animated beautifully but the controls sometimes get in the way. There is not too much replay value, but you can unlock a hard mode after beating the game. Overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this game if you come across it on a decent sale.\n","January 7, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm not sure if this is a compliment to the devs or not, but upon playing for a while, all I could think of is it's like someone finally re-invented Abe's Odessy, except with fantastic visuals, story line and character development, all with the same type of puzzle solving. Little additions like the guns, physics, and other small details really add to a game like this and make it stand out.\n\nAll that said, there's a few niggles here and there. If you're playing without a controller, you can run into some frustrating issues such as rolling being ctrl + shift + a/d. Rather hard to press all those at the same time. Also you can end up swapping sides on a fence/ladder by accident just by continuing to try going the same direction...\n\nThese small issues aside, the devs on this one really made a fantastic game, I would easily recommend this to anyone.","January 8, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The atmosphere in this terrific game is intoxicating, voice acting is great, the scenery is gorgeous, and the story will keep you coming back time after time until you finish. There's a perfect mix of tense action, puzzle solving, and quiet down moments.\n\nGameplay consists of simple platforming and challenging combat. However combat is so discouraged in the game that it's almost always better to avoid the Shadows than to actually confront them, which only makes every forced encouter a hair raising experience. Unfortunately, there are some frustrating "trial and error" times where you might have to restart 5 times to get it right. This breaks the atmosphere and absorbing nature of the game, but not enough to make it an experience changer.\n\nI cannot say enough about the art direction of this game. The background is truly the star here. To just pause for a moment and look at what's behind you is sometimes breathtaking. This is a beautiful game. The music is also fantastic, which is actually best experienced by just sitting at the main menu and listening. The cut scenes are drawn comic pages with something moving in them. This is slightly offputting as the rest of the game is so gorgeous, it would seem that the cutscenes deserved more love and attention than they received. However the great voice acting makes up for most of this.\n\nThe story follows Randal Wayne as he attempts to find and save his wife and daughter while alos taking care of other survivors he's grown close to. The story is gripping and sometimes heartbreaking, with a ending that is completely out of the blue; I never saw it coming. The game somehow manages to change your entire perspective on the main character and the game itself, all in one final extremely well put together cut scene.\n\nSo should you buy it?\nThe answer to this comes with a question: are you a gamer who plays for the experience or for the simple purpose of playing a game? If you enjoy an immersing experience, then by all means this is for you. However if you only play games because of good gameplay (COD, TF2) but not because of the story or experience they present, you might find yourself bored.\n\nSynopsis:\nDeadlight is a fantastic EXPERIENCE. Gameplay may lack in a few areas, but overall Deadlight is a beautiful game that deserves all the hype it has recieved.","April 8, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As a husband and father of 3 (2 sons & a daughter) you'd think I'd connect with him, but absolutely not, he's whiney and a ♥♥♥♥♥. He is not a manly man despite the fact he's a Canadian Mountie who spends all his times in the wood. Again, not a manly man, a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nYou can choose to use guns but you'll be penalized. A gun shot will bring in more zombies than the original shot was worth. The shotgun is about as effective as throwing rocks at someone from a mere 10 feet away. I tried to use a strategy where I'd lure the "shadows" (aka zombies) into a spot below me, about 2 feet below my feet and it was 1 shot per zombie, no spread, didn't kill them. I own a Remington 870 12ga, I now how disgustinly powerful a shotgun blast is, I literally tried to find opportunities to use this gun and it is ♥♥♥♥ poor. In addition you can't use it on humans, they'll shoot you before your kleenex buckshot tickles their nose. I found, more often than not, I would shove or hit zombies once and then *~magically~* jump over them while they were dazed. The zombies have a "belly-high wall" that you can jump over their animation with. Yup. You can vault 6 foot high zombies if you only aim the jump for their chest.\n\nI heard the words "The safe point is no more than a trap used to hunt the survivors" around 30 times. See this youtube video: /watch?v=0bFpTmpBS80 . This game demands absolute platforming perfection in multiple instances after being fair and semi-lax the majority of the game.\n\nAnd last and definitely not least, my absolute biggest gripe is the xbox port over. Every ♥♥♥♥ing command is in xbox language, press RT (right trigger), Press "A" to continue, Repeatedly tap "B" to escape. WHAT IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING ASK ME TO DO IN ♥♥♥♥ING COMPUTER KEY LANGUAGE? When the game says "Press any button or key to continue" what they're actually asking you to do is click your mouse. ♥♥♥♥ing try it when yoiu die, it's ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nTL;DR ♥♥♥♥ this game.","April 20, 2013","false","45.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madsexual/recommended/211400/","madsexual","Netflix and Phil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madsexual/","273 products in account","GAMEPLAY: Know this: the game's difficulty progression is based on setting up obstacles to be increasingly difficult to pass solely based on the game's clunky controls. It becomes evident 2/3 through that it is a design choice, and that the challenge is intended to come from enduring dozens of seemingly needless deaths to a chorus of "WHAT THE HELL? I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT!". There are context-sensitive abilities (such as breaking through doorways) that solve puzzles and progress scenes. Unfortunately, they are not as sensitive as one would hope. Instead, they seem to be always on. Running toward any solid wall causes the player to attempt to ram it like a door. Because it is a wall, the player bounces off for a stun animation for a brief moment. These sorts of abilities are all well and good except for a few action sequences that require perfectly executing a series of moves to get through a section without stalling out because the game thought you were trying to do something else. I'm probably not describing it well, because that sounds like exactly the kind of thing that makes a 2D platformer good! In execution, with this particular game, it comes off as confused and clunky.\n\nPLOT: The plot is similar in style and structure to low budget horror movies, which is exactly what it's going for. The protagonist isn't very sympathetic, but it would be far too generous to call him complex. He and the rest of the cast are simple caricatures of genre tropes. As a result, they don't carry much emotional weight when the plot asks them to, but it is probably wrong to assume that anyone expects the plot to be the driving force in this game. I will say that if you reach the end and felt like the task was a chore, the ending will be especially unrewarding.\n\nSTYLE: The depth of the 2.5D set pieces is actually well done and helps give life to the world you are moving through. The player character is backlit almost the entire time, making him indistinguishable from the undead enemies, called "shadows" (there is an obvious meaning behind this, but at least it's something). The game is very brown, but I suppose that is to be expected for the genre. There are a few brief moments of vibrant color that are a welcome reprieve.","December 4, 2013","false","4.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Don't ever make a game in the unreal engine that requires usage of the mouse. This goes for dungeon defenders too. The unreal engine is not made for the mouse. What you get is a hacky laggy sprite on your screen which moves as you move your mouse--except about 2 seconds behind.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? No. If I could get a refund I would.

After a couple of hours I found myself only doing it for the achievements and after a couple more I just couldn't continue and deleted it.  I was lured in by a great looking environment.  However, the story is wooden and trite.  Based only on the dialoge you'd think the audience was 7 year olds if not for the grim backdrop.\n\nGameplay starts out interesting, but is incredibly unforgiving.  You hardly kill any zombies.  The axe tires you out before you can kill more than one zombie (rarely will there only be one) and bullets are too scarce (and often have to be used to shoot a lock).  Yet the game makes you run through zombie groups repeatedly and this can't be avoided.\n\nThe environment is full of (1) things you need to jump over and (2) background that is irrelevant.  So you will stumble over a box you didn't realize needed to be jumped and be eaten.   You will come upon a hole in the fence that you can't see and need to crouch through but you try to jump and will be eaten.  So, you get to repeat segments over and over to guess your way though.  Randall is slow to boot.  Being forced along pell mell means you'll miss all the interesting side bits.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but I did not.  I cannot explain its (too high) metascore (which was one of the reasons I bought it) nor do I understand the positive reviews from players ("The Royal Nonesuch" comes to mind that purchasers don't wish to look foolish on how they spent their money).

You feel so weak when face to face with a zombie, so many times I was willing my guy to just kick the zombie and keep running, but its not that simple here.\n\nThe lighting is intense, given that this is a side scroller, the spooky atmosphere is an accomplishment. I love the feel to the game. Apart from the shabby controls, it offers a good bit of fun if you are ready to die the most clumsy of deaths many times through.  Wait for a sale on this one.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=199109775","July 20, 2013","false","8.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

This game is not worth the money. Maybe if it's on sale for a couple of bucks but that's about it.\n\nSo, where do I start... with positives I guess? Good gaphics and environmental sounds. That's about it. Now for the rest:\n\nThe plot is weak, predictable and full of holes and inconsistencies. Not to mention 90% of it is fillers that add absolutely nothing to the story. There is an idea there, but not much else. The characters are flat like an ice skating arena. The only character that is, sort of, developing is the protagonist. I say "sort of" because he only does it in the very last cut-scene. Not to mention he's as relatable as crack addict charging you with a broken bottle in his hand. The writer(s) should be somehow punished for all the cringeworthy dialogue too.\n\nThe mechanics would be solid if not for all the bugs and the controls which will make you scrach your head so hard you'll be picking pieces of your brain from beneath your finger nails. I mean, who came up with the idea for some vaulting/climbing actions to use up arrow, some to use space bar, and yet others to use left/right arrows? And then, just to confuse you, sometimes you can press two or three different buttons to perform the same action. But only in some cases. So you end up vaulting over the windows back and forth like a mad man, praying for it to stop.\n\nThe combat system? If it wasn't for the bugs... Just kidding. It's bad. Looks effective, but it's terrible. And the bugs only make it worse. So, you need to destroy the brain to kill zombies. But somehow when you swing an axe you miss the head. Every. Single. Time. And they stand firm like nothing happened. Like they're impersonating the Black Knight from Monty Python's The Holy Grail: "Tis but a scratch!". But if you manage to push (or rather shoosh) them away and they fall over (under the power of your overwhelming manliness presumably) you can then hit them in their toe as they lay there helpless and they die instantly. I can't even... aaargh...\n\nThe voiceovers and the choice of voice actors couldn't be worse, even if they cast Tommy Wiseau A.K.A. "You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"-guy as the mother-in-law who always follows the protagonist reminding him to fix the roof tiles when he comes back to Canada. The protagonist himself sounds like he did movie trailers in the 80's, the Rat sounds like a bored Harvard professor and everyone else is just borderline annoying. I can't even count how many times I tried to hit every "friendly" character with that tennis-ball-looking-thing fired from my slingshot. I even tried that thing where you close one eye and stick your tongue out just before taking a shot hoping it would help the immersion, sadly, to no great effect.\n\nPuzzles were easy and repetitive for the most part, and buggy the rest of the times. The linearity of level progression not only stares you right in the face - it b****hslaps you and shouts "NO!" every time you try to do things even a little bit differently. I think someone in the level design department had serious control issues. I especially "loved" the "secrets" that were "hidden" throughout the game. They basically laid on the ground right in front of you along the main progression path, and not only did they glow blue, but also displayed an interaction icon when you stood nearby. Much secret, such find, very hidden! Wow!\n\nWhat else... Don't bother, unless you really have nothing else to play, and are not prone to frustration and/or depression. Play  The Swapper instead - the graphics can leave you with mixed feelings, but the puzzles are difficult and satisfactory, the story is amazing and the whole thing just stands head and shoulders over this waste of good graphics engine they call Deadlight.\n\nThat is all.","February 23, 2014","false","4.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arcament/recommended/211400/","Arcament","Baby Red ☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arcament/","160 products in account","Deadlight for me is one of the best indie titles i have played. The story and the pace of this post apocalyptic zombie title are one of the best out there. There arent many zombie games that will make you understand and feel what its like to live and survive in a post apocalyptic world, where every ounce of humanity people have, has been discarded for the sole purpose of survival. Its a game that builds on those emotions, especially during the cutscenes were we can witness first hand what it means to be both a hero and a villain.\n\nThe game contains stunning  visuals as well that combined with an awesome soundtrack provide an even more immersive experience to the world and daily life of the main char. A main char whose story begins with the usual cliche of finding his family but as the game progresses it becomes so much more than that. Every arc is building up for the ultimate conclusion, which trust me is one i enjoyed to the fullest.\n\nThe gameplay for the most part plays smoothly and without many shortcomings. You must for the better part use your brain rather than your muscles. Its easier to avoid the zombies rather than to fight them, but when you have to fight the combat itself is not so difficult. There are some bugs concerning the way you move and how you face the zombies themselves but that wont be an issue after a while. The puzzles themselves arent that hard, but they have their moments especially during the end, where you have to show that you mastered everything the game has taught you in order to survive.\n\nTo sum up this was a game that i loved from the beginning to end. I recommend it to all zombie fans and indie lovers.\n\n","June 17, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You can pick up melee weapons as well as ranged for protection, but avoiding a fight is preferrable if you want to survive. You have to manage not only health, but stamina as well, and can find power-ups along the way to help you out. There are also hidden items on the different levels you can collect. By doing this you unlock players diary entries, as well as other goodies and easter eggs.\n\nI've played a lot of different 2D side scrollers over the years and this one visually looks nice, but the puzzles are overly simple and could have been more complex.

Because I missed out on the fun zombie land parkour gameplay. But then I found Dead Light.. which I guess is the after math to dying light that is no longer dying.. so its dead? Yes? No? Carrots?\n\nAnyway, The game your first playthrough will take 3-4 hours only. So I suggest you get it on a good sale. Once you learn the levels puzzles it will take you maybe 1 1/2 to 2 hours only. But it is still really fun to dash through. Even if you think you can't die, 1 miss step can pretty much end you.\n\nThe controls can be a bit.. wonky once in a while, I use a xbox controller so worst I get is my guy will jump forward when I wanted to go up instead.\n\nThe story is interesting and easy to follow.\n\nMy real complaints for the game in itself, is that only 2 cutscenes seem to have sound, the rest go silent(luckily the subtitles are enabled by default.) and the framerate will suddenly drop randomly at certain spots. Despite having no rain or enemies around at the moment.\n\nI also wish fighting zombies would be a bit easier, if you make the wrong step or fail to stay above them, you could get cornered and kill quickly.. They also give a tackle ability that only gets you hurt and grabbed. So not sure why it is even in the game.\n\nI have beat it 4 times now, but I have yet to complete it 100%. Once you beat the story, you unlock a new mode. Nightmare mode, in this mode if you die once back to the start. There may be some checkpoints SOMEWHERE but I haven't seen any yet.\n\nForcing you to replay over and over till you pretty much master every section perfectly.\n\nSo to recap. Wonderful game, amazing gameplay, and despite being so short, tons of replays can be done without being bored.\nFind a good sale, and give it a try.\n\nIssues:\nPoor sound quality on cutscenes.\nFramerate drop.\nControls can feel a bit off sometimes.\nCombat is too against you, many mistakes aren't forgiven.","December 3, 2015","true","12.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Costinux/recommended/211400/","Costinux","Crusty Nuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Costinux/","1007 products in account","Product received for free\n\nWhat's black and white, mixed with gothic environment and zombies all over it? That's right! It's Deadlight.\nDeadlight is an action adventure platformer developed by Tequila Works, S.L. and published by Microsoft Studios in 2012. The game follows the journey of Randall Wayne, a man searching for his family that has drastically disappeared when the zombie apocalypse came out. The world of the game takes place around the year 1980 in the beautiful surroundings of the Seattle city. Because of an complication, Randall gets separated rather at the beggining of the game from the group of survivors that he was traveling with and spends most of the time trying to reunite with them and find a safe place in which to shelter from the horrors that will eventually find you through the course of the game.\nWhen you actually start the game, you will know very little about what has been happening and the game throws you directly into the action but with time you’ll manage to find various journal entries that will slowly begin to shed some light on the horrifying events that have taken place since the end of the world started.\nI have to warn you here. This is not your typical zombie game! Zombies are overpowered just as they should actually be in reality. You can only kill a few of them on the whole duration of the game so you should keep that in mind before buying the game because you will not find the Rambo style of killing zombies in Deadlight. The game encourages you to find ways of sneaking around them while continuing the journey of finding where your family is.\n\nThe game is based on the action-platformer genre at heart, but the driving story and the deeply environmental graphics makes it feel much like one of those adventures of Tomb Raider. Cinematics consists of motion comics with voice overs, which are more enjoyable than you think they would be. Randall will guide you through flashbacks of his past occasionally, making you understand the story better, and there are diary entries lying out there for you to find that will add more plot to the story, as well as some extra curiosities introduced by the ID of some strangers and newspaper clippings. Through the course of the game you will also find first aid kits lying around which will help you in the most appalling moments. And let’s not forget about the extra bullets that will save your life a few times. There are also a few "handhelds" to be found between the chapters, which will unlock some nice games to play within the extras menu.\n\nThe controls for jumping can be a bit suffocating at times, but the auto-save function will ensure that you don't have to repeat much of the section if you’re used to the feeling of dying a lot while playing a game.\nThe game also introduces you to a lot of diversity, as some areas are puzzle-heavy, whilst others are action-heavy, depending on where you are in the story. And I have great news for the achievements hunters! You can always go back to the main menu and choose 'Select Scene' if you think you've missed something. There are three chapters to choose from, and each chapter has specific scenes you can go back to with complete information on how many secrets you’ve found. Finishing the game also unlocks a new difficulty, Nightmare Mode, which is the same as the standard play, except that you will have only one chance of doing everything right, because the game will only save between each chapter.\n\nPros- Support for Achievements, Trading Cards and Steam Cloud.\n- Cinematics can be skipped (a relief for the achievements hunters or even for the people that want to just replay the game).\n- Keyboard and mouse controlls can be re-mapped.\n- An impressive work has been done on the soundtrack. I can still remember every beat of the main melody, that's exactly how nice it was composed. I highly recommend you picking up the DLC if you have the extra cash on you.\n- The settings menu includes options like: turn on/off for things like Object Highlights, Hints, Vibration, Vsync and Subtitles; sliders for Music, Sound Effects, Dialogue, Gamma and Graphics Quality; and you can also change the resolution and choose between making it fullscreen or not.\n- The game can be alt-tabbed for multitasking very easily and the music of the game doesn't hear when you're out of the game.\n- Cutscenes play out like motion comics, an wonderful opportunity for the comic lovers.\n- The voice acting is so good that you will start caring about what happens to the main character next.\n- Hidden collectibles, secrets and time based leaderboards are probably enough to convince you to replay Deadlight after you've already finished it.\n- The developers will introduce you to a new feature they've invented. 2.5D graphics with zombies in it! I have to tell you, this really surprised me while I was playing.\n\nCons- Controllers can't be re-mapped.\n- Leaderboards page doesn't work, saying that you need internet connection when you access it. The solution to this problem has been found, but it's a bit tricky and unpleasant. To see the leaderboards page, you have to block almost everyone from your friend list, till you get less than 100 friends. And that's it, it will most likely work now.\n- Jumping is a bit weird, but that's understandable because this is a port from the Xbox 360 one.\n- The game is only 4-5 hours long.\n\nConclusionDeadlight is one of those games that made me feel in love with it from the very first time I've heard of it's launch on Steam. This may be my favorite indie game from the year 2012 and while the game may be a bit short (5 hours length), it does exactly what the developers dreamt to accomplish. To terrorise the gamers around the globe with the music, atmosphere and story it has, to put the fear into them so hard that they will remember this game for the rest of their lifespan. You get a realistic story-driven horror game that is centered in a apocalyptic zombie world. My advice is that if you're an addicted apocalyptic person as me, you should totally buy this game without thinking, it has the potential to thrill you, to captivate you and to make you cry, all those in a very short period. In just 4 hours you are thrown in a train of feels. You don't need to care about the bad reviews the game received, the game may have a different impact on every person, from my perpective the story was very good written and the actors have done a really good job in making you have a close connection to the surroundings the game puts you into. I couldn't stop playing till I didn't find myself at the end of the game. From my perspective, this game is an hidden gem.\nDeadlight gets a 5 out of 5 from me.\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Tequila Works, S.L. for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

Stupid trial-and-error scripted death puzzles / action sequences, inconsistent behavior on behalf of enemies and on the readability of environments (and whether or not they are traversable or dangerous). The story is nothing special for the zombie genre.

The levels and puzzles are interesting but nothing that is going to stump you for very long.  In the later levels when there are swarms of bad guys, you'll go through tedious trial and error to memorize when things are going to come out at you and when you need to shoot at just the right time.\n\nThe graphics are well done.  During the cutscenes, everything is presented as a graphic novel.  The voice acting is pretty weak for the most part.  And the main story is pretty cliche while the nightmare/flashbacks are not used enough during the game.

Hit rates are not done well and is soo easy to die and get sent back to an earlier check point if you find yourself fighting 3+ zombies.\n\nAlso, it was so easy to accidently do a jump you was not planning on doing.. i.e. trying to jump upwards (where most would detect this is what you are doing) it would instead make you jump accross into what ever area (often ending in death..)\n\nHowever, with this in mind, it is worth a play.

While the suspenseful setting and uniquely dramatic score make for an interesting ride, sloppy parkour mechanics and an uninspired gameplay core will leave you bored within a couple hours. Amusing at first, the platforming and traps quickly become severe annoyances. While these parkour aspects are a decent take on an already sound system, it is not uncommon to find yourself dying repeatedly at the same point from missing a jump by mere pixels, solely because your leap was off by an attosecond or two. On top of that, the "puzzle" aspect of the game is really nothing more than a speed bump to prevent you from shooting through the remarkably short game in under an hour. For each of these traps, you are virtually guaranteed to die the first attempt, and again nearly guaranteed to beat it on the second attempt. This is due to the puzzles not being puzzling in any sense, but more 'unforeseeable deathtraps' that are completely ineffective once you know of their location and MO.\n\nTLDR: If you can stand constantly revisiting the 3 minute gameover loading screen, and are not easily discouraged by excessive and unimaginative 'puzzles' that can be solved only by repetition (rather than wit and skill), then the atmosphere and  combat of this game will be an enjoyable experience.","August 31, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure, it is atmosperic, has a good story, nice characters, interesting blend of jump-and-run and horror survival and builds a dark world, that feels very genuine. Until the Platformer-Part kicks in. At some Point the game just stops feeling realistic and starts to subject it's level design to "We want to have more platformer-elements". Plus it had a suprisingly high frustration factor, and even the best voice acting sounds stupid when you hear it for the tenth time because you keep dying for reasons beyond your comprehension.\n2) Deadlight is very short. I finished it in under 4 hours, and while I probably missed a lot of the collectable stuff, I did so on purpose. I generally dislike using collectables as a means to prolong the game. If the story takes four hours, that's how long the game is.\n\nSo if you do like platformers even if they get proposterous in terms of level design, and happen to get this game for a low prize, or in some bundle: Go for it!

This game is such a broken, glitchy mess, I'm absolutely certain no one playtested it. I encountered so many bugs during my time with it, I thought I had wound up in the Amazon Rainforest. Turns out I was just playing an awful game. One time, I respawned and my character just spun in circles repeatedly until a guard shot him to death. Another time, I swung my axe and it got stuck in the middle of the air, and my character crumpled into a depressing little ball that probably never got any love from his parents or any other human being in his sad, pathetic life, and blood shot out of his back, and then I died. Oh, but my favorite part is the length of time it takes for you to press a button. They may as well have given you elevator music to listen to at that point, because it feels as if you're riding a hotel elevator that never finds its destination. Just like how this game never finds its destination. Maybe the entire game is just an allegory for life and how we human beings are just miniscule pieces of star dust in the grand scheme of things, whose lives ultimately don't mean anything. But I don't think five-year-olds have the capacity to construct something so compelling. Lord only knows why I actually finished this game. There is a section at the very end that has you running from guards while your character lolls around like a reetarded puppet, and I swear to you if you make it through that without having an aneurysm, I will give you $100. My favorite part is how every achievement is named after a popular song from previous generations. If it were 2007, I'd be dying from laughter.

I can't guarantee that you'll enjoy it even if you are a platformer fan and like the Zombie Theme.\n\nLet's start with the good things, the developers did a good job in making a zombie-apocalypse atmosphere, and especially in the beginning you feel like a lone survivor, just barely escaping the horde, with your Ezio-Like Climb skills.\nYou have very low health and run fast out of stamina (used for climbing and mainly fighting), making combat challenging and because if you mess up the horde will get you and just makes sense in these kind of games.\nA big point about positives is the graphics, the game looks nice and the 2.5 D style makes this game feel more alive, defintly adds up to the atmosphere and seems to be what took most of the budged than developing this game sadly.\nThis difficulty builds up through the game to the point where at some points you have to time every single action near perfect to progress, which felt very frustrating and unnecessary, but this kind of difficulty is a lot of platformers, so it's really up to you whether that's a good or bad thing.\nWhile the story and the voice lines are very generic as is the main character in the beginning, there is actually some good character development in the game and the ending was supinely satisfying, but didn't excuse the rest of the game.\n\nIt didn't excuse the frustrating dying over and over again scenarios, where I had no clue what to do or because of the inconsistent length of between the checkpoints, not to mention that the game doesn't always load the latest checkpoint you left. Also controls are unresponsive, as in I have to hammer a button, and the game wouldn't respond to first one or two button presses, mouse senility is off the charts and not in-game changeable. Not to mention the game can crash a few times, but due to the checkpoints, it is for most people irrelevant.\nOn certain level I want to comment on is the rat’s labyrinth, it's a fairly long level, without the great atmosphere and with generic platforming the rest of the game has and completely unreliable to the rest of the game, in case you come past this level don't be discouraged if you enjoyed the zombie-apocalypse atmosphere, it will come back\n\nSo do I recommend this? Well I do because this game is enjoyable, but there are a lot of problems this game has and if you aren't willing to except these problems and want to some zombie-apocalypse atmosphere, than don't get it.","April 10, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It could be considered as a Shadow Complex with zombies but more forgiving on death, more easier to play and more brain power required (you can't shoot your way through every situation.) Aside from platforming there are push / switch puzzles as well as a few ways to get pass the zombies such as whistling them to their demise or bringing them together to jump over them as well as collectables and secrets to be found.

While the backgrounds aren't as amazing as in Trine 1&2 they are masterfully lit and really look great all the time. Those with an artistic interest would probably enjoy it a lot because of the environments.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Another World and Prince of Persia, two very old games. This isnt a problem and works quite well most of the time, the biggest gripe I have is that sometimes jumping works fine to get past, other times you get stuck and die, melee doesnt connect, they manage to grab you in the middle of a swing or sometimes they just dont wanna fall down, its somewhat inconsistent and feels unfair rather than challenging.\n\nThis is the same through the whole game, some jumps are somewhat hard to see, some things are trial and error until you get it right. Most of the checkpoints are close so you wont have to replay much when you die, but the last section of the game is long and if you make a mistake you die and have to replay it all. Its not hard, but trial and error until you memorize that ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe story could be better, the biggest flaw is in the writing and it suffers somewhat of the "your father the king" syndrome. It could be so much better with some work, but I didnt really get any emotional attachment to anyone in the world. The ending really didnt make any sense, him holding a speech about something and then not doing the very same thing he talked about, sure, closure and all, but damn, don't be a hypocrite.\n\nTechnically the game didnt crash any, but a couple times the physics engine bugged out and either instakilled me or didn't kill me. The biggest bug is when the main menu doesnt load and the game just sits there for 1-3minutes until it finally comes up. At least the checkpoint loading is instant.\n\nGood looking game, but frustrating, bad writing and a bit unfair/trial-and-errory at times.","November 25, 2012","false","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The platforming is incompetent, the combat is a buggy disaster, and the story is a transparent, mewling mess.\n\nThe premise is your standard biteception fare: zombies take over, survivors come down with a case of interminable douchiness, world goes to hell. You play a fellow named Randall Wayne, some random sod searching for his family months after the end of civilization. The story rarely meets anything resembling coherence, constantly pushing the boundaries of plausibility. Gentle helicopter crashes? Check. Man outrunning a hail of bullets? Check. Insane scientist calling the zombie plague the heaven we've all been awaiting? Check. You'll have predicted the outcome of the story before you finish the first area of the game, but the game doesn't miss an opportunity to hammer you with every trope it can find before you finally reach the punchline. It doesn't even have a consistent presentation: the story is told largely through comic-book-noir cutscenes, which clash amusingly with the gameplay's generic realistic-3D look.\n\nOn the gameplay side, Deadlight is basically a 2D platformer with 3D backgrounds used to the worst possible effect. You'll often be left wondering whether items are in the foreground or background -- sometimes you'll jump at something which isn't there, and other times you'll bounce off an object you thought was out of reach. The platforming itself fails to offer challenge in any sense beyond the omnipresent bugs. You will rarely have more than 1 route, there are basically no puzzles to solve, and the game never pressures you to make tough maneuvers. You'll fall to your death repeatedly, however, because the game sometimes just forgets to grab ledges or just won't turn around without running halfway across the screen. The controls are generally unresponsive and unwieldy. The game actively prevents meeting that platforming zen by pulling you to a complete stop any time you do anything. Catch a climbing line midair? You'll be watching a 3-second animation while Randall grabs onto it, then come to a complete stop and slowly crawl from one side of the line to the other. Sometimes, Randall will teleport about because the game can't even decide where you are. He will hang from invisible ledges or be unable to jump. If you fall the wrong place, you can get completely stuck and have to restart the scene entirely.\n\nCombat, however, is a whole 'nother level. Zombies attack from the background, so you never know when you can hit them and when you can't. Sometimes, they'll even fall back from the foreground into the background, and you're left swinging at nothing until it re-emerges on top of Randall and immediately grapples. The meeting of Randall and zombie is never remotely clean, often leaving Randall struggling with air and a zombie flailing wildly behind him. Using anything but the heavy axe attack is pointless because Randall will otherwise teleport through enemies, failing to hit them, or push enemies from the ground back onto their feet. The most joy you'll get out of it is laughing at the utter absurdity of it.\n\nTo summarize, Deadlight is not worth the time to play, let alone the cash. The combat is poor, the platforming is poor, the story is poor, the presentation is dodgy, and it's just not fun.","December 26, 2013","false","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I really like the realistic environments and the slowly expanding range of skills you will need to learn and master in order to survive. It begins with simple jumping and crawling, but towards the end, you will be doing many different things at higher speeds.\n\nThe ever present "shadows" (zombies) are reasonably tough - you can easily outsmart them if they are alone, but in greater packs, they present a serious danger.\n\nEnvironments are top notch - from city streets through sewers, from roof-tops to apartments, it keeps changing and it never becomes repetitive. The platforming puzzles have the right amount of vagueness to them - you will occasionally get stuck, but it should never become frustrating.\n\nOverall, this is a really great game which I will certianly replay.\n\nOne playthrough is somewhere between 3-5 hours, with 1-2x replay potential.","June 21, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, there is a lot of frustration included with this sometimes entertaining game. This is one of the best looking 2.5d game I've seen. It's up there with Trine 2 and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. It looks very realistic. The backgrounds are lively and there's always lots of stuff going on.  The voice actor for the grizzled main character did a good job. This game's best feature is its style. That's about all it has going for it, though. The actual gameplay is thin. Standard platforming. Jump here, climb that. Run. Duck. Wail away on a zombie. It can be entertaining, but nothing that hasn't been done before. The controls are decent for most of the scenarios encountered in the game, but at times when quick precision is necessary, the  game falls flat on its face. At times the pace of the game grinds down to a screeching halt as parts need to be played over and over and over again due to the controls not responding properly. There's also other times where you have a split second to react to things or else death. Sometimes there's no way to know what exactly is being asked until dying and restarting the section again.  The very ending of the game nicely encapsulates all the shortcomings I've just listed. I see promise from the developers, but this game just does too many things poorly to recommend.","February 3, 2013","false","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You have to jump exactly where and when everyone else jumps, move the same boxes everyone else moves, and shoot the same zombies everyone else shoots.  The biggest insult of it all is the so called "nightmare mode" you can play once you beat the game once through.  It's not called "nightmare mode" because there's more zombies or you have less health or fewer bullets, it's called "nightmare mode" because you have to play through the EXACT SAME GAME all over again just for a different and still crappy ending.

I can't guarantee that you'll enjoy it even if you are a platformer fan and like the Zombie Theme.\n\nLet's start with the good things, the developers did a good job in making a zombie-apocalypse atmosphere, and especially in the beginning you feel like a lone survivor, just barely escaping the horde, with your Ezio-Like Climb skills.\nYou have very low health and run fast out of stamina (used for climbing and mainly fighting), making combat challenging and because if you mess up the horde will get you and just makes sense in these kind of games.\nA big point about positives is the graphics, the game looks nice and the 2.5 D style makes this game feel more alive, defintly adds up to the atmosphere and seems to be what took most of the budged than developing this game sadly.\nThis difficulty builds up through the game to the point where at some points you have to time every single action near perfect to progress, which felt very frustrating and unnecessary, but this kind of difficulty is a lot of platformers, so it's really up to you whether that's a good or bad thing.\nWhile the story and the voice lines are very generic as is the main character in the beginning, there is actually some good character development in the game and the ending was supinely satisfying, but didn't excuse the rest of the game.\n\nIt didn't excuse the frustrating dying over and over again scenarios, where I had no clue what to do or because of the inconsistent length of between the checkpoints, not to mention that the game doesn't always load the latest checkpoint you left. Also controls are unresponsive, as in I have to hammer a button, and the game wouldn't respond to first one or two button presses, mouse senility is off the charts and not in-game changeable. Not to mention the game can crash a few times, but due to the checkpoints, it is for most people irrelevant.\nOn certain level I want to comment on is the rat’s labyrinth, it's a fairly long level, without the great atmosphere and with generic platforming the rest of the game has and completely unreliable to the rest of the game, in case you come past this level don't be discouraged if you enjoyed the zombie-apocalypse atmosphere, it will come back\n\nSo do I recommend this? Well I do because this game is enjoyable, but there are a lot of problems this game has and if you aren't willing to except these problems and want to some zombie-apocalypse atmosphere, than don't get it.","April 10, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Players should not come into this game expecting something akin to Resident Evil, Silent Hill, or Eternal Darkness. Rather the game is a great send up of old trial, and error adventure platformers from the early 1990's. Games like Another World, Flashback, and Prince Of Persia. It recreates that style of gameplay very well, combining it with Unreal Engine 3 aesthetics for a really goregeous indie adventure game. It's a really good game, but it is hampered by somewhat by a derivative story, and some other minor nitpicks. The biggest problem some will have with this game is the short length. Someone who is really good at videogames can clear it in around 3 hours.\nBut that's not to say you shouldn't buy it. If you loved those 16-bit games I mentioned or the earliest Oddworld titles, I think you'll have a really fun time with it. However, if you really prefer the jump scares of early Resident Evil games your mileage may vary.\n","January 13, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

The above strengths make up for the shortcomings well enough. It's just that when you have a game with a setup this relatively simple, you'd expect it to surprise you in at least a few ways. Portal did this with a pitch-black sense of humor that blended seamlessly with a frighteningly sterile, claustrophobic atmosphere. Unfortunately, while the atmosphere is certainly there, there are a few things that really hamper the experience its trying to create.\n\nThe Abe's Odysee style sidescrolling makes for some great visuals, as the interplay of the background and foreground does a lot to enhance the otherwise banal sight of zombies wandering around the broken urban landscape. Sadly this leads to a bit of frustration when you can't tell if a zombie is within axing range or just outside, and you'll burn up your  stamina or bullets really fast swinging or shooting frantically at the so-called "Shadow" only to find that he'll still get ahold of you. Furthermore, there is some highlighting of climbable surfaces, but its not terribly consistent, so often of times you'll die in the same space over and over only to find there was a wire or pipe you could have latched onto. It gets even worse when the game reflex-tests you by sliding down a hill or chasing you through the busy streets, all the while tripping over piles of cardboard boxes you had no idea were in your way to begin with and wondering why you couldn't just take the staircase instead of hopping from handrail to handrail like an Assassin's Creed character. A few times I walked by a zombie trapped in a car and was a little disapointed that he couldnt reach me from where he was, a missed opportunity for a trap mechanic for all those times you're in a hurry to take cover. Use of the sort-of 2D is excellent visually, but from a game mechanic standpoint I wish it had been developed more.\n\nMelee combat is appropriately messy and hectic, though sometimes a bit too much as occasionally you'll whiff completely on a finishing blow you know should have connected. The stamina bar that depletes with everything from climbing and swinging to running and simply holding onto a ledge also gives you good cause to mind your limits, as running out makes your swings pitifully ineffective and slow. Ammo however should not have been so plentiful at times, and headshots get far too easy when you realize all the zombies are roughly the same height and typically come at you from the same angle, though some will duck a bit lower to charge. It gets the most intense when you start to see zombies pour in from the background and you know it just isnt worth the risk to clear all of them, forcing you to find a way to get out of reach double-quick. I especially like how hard they are to get past when they group up, and how fast you die if you just try to shove past them, which has the nice effect of making you pay attention to all the angles so you can avoid or go around them. The puzzles are bit basic and usually involved shooting a target to clear the way, moving a block to climb up, or in a few circumstances--I wish there were more-- baiting a zombie into a trap. They work fine as a way of breaking up the game's more frantic moments, but they could stand to be a bit more challenging.\n\nI won't go too far into the soundtrack, except to say that it sets the tone wonderfully. The sound as a whole in this game presents itself adequately: the zombies sound like zombies, the guns sound like guns.\n\nAnd then Randall opens his mouth.\n\nThis game's writing has what I like to call "Hideo Kojima syndrome": the story isn't exactly bad, but the writing is horrendous to the point where the voice acting is hard to judge because you can't tell if they're phoning it in or speaking at the grade level they assume the audience to be. Every line from Randall or any of the characters sounds like something you'd hear in a middle school creative writing class: obvious, redundant, and surprising only in its capacity to convey only the vaguest impression of an emotion.  And while this game's story goes through the motions of practically every zombie-themed game or movie--main character looking for his family which may or may not be dead, predatory military scavengers leeching off of survivors, one lone supporting character survivor at the end, etc--it could have easily been redeemed with some  greatly improved writing to go with the honestly pretty damn good atmosphere this game already has. The concept-art cutscenes range from boring to unintentionally hilarious, especially at the end when the main character has a terrifying revelation that (insert the most obvious twist ever here) and his eyes go so wide I wanted to take a screenshot and use it as my steam icon, preferably with humorous text at the bottom.\n\n"YER DEAD!"\n--stereotypical southern military dude, who was at least nice enough to let me turn around, draw, and kill him in spite of having me in his sights the whole time.\n\nWait a second, this game takes place in Canada! What are stereotypical southern military dudes doing in...nevermind.\n\nSo why am I recomending this game? Because I'm a sucker for it's spiritual predecessor, Abe's Odysee. BecauseI love the visuals that the 2D plane grants and the jumping, running, and climbing feel really good. Because I don't always feel in control of the combat.

As a platform game it is very rich in detail and deep in story. I would compare it to the likes of Trine but of course with a more realistic feel.\n\nAlthough the puzzles in the game are not that difficult, it keeps you entertained by occasionally requiring the use of one of your abilities, like shouting to get attention from zombies, to get past particular parts. Some parts are fast paced where you don't stop to kill zombies whereas others are take it slow and search to find the secrets of each stage. Which are sometimes interestingly hidden. This brings back memories of the old platform games from the 90s.\n\nThe controls are simple and not overly complex which gets you into the game very fast. You really only need your movement and action keys of swinging an axe or interacting with an object. Though of course you can shoot the different guns and slingshots that you get and as previously mentioned get the attention of people through the shout key. The stamina bar is a nice addition and adds to the realism of the game that swinging an axe at zombies does make you tired! So you have to be careful not to overdo it and back off as required.\n\nI played this with keyboard and mouse but you can play with the controller also, and I think it would make an excellant relax on the sofa game.\n\nA highly recommended game from me all around.","January 1, 2014","true","15.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Zombies have no problem at all with hitting you while you're at least a half meter out of their range or taking a swing at you when you're prone on the floor, said swing being performed at shoulder height and somehow manages to hit a target a whole meter below that.\nGetting grabbed by a zombie is almost always a death sentence if there are other zombies nearby as it is impossible to push multiple zombies away, they'll pass through others as if they were ghosts, giving you no option of crowd control or getting out of a bad situation, this also didn't make the areas with infinitely spawning zombies any easier. If the whole point of the game was meant to evade the zombies at all cost, why even bother giving the broken option of trying to fight them off in melee?\n\nThe controls sometimes decide to do whatever they feel like, swinging back and forth over a fence instead of dropping down and sometimes climbing back up a ledge I'm trying to climb down.\n\nCertain areas of the game were very annoying as it required you to do things in a very fluid and nigh-perfectly executed and predetermined manner. One area in particular had a warehouse that would collapse bit by bit, I was stuck on this area for far too long because the game did not like me trying to be too fast by performing a running jump over a pit and continuing to run, doing this would result in the final piece of debris killing me a mere centimeter away from the next segment. Instead the game forced you to make a normal jump over the pit and then sprint in order to clear this area. Stupid.\n\nThe main character is supposedly a park warden, who can't swim, not only can he not swim but he also sinks like a rock straight to the bottom where he will drown standing almost immediately. This did not help with my immersion into the game at all as it was a poor excuse to have some water based obstacles in the game.\n\nI'm not surprised none of my friends bothered playing this game to the end, all of them appear to have stopped playing at the exact same spot as well, I wonder why.","September 13, 2014","false","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It has a good aesthetic, and the backgrounds and environments make this 2.5D sidescroller pretty to look at. This is where my praise ends.\n\nDespite how polished and professional the game LOOKS, nearly everything else is crap. The gameplay is a rather tired form of puzzle platformer that's been done time and time again by games like Limbo and the original Prince of Persia. However, the "Puzzles" are mediocre, usually involving activating whatever highlighted item happens to be in the room with you. Similarly, the "Platformer" is just frustrating, due to sloppy controls, and frankly bad design. "Trial and error" gameplay is particularly heavy In the later levels, often times with the character dying for no particular reason.\n\nThen there's the "story." The plot is yet another cookie-cutter zombie-apocalypse story, a genre which is so played out by now that I almost expected this game to be a parody. Deadlight adds nothing new to the genre whatsoever. It's full of a million tired tropes, the voiceacting is subpar, the script is bad, and it's not even fun to play.","April 26, 2015","false","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a puzzle platformer/ zombie game. I never imagined that a zombie setting would fit well with a platformer, you would think that the platforming would take away from the creepy zombie vibe, but it actually comes across quite nicely. The aesthetics are wonderfull with crumbling hotels, underground sewers, and a plague filled hospital. The weakest part of the game for me would be the story but even that  ended well, and if you actually read Randall's diary you may apreciate it much more. The gameplay is solid and fun while being very linear. The biggest complaint I've been hearing about this game is the clunky control's and I would have to agree somewhat. The controls are clunky but I feel that it suits its purpose. So in the end DeadLight is  fun platformer that has a great aesthetic, pretty good story, and ok gameplay, I would recommend to fans of the puzzle/platformer and zombie genre.","September 2, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The storyline is good, but in order to fully understand it you have to read a 60 page diary of this guys life. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that the gameplay is tedious as ♥♥♥♥. It's freerunning parkour, but you have to be exactly in the right area, and for many parts of the game, at exactly the right time. And in order to do this, you have to die multiple times just to get passed one scene. If there's a helicopter chasing you, you die if you lose a second of running. Also, I have my settings for this game on the lowest possible, and yet I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ framerate at certain areas, and it will freeze up randomly, which also sucks during chase scenes where one second will kill you. Why does a game with crappy drawn out graphics require so much RAM just to run? You're better off watching someone play this on YouTube, or better yet reading about it on wikipedia. This game would be much better as a novel, and is no where near worth the money.","June 28, 2015","false","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just point one way and press the button you want and Randall will just do it in the opposite direction you wanted him to.\n- The last half of the game in general was chalk full of frustrating little things overall (and that's pretty much everything I mentioned above).\n\nThat about sums it up.

There are a couple minor control issues, mostly centered around climbing quickly while being chased by helicopters, lol, but outside of that, the game controls are fairly seamless. The game itself is fun as hell. It's a 2-D scroller with a 3-D background which looks really cool in a sort of Apocalyptic Noire fashion. The gameplay itself is fun. You get weapons sparingly and always need to make decision regarding how you are going to deal with the zombies (or Shadows as they are called in this game). You have a stamina bar which is drained when running or engaging in melee combat. You have a very limited amount of bullets for any guns you find. You are however quite acrobatic, and running, jumping, diving, and rolling are equally important from a tactical standpoint. There are also som cool trap sequences, and in many parts, you can use the environment to your advantage as well.\nFinally, the story is also really quite interesting, and unlike most games, the "secrets" (aka hidden objects) are very easy to find, although with the undead on your tail, you may not have time to grab them, lol\n\nI think this is a definite must own.

Te elaborate on the controls; this game basically expects you to have very precise movements in order to jump and land on obstacles and to dodge traps and run from zombies. However, the movement is very clunky, and every action you perform seems to have such a delay that finding the correct timing is more or less a combination of luck and tedious trial and error. Your character can either jump 6 inches straight up, or 10 feet diagonally, with no inbetween. Trying to jump and grab a platform straight above your head is a nightmare because either you're off by an inch and will miss and have to retry until you get lucky and find a sweet spot, or you will accidentally jump at an angle you go 10 feet too far and fall to your death. As for the story it has all the typical zombie cliches that we've all seen before.

They've never really scared me and they're a dime a dozen these days. So when I picked this up during a Humble Bundle sale for really cheap, I wasn't expecting much. However, this game surpassed my expectations and turned out to be one of the best indie games included in the bundle.\n\nStory:The game takes place in Seattle in 1986 after the outbreak of a virus that has resurrected the dead and turned them into zombies. You assume the role of Randall Wayne, a park ranger and survivor of the virus who is on his way to the last remaining safe point in hopes of finding his wife and daughter.\n\nGameplay:Deadlight combines elements of a platforming, puzzle solving and horror. You're always encouraged to run away from the zombies you encounter unless you have no other option. You're only armed with an axe, but as you progress through the game you'll come across a handgun and a shotgun. Ammunition is limited though, so you should only use when it's necessary. The meat of this game is the platforming. It makes good use of parkour, which is the best part about this game in my opinion. The game is very linear, but very fun to play. Included are several things to collect, which makes the experience more fulfilling as it offers something in addition to just playing through each level and progressing through the story. There's also an additional mode called "Nightmare Mode", which is basically the same as the main story except you're not allowed to die. If you die in Nightmare Mode, then you must restart from the very beginning.\n\nNegatives:The only negative for this game is it's length. It took me less than 7 hours to complete 100%. That's not always a bad thing. Not every game has to be 20 hours or 40 hours long. I just think $15 is a bit much to ask for a game that's so short. Sure, you could play Nightmare Mode. I'm sure that would add lots of time, but it's just more of the same on a much harder difficulty and doesn't really add anything new.\n\nConclusion:Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone that's a fan of platformers or zombie games. I'm not even a fan of zombies, but I still really enjoyed this game. The story is good and the gameplay is great. It's well worth buying, but because of it's short length, I'd suggest waiting for it to go on sale.","August 29, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I can't guarantee that you'll enjoy it even if you are a platformer fan and like the Zombie Theme.\n\nLet's start with the good things, the developers did a good job in making a zombie-apocalypse atmosphere, and especially in the beginning you feel like a lone survivor, just barely escaping the horde, with your Ezio-Like Climb skills.\nYou have very low health and run fast out of stamina (used for climbing and mainly fighting), making combat challenging and because if you mess up the horde will get you and just makes sense in these kind of games.\nA big point about positives is the graphics, the game looks nice and the 2.5 D style makes this game feel more alive, defintly adds up to the atmosphere and seems to be what took most of the budged than developing this game sadly.\nThis difficulty builds up through the game to the point where at some points you have to time every single action near perfect to progress, which felt very frustrating and unnecessary, but this kind of difficulty is a lot of platformers, so it's really up to you whether that's a good or bad thing.\nWhile the story and the voice lines are very generic as is the main character in the beginning, there is actually some good character development in the game and the ending was supinely satisfying, but didn't excuse the rest of the game.\n\nIt didn't excuse the frustrating dying over and over again scenarios, where I had no clue what to do or because of the inconsistent length of between the checkpoints, not to mention that the game doesn't always load the latest checkpoint you left. Also controls are unresponsive, as in I have to hammer a button, and the game wouldn't respond to first one or two button presses, mouse senility is off the charts and not in-game changeable. Not to mention the game can crash a few times, but due to the checkpoints, it is for most people irrelevant.\nOn certain level I want to comment on is the rat’s labyrinth, it's a fairly long level, without the great atmosphere and with generic platforming the rest of the game has and completely unreliable to the rest of the game, in case you come past this level don't be discouraged if you enjoyed the zombie-apocalypse atmosphere, it will come back\n\nSo do I recommend this? Well I do because this game is enjoyable, but there are a lot of problems this game has and if you aren't willing to except these problems and want to some zombie-apocalypse atmosphere, than don't get it.","April 10, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Te elaborate on the controls; this game basically expects you to have very precise movements in order to jump and land on obstacles and to dodge traps and run from zombies. However, the movement is very clunky, and every action you perform seems to have such a delay that finding the correct timing is more or less a combination of luck and tedious trial and error. Your character can either jump 6 inches straight up, or 10 feet diagonally, with no inbetween. Trying to jump and grab a platform straight above your head is a nightmare because either you're off by an inch and will miss and have to retry until you get lucky and find a sweet spot, or you will accidentally jump at an angle you go 10 feet too far and fall to your death. As for the story it has all the typical zombie cliches that we've all seen before.  Save yourself some time and frustration and give this game a pass.","February 6","false","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/papadelta/recommended/211400/","papadelta","PapaDelta138","http://steamcommunity.com/id/papadelta/","122 products in account","Deadlight is another one of Microsoft Studio's side-scolling platformer games that tells us the story of Randall Wayne, and his determination to save his friends from the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. It pretty similar to a few games like LIMBO, in terms of the platforming, and This War is Mine in terms of the visuals. The story was extremely short, let's say about 3-4 hours, but I won't speak against that because even though this game has its positives, there are also as many negatives in it, and that makes me want to just drop the game at any moment.\n\nThe visuals - Out of everything else in the game, this is what stood out the most. Grim, dark, and creepy - an appropriate setting for a game like this. The artwork is, as always, brilliant. To keep to the tone of the game, it won't be colourful (obviously). It probably draws inspiration from LIMBO. The cinematics are pretty similar to the artwork you'd see in The Walking Dead comic books.\n\nThe story - It is extremely short, but I felt it was good enough for me to be able to enjoy it. But it wasn't exactly immersive. There was not much character development, mostly only focusing on your main character,  and the start of the game feels like you're playing a game that's halfway done. Personally, as the game progressed, I questioned myself as to why I should give a damn about a bunch of characters I couldn't know about a bit more. It just felt inadequate.\n\nThe gameplay - Deadlight has its fair share of puzzles, and I'd say they're actually pretty ... not nice. Certain objects just go unnoticed, you just can't see them. It's frustrating. And the same thing could be said about the platforming. It's utterly maddening that you have to jump from Point A to Point B without having to know you'll probably die while doing it ... and you actually will (I literally stopped playing it once, because it was really rustling my feathers). Oh, and it's a mediocre port.\n\nThe verdict - I'd say that the game honestly did not live up to its expectations for me. I got it with full intentions that it would be one of the best games I've played, but nah. It's got a nice story, but terrible gameplay. I've also had issues with its bugs, too, as the cinematics would lose sound, so I'd feel like I'm watching a silent movie. Thank God for subtitles. All in all, I'd say get the game strictly when it is on sale. Would I recommend it to platform-lovers? No. What about story-oriented players? Maybe, maybe not (Mostly a no). But I will tell you this - Deadlight is very much forgettable.","February 18","false","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I really enjoyed the graphic style, the really cool sound design and during the first chapter of the game, I also enjoyed the gameplay mechanics.\nNow let's talk about the rest. Story-wise this game is atrocious. I won't spoil anything, but the writing is really clichéed. Strong man that doesn't talk much and mourns his family. The real enemy is not a zombie, but the human itself. And it is a human that attempts to ♥♥♥♥ a woman at the point, where the story almost falls apart, just to create some suspense. Not really imaginative.\nThe gameplay turns into a catastrophy while playing the last chapter. From timed jumps, to bullsh*t hitboxes that will make you die over and over again - everything is in there. Phrases like "The Safe Point is no more than a trap used to hunt the survivors." will make the replaying of those little parts even worse. The worst part are the checkpoints. You think that you will only have to replay that one jump, but you start out at the beginning of a long and unrewarding section that will take you approximately 30 minutes to finish. The game design in the last chapter is just really, really bad.\nAnother minor quirk is the overlapping of audio. Since recordings that can be found throughout the game world do not have subtitles, you will have to crank the volume up in order to understand them. Of course, they are a bit distorted, to make it even harder to understand.\nThe collectibles are also very, very unrewarding. There are hints at the government using leftover missiles from the Cold War, but as a whole the plotholes are very big. Furthermore, the ID's of strangers do not make any sense. I do not know if they are a reference to something, but they are in no way motivating collectibles.\n\nAs a whole, I do not recommend this game. The first part was very enjoyable and the game could have been a lot more. Nevertheless, because of the unprofessional writing and the rushed game-design towards the end, it is a tedious experience. If you really want to experience the (bad) story, you should rather watch a playthrough.","January 17","false","7.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #43 - Deadlight\n\nI'll start by saying I love the art style in Deadlight.  This is definitely the strong point of the game.  The entire game is a 2D side scroller, but the attention to detail is really well done.\n\nUnlike other zombie games I've played, there isn't as much of an emphasis on combat in this game.  It's really more about using your parkour skills to keep finding a way forward.  More often than not I was running from zombies because it's easier to run than to fight.  This changes somewhat when you eventually get a gun, but even then your bullets are limited.\n\nThe game plays like an adventure game, where the main character Randall serving as narrator.  You progress through levels, and in between you'll get a little animated comic book sequence that tells more of the overall story.  You can also find pieces of Randall's diary along the way which also fill in gaps in the story.\n\nDon't expect any kind of an open world here.  The gameplay is completely linear.  If you die you'll go back to your last checkpoint.  There's no visual cue as to where the checkpoints are, but there seem to be a lot of them.  I never had to repeat more than a minute or two of gameplay in any of the deaths I had.\n\nIn some ways this is a strange game because as a zombie game I wasn't that impressed with it.  As an adventure game the story is okay, but not what I would consider the strong point of the game.  It's the platforming elements where the game stood out for me, which I was not expecting going in to this.\n\nI'm a little lukewarm about paying the full $15 for it, so I'd recommend maybe waiting for this to go on sale.  As it happens right now it's 75% off, so for just under $4 it's definitely worth picking up.  Regardless of the price, I had fun with the game and really enjoyed the art, so I can recommend it based on these strengths.","November 1, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a tense, dark side scrolling platform with a great art style and wonderful attention to detail.\n\nSadly this only lasts for the first Act. Eventually the ideas ran out and the cohesive world building and fourth wall are broken for no apparent reason. Instant kill traps for no good reason, forced combat situations, cliche story, and trial and error fill up the rest of the remaining two acts.\n\nI'll explain a bit more about the trial and error as that is what truly causes this game to deserve a thumbs down. This is a game that will make you want to throw a controller/smash a keyboard. I'm fine with tough platformers, but not if the problem is the controls. The tight controls from the begining of the game do not hold up to the advanced "we put this death trap ridden jungle gym of a house falling apart just becuase" sections throughout the game.\n\nAn example: in one level you are tasked with sprint running through a door, making a jump over water, running fast through a corridor, wall jumping to grab a ledge, vaulting over and then rolling through the escape. Any slip makes you restart. The kicker? This is literally impossible if you long jump (sprint + jump) on the first jump. But you are already sprinting through the door so you have to stop sprinting, jump, then sprint. This is the only puzzle that requires this and there is no hint as to why you die in the corridor because you long jumped. After restarting 20ish times you either look up the trick online, or figure it out by mistake/trial and error. By all means google a few youtube videos of it, the level is called Fallen.\n\nBad game design and a lack of polish ruined a game that showed great potential, and really, that's too bad.","March 16, 2015","false","4.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I really only have two complaints about the game and that is how short it is, i completed it in 3 hours but there is a nightmare mode which i assume is just playing it at a higher difficulty. My other complaint is the keymapping for keyboard, it is obvious that the game is made to play with a controller as some moves are quite hard to do on the keyboard such as the tumble (you need to hold shift+ctrl+A(or)B) and there is no way to remap the keys to my knowledge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevix/recommended/211400/","Sevix","Sefris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevix/","251 products in account","Deadlight shows a lot of potential, especially early on. It's a tense, dark side scrolling platform with a great art style and wonderful attention to detail.\n\nSadly this only lasts for the first Act. Eventually the ideas ran out and the cohesive world building and fourth wall are broken for no apparent reason. Instant kill traps for no good reason, forced combat situations, cliche story, and trial and error fill up the rest of the remaining two acts.\n\nI'll explain a bit more about the trial and error as that is what truly causes this game to deserve a thumbs down. This is a game that will make you want to throw a controller/smash a keyboard. I'm fine with tough platformers, but not if the problem is the controls. The tight controls from the begining of the game do not hold up to the advanced "we put this death trap ridden jungle gym of a house falling apart just becuase" sections throughout the game.\n\nAn example: in one level you are tasked with sprint running through a door, making a jump over water, running fast through a corridor, wall jumping to grab a ledge, vaulting over and then rolling through the escape. Any slip makes you restart. The kicker? This is literally impossible if you long jump (sprint + jump) on the first jump. But you are already sprinting through the door so you have to stop sprinting, jump, then sprint. This is the only puzzle that requires this and there is no hint as to why you die in the corridor because you long jumped. After restarting 20ish times you either look up the trick online, or figure it out by mistake/trial and error. By all means google a few youtube videos of it, the level is called Fallen.\n\nBad game design and a lack of polish ruined a game that showed great potential, and really, that's too bad.","March 16, 2015","false","4.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I'll start with gameplay, the controls themselves are good, but the overall platforming feels slow and clunky, things easily blend in with the background and make it harder to see where you need to jump to.\n\nAnimations aren't so good when platforming too which makes the game feel even more awkward while jumping around. Sometimes you have to stop and carefully place your character right above an object (which takes time and zombies are almost always following you)  in order to jump and trigger a grabbing animation.\n\nThe shooting is kinda fun, despite the clunky aiming and platforming, the so-called game "secrets" are simply obvious, but the atmosphere is really good.\n\nPuzzles are boring and generic (pull this here to climb over there), the game difficulty and feeling of despair you get when you see the world easily become obsolete when the game saves every five seconds and gives you full health every time you re-spawn.\n\nSoundtrack isn't anything mind blowing, but it isn't bad either. The graphics are gorgeous though, but the game lacks simple options to control them (I'll talk more about that later). The story is your generic zombie apocalypse kind of thing, the characters are barely likeable and voice acting is terrible.\n\nThe cutscenes look like they are scaled down to 720p, you can clearly see some artifacts here and there and are not really enjoyable, seems like they saved money on rendering actual cutscenes and just went for the comic slide-show type of narration here.\n\nPort\n\nThe port is where it gets really bad, the game is locked at 30 FPS, the menu has barely any video settings at all, FPS drop in certain places for no reason and the game sometimes freezes for a couple of seconds and unfreezes on its own. Optimization is really bad overall.\n\nControls are fully rebindable, so we have that going for us. There is an audio settings menu with basic options as well, which is always nice. The game also supports a gamepad (It would be strange if it didn't, considering it's an Xbox port).\n\nI can't believe they couldn't make a decent PC port out of a Platfromer/Shooter kind of game.\n\nQuick Version:\n\n- Lack of Basic Graphics Options\n- Bad Optimization\n- 30FPS Cap\n- Awkward Platforming\n- Clunky Mechanics\n- Bad Voice Acting\n- Generic Characters and Story\n\n+ Great Atmosphere\n+ Beautiful Graphics\n+ Shooting Things Is Somewhat Fun\n+ Fully Rebindable Controls\n+ Gamepad Support\n\nWould I recommend this game?..uhm not really, I expected more and even if you like the game itself the port will definitely ruin your experience to some degree.","November 11, 2014","false","2.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Deadlight features a wonderful sountrack that fits each level perfectly. The voice acting in Deadlight is quite well done as well, though at times the narrative can be a little emotionless. There are no cutting or static issues with the audio in Deadlight. Deadlight delivers a wonderful experience through sound. 4.5/5\n\nVisually Deadlight is stunning. Brilliant aesthetics and effects really bring this game to life. Deadlight is by far the most beautiful sidescroller game I have ever played. The textures are crisp, clean, and high quality. No texture clipping or inconsistencies were experienced. 5/5\n\nDeadlight's story is well written. The story in Deadlight is both narrated through Randall's thoughts and read through his diary. The added depth to the story that comes from the reading of Randall's diary really gives the player insight into Randall's world. The story is full of tense moments and unexpected twists.  5/5\n\nMechanically Deadlight are well done, but not perfect. Deadlight features some environment interaction, though this is mostly limited to opening doors and solving puzzles. The movement in Deadlight is quite fun- being able to blast through levels as fast as possible, or taking it slow. The game has some issues with regards to keyboard controls, as it is difficult to make some jumps, though this is not really an issue. The gameplay can be a little "iffy" at times, such as events not firing or forcing the player out of areas. No crashes were experienced.  3/5\n\nDeadlight is a game that takes place in a beautiful world, with amazing sounds and voice acting. The story in Deadlight is fantastically executed and deep. The game has very basic mechanics, despite this, the game is worth every penny.\n\nFinal numerical score 17.5/20 or 87%","January 25, 2014","true","4.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Prince of Zombies? Zombies of Seattle? Also, I mean the old Apple II one.\n\nDeadlight is a 3D side-scrolling platformer with the same precise yet tanky controls from two decades ago. There's running and jumping and turning in place and stopping on a dime, and God help you if you flub a jump. You play Randall, a gravelly survivor of the zombie apocalypse who wishes he had half the gravitas as Bill. You must guide him as he mantles up and over the thousand fences, crates, and fire escapes of Seattle in search of his three survivor buddies and maybe his family? I dunno, I was too busy wrestling the terrible combat controls.\n\nMelee in this game is awful, as it only functions a certain distance from your character. Any closer and you harmlessly shove enemies away instead of whacking them. It makes mobs of zombies a proper death sentence, but in a game like this where it's easy to miss one running jump and land in a pit of undead, it can get frustrating fast. The gun is more effective but your ammo is rather limited and headshots are a must. I tended to do a lot more running from fights, which the game seems to support and often expects anyway.\n\nDo not buy into this one for the story, for it is terrible. The characters are incredibly one-dimensional and the writing is bad to the point of nonsense in some places. It is a pretty game however, in that lovingly-rendered hellscape sort of way. There's a lot of detail in the environments (so much so that it can obscure your path at times), and plenty of little collectibles hidden in out-of-the-way spots or obvious deathtraps. Looks to be about a 5-6 hour game, quicker if you don't bother looking for goodies. Decent playtime for the price, but the rough edges lead me to suggest a sale purchase if at all.\n\nIf you thought Prince of Persia needed a modern reboot with zombies and bad combat, by all means give it a try.","September 10, 2015","false","2.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Except nowhere near as good. Plenty of issues with non-existent foreground/background differentiation, terrible deadpan voiceacting from The Rat, obstacle course gameplay with trial and error and annoying loads for every try, tedious and unnaturally cryptic dialogue from a NORMAL person who's trying to tell you critical mutually beneficial information, and just generally plodding pacing of the plot make this title Deadboring to play.\n\nOh yeah, and the criticisms about controls is true. Mostly, it's that it takes a second for your character to accelerate to a run properly, and your character needs to fully transition to a different stance (hanging/running/jumping) to accept a new context sensitive command. It usually results in difficulty in controlling distances of jumps, and a slippery feeling to the controls.\n\nI gave up this game when The Rat tasks you to find his son, but refuses to return your axe and gun, even though he acknowledges the journey on the surface would be perilous... What? And instead of just walking with The Rat into the background platforms to get about, instead he follows you along catwalks while you complete an unnecessary obstacle course below, even though he's already acknowledged you. DOES HE WANT ME TO RESCUE HIS SON OR JUST ♥♥♥♥ AROUND?\n\nThis game's strongest point is its atmosphere and environment (except for how poorly it communicates what platforms/objects are reachable/usable/in the foreground). Unfortunately, because of how idiotic the characters are, it ruins any sense of immersion or belief, and there's really nothing more to play for.","October 8, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"
