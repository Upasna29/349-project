"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TubaPlyr/recommended/439880/","TubaPlyr","TubaPlyr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TubaPlyr/","294 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI played the first Heroes of Loot on mobile for 60+ hours so I was super interested when I saw this on steam.\nI've just jumped in and played two games so here are my first impressions.\n\nThe game looks nice and is pretty similar in gameplay to the last one. The controls are simple, aim with the mouse and move with the arrow keys clicking on people to interact.\n\nFor a game just beginning it's early access there sure is a good amount of content here, A bunch of passive and interesting items, enemy variety, levels, teleporters, cool bosses and very funny level transitions. The game doesn't take itself very seriously at all, cracking a joke whenever it can, which is definetly a plus for me. You unlock items in the game by collecting fragments of the item. When you collect all of the fragments you unlock the item which is very cool. The game gets deceptively super hard later and can start to give you an bit of a challenge which is actually pretty cool.\n\nNow all that being said here are some things to work toward.\n\nThe games did randomly hard crash after a certain point usually in shop areas, but I'm sure that'll be worked on in time. Luckly the game has an autosave feature, so even if it does crash it's not too frustrating.\n\nNow although fun, the game feels a bit chaotic. While other roguelites like TBOI and Spelunky have set level paths clearly labeling a "Level 1" and "Level 2", HoL2 doesn't feel that way. Instead I jump around to different levels each play through not knowing where I am or how far I've gotten. The game could really benefit from a "Level Map" like in the level transitions of TBOI. Or a difficulty meter when you enter a level to show how much harder the floor is going to be.\n\nDifficulty definitely gets there eventually but all in all feels a bit easy to start comparitive to other games like this and I would love to see the starting max Health decreased or More enemies at the start and maybe a slightly faster Rocko! ;) The game feels like you're being babied a little in the beginning which can be frustrating when you make it pretty far, die, and have to go through like 4 levels for it to start being hard again. I want to be challenged the WHOLE time. But thats really just a personal problem.\n\nThe game does way more right then wrong IMO, I love the game and I'm super glad I bought it. I can't wait to follow the development of the game and It can only get better from here. I'll be watching Orange Pixel!

After watching the trailer I saw some similarities in art style and game play style, so this was an insta-purchase for me.\n\nI've been having a blast. All the same addictive dungeon crawling from Space Grunts, but a much faster game play pace. I particularly like the booby traps. Again, Space Grunts had some really cool booby traps, so it's fantastic to see the dev continue to include them in future games. OrangePixel is/are beginning to establish a game style and it really works. This is a developer to watch.\n\n\nSome key review points:\n- Fast paced, hectic game play. Collect tons of loot, smash enemies with multiple characters, switch them in and out in real time. Enemy AI is balanced and fun. My only critique of the game play is that it's really easy for a while at the start of the game. I wasn't challenged at all for at least an hour of game play. As I've mentioned a few times, Space Grunts, another game by O.P was tough straight away.\n\n- Cute, bold pixel art visual style.\n\n- Subtle,well suited music and some great sfx.\n\n- From my 2.7 hours of play time, I've explored only a small amount. Heroes of Loot 2 is packed with content and replayability.","May 15","true","2.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The auto-aimed attack works pretty well, only if you deliberately want to, say, target the (mini) boss while ignoring his adds you need to use the stick.\nPickups consist of health/xp items, money (3 currencies for shopping, level skip and to pay healers), special weapons, defensive items, scrolls with various effects (which have to be unlocked to spawn), bombs or quest items.\nGraphics are nice pixel-art with some good-looking particle effects and very good lighting thrown in, the tile sets for the background vary enough so no 'been there, done that' feeling sets in.\n\nDifficulty curve could need some adjustment, it starts out very easy and you don't really have to watch your health, and then, somewhat suddenly you encounter enemies that can kill you in a few seconds, leaving me with a 'Wait, WHAT?' feeling - which wouldn't be too bad, if it weren't for the slog to get through the early levels again with the next play-through. That said, you can find shortcuts that skip 3 or 4 levels fairly frequently, but that means you lose out on the experience to level your characters. It might be that the permanent unlocks will eleviate that problem down the line, so you might be able to skip the first levels without being too weak later on, but that's too early to assess right now (~4 hrs in).\n\nAnother thing you have to get used to is the frequency damage is dealt to you. Trap tiles, contact damage or e.g. the flame breath of the minotaur feel like they tick every other (or maybe every 3) frame(s). I don't know the exact numbers, but standing on something that damages you can take a third of your health in a second or so - some slight adjustment on the i-frames might help.\nOn the technical side, it's quite solid, sometimes the music changes too often (playing a different track just a couple seconds after the last one started), the dice (found in the shop) can crash the game (game saves at the start of each level, so you wont lose 10 lvls worth of progress), and there are some rare level generation bugs.\nComing from Orangepixel's last game, Space Grunts, which I also bought right at it's EA release, I'm very confident these issues will be fixed during EA.","May 14","true","18.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprized by the first Heroes of Loot, and this one improves on everything that was enjoyable in the first one, and goes beyond. There are new additions throughout....there are cool levels, great loot, arenas, responsive controls, neat enemies and lots more! Though you control more than one hero in this game, it is not at all trying, nor demands co-op to do so. It's just a lot of fun to play...as is the first game. My play-time is a bit minor as I wrote this...but the game gives you a lot of enjoyment in a short time...so ideal for quick runs and long runs or in-between other games. I highly recommend this game already, early into its 'early access' stage...and also highly recommend the first Heroes of Loot too!! Great to see a 'sequal' that adds so much to its predesassor without diminishing either game. Bravo, Orangepixel!!!!!","May 29","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
