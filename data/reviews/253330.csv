Hopefully people find it helpful.\n\nThis isn't a typical horror game. It's not about startling you with jump scares. It's about creating a tense and oppressive atmosphere that mirrors my experience with mental illness.\n\nIt's not very game-y. Some may describe it as a "walking simulator". While it is true the main mechanics are walking, this was a deliberate design choice. The game is about disempowerment and vulnerability, which is important to creating a horror experience. To further the vulnerability, the main character has asthma. That means he can't run very far without stopping to get his breath, and we use the stamina to create tense situations.\n\nWe wanted to create a focus on immersion. That's why there is no UI, hud, or traditional game mechanics. We want you to forget you are playing a game and get lost in our nightmare-scapes.\n\nIt's not very long. A playthrough to one ending is between 1.5 and 2 hours. However, we have 3 different endings with unique content leading up to them, so I would recommend playing all nightmares. That will add another hour or two to your playtime.\n\nWill you like this game? That really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a unique take a horror with thick atmosphere, then I think you'll love what we are offering. If you are turned off by short games or ones without a lot of challenge, then this may not be the game for you. It's tough to make a game that appeals to everyone, but I think we've created a special game that a lot of people will really love.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the game! :)\n","October 2, 2014","true","45.7"," 621 of 656 people (95%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","95","621","656","12","10"

This is bleak, brutal, and brief – like every good horror should be.\n\nAs Thomas you wake up from a nightmare... only to realize that you're still asleep, still dreaming. And like a Freudian Dante you'll make your descent down the increasingly bizarre and menacing circles of your inner Hell searching for your Beatrice... of sorts. The world is sketched starkly and wildly in black and white (like a schizophrenic's scribblings) with the occasional accent of blood red and sickly yellow to mark manipulable objects and pretty much every childhood fear, irrational or otherwise, you still foster in your beating heart: darkness, gore, claustrophobia, self-harm, asylums, creepy porcelain-skinned, raven-haired girls, dolls... it touches on them all. ♥♥♥♥ing dolls. ♥♥♥♥ing dolls and raven-haired girls, man. Some people are afraid of heights. Some people are afraid of clowns. I'm afraid of dolls and women with black hair and fair complexions. And if you aren't, you will be.\n\nThe atmosphere is thick in this one. As you progress slowly from room to room and area to area, the game will do its damnedest to put you on edge. China will crash to the floor with no prompting, birds slam into windows with suicidal intent, and shadowy figures dissipate as you draw close. Then the tension will ease off, and your guard will be lowered. That's when the game will hit you. And it will hit you relentlessly. As I've said, this will touch on all your creeping nightmares... and perhaps some new ones will blossom. How great for you! “Neverending Nightmares” utilizes its jumpscares effectively. While they are numerous, they're only as scary as the atmosphere allows and let me tell you, it abides.\n\nAccording to the “About This Game” section, “Neverending Nightmares” is in part inspired by a developer's own struggle with mental illness. And that absolutely comes across in the game. The jarring, not-initially-clear story, the imagined monsters... and the real ones; the soft, distorted, plinky music and “mental ward sketching” look of the art... it feels very personal. And the game benefits from it. This is a man's soul laid bare, complete with an intimate, artistic peephole into his troubled mind. It gives the game character. More importantly, it makes it that much more terrifying and tangible.\n\n“Neverending Nightmares” doesn't overstay its welcome, keeping it fresh and frightening. And with the divergent endings you'll likely get some replayability, but don't expect to revisit this one over and over as it's fairly linear. It isn't all that challenging either, though that isn't why I play horrors. I play them to have a story told to me... a story told to me by an unspeakable horror that has me bound to a chair in basement with a lone, swinging light bulb above my head. And it's on the fritz.\n\n“Neverending Nightmares” is one of the better ways to ring in a new spooktastic October.","September 26, 2014","true","5.2"," 395 of 467 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","395","467","2","10"

I've seen some reviews and comments where people complain this game is both short and has very little real game-elements. Both of which are true. So if you are looking for an action packed lengthy horror-game, this might not be the best choice for you. If you however enjoy atmosphere and an 'experiance' this is really worth picking up.\n\nNeverending Nightmares is more like games such as Dear Esther, Gone Home or even Journey. It's not really the gameplay or the length. It's all about being sucked into an experiance and the atmosphere being presented to you. It's still very different from those games however. For one this is a really disturbing exeriance, it's a horror game after all. It does have some mild puzzle solving (how to avoid some enemies). The main thing is the visual style. The art, both graphically and sound make this game and this experiance.\n\nKnowing that you are going through things in the game based on the real nightmares the developer experianced being clincally depressed also helps to better understand the game. You aren't playing it for the sake of playing it as a video-game. This is experiancing the night-terrors of another real humanbeing.\n\nMinor downpoints is that you sometimes do have to walk a lot before something new happens. I understand it's building tension, but sometimes a few less rooms would have helped. Ironically, the game might have been better if it has been slightly shorter in that sense.\n\nYour sense of 'dread' also depends on the imagery, sound effects and jump scares. You quickly learn that death doesn't really impact. Which I do find a good desission. It's not about avoiding death, it's about the atmosphere. By the end however I could predict there an enemy encounter would probably happen as a bedroom was also nearby (if you 'die'  you awake in the closest bedroom).\n\nAll in all I highly recommend this game and hold it in high regard. But know it's not a game for everybody.","November 21, 2014","true","3.5"," 148 of 160 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","148","160","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/253330/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","Was very keen to try this one... (Watch out people, another long one. This one’s slightly personal).\n\n…for a few key reasons!\nIn its description it reads “Neverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game inspired by the developer's actual battle with mental illness.”, “Nightmare worlds inspired by real life struggles with OCD and depression”. Which are all points of interest for me. I really enjoy psychology and I have had more than my fair share of mental illness myself in much of the same respects. Being someone who has also had experiences with depression and night terrors, it was almost personal to me. I had to try this game.\n\nI’ve read very mixed reviews on this.\nSome love it, others think that it’s not a horror, not scary or compelling enough to play because of its “Walking Simulator” qualities. Which I’d have to say is true to certain extents, there is quite a bit of walking, but the nature of this game is not the norm. This isn’t a typical horror game. I’d say this is more of an experience then a horror game. At least that is the way that it comes across to me.\n\nI was very interested to see what kind of stuff would come up in this from what it’s based on. The difficult thing with dreams and nightmares is you can show and tell someone what happened, but you can’t always bring across the emotions, how you felt and the general tone and atmosphere of the dream for that very reason. An example being that I have a phobia (or Phonophobia to be more precise), an irrational fear, which I could try to explain to someone, but ultimately they’ll never understand the real feeling of having this overwhelming fear for something even you know is absolutely ridiculous.\n\n(This is where it gets personal, skip this section if you frankly couldn’t give a rat’s ♥♥♥♥.)\nThe one thing this game brought back from the back junk filed caverns of my brain was an experience I had. I would wake up (still dreaming) in my room, and the tiniest little detail would be out of place. Whatever was out of place would “clue” as to what phobia I had developed in that particular dream. If I didn’t figure it out in time, I’d be killed. By something relating to the phobia I had just developed. For example, an out of place poster on my wall that advertised Claustrophobia. I didn’t recognise it in time, a TV turned on in my room and it showed rows upon rows of beds, pairs of which that were opposite each other would slowly move toward another, then slam together face to face. Crushing the people inside. Starting from the furthest away and working its way to me I had to force myself to “wake up”. Only to wake up in my room again, a new slightly different oddity in my room, a new clue and a new phobia.\nThis happened what felt like hundreds of times. Safe to say when I finally woke up for real I was sat on my bed examining my room for something out of place like a true maniac. That experience being what this game reminded me of. It’s not the exact same, but it definitely rang a few bells.\n\nI am beyond a pansy when it comes to scary games and I was able to play this without stopping, hiding behind something and absolutely dreading moving forward like I have with traditional horror games. It’s gory, but it’s not particularly scary. Don’t get me wrong, this game builds tension and suspense and really had me and my heart rate going at times, but I don’t play many horrors games because of how big of a baby I am. If it couldn’t get my of all people’s jimmies truly rustling, I doubt it will for you.\n\nGameplay wise, you walk, you avoid and you run. There isn’t much to it, but where it lacks in gameplay it makes up in other aspects. The art style and use of colour is wonderful. Things that are coloured can be interacted with. A lot of things you can interest I was honestly curious as to what the significance of. Maybe they are just there for curiosities sake? Some are items you can use but most are just little things in the scene to get a closer look.\n\nThe settings are interesting and at times almost labyrinth like. I was torn between feeling like it was linear and I was on the right path and feeling like I was going in circles and was completely lost. It definitely added to the game. Wasn’t at all frustrating for me.\n\nFinally, story. I’m not sure I would go as far as saying there is a story given the nature of nightmares. But you can tell there is definitely a recurring theme. Which is interesting! Made me wonder. This is definitely one of those games I would actually be interested in hearing the developer talk about.\n\nAll in all (thank god it’s over, right?) this is a great little indie game. I enjoyed it!\nIt’s an interesting experience and it’s a pretty easy 100% which is always a nice bonus!\n\n\nTL;DR : (Don’t blame you) You walk a lot and gameplay wise you don’t do much. But it makes up with that with a wonderful art style and an interesting theme/story. It’s an easy 100% and I think it’s definitely worth a try. Especially if you like this psychology hoop-la, like I do!\n","March 8, 2015","true","3.3"," 182 of 212 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","182","212","7","20"

But there's not too much more for me to say. Gameplay is... Okay, if not super simple. Mainly just walking left or right, looking for an item, some enemy avoidance or running from enemies in places, going back and forth to and fro. And that'd even be okay... But the story completely lets itself down. Playing it, I knew it was going to be a game that would be made or broken by its story, and it just does not deliver. It has all this mystery, surrealism, themes, and absolutely no pay-off. I don't want to say too much, but the game has three-endings, and not the good multiple ending kind. Basically, there's no real meaning to anything as the endings suggest different potential 'answers', and with that, are the most cliche-horror answers you could think of.\n\nIt's not terrible, worth it if interested, and there are some good scares (many front-loaded) and moments, but there's just not enough there, and what is there isn't backed up by a complete vision to be a worthwhile experience. Pieces of it are good and interesting, but let down by simplified, repetitive gameplay, and an uninteresting, cliched open-ended narrative.","March 5, 2015","false","3.8"," 152 of 188 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","152","188","5","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/253330/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","The greatest and most effective aspect of horror is the tension and the atmosphere, the feeling of creeping unknown terror that lurks around each corner ahead, the mysterious buzzing sounds of some vile machine sprinkled with the curious moanings of what one could only guess are tortured souls.\n\nWhen it comes to horror, it's hardly ever the execution of cheap scares or the appearance of the actual monster that are scary or make the experience, but the thick and heavy atmosphere and the suspense that it builds in you throughout the journey and this is exactly where Neverending Nightmares excels above and beyond everything I have come to expect from the horror genre.\n\nNeverending Nightmares tells its chilling story of endless terror in the heart of a young boy through brilliantly gritty black and white artwork that evokes a strong nostalgia in me for the works of Edward Gorey, and the influence is obviously strong both in visuals and narrative content. This mysterious story of a troubled young protagonist shows a deep connection between him and his sister, and yet he seems to be so alone, so isolated in this nightmare realm.\n\nThe effects of prolonged solitude and isolation from the rest of the world can bring about these strange and hard to manage feelings of anxiety or OCD, and it creates a feeling of fear and distrust towards the few humans that are close to the inflicted. We see this fear in the protagonist and his close relationship with his sister as his visions slowly distort the image of this caring force in his life into someone who doesn't even recognize who he is.\n\nThe title screen alone gives a foreboding and chilling effect as the eerie sounding notes of a piano descend peculiarly in the same way the player will descend into progressively bizarre and terrifying realms of what seems to be the characters own mind. Deeper into the hauntings of your nightmares you will journey, waking up over and over again only to find yourself in an even more terrifying nightmare than the last like some kind of harrowing metaphor for the day-to-day dealings of those who suffer from mental health issues.\n\nWith each passing of these horrible nights that seem to be a dream or vision our protagonist awakens back in his bed suddenly, gasping for air and trying to put together the pieces of what he saw. Each time you awaken startled out from your slumber your environments change and the place you once called home slowly evolves into something hellish and terrifying. More and more with each damning vision your surroundings become enshrouded with antique oddities and bizzare, grotesque imagery.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of horror, not because I get scared easily but because blood and gore never really do it for me. I was kinda exposed to a lot of violent entertainment as a kid unfortunately and saw a lot of thriller and slasher flicks and such at probably too early an age.  I became totally desensitized to shock values in horror.\n\nThis game, though.. This effects me in ways I can't really explain, and wouldn't feel comfortable explaining because it really hits home with issues I've had dealing with insomnia and anxiety at a younger age although clearly not as extreme as what the developer, who states that his own real life experiences were a huge influence on the game, has been through. The point, either way, seems to be that mental health, no matter how small or severe, is a real issue that needs to be looked at more seriously especially in the gaming world.\n\nDespite the very sparse dialogue the characters are given incredible authentic personality through the emotions they portray throughout the game. The sound design is the best I've heard in a horror game and recommends you use headphones, I can see exactly why and would absolutely recommend it now as well. The effects all come at you from every direction and make you feel like footsteps accompanied by the rattling of chains are closing in behind and faint whispering can be heard as you step deeper into dark basements, the atmosphere is so thick and heavy that I find myself stopping to catch my breath and gather my thoughts.\n\nStill, after a couple playthroughs and seeing half of the endings I am left with so many question on what exactly our main character is going through. What causes him to see some of these visions, particularly of the cruel happenings between him and his sister? Which of these events are reality, and which are merely a figment of his paranoid and anxious mind?\n\nThis is a story I will revisit and contemplate many times, and it's a story I'll be determined to show everyone I know with or without an interest in the subject matter of mental health. Neverending Nightmares manages to be genuinely terrifying and surpasses even the most realistic 3D horror experiences on PC simply through the usage of skin-tingling atmosphere and an art style that won't soon be forgotten.","September 27, 2014","true","19.0"," 164 of 206 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","164","206","0","17"

Having suffered myself many years back from severe depression, at one point not even being able to get myself out of bed and constantly being close to tears, Neverending Nightmares was instantly recognizable.  Having had to learn to build strong defenses and coping mechanisms as a means to claw my way out of my own "well of darkness", I tip my hat in the direction of Matt Gilgenbach and hope that making the game was as cathartic in confronting those personal demons as it was to play it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=325940105\n2014 has been an incredible year for the Indie scene.

This fabulous year for gaming has seen the Indies take on Horror, Comedy, Strategy, Homages. Simulations and Adventures with the keen eye of an artist reaching for the highest hanging fruit from the tree upon which to base his/her canvass.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=324315871\nNeverending Nightmares starts with a decent into a hellish dreamscape and just like a spiraling staircase its added layers become almost serpentine as each dream begins to double-back on itself  the further you delve into its dark embrace. While some have dismissed the game as a "Walking Simulator", I fear they have missed the point entirely. This is a game about confronting your demons, not about engaging with them in blazing battles of attrition. Even without the flashy, almost photo-realistic graphics that accompany most horror these days, Neverending Nightmares manages to outdo most of them and is more terrifying than anything The Evil Within (after having played both games side by side) could dream up because it comes from a dark and deeply personal space that no fantastically, phantasmagorical horror could ever fill. Most of this is down to the disturbing imagery and fantastic sound design by Robin Arnott which has resulted in one of the most immersive and terrifying audio landscapes for a game I have heard yet. The game recommends that you play with the headphones cranked up and if this were a movie it would most certainly be clinching the Academy Award for Sound Design come awards season.\n\nWhile the game may be light on exposition it leaves the players to fill in the blanks when confronted with some of the games more grotesque and disturbing imagery. Neverending Nightmares is not a game that is going to spell it out for you and will require some analysis on your part just like the best of dreams get mulled over for their possible meanings. If I do have a slight complaint it is that some of the nightmares go on and on and tend to drag a bit reducing their shock value when their abrupt ending arrives.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=324033002\nNeverending Nightmares is a dark psychological journey into the realm of a damaged human psyche and will often leave your blood running cold and your heart racing. I can't say everyone is going to enjoy the experience though. This is an adult game taking risks with uncomfortable and disturbing themes and for that I give it my highest of recommendations. Don't go in expecting an Outlast or Amnesia kind of experience, although the game does provided ample jump scare moments, as Neverending Nightmares is more cerebal horror. If your are brave enough and up for the challenge go grab it now while it's hot!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","October 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 82 of 99 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","82","99","0","13"

It alludes to great things in Neverending Nightmares’ future; the idea that this might be a horror game which actually means something, pulling terror from the traumatic experiences of its developer and in doing so making it apparent to others how hard it is to live with them.\n\nBut despite what Neverending Nightmares wants to be, what it comes so close to being in its strongest moments, it lacks a deep enough understanding of itself to be able to fully accomplish it. Its effort is impressive and commendable, but its failure to completely reject the conventions of its less inspired horror peers caused me to feel uncertain what exactly Neverending Nightmares hoped to achieve, as well as call into question its ability to do so.\n\nNeverending Nightmares essentially works on two stages. There is the build up to a pivotal scene – slow nervous walks through dark corridors, dread hanging in the air over things hiding in the shadows – and then there is the climax of you current loop, in which you come face to face with whatever horrific abomination or memory has been haunting you. In this formula Neverending Nightmares is fairly comfortable and for a while succeeds in balancing the level of tension with due time for it to grow and dissipate, but somewhere around halfway through it introduces a third disrupting stage, that being terrifying abominations which can hunt and kill you long before you’ve made it to the next leg of your journey.\n\nI don’t wish to imply that I think death and repetition is unusual or an instant fowl for horror games in general, as when used properly it can elevate the terror by keeping you feeling vulnerable and on edge. Neverending Nightmares doesn’t fit into this genre the way many of its contemporaries do however, and through almost every aspect of its design is unprepared to have you need deal with threats in any meaningful way. Your ability to interact with the world is almost solely reserved to opening doors and occasionally picking up a key item, which leaves avoidance as your only means of moving forward when something more deadly is in your way. Except, nothing about Neverending Nightmares feels as if it was built to allow you to hide or quickly move the way you need to for this style of play to work. Its solution then is to create monsters nearly as incapable as yourself, but in doing so it disrupts the authenticity of its world and creates an awkward hurdle for you to constantly crawl over.\n\nOnce the limitations of your enemies become clear, getting past them is little more than a chore. Being unable to follow you past the room they exist in means any threat is only that for as long as it takes you to walk to the next door, and in many cases enemies won’t even see you if you’re slightly higher or lower on the screen than them (though the game is 2D you can still move slightly up and down on that plane). Their necessarily predictable movement patterns serve as the final knock to any sense of place Neverending Nightmares may have had, leaving it a bundle of transparent design conventions which grind noisily against each other as the game struggles to hold onto an identity fast slipping away.\n\nBy the end however it wouldn’t have mattered if Neverending Nightmares had found a way to make its mechanical insides work together, because it isn’t working toward any end worth arriving at. The scattered plot becomes more threadbare and contradictory as it goes on, fabricating confusing imagery and dialogue for the sake of actual progression. In the end it settles for tired, hastily wrapped up clichés which gave little closure and felt more bizarre and unfocused than anything Neverending Nightmares had showed me thus far. It felt like too little too late, a tame closure to a game that moments prior was assaulting me with nauseatingly continual depictions of a woman being mutilated, hung up like a slab of meat, and thrown from a window into a crumbled mess of limbs. There is a lot of messed up stuff in Neverending Nightmares, but these final scenes were the only time it really got to me, because it felt gratuitous and pointless in a way that everything else had not.\n\nI’m as much disappointed with Neverending Nightmares being a dull and uninteresting horror game, as I am with it failing to live up to its potential of being something more than just an excuse to get freaked out. With so much trashy, exploitative horror with no goal at being anything but that, Neverending Nightmares seemed to want to do something more, delving into the real psychological horror  of its developer and wrapping it up in a distinct visual style that all hinted at this being a project trying to do something different. I can’t say Neverending Nightmares didn’t try, but somehow that only caused it to fall further down the well of tired horror traditions.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 24, 2015","false","3.1"," 107 of 144 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","107","144","6","5"

The graphics and sounds are superb, and every minute of it is genuinely creepy and nightmarish.  The problem is that it's incredibly tedious and feels pointless after a while.\n\nThe "gameplay" is just walking (VERY slowly) through a house where, despite becoming increasingly surreal and disturbing, the scenery is too repetitive.  Oh, and occasionally trying to avoid encounters with passing creatures, which is just about my least favorite thing to do in a video game.  It just gets to be so dull.  And sadly, I think this repetition was totally intentional, a "his nightmare is OUR nightmare" feeling of being stuck in a desperate place and unable to escape.  It just fails at this, badly, as the game becomes unbearably boring.\n\nBy the time I reached one of the endings, I was SO ready for it to be over, despite the game's short length.  I have no intention of replaying to experience the other endings, especially since they require plodding through the asylum scene again, which is the most tedious part of the game.\n\nI started out loving the game, but when boredom set in, it hit hard.  Also, it's overpriced.  A game that can be finished in a couple hours should cost 4 or 5 bucks.","September 27, 2014","false","1.7"," 164 of 234 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","164","234","0","4"

I have been exposed to the game much longer than most people probably will.\n\nSo obviously, you know that it’s a horror game, but not in the same way Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Outlast, Slender, or SCP Containment Breach are. Those use a first person perspective to create more personal jump scares and to create a more realistic atmosphere; Neverending Nightmares doesn’t have nearly as many jump scares as those do and focuses on enhancing a very foreboding atmosphere and telling a story. Neverending Nightmares has a lot more in common with Gone Home then the other titles mentioned.\n\nThe story in NN can easily get confusing and requires some analysis to fully understand. Depending on which ending you get, you may be greatly disappointed in the game. I feel like only one of the endings actually has closure while the other two are much better if experienced after the first ending. The game tries to push the player to the first ending, but there is one branch that I feel could have been done much better in pushing the player in the right direction (SPOILER: it’s at the end of the asylum level. I feel like most people will probably jump off the edge just to see what happens, even if there’s a teetering animation. This is problematic because the way to the first ending is by going back into the asylum).\n\nThe horror in NN mostly comes from the atmosphere and imagery; not too much from the feeling of being chased or stalked like in SCP or, Slender. If you want something like those games then you’ll probably be somewhat disappointed with NN. Not to say that NN doesn’t have jump scares but they’re placed throughout the game very sparingly like in Amnesia, or Silent Hill. Silent Hill is somewhat similar to NN, but Silent Hill had more of a puzzle focus than NN does. The puzzles in NN are pretty easy and even become easier if you can’t seem to figure it out (note, that these “hints” are designed not to break your immersion, so there will be no word box that appears; rather, something in the environment will change to lead you in the right direction). If you expect the cryptic puzzles found in Silent Hill, then you’ll probably be disappointed.\n\nFrom my interactions with Matt Gilgenbach, the creative director, and my many playthroughs of the game, I figured that immersion is probably the biggest priority in this game. Many things that are just looked over in other games have a reason for it to happen; for example, every time the player dies, he wakes up in a bed as if that death was just a nightmare. Other games would probably just throw a “game over” screen and have you try again—and there’s nothing wrong with that, but NN creates a narrative reason to player deaths, which boosts immersion. Immersion also works well with the way the game tells its story since attention to the game environments is expected to fully understand many of the details in the story. I feel like the game’s short length also encourages replays since it’s a lot easier to study the environments of a two-hour game than a twenty-hour one.\n\nSo in conclusion, for what it is, NN is a great experience that I would recommend it to anyone who likes disturbing horror with a thought-out story, and a very distinctive art style. The game isn't really going to make you scream like other horror games, the game will give you more of an uncomfortable feeling while playing. I wouldn’t recommend it to people who generally don’t like/are getting sick of games that don’t have too many gameplay features, ie games that tend to be “artsy” like Gone Home, and Journey.","September 26, 2014","true","13.9"," 90 of 124 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","90","124","0","0"

Completely original in both concept and graphic design, and not only are the controls smooth but every aspect about the gameplay itself is extremely intriguing. Neverending Nightmares is very successful in delivering psychological unease visually and through atmospheric ambience, just like pixel horror games such as "Mad Father" and "Witch's House" were able to do. Would definitely recommend this game who likes more psychological horror and an interesting yet somewhat cryptic plotline over blatant jumpscares and chases in the more "traditional" horror games.","August 26, 2014","true","4.4"," 65 of 86 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","65","86","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JPrice321/recommended/253330/","JPrice321","JPrice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JPrice321/","323 products in account","Disclaimer: I took part in the Kickstarter campaign in order to get this game funded. As a result I’ve been playing the game for a good number of months in its Alpha/Beta stages, giving feedback and talking with the developers about the game.\n\n-TL;DR version-\nThe game is a wonderfully crafted psychological horror game that builds its horror around crafting a dark and foreboding atmosphere. It also does a great job at emphasising a slower, more disturbing tone than a traditional startling tone. The game being inspired by the visions and thoughts of someone with mental illness give a very genuine and unnerving feel to everything, which as a result makes for one of the best horror games that I’ve played in recent times. Definitely worth your time if you’re a horror fan and want something that’ll truly get under your skin.\n\n-Long version-\nNeverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game based upon the intrusive thoughts that have plagued developer Matt Gilgenbach over the years as a result of his mental illness. You play as Thomas, a man who initially when the game begins wakes up from a nightmare. From then on the game is shaped around Thomas’ descent into his mind as he keeps waking up into new nightmares. One major factor is consistent throughout almost all of Thomas’ nightmares, the presence of a girl named Gabby. How she and Thomas are connected remains unclear until one of the games multiple endings. As a result the player is given multiple possible theories to play around and work with; is she your sister? Is she your wife? Is she just a friend? Is she an enemy? The narrative gives the player enough to work with so that they are constantly guessing up until the very end of the game. This constant questioning plays into the world of Neverending Nightmares as you are never certain of what is reality or what is simply a figment of the nightmare you are currently in. As explained earlier the game features multiple branching pathways that lead to multiple endings (3 in total). These branches change the story of the game in various unique ways making the entire motivation behind the nightmares different in each ending, as a result it is encouraged that you playthrough multiple times to acquire all the endings and experience new nightmares that can only be found on that pathway. This added replayability should give you around an hour or two extra playtime once your first playthrough is completed.\n\nThe gameplay of Neverending Nightmares follows a 2D adventure format. You walk around various environments, interact with objects and explore your current nightmare in order to progress forward. If there’s one shortcoming that can be levelled against the game it’s that the gameplay itself, on an objective level, is rather basic. The formula doesn’t change too drastically from nightmare to nightmare, with only some minor puzzle solving elements being introduced when dealing with enemies. However there’s enough story and horror to help strengthen the gameplay, making you intrigued to progress further. In terms of actual control Neverending Nightmares adopts a very simple control style, with the only major functions being move, interact and sprint. This simplicity however doesn’t detract from the overall product in a major way.  The controls themselves are spot on, with the player being able to move Thomas in any which way they please, as well as being fully re-bindable. The controls also play into the horror as Thomas suffers from asthma, so he can only sprint for a short distance which requires effective management so the player isn’t left in a compromising situation. There are also other sections that play with the controls in interesting ways, however you shall have to find those out for yourself.\n\nBut what’s a horror game without the horror right? Well you’ll find your needs met with Neverending Nightmares. As this is a semi-autobiographical product a lot of the horror has been drawn from real experiences and visions, which really adds to the game's atmosphere. Some of the visions and imagery you experience in Neverending Nightmares is truly disturbing, especially with the added context of it being taken from a very real place. From body mutilation to overwhelming darkness, there are multiple instances where you will be truly afraid or horrified of what may or may not be around the next turn. Often times you’ll find yourself simply walking down a hallway, however the game slowly begins to twist and bend the environment to play with you. Distant whispers, growls within the darkness, words written in blood are simply some of the tactics that start to put you on edge. From there everything only builds and continues to build, making the player wonder “When is something going to attack me?” “Where’s the next safe spot?” “What will happen if I go down these stairs?”. Often times you will have never even seen an enemy that could potentially kill you and you’re still on edge, just waiting…Waiting for the inevitable. All of this contributes into creating a horror game that understands that the best way to create fear is to let the player scare themselves. However for those who like and appreciate the more startling aspects to horror, there are still elements of that in here with some well crafted jumpscares that are never too abundant to become tiresome.\n\nOne aspect of the game that can be critiqued is the brevity and challenge of the game. Neverending Nightmares isn’t the most challenging of horror games. Often times you are able to bypass enemies with relative ease once you determine their behaviour and the game is decidely linear which leads little room to get lost. As a result the game in one playthrough can be finished in around 2-3 hours, however with the added branches there is an extra hour or two of gameplay added on top. With that said, the game is much more focused on the experience than challenge. By focusing more on the experience, the team at Infinitap Games are able to create a very lean game that packs all of horror into one sleek package. As a result the horror itself is a lot more impactful rather than being bogged down by repetition or filler. How you feel on the matter however is something that should be left up to you, just be aware that the game isn’t particularly lengthy or challenging before going in.\n\nFinally the visual/audio design is superb throughout. The Edward Gorey inspired art design stands out as being something unique within the genre, it also creates a storybook-esque style that meshes well with the horrific atmosphere. The audio design is top notch with subtle flourishes of music and ambient noises that play on your mind all throughout the game. Voice acting, whilst being slightly underplayed in the story as a whole, conveys the suitable amount of emotion required to make you empathise with Thomas’ struggle and dubious of Gabby’s true intentions.\n\nAll in all I can say that the money I spent on Kickstarting this game was not made in vain. Neverending Nightmares succeeds at crafting a satisfying horror experience that toys with the player in a wonderfully fresh way. The semi-autobiographical angle gives the whole game a very grounded and real atmosphere, making you see some of the worst that mental illness does to people.\n\nIn my opinion, it’s one of my favourite horror games in recent memory and definitely worth a purchase for any horror fan.","August 31, 2014","true","13.7"," 57 of 74 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","57","74","0","0"

Each nightmare that you experience leads into the next, slowly revealing the reason that you're there in the first place.  To get the full effect of the game, it's recommended that you play with a headset and a controller as the ambient sound and rumble features are implemented.\n\nThe game is short, I completed it in about an hour and a half.  There are three separate endings that you can unlock based on a few of the choices in the second half of the game.  I was unaware that I was even making choices on my playthrough as they are not obvious until they are revealed at the end.\n\nAll in all, this is a good game and a fun experience.  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys atmospheric horror with an unfolding mystery added in that explains why it's all happening.  I must say that I personally would recommend only picking it up on a sale, though, as the current $15 price tag is a bit steep for what is offered.","May 9, 2015","true","1.7"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","42","50","2","0"

For a month, I found myself quitting each and every time when I sit before this game, even with the perfect resolve to complete it. Yesterday, I did it. In the end, it left me with mixed feelings. I certainly appreciated the art and the thought process, yet did I love the game? I think "love" is a big word to define this particular psychosis.\n\nThe game is a survival horror adventure + walking simulation. Young Thomas is a man trapped within his own nightmares. He wakes up in an old Victorian mansion - presumably his parents' house - and starts to walk around, pacing within countless disturbing settings which supposedly represent his own subconscious. By the end of each nightmare, a new one starts, and he wakes into another nightmare, and another... and so this goes on and on. Every time that he wakes up, the nightmare seems to twist into a bit more disturbing and gory version of what he has already encountered. Themes of immense depression, guilt and decay are omnipresent. Thomas' only tie to the reality is a young woman, who seems to be his sister: Gabby or Gabriella... who constantly dies, for some reason. Symbolisms we gotta look beyond of? Hmph, I finished the game with all endings even, and I still don't know.\n\nThe opening of the game is pretty disturbing and catches your attention quickly. The artwork is hand drawn, an eerie pen & ink style drawing that recalls Edward Gorey. I should state that an immense labor was put into even the art of the game. Everything is in black and white, drawn with countless dots and brush marks to work on furling shadows. Only blood and certain objects that you can interact with are presented in colors. Combined with background sounds like whispers, dragging noises, moans and whimpers; an astonishing atmosphere awaits you. Yet this atmosphere quickly loses its effect as the game continues.\n\nThe dynamics of the game are pretty basic. There is a tense, lonely period weaved with suspense and scattered flashes of bad omens which makes you tiptoe; and then comes the climax of either a bad memory or a gory enough scene. This equation loops each and every time, added up with the optional presence of a monster to avoid. After a while, added with the loss of direction due to "neverending" display of the same environments with some new events, you start expecting what is to come and everything normalizes quickly. After the first half an hour, you get used to the dynamic and the thrill loses its effect over you. You start playing the game automated, just for the sake of finishing it in hopes of understanding the storyline.\n\nGameplay only gives you the option of walking in a direction, rarely pick an object and change rooms via doors. Oh, and you have the option of running for a little while with the shift keys, if you are to avoid a monster. If you keep a different elevation, you are able to avoid most monsters. For others, you only need to leave the room. I completed all endings with only 4 death counts, once for each kind of monster you have to deal with and I'm not particularly good with my reflexes either. If I managed, anyone can manage to avoid monsters, endure some gory scenes and finish all endings within 3 hours if they want. That kinda diminishes the thrill of the game and with this much repetition, it gets boring quickly.\n\nWe are informed that the designer of the game, Matt Gilgenbach dealt with severe depression and OCD which gave inspiration to creating this game. In my opinion, the artwork and the themes used may indicate depression, but the only indication of OCD that I've observed is the art style itself, consisting of countless hand drawn lines and dots. Whew! That is OCD if I've seen one! But the gameplay and the story has nothing to do with any of these mental conditions. So it would be hypocritical to exemplify this game to promote awareness for either depression or OCD. No, I'm not a psychologist, but I'm sufficiently trained in psychology and, I suffer from minor OCD. I also had a brief depression period 5 years back - as any individual with an above average IQ in modern society. Yet again, experience is always subjective so I cannot declare mine as the sole verdict on an artwork.\n\nOn my own experience, I cannot recommend this game. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for symbolism and well-crafted atmospheres, and I certainly don't declare myself as capable to understand everything concerning human psyche, but there is no consistent story. Only details thrown around to make room for you to craft a meaningful story yourself. I've read an explanation in discussion forums, and thought "this should be it" long after I finished the game. Aside its success on atmosphere, this game ends up being an excuse for gore. Combined with its flawed horror dynamic, I'd say the current price is real steep for what you're getting yourself into. Then again, art IS subjective.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 27, 2015","false","4.5"," 75 of 109 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","75","109","0","13"

The art creates a striking visual style all its own, and the game further sets itself apart by streamlining the experience of gameplay; it forgoes inventory systems and onscreen interface elements to present a player interaction that is focused completely on what's happening in the protagonist's nightmare world.\n\nIt is not without jump scares, but they are spread judiciously throughout and well earned by the slowly built tension. Instead, the game wisely chooses to focus more on the subtle. Like a good horror movie, it plays with your expectations and eases you gradually into the terrifying. Shadowy movements in the corner of your screen and barely heard voices and sounds set the stage for the actual dangers yet to come. The game's unique and beautiful lighting system makes the darkness itself into a living entity, and it constantly shifts and pulsates around you, at times threatening to suffocate.\n\nThe music and audio are exceptional. Everything from the pained rasping of the main character's asthmatic breaths to the low growls of unseen creatures lurking in the darkness serve to pull you deeper into this nightmare world. The music is simultaneously eerie, ominous and beautiful.\n\nThe game features branching paths that lead to multiple endings, each of them ambiguous in their own way. The story often follows a bizarre dream (or nightmare) logic that defies rational explanation and begs replay.\n\nThis is truly something to be experienced, ideally with the lights off, headphones on, and a controller with rumble.","September 26, 2014","true","60.6"," 56 of 78 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","56","78","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/253330/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Neverending Nightmare is a horror adventure style game. This game was released in September 2014 on Steam.\n\nYou play the role of Thomas, the idea behind the game is that you keep experiencing nightmares, but you keep waking up and going straight into another one.  Each nightmare gets worse and worse every time - and the gameplay elements in them become harder too. The game also has a pretty cool save system in that if you die, you end up waking up just a few moments before in the same nightmare.\n\nThe actual gameplay is fairly simple - it almost works like a point and click adventure game, but you walk around either using WASD or a controller. As you navigate around the levels, you encounter certain objects which can be interacted with or picked up to use in someway, such as a candle. You will also face a couple of enemies which you have no way of killing, you just have to either avoid or sneak past.\n\nGraphically, Never-ending Nightmares is a 2D hand-drawn line art style. This looks really cool and really puts across the point that this is a never ending dream; all of the colours are the same every room looks identical to the last but with subtle changes.\n\nThis game comes with three different endings, I haven't figured out really how to get different endings to the one I already have got, but there are guides online if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nMy first run through NM took me about two hours to complete. This would of been considerably shorter if not for a few irritating moments involving sneaking past a difficult monster, but I felt this time was OK for this type of game. Like I said, there are two other endings which will make this a pretty decent length title, but others may be looking for a bit more longivity for the price this is on sale for.\n\nI didn't have any technical problems whilst playing, I did however see something which I think should be mentioned - no loading screens. I don't think games get enough credit when they implement something like that, having no loading screens at all really keeps you immersed in your surroundings and the game.\n\nMy final thoughts would be to pick this game up if you are into the atmospheric horror genre of games; but don't go into it expecting fast paced action because you will be thoroughly disappointed as there is virtually no action here. But for what it is, which is a well presented horror game with an awesome looking art style, then you'll get some enjoyment out of it. Personally I think that the £10,99 is a bit steep, maybe wait for it to go for -25% off before picking it up just because of a single ending only takes 2 hours to see.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Horror games on the other hand when done right scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me! Neverending Nightmares is a fantastic example of a horror game done right that had me on edge throughout the entirety of my time spent playing.\n\nAt it's core NN is just an exploration game. But at it's heart it is much more. NN presents a physhological horror experience of the kind I have never experienced in a game before.\n\nLet's start with the sound design. This is what builds up the experience. Ambient noices are present throughout the entire game. They help to build up the fear amazingly. Each sound is designed to absolute perfection. Everything sounds like what it should do and when put together they create a perfect tension throughout the exploration. Their is also a brilliant soundtrack featuring creepy songs such as out of tune record players that build the experience. The only issue I have with sound design is the voice acting. Some of it isn't great. Luckily there are only two characters that speak and they don't speak very often so this is a minor flaw. But it could do with some improvement.\n\nThen there's the graphics. It is the most unique choose of graphics I have seen in a game and it is a fantastic choice. The whole game is presented in a handdrawn sketch style art view. NN is a work of art in this mean. The detail the artistic has put into it is an unprecedanted masterpiece. The small details are paid close attention to. Everything from the cracks in the wall to the creepy paintings on the wall help to build up the horror experience.\n\nWhat about the actual horror element? Well it's definitely not for the faint hearted. There is a "lot" of gore. I mean a huge amount. You see things like the character chopping their own arm to pieces in excruciating detail! It is extremely disturbing. Now I am not a person that usually get's cringeworthy at gore, but this game had me cringing a few times.\n\nBut the real horror comes from some of the jump scares. There are few of them compared to other horror games but they are done extremely well. They are not cheap overdone jump scares either. Each of them is well thought out and unique in it's own way. They definitely all come at a suprise. All of them really, really scared me. And as I said before I don't find myself getting scared at jump scares in films but in games it seems completely different. Maybe it's just the fact that you feel like you are actually experiencing it yourself by playing as the main character.\n\nThe enemies are something of a pleasure as well. Each are very unique. You will often find yourself running from enemies during the game. And that's not because the game is making you but because you are running from your own fear. This paragraph may contain spoilers if you don't want to know about any of the enemies you will be experiencing. Now it may seem cliche to be running from a little girl carrying a knife but somehow NN seems to be able to make the experience seem new. You also have characters you have to hide from in closets or the such. A unique enemy is the blind one that you have to sneak past with making little noise. But the biggest fear I had was for childs dolls. Now that definitely sounds like the biggest cliche ever in horror. But again somehow NN makes dolls coming alive a complete new experience that scared the crap out of me! There are many more enemies as well but you can experience them for yourself.\n\nThe story is mildly intriguing. It is one of the least standout parts of the games though. I don't know quite how to explain it without spoiling it though so I will just leave it at that. But it seems to get resolved rather quickly at the end of the game and then it just ends. It was a rather disappointing but suprising ending.\n\nI have seen in other reviews peoples main complete being about the length of the game. I don't see this as a bad thing. I experienced everything that the game had to offer, including getting every achievement, in just under 3 hours. I think this is a reasonable length. Anymore and I would have found myself getting bored of it. But you may think differently so you should put this into consideration.\n\nSo I would definitely recommend this game. It is one of the best horror experiences I have played to date. Most things are done to perfection and it is very unique. The only thing that may put people off is the price point of £10.99. I personally think it is well worth this initial price though. I really hope people consider this game and don't put it off to play one of the bigger 3D horror experiences that have nothing on the pyschologial experience neverending nightmares presents.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","August 24, 2015","true","3.1"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","3"

That's pretty much all you do most of the time - you're going through (largely linear) corridors and taking in the scenery. There are no puzzles. There's no inventory. It's short. The player character is slow as a snail. There's little interaction with the environment.\n\nBut, there are threats and obstacles to traverse. There are branching paths and endings that range from obvious to very subtle. In fact, much of the changes in the environment (and thus the story it tells) is incredibly subtle and easy to miss. The mechanics present in each chapter are minimalistic (it's always about simply moving, really) - it is clear the entire game has been deliberately designed to have the bare minimum of interaction, to focus on the atmosphere and unraveling of the plot and setting.\n\nThis is a double-edged sword. On one hand, you don't have interesting (expanded) mechanics to keep the player engaged. On the other, the game builds tension and dread almost perfectly because there is no clutter in-between the player and the spooky. Every time the player thinks the game is starting to get predictable, it throws a curveball. There are some really well done moments (no, not jumpscares, even though there are a few of those as well) that could easily fit in a Clock Tower or Silent Hill game. It would be a shame to miss those.\n\nThe (objectively!) best part of the game is the sound design - it is absolutely necessary to play with headphones to get the full experience. There's plenty of dynamic changes to the BGM along with superb sound effects, even completely fine voice acting too. The credits song is practically a Yamaoka homage. Props to McGlothlin.\n\nThe artstyle is also worth a mention. Everything is in black and white, except blood and interactive objects that are shaded in different colours. It feels like a cross between a child's scribbles and a newspaper caricature. There is a huge amount of detail put into scenery, and there is one nightmare that makes very good use of this style to keep you on edge. There's a surprising amount of gore and uncomfortable imagery too, making it pop out even more.\n\nAll things said and done, if you like horror in general, you'll probably like this too. If you enjoy survival horror though, your mileage may vary. It's worth the couple of hours, especially if on sale.","November 24, 2014","true","3.5"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","31","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/253330/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Neverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game based on developer Matt Gilgenbach’s personal experience with OCD and depression. You can clearly see that a lot of work and effort went into creating this game but the big question really is: is this game enjoyable for and accessible to anyone else who doesn’t suffer from these disorders ? Is this game not too personal ? Let’s review:\n\nI’ll immediately answer that question for you. No, the game has not become too personal and it has become a game anyone can play. What you make of it is totally up to you, however. Even if most of what you’ll see is fairly obvious.\nWhen I said that this is a psychological horror game I wasn’t being entirely honest with you. Because the game - well, it doesn’t really rely on them, but it uses them anyway – also has a few jump scares in it. But, these are rare and more creepy than scary.\nThe game does an amazing job at creating an unsettling atmosphere. It felt uneasy the whole time I was playing this. Not many horror games have managed to do this so that was a pleasant surprise for me.\nThis is a traditional survival horror game where you don’t possess any weapons (nor will you pick any up later on) and the idea behind it is to create a sense of dread or helplessness. And with success.\nYou’ll navigate through a mansion and other environments to find out what’s happening with you and at least one other major character. I’m not going to spoil anything here, because this is a game that should be experienced and talking about it too much would just detract from that.\nThe whole world is in black and white with the exception of some objects that you can interact with (like doors and paintings) and things like blood. It’s part of why the atmosphere is so good, because there’s no clear distinction between objects. You can’t possibly know what to expect.\nYou’ll navigate through the environments by just going through doors in the hope that it’s the right one. There’s no map and especially in the beginning this can lead to a bit of backtracking. The fact that the environments subtly change doesn’t help either. But once you realize how the game works it will actually become easier to understand.\nNeverending Nightmares is a short experience, and I finished my first playthrough within just an hour. After completing it I noticed that the game actually has branching paths and thus I actually missed 3 different endings. This was entirely unexpected because the game doesn’t play like a game where you can make choices. It’s all very subtle. So, anyway, I continued closest to where it would branch off and tried a different path. And what do you know ? I came across different settings/environments and had completely different scares, along with a story that wasn’t even remotely similar to my first ending. Very impressive and because of that you can easily add a couple of hours to the playtime here. I think first time players can and will finish the first story in 60-90 minutes, though.\nAnd I almost forgot to mention; should you die - and it doesn’t matter where - you will usually wake up in your room. Going through the door will usually let you continue close to where you died so you won’t have to backtrack much. It’s a clever system that once again adds to the creepy atmosphere it tries to create.\n\nGraphically this game is a stunner. Usually I don’t expect indie games to have high resolution art in them, but Neverending Nightmares has some of the prettiest and sharpest graphics I’ve seen in a 2D game so far. People refer to it as pen-and-ink style and I can only agree. It’s something that has to be seen in motion to be appreciated and understood.\nThere are so many details found in the environments and in the animations of your character that it’s nothing short of impressive. I’ve seen the character stopping and panting after running for too long, with perfect lip syncing and I’ve seen the belly of a monster moving. Usually developers don’t put much time in animating everything there is to animate so it usually comes down to limbs and heads. This is absolutely amazing.\nThe music and sounds are ominous and exactly what you would expect from a horror game. Don’t expect any happy tunes here.\n\nNow, ‘is there nothing wrong with this game’, I hear you ask ? Well, no, not really. If there’s one thing I had to mention then it’s that it’s a bit slow sometimes and that it’s a bit repetitive once you get used to the scares and atmosphere. That’s literally the only thing I can think of. Honestly.\n\nI hope Matt’s Neverending Nightmares will be a huge success critically and financially, because it really deserves it. And if it can make people aware of OCD and depression at the same time then it deserves even more credit. I just hope that the people who are going to play it will also try to actually finish it because, let’s be honest, that is its ultimate goal.\nBravo ! Bravo !\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","September 26, 2014","true","3.1"," 40 of 60 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","40","60","0","3"

The gameplay itself is linear and repetitive, but the real crime is that those brief moments of creepiness never build to anything more- they don't add up to some chilling tale of dread, or slowly reveal an unimaginable horror- they're just isolated bits of ghastliness without any real substance behind them. This is only emphasized by the multiple endings- rather than all the clues pointing to one inevitable, undeniable terror, it's just a mix n' match of traditional horror imagery. The end doesn't come as revelation, but a sudden 'What? Is that all?'\n\nIf you're really curious I'd wait until this dips to around the $3 mark, but in the meantime your pennies and yen for suspense would be better spent on Limbo or Gone Home.\n\n\n\n","September 28, 2014","false","1.8"," 70 of 114 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","70","114","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilkinggumby/recommended/253330/","evilkinggumby","EvilKingGumby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilkinggumby/","448 products in account","I just did an initial playthrough for Neverending Nightmares last night. I was one of the original Backers for this on Kickstarter, and played the initial demo they had for the fundraiser to get a feel for it. Beyond that I have skipped a lot of the videos and discussions and Alpha/Beta tests so as not to spoil the experience of the game.\n\nNow as you'll see they went with a classic pseudo Edward Gorey style of art, and this I actually like. The pen like line work is kool and the animations and overall look feel very similar to Gorey. It uses a minimalist color scheme, where interaction objects are color so you can easily spot them and know when to use them (though there is few spots to do this aside from a myriad of portraits to view, cell doors to look in and a bunch of dolls to glance at). The game only has a handful of objects to find, a candle, an axe, umm.. that's about it I think.\n\nMost of the game is walking around this large creepy house (or an asylum) just trying to find an end to the "Nightmare". Along the way is a bevy of imagery, creepy/dangerous creatures to avoid and a few mild jump scares.\n\nWhat works:\n\nOverall sound design is atmospheric and interesting/creepy\nArt design is solid\nControl of the character (uses Gamepad or keyboard)\nRuns at a number of resolutions, all the way to 1080p\nHas enhanced audio for headphones (it has a warning that it's better to play on them than speakers)\nDisturbing imagery without going overboard.\n\nWhat misses:\n\nFirst nightmare seems to have more creepy instances and mild jump scares than any other level\nshading//lighting is too "still" (more on this later)\nMusic becomes quickly monotonous and repetitive\nSome areas have noticeable skips where you can tell it's jumping from the end of a hallway to a new hallway when it is supposed to be one continuous hallway\nThe character has asthma, so you do get a "Sprint" button but you can only use it for short (1/2 a room or so ) bursts and the character makes the same whiny out of breath noises whenever you've sprinted a couple steps.\nNo interaction with the little dialogue that is there.\nObscure branching paths\naside from a few tense moments when you first encounter an enemy (and learn how to avoid it) the game is mostly walking and navigating.\n\nWhere this game just misses is that it feels like everything that is there, at some point was deemed "good enough" instead of "perfect" or "great". This is a trend I suspect I'll see a lot with Indie games and Kickstarter projects by small studio's. With NeN the audio design is good, it has a good somber spooky vibe to the music and the kaleidoscopic of noises that come and go are suitably "horror game" sounding. But that's all it is.. background filler. It rarely ramps up or builds to a crescendo, doesn't try to manipulate the player aside from a simple orchestra hit when something jump-scares you. And most of the atmospheric noises are heard no matter where you are, with a few audio cues added for when you are outside or in the asylum or in a bathroom.\n\nThe visual design is serviceable, but what would have made the game a lot more tense and nerve-wracking would be to make the lines creating shadows a lot less static and a lot more "noise". There is a slow crawl series of layers to the lines that create the obscured effect in the game, but they move slowly and from right to left and that's it. Horizontal and vertical lines, when thinking of it like a designer for a home or a useable space, are usually beneficial. vertical lines imply strength and stability. horizontal lines imply peace, calm, and relax a person. ANGLES cause tension. And squiggles or erratic lines also cause tension and unrest. If they had worked on the line work and shading a bit more, and created something that felt unsettled and "restless" when you are simply standing there, it would have worked wonders. I harken to playing the original Fatal Frame and how the simple detail that the view of the game was through a grainy film layer, which made every moment of every scene lack a placid stillness that felt calming, and so you were kept on edge even in moment where you were "safe".\n\nThe use of blood around the house was good in the first nightmare, but over time there is more and more blood splatters and strips and puddles. Since there is likely about a dozen or so decals for blood, you see a lot of similar splatters, and over time they end up just feeling cartoonish and copy-paste. Any atmospheric effect it could have is lost, except when you ramp it up and see a room with a LOT of blood on the walls or floor, and by that point it has lost it's shock value.\n\nThere are a lot of re-used assets. I imagine they created a lot of the objects for the game individually, then placed them around the house to create a variety of halls, rooms and areas to explore. I am not against this, except after seeing the same doll/chair/painting the 50th time. As well the fact that most of the areas you navigate are (again) static and unmoving makes it feel like " ok here is another room like this.. just need to find the door". In a lot of ways, stacking this idea with the fact some of the levels are maze-like and frustrating to navigate to the object you need or the end of the area, makes it feel like such a slog. I will admit during the second nightmare I was on the edge of shutting the game off out of sheer banal boredom.\n\nI guess for a nightmare, I would have expected the house/asylum/areas outside to feel more "alive". organic. I want a steady stream of dolls turning to watch me, of paintings slightly fading from one normal image to a creepy one. Of stuff poking into the scene just at the edges of the screen where you almost see them, but not quite. When I played the second Phantasmagoria game and you go to work and there is a simulated "computer screen" you can check email with and do some work activities, I loved that every little while (seemingly random), words would change to other words, hard to see but if you manage to spot it you realize it's sinister and evil. It made the simple act of reading email as the character feel disturbing and you would question your sanity. When the environment feels extremely copy paste and static, so you have a good feeling of what will happen and what to expect, it ruins the tension and takes away that feeling of being helpless that makes horror games successful.\n\nThe underlying point of the game, to examine and empathize with mental health conditions, and try to evoke a sense of what it is like to have a mental illness, is really what the game was supposed to be about. I think a lot of gamers won't know to look for this or see it at all when playing the game, mostly because it is hinted at and thinly threaded into the game but not so much that it's obvious or too much (and so heavy handed). I think having the entire game be nightmares (which aren't real, and disturbing nightmares are fairly common, so not indicative of a mental disorder) actually spoils any true sense of dread. But really I am sure a lot of folk that play this will think " well i have more disturbing dreams than this, and I am not mentally ill". The idea is in there, within the bones of the game, but being buried enough you have to actively seek them out, and also play the game about 5-6 times to unlock and "see" all of the endings makes it too much work and effort to "get" the point of the game. When you consider the other issues and the fact the game is neither completely scary, totally creepy, or terrifyingly exciting, going through the first few nightmares again and again doesn't sound inviting. Considering every time you die or enter a new nightmare you burst awake in bed, the initial play through has a bit of "repetition" fatigue already. Doing it again.. not inviting.\n\nReccomended: Horror fanatics, Ed Gorey Fans, anyone skilled with reading into subtext/iconography in a game.This is not a "jump scare" game.

But, in concern to this game, I wholeheartedly agree.  There is no more to this game than walking forward; pressing two buttons on occasion (one to intereact, one to run - for the duration of one with overly-crippling asthma); and the occasional need to either hide for several seconds, walk slowly, or travel in the opposite direction.\n\nThe first playthough takes roughly 45-60 minutes and to be honest leaves you not wanting to replay the game again.  Games like this rely on atmosphere and subtext to propel them past their lack of "gameplay."\n\nThe atmosphere is stale and relies upon filling an area with clutter and then plopping something of slight significance in, hidden amongst everything.  The subtext is bizarre, which is good for the theme of the game, but overly cryptic leaving you to make no sense of the game.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about this game is that the artwork is absolutely brilliant.

They go around and stranger and stranger things happen, and then a big shocking thing happens and they wake up? Neverending Nightmares is an entire game built around that concept. And if that doesn't sound like much of a game to you, well, you'd be right.\n\nThe game opens with your sister dying and you waking up. You lead your character through a darkened, monochromatic house in search of... nothing, really. You proceed through the unsettling halls because nothing would happen if you didn't. Eventually you'll find your sister again, and something horrible will happen to one of you, and then you'll wake up again. The cycle continues throughout the game, with the environments becoming steadily darker and more unfamiliar. This part admittedly works really well, forming a genuinely tense atmosphere. The gorgeous art and animation sets the tone perfectly, and you never really feel completely safe, even after you divine the flow of the game. Neverending Nightmares does a fantastic job of mimicking actual nightmares, at least in terms of aesthetic.\n\nThe problem is that there really is no more game to it than that. You'll come across enemies from time to time, but all you can do is hide from them and then scamper past once their backs are turned. There are no puzzles aside from permutations of "find candle to enter dark room" roadblocks. Exploration won't gain you anything aside from some slightly different scenery, as all paths still lead to the same inevitable conclusions. And that's the true killer of Neverending Nightmares, that everything about it is inevitable. Each nightmare is the same hell of wandering dark halls and weathering jumpscares and shambling monsters. Your reward for navigating the gauntlet is some terrible shock scene and a sudden awakening into the next.\n\nIt's one of those games that seems to do exactly what it set out to do. Neverending Nightmares does indeed trap you in a seemingly never-ending cycle of wandering halls and avoiding monsters. It just does it in a far more tedious and uninteresting way than your own mind would.","October 22, 2015","false","1.1"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","6"

As a player, my only contribution to this game was holding down the forward key and occasionally tapping enter. There were two points in the whole game where I needed a moment's thought to figure out how to get around a challenge (and it did not require more than a moment's thought). Furthermore, the designer has said that the gameplay is informed by the fact that he wanted to channel his experiences with depression and OCD - he wanted to make even simple tasks like walking a challenge. The problem is that "making it hard to walk" is not a very creative way to channel those experiences - and as a result NN can be extremely tedious. I refuse to believe that there is no way around the creative impasse of making the game feel slow or oppressive and making it boring (the no.1 sin for any form of entertainment).\n\n2) Character - as mentioned above, the creator of this game intended it to be a manifestation of the "real horror" of OCD and depression. I can appreciate why this must be important to him, but the game really makes no effort whatsoever to get the player to invest in the character. The fact that I control Thomas does not "put me in his shoes." If I do not feel invested in the character, his emotions and experiences, unfortunately, really don't mean that much to me. Despite the beautiful art direction, NN is really, really lazy and ineffective at doing something that seems fundamental to what it is trying to do.\n\nLastly, I have to say that this "game" is over-priced. I finished the story for the first time in less than two hours. And with the other endings, I reckon NN really doesn't have more than an extra hour or so's worth of content (though I may be wrong about this - I did not bother to explore the other endings because, as I mentioned above, I did not feel remotely invested in the character or story).\n\nThis game looks beautiful. The art direction has remarkable attention to detail. But the gameplay and writing are just so, so lazy and ineffective. I'm sorry, but I regret giving the devs any money for this. It's an overrated and over-priced piece of beautiful-looking crap.\n\nEDIT:  I played this in my room, in the dark, with headphones, in the early hours of the morning.

Good amount of jumpscares, good amount of doors (you can explore but can't get seriously lost), and nice style overall.\nFairly short game, too.

It's definately not worth the 15 dollar price tag. The developers claim it was based off thier battle with mental illness but all I see is a game filled with the same horror game tropes you've seen ten thousand times before. Even with the horror tropes I would of given this game a thumbs up if it even had a slither of interesting or fun gameplay but the gameplay only constists of walking down hallways and the occasional shifting to the side a little to avoid a monster like you are trying to avoid people in a cramped elevator. If you want a similar game to this that is actually decent and cheaper I'd recommend Year Walk.","August 21, 2015","false","1.3"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","25","38","0","5"

White, black a red is probably most common color palette, but it works absolutely great with this hand drawn style.\n\nStory overall ... i just say, you just want to know more, you want explore further, despite this unsettling feeling inside you.

I think I've done it twice in the last year (both for games that were huge disappointments and nowhere near the level that word of mouth made them out to be [Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and Strider (2014)]).  This will be my third.\n\nI really wanted to like this game; after not being a big fan of Retro/Grade, I decided to give this title a shot for a variety of reasons: the unique artstyle, it's a different genre from his last game, and most importantly, it's "based" off his experience with depression and OCD.  Having experienced both of those illnesses first-hand, I was hoping I could find something to relate to here, something that made me feel like somebody else knew what some of it felt like.\n\nInstead I was treated to a repetitive game with very little gameplay and very little substance.  What little gameplay exists is moving the character from A to B and "investigating" the rooms along the way.  However, the "investigating" consists of looking at pictures or looking at creepy doll faces, for the most part.  Every once in awhile, something interesting will be there for you to examine, but the actual gameplay leaves much to be desired in the vein of exploration and story.  Further holding the gameplay back is the character's glacial walking speed -- and when you use the sprint button you quickly find out that the character must have the worlds worst case of asthma.  I know that this was done to prevent someone from just running through the game, but it hurts more than it helps, especially when you're feeling like you've seen the same hallway 37023 times and you just kind of find out what happens next.\n\nFrom a horror perspective, there were a couple jump scares and a few kind of creepy moments that had me a little on edge, but nothing along the lines of instilling terror into my very soul.  There was a bit in one of the last branches I played through that had my heart racing a little, but again, nothing to really set it apart or make it worthwhile as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThe game does have some good points, even if they're few and far between, but they aren't enough to leave me feeling good about recommending this to anyone.  I thought the voice acting was pretty well done and the artstyle and animation is unique when the looming "darkness" isn't obscuring things.  Other than that, I can't say much else.\n\nOne of my friends recently played through this after backing the Kickstarter campaign because he was a huge fan of the developer's other game Retro/Grade.  He left disappointed as well and said to me that he thought the game would've been better as an animated short or something along those lines.  I can't help but think that this would've been the perfect medium for the story the developer wanted to tell as the most interesting parts of the game are the cutscenes that occurs between some of the chapters.\n\nOverall, I found this game to be a waste of my time.  My OCD did kick in and I made sure I played the entire game and completed 100% of what it had to offer before writing my review... but I cannot in good conscience sit idly by and let people jump into this without so much as a warning.  This is probably the worst game I've played to completion in 2014 and I really feel like I would've been better off spending my money on something else.","September 29, 2014","false","3.5"," 63 of 111 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","63","111","0","0"

The most interaction you get is opening doors. You can walk, run, open doors, look at stuff sometimes and that's all about it.\n\nI don't know if this is intended but the MC will get exhausted very quickly and it sounds like he is having asthma all the time which is getting quite annoying especially in a game where you have to run a lot. The scary events are ok but I mostly got scared by the loud sounds which I find it a little cheap.\n\nI recommend to play this game with the controller. The rumble feature does helps a lot in certain situations. What I find good in this game is that there are 3 different endings and you can choose to play the unlocked nightmares after you beating the game which makes it less tedious to get the other endings. The monster design is also nice and creepy.\n\nThis game is definitely not worth the full price imo but buying this game at sale events would be a good idea if you don't mind walking around most of the time.","August 31, 2015","true","2.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Well, its more of a suggestion.. I guess, hear me out will ya.\n\nWhat I mean to say is that going through multiple times though I stopped very early in my second, is not recommended. Just go for it and take the ending you do get.\n\nHowever, that's if you ignore the rest of what I'm going to say.\n\nNow the real review begins\n\nThis game is not fun. It does create a slightly displeasing environment to be in but as the preamble on the store page suggests, this is about depression.\n\nNow I know that is a touchy subject and before you attack me, I have had my bout with depression. I've taken anti depressants and gone to therapy. So without to much pretension I feel I'm capable of commenting on the subject with some clarity and sensitivity.\n\nIt seems to me that everything here represents some facet of depression while maintaining an over the top hyperbole that goes beyond a simple euphemism. Such as the fact the character walks so very.. very.. slowly and is constantly out of breath. To which I'd say this is more allegory to the crushing weight of the world and simply existing being so overbearing it's difficult to just move you body alone. And narratively speaking this comes across well. But mechanically, we may be reading the same book but we are not on the same page.\n\nThis goes further into the having to repeat rooms (it does checkpoint nice, as the title would suggest you tend to have waking nightmares) because of the monsters that kill you instantly and in ways that are not super pleasant to look at all the time. Why are these monsters are there? Well, it seems the developer wanted it to be open ended as a design choice. I have my story, my ending, my interpretation and that's what I'm sticking with. I do not recommend going back in or really even the first time.\n\nI should mention it's “Not Recommended” because I feel that anything over what 'you the reader' thinks, lets use the idiom, 'a drop in the bucket' is just not worth it at an hour and a half of mediocre content.\n\nNow back to the depression aspect. I don't feel as though this represents MY OWN experience with depression. Its was far more mundane then anything this extravagant. It was more like, why bother getting out of bed, why bother changing/cleaning my clothes, no one would notice. Then you sort of stare blankly at things and watch other people live their lives wondering how they ignored how pointless things were, couldn't they see it? Were they living in a bubble?! And it went on like that for awhile. It still creeps in once and awhile. But I digress. Perhaps I'm way off base and this person did have an experience much closer to what is depicted here. But all that said, this isn't worth the time or money in my own very humble opinion.","October 25, 2015","false","1.5"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourMomsCat/recommended/253330/","YourMomsCat","EverywhereCats","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourMomsCat/","7 products in account","This game is more of an atmospheric horror than a 'jump-scare' horror. There are, maybe, two or three jumpscares. It's slow-paced and repetitive, which, I think, work really well for the game. You pay close attention to all these tiny details, like blinking and shadows, and all the paintings convey all these interesting thoughts. The game makes you wonder "Why is this here?", "What's going on?", "What does this mean?". I spent more time wondering about the enviroments and the events than being afraid, and I'm still trying to connect the dots of the game.\n\nOne thing you're going to notice is that almost all the reviews have a short playthrough time, me included. There isn't a lot to play through. The game is very short. This helps the game stay suspenseful. If you're looking for a game to sink 100's of hours in, this isn't the game for you. You'll want to replay it to acheive all possible endings,  but the replaying time isn't long. The short playthrough time creates a tense feeling for the whole game. It should be added that there are absolutely no loading screens in the game, so you never have any release or rest from the tension.\n\nThe game is also very heavy with symbolism. The paintings, the art, the ages, the enemies, the colors, they all seem to have unique meaning. I found myself sitting in rooms, staring at the windows or the pictures, or hiding from enemies to observe them, trying to figure out what it meant, how it reflected the character.\n\nThe art style is somehow simple and complex. The characters look cartoonish, as does the enviroment, but it still has great detail. A lot of effort went into the design, as everything is hand drawn. Items that you can interact with are colored, like the bronze doorhandles, which is an interesting mechanic that helps negate confusion.\n\nAs for the horror elements, I really didn't find the game scary, but there is a LOT of gore. As previously stated, the enviroment is monochromatic, consisting of just black and white. One exeption to this is the blood, which is red. And, oh boy, there is a lot of red. It's similar to 'The Human Centipede 2' in this way, where in that movie, only the blood had color. This causes the blood to stick out and have a drastic impact on the player. I don't want to spoil anything, but as the game goes on, the amount of blood increases, and you get this feeling of dread, like you don't want to go on, but you want to find the cause. This gives me a tense feeling, but not a scared feeling. Gore has never been a scare factor for me, but it might be for you.\n\nTl;Dr: I wholeheartedly reccomend this game. It's packed with symbolism. It's short, but tense all the way through. It looks beautifuly frightening and sounds amazing. It's not terribly scary, but it's quite immersive.\n","December 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

There's an amount of degradation to every awakening, where things turn gradually worse. To our despair, not even our bed is what it seems to be, in its comforting, homely tension-breaking, turning into a dark, cobwebbed, bloody mess, but in a weird way, still home, still tension-breaking, still a relief. And in short, this – this awareness of nothing having real consequences, much like Bioshock Infinite: a short animation or cutscene depicting your revival/death followed by reanimation –, along with a slew of other things, is what made this game the not so poignant or interesting experience I expected, considering the visual style and premise.\n\nOn the visual style, when zoomed out, and the pixelated low-quality of what's in front of you is not so blatant, it looks rather quaint. The salient reds and colors signifying interactivity is a rather interesting concept, albeit mainly wasted on Kickstarter portraits really serving only to satisfy those backers, and wasting the players time.\nGenerally, the way they construct the different rooms, the scene design, one could call it, was fairly generic. Elaborately: the conveniently dead-eyed dolls all facing the players point of view (this motif in particular, is not scary in overabundance), the flash of the lightning with the dead-looking sister appearing behind you, gutted animals in the forest, portraits blinking, the faceless manikins, generic pleads for God written in blood, these are all generic design-decisions seen in most lowest common denominator horror movies, and it's simply squandering an interesting premise and art-style that could have brought so much more to the table. Although it wasn't all bad, it was interesting to see the dismembered limbs scattered about, thereafter seeing the pile of dismembered bodies, giving it the credence it needed, beyond the surrealistic nature of dreams.\n\nThe level design of endlessly walking through the same corridor, but with a new texture, a new coat of paint, does not excuse it being the same corridor being traversed. I found it incredibly dull and uncreative, it's simply frustrating to be going over the same thing more than once, when in reality it served no purpose. Purposelessness in games is the ultimate disdainful choice a game-creator can make, forcing a player to needlessly – in terms of narrative – do the same thing, and to not give any sort of satisfactory reason or reward for it can really not be in a game, especially not one this short and lacking in substance. There was a sense of enjoyment to every new room explored, but they were seldom seen, and often ultimately pointless. It's immensely disappointing that a game with this much style and potential didn't actually arouse any profound thoughts, or any interesting thoughts at all: springing up from neither art-direction nor narrative, where the chance of creative ideas often resided.\n\nEnemies were introduced in an interesting way, at least the one we come across in the asylum, it was foreshadowed in a fairly obvious jump scare, although still cleverly adumbrated and its function within the game shown by visual design, not by some redundant tutorial pop-up. The gouged out eyes of these adversaries were here the sign of them operating with sound, not vision, such as the other enemy. Furthermore, the AI, rigid as it was, broke the tension by being, well. . . rigid. The encounters you have with these seem more like a puzzle than a fearful enemy capable of horrid acts. It was pattern-solving, not an avoidance of possibilities that could actually spark fear in a person.\n\nLastly, characters that seem aloof, disinterested, without any signs of distress, do they not bring down the agency of the game? If there is no discernible sense of fear or urgency in the person we play, why are we to fear or tense up to what is going on? It's all too static, unbending, and it needs flexibility pertaining to the reactions of the character we play. Not only to see the urgency of agency, but for the empathy and connection one feels with this character. I stress this because without it I feel this emptiness to the whole experience, it's a common theme in many of these lower budget indiegames, and it's understandable, but it's detrimental to this player-game connection that I feel is crucial in a third-person horror game, because how else are we to immerse ourself into this world, when we don't have the simpleness of attaining that connection to the game that a first-person game easily brings (since it removes the “middleman”).\n\nI have no idea if I actually enjoyed this game, a huge part of me didn't, it felt the scares were cheap mostly due to clichés seen in all types of horror. The art-style was creative but nothing else. The narrative was bare-bones and the resolution seemed shallow and predictable. There is nothing in me that wants to re-live this game, I didn't fall in love with any concept or visual, it was just this experience devoid of real substance. It was okay, in the most mundane and frustrating way possible, because it could have been more, but was left unexplored.","September 27, 2014","false","1.8"," 49 of 87 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","49","87","0","0"

Neverending Nightmares does exactly what it says on the tin.\nThat feeling of being trapped... unable to run, loss of breath, darkness closing in. Am I lost? Is someone following me? What's around this next corner.... Oh, I'm falling. Am I awake? This game perfectly captures all of the feelings of being helplessly trapped in an unpleasant slumber. People have criticised a number of things this game has to offer- and thinking through to actual nightmares knocks these points down one by one.\n"He doesn't run fast enough/for long enough!" - That feeling of being chased by the monster in your dream. You run for what seems like an eternity, and yet only travel a few feet, will you get through the door in time?\n"The corridors go on and on and on, it's like a walking simulator!" - Being lost... Trapped in an unfamiliar and eerie environment.... everywhere looks the same, will you ever escape?\n"These enemies aren't scary/have stupid mechanisms" - Sometimes the scariest things of all are the simpler ones. Distorted visions from every day life. The chaser. The follower. The listener. The scraper. The patroller. Each is unpredictable in it's own way on first encounter.\nGoing past all of this- I'll be honest. People like me are the prime audience for a game like this. I am a scaredy cat. I had to get a small amount of help from my boyfriend on one of the parts that was just too creepy for me.... and the rest, I completed by myself. This game had tension, some well placed jumpscares, and a strange broken up story that didn't fit well together- but what does that sound like? A nightmare.\n\nI'd also like to praise this game for the artwork- this game must have had countless hours spent on the artwork alone. It's an interesting scratchy style but those extra details really make the game. Splashes of colour for notable objects. I wasn't a MASSIVE fan of the character design, it looked a little goofy to me compared to the complexity of some of the rest of the artwork in game.\n\nAnother point I should make is how considerate the dev was for helping to achieve the branching story paths- continuing from a level where the story branches places you EXACTLY where you need to be to go about following other paths. You do not have to replay the entire level, let alone the entire game (Which is something some of the negative reviews seemed to think was the case?) In other words, you complete the whole game, and then you can gather up all the extra endings within another half hour or so, by easily being plonked in the right place. How kind :)\n\nAll that said, I recall buying this game on sale. The current price for this game is £10.99 and I'm afraid despite such massive praise from myself I would place the value at somewhere around the £5 mark if you're waiting for the sales. The artwork is surely worth full price- again, beautiful and stunning game that absolutely captures the points and feelings it wants to get across.... but the length and complexity of the game is where it falls short.\n\n7.5/10, Achievements were a nice bonus :)","May 15","true","3.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

A short game could have quite easily been shorter due to lots of pointless fluff.\n- You run and your characters breathing goes unrealistically out of control, it gets annoying fast and detracts from immersion.\n\nVERDICT?\nA part of me wants to experience the two other endings but gameplay is so boring that I will probably won't, thats the games downfall unfortunately.","August 25, 2015","false","2.3"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","17","27","0","0"

From the atmosphere to the background sounds, everything is spot on. You literally feel every ounce of dread the character goes through with every step he takes; with not knowing what's going to happen next. The Alien FX is a nice touch too, even though the character rarely uses the candle, but I guess that's what makes it special. The black/white against the blood red is very effective and pleasing to the eye. The auto save feature is very nice as well, it's almost like they knew where you were going to die. From the creepy dolls following you, to the crazy hatchet murderer chasing you, this game is sure to keep you on your toes. For the best experience I would suggest turning the lights off, put your headphones on and let the Alien FX glow blood red.","January 18, 2015","true","3.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The game is straightforward, following almost endless hallways as you progress deeper and deeper into the nightmare. You can choose a certain chapter of the game if you do not wish to replay it all, to see all 3 endings which are one of the most heart-wrenching endings I have seen in a while. The grotesques fits perfectly and it is just enough to make it dreadful, but not too much to make it cheesy. There is very little of the muscal score, but effects are done masterfully to deepen the feel of horror. As for the story? I cannot write without spoiling it or ruining the mood.

A walking simulator; the game's extremely short length works in its favor as the "gameplay" will feel more and more tedious the longer one plays. Nonetheless the creepy atmosphere made successful by the beautifully detailed art, use of darkness and color, and ambient background soundtrack allow this game to provide an uncommon horror experience.\n\nIt's a shame that the interaction is so minimal. Portraits, for example, are disappointing and meaningless; the majority of which hold no relevance to the game's story.* One cannot help but see lost opportunity to delve deeper into the protagonist's psyche and further expand his backstory, as well as that of his sister, such as through the use of written notes or diary entries, though such would destroy the silent narrative that may have been intended by the developer. However, having unlocked all of the endings and viewing the Final Descent ending, the narrative is perfect, and it's possible that any extra written dialogue would have taken away from the mystery of the conclusion.\n\nThough the atmosphere is what's considered the highlight of the game, the true highlight is the art. The imagery is delightfully creepy and impressively detailed.\n\n*Because they were Kickstarter rewards.","November 26, 2014","true","3.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

What it doesn't have is context.\n\nAnd this is the main problem I am seeing in this game. When it starts, you see impressive visuals and amazing soundtrack by Skyler McGlothin. And it works great - in Neverending Nightmare darkness is scary, not because of what you see or hear, but what you think you see or hear. The game's description tells us that 'a dynamic lighting system gives the ever present darkness a character of its own'. This is spot on. Developers were able to replicate that feeling, when you walk in darkness and start to see silhouettes in your furniture and you feel disturbed.\n\nBut later on it all goes away - when the plot only starts, it is wrapped in mystery, yet as it unravels... wait, it actually doesn't. The plot is weak. And when you have a horror game it is not music or art style , which fuel the plot to make it stronger. It is the other way - the plot gives context to all 'scary' things to make them matter.  Otherwise,  it is just an equivalent  to a person who makes silly faces while jumping out of a corner.\n\nNeverending Nightmares is stated to be 'a psychological horror game inspired by the developer's (Matt Gilgenbach, creative director of Infinitap Games) actual battle with mental illness'. Yet it doesn't feel like it. It indeed has a\ndistinguished feeling of crushing darkness, of somebody watching you from behind, but you can’t base your whole horror game on 'that feeling, when I go to toilet at night and it is kinda creepy'. Mr. Gilgenbach also wrote a novel 'Deconstruction' which dealt with the same personal problems of his. I didn't read it, so I can't say what is the reason behind poor writing in N.N. - technical restrictions or just lack of ability.\n\nContinuing discussing problems within the plot, I want to address the issue of endings.  The game's page on Steam states that 'branching narrative features 3 completely different endings'. And this is true - endings are completely different, I would even say that they have no connection to each other or what we have seen previously in the game. There are symbolic elements which, combined, must give us a complete picture of what was going on, yet when these elements must apply to different meanings, we get a mess. Each ending can point at something which was previously in the game and say 'these things led you to this me'. Yet none of the endings can say that about every plot-element. And when you finish one branch, you start to re-play to get other endings , and you get bored, because they doesn't differ that much in their scenery and gameplay.\n\nBy the way, about gameplay - it is primitive. The only thing you do is just basically go forward and avoid monsters, which becomes boring fast, because these monsters are very easy and one particular type shows too often and basically overstays its welcome.\n\nIn conclusion I want to say that the game doesn't hold up to its great visuals and music. It doesn't have thought put in it and it will leave you disappointed.\n\nCurrently Infinitap Games started a Kickstarter for their new game 'Devastated Dreams'. It already has a demo, so I checked it out and I saw 'Neverending Nightmare 2.0'. It is a polishing of what they did - it seems to be better in terms of setting and gameplay, its visual style has improved even more. Yet I don't have a feeling that they dealt with issues N.N. had, it doesn't feel like a next step. Right now I doubt that I will play D.D, but I hope I will be proven wrong, because there is a lot of talent in the dev-team.\n","August 1, 2015","false","4.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The controls are pretty simple in that you move with the arrow keys, sprint with the shift key (a very limited run as Thomas has asthma), and interact with the world using the enter key. If there are two things that I didn’t like about Neverending Nightmares, it’s that the game was way too short and the endings left too many questions. The latter I can forgive as everything is built around dreaming. And anyone who remembers any dreams that they’ve had know that they can be jumbled messes that make little (if any) sense. And the former is due to the fact that I enjoyed the game so much that I wanted more.

Please use your headphones if you play it\n- Great concept and tons of new things to discover\n- Good "story", if you make sense out of it\n- Multiple endings\n\nCons:\n- Painfully long. It could easily be half as long to get anywhere and you wouldn't miss a thing\n- It can be boring to do the same thing over and over again if you fail to remember what to do some times\n- You character makes One noise when he's tired and you will hear it A LOT, gets a bit odd really quickly\n- Graphis aren't meant for this kind of game, although it works letting you know what to use or where to go\n\nIt's a must if you like atmospheric bizarre games if you get it on a sale, I wouldn't buy it for retail price but if you have the money, then go for it. Just make sure to play it at night, graphics are nowhere near being enough to scare anybody during the day","August 18, 2015","true","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FirstUtterance/recommended/253330/","FirstUtterance","FirstUtterance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FirstUtterance/","571 products in account","I backed this thing on Kickstarter (the $15 tier) and speaking for myself I don't regret it as it was a solid experience and am glad to see that it got made. HOWEVER, speaking for everyone else, be warned that this is a VERY short game. that 1-point-some hours you see there? That was just from one playthrough of this game. From what it looks like there are branching paths leading to other endings (which I suspected since dying at several points led me back to completely different areas), but otherwise in addition to its shortness it is also a very simple game. You can walk, run, and interact, and what interaction there is is minimal and pretty much spelled out for you. Does it have color? Chances are you can either look at it or pick it up (for the most part you can only look at things, which consist of paintings of people we never meet or objects like a bloody meat grinder or a bloody sink with a few teeth, or most anything else with blood). The only real interactive objects you'll find in the game are doors, candles and occasionally an axe (sadly the only use you have for this is to break down a barricaded stairway, no combat for you!).\n\nThere are no actual puzzles to speak of. Mostly it's dodging the game's grotesque display of enemies, however few there are. One enemy is big, dumb and ugly, patrols back and forth and is bypassed by hiding in cabinets rented out from Amnesia as they clumsily stumble by while you walk over to the next cabinet. The other enemy can be annoying, a blind zombie-type thing with enhanced senses in every other area. Unless you are very far away from them, if they sense you, you can't outrun them. It's a matter of walking around them or using distraction tactics (actually only one time you get to take advantage of this) to bypass them when bypassing them otherwise proves impossible. The other kind of enemy is... RUUUUUUN! Axe-wielding crazy, but not just ANY kind of axe-wielding crazy. I won't spoil that bit.\n\nSo the game basically consists of navigating pseudo-labyrinthine environments, some areas with more than one doorway (some leading to just dead end rooms), the environments changing on a whim (well, this is dream logic after all), and admiring the beautiful, pastoral scenery (as confusing as it may look sometimes it's still very linear and not too hard to find your way around). But seriously though, the aesthetics are the game's strong suit, and I'm sure anyone playing wouldn't disagree with that. It's not just the pen-and-ink style but the details and the way they're drawn. Darkness and shadows are conveyed by pen scratches that get increasingly thicker and layered on one another the darker it gets. Color contrasts, though used in an obvious way (whether to tell you which items you can interact with or to tell you BLUUUGGGGHHHD!) look really neat. And the environments in general, with all sorts of creepy objects and decay piled on top of one another and a series of questionable-looking paintings, add up to a real looker of a game that doesn't require a high-end computer to admire.\n\nThe game's story is... uncertain. Like I said, there seems to be multiple endings, and until you reach one such ending throughout the whole game the only thing you can seem to ascertain is you play as someone who's murdered your sister supposedly and are continually haunted by layers on layers of nightmares about this and other terrible, gory things (when your character rips out a vein from your own arm before "waking up" was the one moment I cringed, but then I was reminded of Riki-Oh and relaxed again). Jumping from variations of what is seemingly your home, a large house in the 18th-19th century, to a psych ward, with repeating visual motifs, from dolls, toy soldiers, paintings of people unknown, and, well, stuff you'd find in a psych ward/hospital around the time period (like a tincture of opium and a bottle of cocaine/alcohol mixture! I think this fellow could use some of that here). One picture that seemed "off" is at the very beginning, a portrait you can examine of someone in what looks like a 1970s swinger get-up. It made me question when this game REALLY took place through the whole game from that point on despite their being no other indications besides that. Voice acting, what little there is of it, is adequate, if not extraordinary. The actor for the protagonist does frightened, confused and occasionally grieving OK, and the voice actor for your sister (remember, nightmare land, you're gonna jump around a lot) is given more than a few things to do and pulls off most of those decently as well. Overall though, there's not much to take away from the story besides this mise en abyme of gory, dark and monstrous imagery that relates seemingly to the death of your sister, until, as I said, the very ending, where the dev's attempt to recreate the actual anxiety of OCD and not the Hollywood/common societal definition of it comes into play (at least the ending I got, though I don't doubt the other endings get the same message across).\n\nThey say a horror game's best asset is its sound, and it's no more true here. This has some of the best use of positional sound in an indie horror game I've played, so there are more scares focused on the sounds of approaching footsteps and other noises from the distance reaching ever closer and less from jumpscares (there are a couple of orchestral stingers meets monster-thingy flying across your point of view, none of which I found effective - when Monsieur Axe Murderer started appearing out of nowhere is when I freaked out the most), which is definitely a good thing. The soundtrack is noteworthy too, and while not the best dark ambient I've heard it still works well here. There's your usual droney rumblings and creepy voices to synths that sound like Tangerine Dream gone to hell toward the end.\n\nSo besides the high price to length ratio (or short length to price ratio, I don't know my ratios), what's the biggest problem with this game? I'd say the fact that a lot of the horror depicted here is too familiar and relies heavily on gore for its atmosphere. Blood stains, blood pools, blood blood blood... and the gallons only increase as you move along. Creepy-looking dolls, some with heads with cracks on them, and empty eye sockets? You get those. A decrepit insane asylum with creepy abandoned wheelchairs and general lack of proper sanitation? Check. A dark, spooky gothic mansion? Checkeroo. Speaking of blood, you also get repeated phrases written in scraggly letters on the walls in blood, from "WAKE UP" to "Everything is a lie" and other insightful comments. Dead bodies can be found, sometimes even of other species, and they're not dead in the nice way either!\n\nSo, look, I am unsure of what the dev's actual headspace was when suffering from OCD at its worst. He mentioned that it's often violent and suicidal thoughts. There are moments in the game where a dream ends by you killing yourself, or discovering the dead body of your sister, and those moments are by far the most potent (the vein ripping from earlier I mentioned...). And I admit, despite the use of some overused horror imagery they are done well for the most part. I was expecting it to change up a bit more as I was going, but what we got is still sufficient. And while violent imagery and suicide I can understand being something he'd be suffering from, where some of the more... banal things really part of it? The wheelchairs, dolls and stuff? He has mentioned using elements of other horror games as an inspiration, perhaps to fill in the gaps, you know, Silent Hill, Amnesia, what you'd expect, and these influences definitely stick out, for better or worse.\n\nBut, despite whatever cliches it may fall back on, the anxiety that its title would suggest, is successfully conceived and I do recommend this to horror fans, again with the caveat that it is SHORT. During a Steam sale though, I'd say this is an insta-buy, no doubt.","September 26, 2014","true","3.7"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moronokimi/recommended/253330/","moronokimi","Unstoppable Trash Queen, Moro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moronokimi/","71 products in account",""Neverending Nightmares" is a game that has a lot to offer for some but will fall entirely flat for others.\nIt is at its core a game about mental illness.  Not the hackneyed, insufficient portrayal seen in most media of "insanity" as a flat stereotype.  This is about mental illnesses as they really are.  This means that those who will most appreciate it are those with a mental illness of their own, or who are well-acquainted with someone with it.\n\nThe unusual art style, reminiscent of the work of artist Edward Gorey but with a more sinister bent, lends a uniqueness to the game.  Alternatingly subtle and very unsubtle creepy images saturate it, creating a tense feeling.  Do yourself a favor--play it when everything else around you is quiet, with the lights off.  It won't make you screech in horror and have nightmares, but it will make you nervous and tense the whole time.\n\nThe gameplay is really virtually nonexistant.  You wander through various unsettling areas (gore is abundant and you may find its impact diminishes over time, though this was mostly not the case for me) and the only challenges in most cases are "where do I go next?"  But even more mazelike areas are fairly linear, so when it doubt, just wander everywhere and you will eventually find your way.  There are one or two areas where you must navigate around an enemy which might sometimes be tricky, but overall, the point of this game is not to be challenging.\nThe multiple endings add some replay value and it is not a matter of meeting a lot of fiddly criteria to end up on the correct path--most are contingent on a spare few different actions.  I won't spoil any details but I will say that they might keep you wondering what REALLY happened.\n\nIn conclusion, "Neverending Nightmares" is definitely worth playing for anyone who appreciates a different sort of horror game, but will have vastly more to offer to those with a thorough understanding of mental illness in its many forms.","January 17, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story was well told, but i mean, its SUPER short and the gameplay itself was rather dull. All you did was walk around opening doors, and its very linear.

It's not that you are even being chased and that's where the tension is coming from, the staircases consistently seem to be the safest places in the game, nothing ever happens on them, it just takes SO long for him to get down them and there are SO many! Yes, what I am saying is that by the end of the game what I feared most was the STAIRS! In a game that has a baby monster, an escaped psych patient, a machete wielding girl, spooky dolls, creepy music and well done atmosphere, there was nothing that sent a chill up my spine like coming upon ANOTHER flight.\n\nAgain though this is really a tiny beef its a nice creepy game at a reasonable price with multiple endings.\n8/10 Would learn to fear stairs all over again.","May 11","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It represents mental state of the creator of this game who suffers from OMC syndrome. Every night he has terrible nightmares, he can't sleep and breathe properly and that is FOR REAL. It's actually pretty grim stuff. Makes you think how your mental health is important.\n\nIn any case, this game literally puts you into the head of a person with serious mental issues. The music, graphics and the atmosphere of the game are really creepy. That, plus several well-placed jump-scares, make up the horror part of the game.\nThe strory (if you are brave enough to call it a story) is absurd, but that's kinda the point.\nThe gameplay is kinda repetitive, (mostly it's avoiding the monsters), but requires some thinking. Besides, you can beat the game in a couple of hours, so you won't be able to get bored.\n\nSo that's it. I do recommend "Neverending Nightmares".

A single ending took me about 2-3 hours to achieve.)\n\nI found myself tentative to recommend this at first, as it's a very slow burner that can prove irritating during some of its clumsy chase sequences, but digging deeper and giving it time to sink in has left me with a positive overall impression. It's thoroughly dark and depressing, with no coherent central plot until you start to read into things, and legitimately frightening. The art style is fantastic, though animations are clunky. There are a few different endings to discover, but none of them will take more than a few hours to get to. There's not a lot of game here for full price, but it's solid fare for horror fans.\n\nWhat makes it more interesting is knowing the context behind its development. Created from a dark place, it's an expression of depression and other psychological issues the developer was suffering from at the time. Taken with that in mind, it becomes a deeply personal exploration of someone's troubled mind, and offers an unsettling view of illness that's eye-opening.","September 18, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I bought this game expecting a psychological trip, like, the mind games of Amnesia The Dark Descent, or the experience of emotional tension beside all the survival horror like Silent Hill 2, but instead what I found in Neverending Nightmares is simply every trick we've already seen in the horror genre (be it movie, novel, or video game) amplified with buckets of blood and dark ambient noises to make your time playing this as experientially unpleasant as possible. I understand that in order to be scary, an artist needs to show you something to break comfort zones and unnerve you into paying attention, but here the designers seemed to just overload you with everything that tempts you NOT to pay attention: Good God, I mean, you see some of the most overtly disturbing sights and sounds I've ever found in a game here, all in that Edward Gorey-esque art style, for no insightful meaning other than to promote awareness for mental illness-- as made evident from a message in the credits. While I can see how there are people out there that can enjoy this -- be it for the sociopolitical issue of mental health awareness or the jump-out scares that will surely spawn some funny Let's Play videos-- I cannot recommend this simply due to how uncreative and tasteless the creators' sense of "horror" is.

Neverending Nightmares is relentlessly intense, packed to the brim with subtle scares and leaves you with a feeling of twisted curiosity and deep thinking that most horror games simply don't achieve. This game serves as a testament to focus in a game being crucial to its success (the only controls in this game are movement and an interact key), and with this unwavering dedication to a horror experience it ends up being one of the greatest horror games I've played not just in recent memory, but that I've ever played.

I'd definitely suggest headphones to anyone who does end up playing, because even the sparse soundtrack is great.  It's just great horror, aesthetically.\n\nThe problems begin when you start to learn the games tricks: nothing matters, there aren't puzzles, just walk, if you die you come back very close by.  At that point, I lost interest in the gameplay itself.  A lot of the areas drag on too, and when you start to see the same things over and over and different items rearranged in different rooms, you begin to feel like your time is being wasted and disrespected.  When you walk down the same hall five times before you see anything new, you become frustrated.  It sucks.\n\nI beat the game and tried to go back to try for another ending, and at that point I knew more than just what the game could do, but what it actually WOULD do to me, and all semblance of tension or fun was lost from there, even as I experienced the new content.\n\nIf you're looking for a new type of horror experience and you've got fifteen bucks burning a hole in your pocket, get this, for sure.

I saw it on Kickstarter originally and thought to support it but gave it a pass. The art style is wonderful - kind of a Gorey / Gloom vibe to it. The music is good to adequate. The actual gameplay... well, for the most part, there isn't any. OK, sure, occasionally you'll have to run. Rarely. And you've got awful running ability, being tired out after 6 seconds to stop and rest. And part of my playtime was not realizing a certain enemy couldn't be run from... you're supposed to be quiet, so can't run. But that's it.\n\nOK, so what do you have? Unfortunately, you just walk. Slowly. And walk some more. And walk again. The few places you go are resused over and over, so even seeing what you see is not worth it. There's some scary stuff. Mostly it's a lot of gross out material, like showing different roadkill and saying, "Yup, that's road kill!" Or a doll with 25 different scary facial features each time. There is no game. If you boiled it down to what you can see the first time and interact with you got maybe a half hour of content. But playing takes hours that seems tedious to wait for the pay off... and there's nothing. No explanation, nothing over the top scary, nothing. And then credits roll.\n\nI got this on a huge sale, but I wouldn't pay that price even. This is a free Flash game at best. At the end you'll ask yourself why you spent the time. Don't pay for it on top of that. The art was great. The idea was great. If this was an animated 20 minute short you might watch it and even pay a few bucks.

Eventually all the symbolism clicks into place, all the confused narrative suddenly becomes coherent, and you immediately gain a whole hell of a lot empathy for our poor impotent protagonist. Unfortunately, along the way to that glorious, agonizing trio of endings you have to put up with the game itself, and that's not nearly as enjoyable a prospect as I'd hoped.\n\nIn NN, you play a man named Thomas who wakes up with a start in his bed, only to find as he explores his home that all is not well. The decor is decidedly morbid, the furniture dusty and broken, the house itself in a dangerous state of disrepair. You walk the familiar halls, and then you notice the blood. Drips and drabs, usually, but in places great spatters, and then you see the meat, hear the crying, and then you find Gabbie, except she's dead, a knife in her belly in a clear suicide, but that's not right, you did it, you stabbed her, but that's not right, she's fine, Gabbie's not d\n\nAnd then you wake up, and you get out of bed. But as you explore your home you find that all is not well.\n\nThe concept here is fantastic, and it's executed wonderfully when you first set out. The artwork is the most obvious strength; pretty much every inch of design is dripping with Edward Gorey influence, and who better to illustrate dismembered children than the master? Just as critical is the sound work. While perhaps not so unearthly and unsettling as the audio in the Silent Hill series, NN's whispers and screams can definitely get under one's skin from time to time. I strongly recommend playing with a good set of headphones in the dark, as maintaining atmosphere is critical to enjoying the game... which is sadly something it's really bad at helping you along with.\n\nAs good as the artwork may be, the fine people at Infinitap really, really wanted to hammer home a sense of obsessive-compulsive disorder to go along with the suicidal depression themes. Faithful to that goal, the artwork is recycled to an excruciating degree. The first time you see a maimed toy soldier or cracked doll girl staring at you with dead eyes, you can appreciate it. The hundredth time it happens in a single hour of game play, you're filtering it out. The same goes for the ghastly portraiture, the spider webs, the blood spatters, the intestines... For a good portion of the game, you feel less like you're wandering through a carefully crafted diorama of mental anguish and more like you're stuck in some random number generator's attempt at gore-horror. Eventually the repetition gets the desired effect across, and I applaud the intent here, but until it actually works you're simply annoyed by it all.\n\nOther fumbles are less easily blamed on design philosophy. The gameplay takes a massive chunk out of any sense of immersion for a few reasons. First off, your controls are extremely simple: you can walk around, run for short lengths of time, or examine objects. With such a bare bones control set, the game tries to make you feel like you're actually playing something the only way it knows how: through really bad stealth action. 90% of the game is spent simply traveling further and further into horrible places, but every now and then monsters are thrown at you, and you must bypass them using terribly unoriginal stealth tricks, such as hiding in a closet or timing your movement so you never get close enough to notice. Used in moderation, adversaries could have greatly improved the general sense of anxiety you're supposed to be feeling, but instead they just make you remember that you're playing a video game and this is yet another obstacle to bypass.\n\nExamining your environment is even worse. Any time you find an object you can look closer at, it'll be colored, unlike the all black-and-white background of everything else. Doing so really accomplishes nothing; usually you just see more spookily arranged dolls, unsettling bits of meat, or horribly murdered loved ones, and all of those get caught up in your repetition filter real fast. Every now and then they throw in a sassy jump scare, but those don't contribute too much in the end. On top of that, the game suffers a bit from overzealous Kickstarter Love. Donators who gave above a certain threshold got to have their faces immortalized in game, in the form of large portraits you come across every so often. Initially, I thought these characters would be story-related in some way, family members that were influential on the developer's life or key villains to be discovered down the line. Nope. They're just a bunch of very nice people who gave a lot of money to this man to make a game. And that's fine, that's all well and good, but it tears you even further out of the sense of immersion, and by that point you're noticing the awkward animations, and you're sick of the protagonist's pitiful endurance for running, and you're wondering why you're even playing.\n\nIt took me much longer to finish Neverending Nightmares than I expected it to, simply because it sapped my motivation hard about halfway through. Upon beating it, I only dug up the remaining endings out of some sense of obligation to do so before reviewing it, and I am extremely grateful I did so, even if I needed the help of a walkthrough to find any of the other endings. When all is said and done, NN is a hell of a narrative that gets the sense of a man's agony across quite well, but its many flaws can't be ignored. A stunning last act can win over an ugly crowd, but only until they stop afterwards and think about all the complaints they had along the way and all the pieces that never quite fit. I applaud Infinitap Games for putting this together, and I know a good number of people who might eventually appreciate playing this, but in the end I just can't say the experience added up to a good game.","October 15, 2014","false","7.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

I'm fascinated by the idea of horror games (as the fact that I have a number of horror games on my playlist will attest), but often lack the guts to actually install and play the silly things (as the fact that most of those same games have 0 playtime on them will attest).\n\nGiven that, it was with a bit of apprehension that I loaded up the game this evening.  But I went all in for the experience.  The lights were out, the headphones were on, and I dived in.\n\nAnd I got to say that I enjoyed it.\n\nNeverending Nightmares tells the story of young Thomas, an asthmatic young man whom awakes from a nightmare in which his murders his younger sister, Gabriella.  As the name implies, that is not going to the last time that Thomas wakes up in this game.  Most of the game is spent wandering through a handful of environments, while the tension slowly builds around you.  I’m sure there will be people who decry this as “yet another walking simulator,” as Thomas cannot run for long before having to stop to catch his breath.  This exploration is punctuated by a handful of enemies, and a number of jump scares (I think all but one actually made me jump).  The enemies themselves act more as barriers than as active hunters (with a pretty notable exception), but nothing too aggravating to overcome.  The real draw here is the tense atmosphere.\n\nThe tension is brought in large part by some amazing sound design.  The ambient soundtrack kept me on edge pretty much the entire time.  The enemy tells were also nerve-racking…and while not sound design, I wanted to give a shout out to some great use of controller vibration, using it to as another cue for the enemy’s footsteps.  Even the sound of poor Thomas gasping and wheezing to catch his breath after a full sprint was well done.  It made me feel bad for the poor kid, and I actually stopped sprinting as much because I didn’t want to hear it anymore!\n\nIn the end, Neverending Nightmares is a short game.  I finished my first play through in an hour and a half.  There are a couple a sequences that I missed and intend to go back and play through, but all told I’ll be surprised if a full complete takes more than 2 hours (Update: it took me 2.5 hours to get all endings/branches).  In the past, that has been a major hang up for me.  In this case of Nightmares, however, I don’t mind at all.  I feel that I got my full-pledge value out of what I played.  It's a tight experience that delivers it's narritive and atmosphere, and then ends before it overstays it welcome. And I wouldn’t be surprised if Neverending Nightmares becomes a Halloween tradition for me.\n\nI also feel that the story behind the game is an important one.  The game is the director’s way of trying to express what it was like for him to suffer from depression and OCD.  But don’t worry, this isn’t a “game with a message” where you are beaten over the head with it.  It did cause me to consider what it must be like to suffer from mental illness when, after I played the game, I discovered that some of the more gory/horrific sequences in the game were inspired by intrusive thoughts the director had suffered from (I didn't even know about intrusive thoughts before then, if I am being painfully honest).  If you google 'Neverending Nightmares,' you will get linked to some articles where the director tells his story and his reasons behind the game in more detail than my lame attempt here.  It is well worth looking up.\n\nAll told, I don't regret throwing my money behind Neverending Nightmares at all.  If you like horror games, pick it up.\n\n\nUpdate:\nI managed to reach all the endings.  According to Steam, this took me about 2.5 hours (on timer on Steam said 2, another said 3, so I'll spilt the difference).  I should note that, after I played through blind the first time, I used a guide to find the other two endings, so if you are keen on finding out those for yourself, it might take long.","September 26, 2014","true","3.0"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

The idea seemed quite interesting at the time, but it didn't turn out well. There is/was no horror - some gore and attempts at jump scares. The plot... well, I'm not really sure there is a plot. Apparently there are different endings, but I have no clue how to obtain them. I'm being told I made choices at some point during the game, but I have no idea when, where or how.\n\nThe entire game felt dull, very walking-simulator. I understand this game is supposed to be reflective or symbolic of mental illness, which I can relate to, but if there is some kind of message being communicated, it is completely lost on me.\n\nIt is extremely short, but I have to say if it was significantly longer with no other changes, I probably would never finish it simply out of boredom.\n\nThe pros of the game are the music and the art. The art is very unique and engaging. Some areas of the sounds get annoying at times (your character gets winded from running 10 feet and huffs as if they were a 50-year smoker) but it does communicate the atmosphere well.\n\nI wouldn't overall recommend it, but I also wouldn't write it off.

The art style is amazing and the sound is well done. While not the most scary game, the atmosphere is pretty creepy. While it has a few jump scares, the game doesn't depend on them. This is a game you must play with headphones at night.\n\nThat said, the whole package is really underwhelming. There's no combat in the game and the most you do is dodge the few predictable enemies in each section. If you manage to make a mistake, you restart in a room just before the one you died in. The enemy system is unchallenging and annoying, and rather than help the game, it makes it tedious.\n\nThe game itself is incredibly short, and you can finish the first playthrough in less than one hour and a half. This isn't even rushing through the game, but exploring and examining the locations. Even getting through all the game routes, it'll be hard to go over three hours. I would be able to forgive this if it wasn't for the game biggest mistake: it's really repetitive. The first hour of the game is, as I said before, creepy and atmospheric. Then the game starts recycling assets and themes and the whole experience falls on its face. In the end you'll get one of three endings, and I'm sad to say, they're just disappointing (short, straightforward and not even clever). There's no reason for a game so short to be this repetitive and saying that it was intended to be that way is a terrible excuse.\n\nI mention that the game has a nice style to it, but there are games that do it much better, and for the current price ($15) it isn't really worth getting it.","September 28, 2014","false","2.7"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","2"

The actual scares get very repetitive towards the end as you go through the same rooms and encounter the same enemies over and over and over again. Locations and enemies are unfortunately fairly stock: creepy old mansion, run down asylum, mutilated inmates, living dolls, etc... A few times the enemies actually managed to frighten me, but they were mostly predictable. This game is a fine example of why repetition can ruin horror. All that being said, the audio and visual design save this game from being completely mediocre. The sound in the game reminded me very much of Eternal Darkness, setting the mood of a rapidly shifting nightmare scape very effectively. And the hand drawn, line heavy art style is fantastic.

More reminiscent of Limbo than any of the more conventional horror games I've played, the game creates a dark world with only one objective: keep walking.\n\nThough the third person perspective means that it can't do jump scares as well as most horror games, it nonetheless managed to create a feeling of dread throughout the game by focusing more in the psychological part of the horror genre. The slow building gameplay helps contribute to the dark and introverted feel of the game; though I found it wonderfully refreshing, not all gamers may enjoy what is essentially wandering around a dismal world for half an hour.\n\nThough it suffers from a few minor glitches with the lighting, it never really got in the way of gameplay and the branch-off levels add to the otherwise short game. It gets a little repetitive by the end, and the short environments show its indie background, but it's ultimately worth playing and is infinitely preferable to games like Dead Space which overly rely on jump scares.","September 28, 2014","true","2.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Not only do they make you walk down the same hallways over and over, but you cant run more than five seconds or the character starts to slow down and pant very annoyingly. Its as if they want us to "take in" the game atmosphere by forcing us to slowly waddle through the game.\n\nAfter everything, I am very disappointed in this game. No, I dont regret backing this.

The first half is the most eerie gaming experience I've ever had—despite the abstract artstyle—to the point where I had to shut it off and calm myself down after just 5 minutes. The atmosphere is so well done that the game is worth recommending. Just. The game then changes locale and suddenly swaps out atmosphere for tedious, repetitive scenarios where all you do is elude zombie-type creatures, while you rely mostly on trial-and-error and the frustratingly slow pace of your character, who is exhausted after 5 seconds of sprinting. And then the game is suddenly over— after maybe 1 hour of play. The few interactive items in the game that seemed like maybe pieces to a puzzle, or a secret to unravel (mostly framed portraits) appear to be just things for you to pointlessly look at.\nTo be honest I felt cheated paying what is the equivalent of $17 for this. Grab it during Summer Sale if it's there for like $5 just to experience the remarkably well done opening act, but this game feels like the developer(s) got lazy in a hurry.","September 29, 2014","true","1.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The idea seemed quite interesting at the time, but it didn't turn out well. There is/was no horror - some gore and attempts at jump scares. The plot... well, I'm not really sure there is a plot. Apparently there are different endings, but I have no clue how to obtain them. I'm being told I made choices at some point during the game, but I have no idea when, where or how.\n\nThe entire game felt dull, very walking-simulator. I understand this game is supposed to be reflective or symbolic of mental illness, which I can relate to, but if there is some kind of message being communicated, it is completely lost on me.\n\nIt is extremely short, but I have to say if it was significantly longer with no other changes, I probably would never finish it simply out of boredom.\n\nThe pros of the game are the music and the art. The art is very unique and engaging. Some areas of the sounds get annoying at times (your character gets winded from running 10 feet and huffs as if they were a 50-year smoker) but it does communicate the atmosphere well.\n\nI wouldn't overall recommend it, but I also wouldn't write it off. If you are a overall fan of this style/genre, it's good to kill a couple hours at a cheap price.","September 27, 2014","false","1.4"," 28 of 56 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","28","56","0","0"

The art style is amazing and the sound is well done. While not the most scary game, the atmosphere is pretty creepy. While it has a few jump scares, the game doesn't depend on them. This is a game you must play with headphones at night.\n\nThat said, the whole package is really underwhelming. There's no combat in the game and the most you do is dodge the few predictable enemies in each section. If you manage to make a mistake, you restart in a room just before the one you died in. The enemy system is unchallenging and annoying, and rather than help the game, it makes it tedious.\n\nThe game itself is incredibly short, and you can finish the first playthrough in less than one hour and a half. This isn't even rushing through the game, but exploring and examining the locations. Even getting through all the game routes, it'll be hard to go over three hours. I would be able to forgive this if it wasn't for the game biggest mistake: it's really repetitive. The first hour of the game is, as I said before, creepy and atmospheric. Then the game starts recycling assets and themes and the whole experience falls on its face. In the end you'll get one of three endings, and I'm sad to say, they're just disappointing (short, straightforward and not even clever). There's no reason for a game so short to be this repetitive and saying that it was intended to be that way is a terrible excuse.\n\nI mention that the game has a nice style to it, but there are games that do it much better, and for the current price ($15) it isn't really worth getting it.","September 28, 2014","false","2.7"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","2"

I was really excited when I saw the art style and the demo. But the demo was good as a demo, not 1.5 hours of game play. Nothing happens in this game. the story is very weak, and the game play can only be described as plodding. Also the price tag is ridiculous. I understand they didn't want to make it less expensive than what kickstarter backers had to pay, but in that case, make the game better or longer or something. The creator argued that good gameplay trumps game length, and I would agree if the gameplay was solid. But in this game it is not. As others have stated, maybe buy this during the Steam Sales, but otherwise you money can be better spent elsewhere.","September 29, 2014","false","2.4"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

In addition to chapter selection, the game also allows you to see which paths are still left to unlock. For achievement hunters, this is especially handy.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily recommend buying this for the full price. For a short, relatively linear game, I don't believe it's worth $16.

The actual scares get very repetitive towards the end as you go through the same rooms and encounter the same enemies over and over and over again. Locations and enemies are unfortunately fairly stock: creepy old mansion, run down asylum, mutilated inmates, living dolls, etc... A few times the enemies actually managed to frighten me, but they were mostly predictable. This game is a fine example of why repetition can ruin horror. All that being said, the audio and visual design save this game from being completely mediocre. The sound in the game reminded me very much of Eternal Darkness, setting the mood of a rapidly shifting nightmare scape very effectively. And the hand drawn, line heavy art style is fantastic.

I, personally, don't care for game+ type of scenarios or running through alternate endings and such which might be something to consider also. With that said I beat the game in 92 minutes and I can say that my overall experience was pretty good.\n\nOn the plus side, the sound is notably magnificent. I really like how the directional queues in the audio contributed to the overall awareness of your impending doom. It goes without saying that sound plays a major role in any scary game or game that wants to immerse you. Equally noteworthy is the art style. You may or may not like the hand-drawn aesthetic, but I like it, though it is worth noting the entire game is rendered this way. There are also a lot of explorable areas along the way to take in the detail if you're in the mood to appreciate the labor that has been put into the artwork.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the repetition. You will get winded after the first 30 minutes when, despite the inclusion of a few evil creatures, you realize the mechanics are a bit shallow. You look at things that have color, you push the shift key to run from creatures, and you try not to walk into the possessed inmates. That is the challenge in a nut shell, though it shouldn't take away from the real goal of delivering an enjoyable story which you can read all about in the game's description (it is pretty accurate).\n\nNeverending Nightmares is a trip, no doubt about it. The game would be a great way to kill an hour or two if not indulged upon in short bites.

In the hour and a half it took to get through the game I kept hoping for Anything mildly interesting to happen, but in the end I just felt like I had wasted my time.\n\nYou play through a series of nightmares that all consist of walking through corridor upon corridor in such groundbreaking and refreshing settings as ~an old, abandoned house~, ~a psychiatric hospital~, and ~a graveyard~. I expected there to be some absurdity, maybe some surreal looking areas - these are nightmares after all - but there was hardly any to be found.\nOccassionally you will come across monsters that you have to get past to get to the next boring corridor. Some you need to hide from, some are blind but will attack if they hear you, etc. Pretty standard horror game mechanics, nothing new here either.\n\nNow, I could live with the boring gameplay and paint-by-the-numbers horror elements if only the game had an interesting story to tell, but even the story is about as trite and clichéd as they come. In the description it says the game was inspired by the creator's struggles with depression and OCD, but I didn't see anything that gave me any insight into what it was like to deal with that.\nI say this as someone who's struggling with mental illness myself, and am a little dissapointed that you'd use that as a selling point for something that only ever comes across as yet another horror story about some guy fighting monsters in a surreal alternate world because of a traumatic family incident. It never feels personal at all, it just falls flat.\n\nAlso, apparently the game has multiple endnings, but it gives you no reason to want to replay it, so I don't know what the point of that even is.\n\nIf you want to play a game where it feels like you're fighting mentall illness, play Knock Knock. If you want to play a game with a similar quirky children's book style, play Fran Bow. Both are much better horror games.","April 27","false","1.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

The use of colour is excellent and I have a weakness for eerie whispers. Later in the game the sparse and occasional blood spatters begin to become the usual décor which loses the promise it once had of violence and horrors.\n\nAs for the pacing, we play as a sickly child who can ran for about 5 seconds before he must take a break to wheeze desperately and collect himself. When he isn't breathlessly fumbling along, he staggers at a snails pace. The enemies and threats this game provides feel no more forboding than a slightly deformed picture of a kitten. Interacting with them does not cause fear, but rather it brings the already slow pace to a crawl.\n\nI found myself wanting it to be over but it kept dragging on. The jump scares were predictable and over all it was an unsurprising and tedious experience. I respect the personal nature of this game, and I think it's absolutely awesome for the devolper to use the medium for expression, but as a game, I don't recommend it.

Why do I not recommend this game?\nTL;DR: It is too expensive for the amound of time spent, mostly walking in one Direction with the occasional change of direction. And it isn't scary. At all.\n\nI have played it trough once, and I guess I will play the other endings too, sometime.\n\nFirst, the positive aspects:\nI like the gamestyle, it is something different.\nBut what kept me playing was the question, whats going on.\nThe Sound and Athmosphere were also really great. The game rarely scared me, but I was often on edge: "What happens next", "If I go there I bet something tries to jump trough the window", and so on. But only for the first 20minutes or so. Then the Cons shoiwed.\n\nCons:\nThe "monsters" - They really don't add a lot to the game, they seemed more like a puzzle to me than a scare, because they really arent scary. They are really, really dumb.\nThe Level Design. Soooo much to walk around! If I had not been hooked by "whats going on here" I would have quit.\nBecause at least 60% of the game consisted of walking "Right". 30% have been walking "Up", "Down" and "Left". the last 10% where interacting with things, mostly Paintings I still dont get the hang of, what they added to the game, I really have no clue,\n\nNot certain if positive or negative: I was almost never really scared. At the beginning there was a lot of anticipation and some really nice scares, building up atmosphere. But after that, it felt as if nothing was happening anymore. And I am one fellow who is easily scared.

Ok, so the art is great, it's very atmospheric and it has some really creepy moments. But you simply can't sell at this price a game that you can complete in an hour. Yes, it has alternate endings, but it means that you are going to have to play the whole game again, a game that is already very repetitive, only to watch another ending but without any new playable experiences.\nThe game has literally three different kind of hazards and like another three puzzles and that is it.\nAnd let me tell you, what is up with that part with the boy in the woods? it seem only there to annoy the player, the boy can't run for more than like five seconds and even running he is incredibly slow, and they make you run through an endless wood chasing your sister.\nAnd by the way, all that thing that the developers have been telling about the game being  based on the real experiences of someone who have experienced mental illness, so convenient that his condition involve a mental hospital, a creepy house, and all the oldest horror clichés.\nShame on you Infinitap Games.\n\nFinal impressions:\n\nOk, so now I've completed the hundred per cent and played through all of what the game has to offer, you can check my profile to see that it's true, and that I have spent only three hours to accomplish this, considering that I have had to play to some segments more than once.\nHere is my conclusion, the game is extremely short and the sceneries and situations are used again and again. Many times, there is not even anything to do, only walk through hallways and hallways, entering rooms that have nothing inside and wait for the jump scares to appear.\nThe game has a few really good moments, but really keep you waiting for more to come, something that gives sense to the whole experience that never comes. The game suffers from a lack of content, especially considering the price.\nI feel very disappointed, because this game had huge possibilities.","September 28, 2014","false","3.2"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

The art style of Edward Gorey incorperated into the game was amazing... it did a good job of setting an atmosphere... beyond that, not much else to say.\n\nYou're not really solving a mystery or finding clues, it just seems like a random assortment of common fears: babies, dolls, bears (??), isolation, heavy breathing creepos...etc.  Mazes of sorts for each level drag out gameplay way longer than it has to be.  Not in a scary way of being lost, just kind of boring way of "guhh are we there yet, Thomas??".  The different endings was a plus, but there wasn't much of a narrative of what was actually happening.\n\nI didn't get any achievements for getting said endings OR completing the "veins" in which the endings appear.

His dark, gothic style of cartooning has delighted the Victorian in people for years.\n\nNow Neverending Nightmares takes his style and makes a game out of it, and just like Goreys style, in this game there are no good endings.\n\nThe controls are basic and functional and don't get in the way of the game... The art, which is THE reason to play this game doesn't quite ring true to Gorey but is very effective in getting the hopless sense of fear and desperation out of the game and into the player.  Only black and white is allowed in the pallette, with occasional visits from other colors... particulary red.  A simple mask of blakc lines over the front of the screen gives the omnipresent drearyness  a real sense of depression.  When a color does pop up the players eyes are immediatly drawn to it.\n\nThe music fits very well, sound samples are played repeatedly with changes in frequency giving the body of the song rather than pitches or notes.  Whether is a twisted lullaby, or the screams of a lunatic in an asylum every part of this game screams at the player "Doom!  Death!  Hoplessness! Despair!" while using a the voice of a soft whisper.\n\nIf you love dark things, Victorian novels, or are a fan of E.

There isn't a lot of variety and the game is pretty linear but does give you branching paths near the end which can change up the narrative.

Intrusive thoughts are these crazy thoughts that your mind comes up with for the sole purpose of upsetting you. In my case, I've struggled with thoughts of violent self-harm. I've actually re-created some of my visions in the game like pulling the vein out of my arm or tearing out an arm bone.\nWhat's powerful about games is that they give us the opportunity to experience things we normally can't.

It's all presented in an Edward Gorey-like artstyle, that also brings to mind the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Even more intriguing than it's artstyle is the absolutely fantastic sound design which consantly keeps the player tense for the horrors to come. Is this the scariest horror game I've ever played? Well, no. But like the best games in the psychological horror genre it focuses on being thoroughly unsettling throughout - a feeling that intensifies upon reflecting on the real life mental struggles that inspired it.\n\nCommon complaints target the game's short length and the lack of player interaction - but to me these miss the point. The game should be judged by the emotional journey it takes the player through, not by some commercial formula of "X hours of gameplay for Y amount of money". To me this is a great game, and the few complaints I do have - i.e. some of the character animations, lip-syncing - are likely to be addressed through updates, and don't detract from the raw human emotion and pain conveyed through the experience.\n\nTwo thumbs up.","September 29, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'm going to remain as unbiased as possible during this review, but it's more likely that not that I'll have a LITTLE bit more buy-in than others and this might taint my opinion.\n\nI originally backed this project because I loved the art style as well as the commitment towards building something that didn't rely completely on jumpscares (I'm looking at you, Amnesia, Outlast, etc.). I'm seeing a lot of people saying that the ambience "doesn't build to anything". That it's too short and too linear.\n\nWhile I'll say that they're completely correct, it was the journey, not the destination. I thoroughly enjoyed the art style as it's used to great effect. As someone who grew up with "In a Dark, Dark Room", this nailed the look. The added frosting was the sound direction, which is nothing short of amazing. Pants turn to gasps. Gasps turn to wheezing. Wheezing gives way to helplessness. Music sets the tone of neverending dread.\n\nSome could argue that the cost doesn't justify the experience, but I disagree. I believe my Kickstarter funds went towards the exact game that was delivered. I don't regret backing this project one bit. I could complain about using the "psych ward" cliche as a means to deliver narrative, or that there was no real skill involved with beating the game, but that's not the purpose of the game. It's not here to make you reevaluate your life; it's here to be a nice, scary haunted house. A short ride that reminds you why you like scary things to begin with.\n\nIt's good. Is it $15 good? I would say so, but I'm a lone voice. If you're looking for the next Amnesia, or you're looking for something you can play over and over again for long durations, move along. If you're looking for a nice experience of dread and can part with your $15, you could certainly do much worse.","September 29, 2014","true","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonbash/recommended/253330/","jonbash","Jon Bash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonbash/","131 products in account","Let me get the general ruling out of the way first: this is a great game from a new and promising voice in the indie horror game scene. It tries new things and often does things by its own rules, and it does this effectively, while also following in the footsteps of tried and true horror classics. It's not for everyone, but fans of personal, artistic, exploratory games as well as fans of atmospheric horror games (as opposed to action/survival-based horror) should buy, enjoy, and support it.\n\nThat said, the game is not without its flaws, and a number of them have to do with pacing.\n\nHallways sometimes seem to go on a touch too long without much happening. It's a strange feeling, getting *bored* by a horror game. Luckily, several times I thought maybe I was started to get bored, something terrifically terrifying would happen and put my ♥♥♥ right back on the edge of my seat where it belonged. Perhaps these moments would not have been as effective without the moments of calm, but I feel that the game would have been *more*, not less, effective if a few of the rooms or hallways would have been cut.\n\nThat's not to say that all of the "pointless" rooms should be cut. It's kind of wonderful to be walking down what seems like a cookie-cutter hallway, enter a side-room, and find some new, unexpected, grotesque scene that, while serving no clear ludic function, ramps up the chills significantly and sinisterly.\n\nBy the end of the game, though, the player will likely become a little desensitized to blood and guts intended to convey scenes of horror. At the beginning, the bright sight of red blood against the beautifully pencilled black and white is a shock and reminds us that not all is well in this mansion. By the end of the game, there seems to be more red than white at times, and it becomes just another part of the macabre scenery.\n\nDon't get me wrong, though; throughout the game, the gore is often used to wonderful effect, throwing guts in our face when we least expect it. While I'm not usually a fan of cheap jump-scares, this game does have a few, and they don't at all feel cheap. In fact, I think each and every one was greatly executed.\n\nThe art, overall, is quite nice. The way the seemingly-hand-drawn shadows scribbled their way over the light is a very cool effect and works well in the nightmarish context. The set-pieces and enemies in particular have frightening designs, especially as the game descends deeper into madness.\n\nOne enemy, though, just wasn't particularly scary or fun to deal with. Luckily it doesn't show up very often, but a few of its behaviors seemed to be a bit out of place with the rest of the games. While another, later enemy hit the sense of adolescent terror just right, this one was more obnoxious and almost silly. Other than the one, though, the enemies overall were extremely effective from both a gameplay and horror perspective.\n\nThe sound design and music are quite lovely, if you can call it that... aside from a few background ambience that sounds like someone doing an impression of a tortured Droopy Dog. I appreciated the way the music would evolve over the course of the different nightmares and a "new" nightmare's beginning would be indicated by a shift in the music as much as the narrative.\n\nThe endings (the two of three that I've played, at least), while narratively intriguing in their own rights, seem to happen just a tad too quickly and feel like they lack the weight I think they deserve. With this kind of short game I don't feel necessarily like *closure* is what's needed, but the credits seemed to start rolling quite quickly and suddenly, as if someone came into a movie theatre after the last words had been spoken and hurried the audience out so they could make room for the next group or something. That said, I like that the endings don't necessarily agree with each other. They all come from the same background, but come to different conclusions of varying depth that indicate what's **really** going on here, and I think that was a smart and cool decision.\n\nOverall, there's a lot to praise in this game. It's at its best when it embraces nightmarish weirdness to try to throw the player off track, changing placement of rooms and playing with expectations. The lead developer, Matt Gilgenbach, has referenced *Metal Gear Solid* and *Silent Hill* as influences, and in this way they both shine through, but without becoming overbearing. If there's an ultimate takeaway, it should be that this game is a unique experience that I highly recommend. Also, supporting this game means supporting future titles from the developer, and personally I'm *very* excited to see what Gilgenbach and Infinitap does next.","September 29, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Missing either of the latter two will cause you to lose a good 50% of the atmosphere.  Great for Edward Gorey fans.\n\nThe game could have been more, and one enemy in particular adds an obnoxious game mechanic which is initially clever and then very tedious.  It also fails to provide any really satisfying endings.\n\nYour enjoyment of Neverinding Nightmares will largely depend on what you look for in a horror game.  Thankfully Slendy -- who showed up in the demo -- is removed from the final version.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who enjoys being creeped out, this does a pretty good job.  This isn't a game played for depth, but it does an excellent job with providing a unique experience your first time through.  If the art style doesn't do much for you, chances are the rest of the game won't.  If you enjoy Creepypasta however, this might be up your alley.\n\nWarning for those squeamish about blood and gore: some paths are pretty nasty from an imagery standpoint.\n\nIs it worth the price tag?

I intentionally avoided playing the betas, but I did play the kickstarter demo.\n\nI found this game very interesting as it it clearly focused on the creep and scare factor.  There were only a few spots that took some some more serious "gamer attention" to get past.  I actually enjoyed how when I made it past a part, it was not going to have to be repeated if I failed the next.\n\nThere are some very thoughtful aspects to the game.  It was rather calculated in making the player feel safe at certain stages of play only to turn it upside later for a scare.  I feel there was a lot of effort on this aspect as there are plenty of "walk through parts" which were part of building suspense.\n\nThe art style is what drew me to the game initially, as it is not a naturally scary style in the first place.  Hence it is a real challenge to make it scary.   However, I will say that the musical score is absolutely spot on and adds a tremendous amount to the game.\n\nMy main con for the game is that it could be longer.\n\nI would recommend this game.  In fact I have, but unfortunately it was too scary for all of them.","September 29, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

For the past two years at PAX, this game has managed to catch my eye, even through the massive sensory overload brought on by the myriad of other games screaming for attention.  Suffice to say, it has been on my radar for a while.\n\nDid it live up to my expectations?  Mostly.  The real strength of the game is its ambiance.  It absolutely must be played alone in a dark room, headphones cranked, with controller vibrations enabled.  The creepy music and sound effects blend smoothly with the visuals, first creating a sense of unease, which gradually ramps up to dread with a dash of "oh holy ♥♥♥♥ing hell that's disgusting."  The jump scares are definitely a big part of it, but far-between enough that they don't lose their effectiveness.\n\nBut back to my original point--it's really not much of a game.\n\nI'm not sure what I was expecting.  Having played the demo, I suppose I thought it was going to be a puzzler.  Explore hallway, find candle.  Explore dark hallway, find axe.  Open blocked path, continue.  And on, and on.  I was kind of hoping for a horror-themed Myst.\n\nInstead, you will spend the vast majority of your playtime creeping slowly through a (more or less) linear path, building tension for the next gruesome cutscene.   Objects that you can interact with are sparse, which is disappointing in such richly detailed environments.  It made it all the more confusing when there were special "interactable" gold-framed portraits scattered throughout the game.  It took me a while to realize that these weren't some sort of puzzle element, but rather rewards for people who contributed a certain amount to the kickstarter.\n\nIn short, this is interactive artwork, depicting a spiraling descent into madness inspired by the developer's own struggle with mental illness.  As a game, it's not exactly what I had thought it would be, but it was an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.","September 29, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

At first glance, this game could easily be dismissed as not scary.  It certaintly doesn't look like a lot of the modern horror games.\n\nDo not let quick impressions fool you, this game is a wonderfully creepy, scary and just disturbing game.\n\nThis is definetly a game to play with headphones if you can, the sound design is amazing.  Not only is there a mix of unsettling music, there is also plenty of background sounds that really start to get to you the longer you play.\n\nThis is also a game to play in big chunks, the more breaks you take, the more the atmosphere is broken.  If possible, try and play through to a finished path in one sitting.\n\nI've currently gotten all three endings and I won't share any of the details here.\n\nOne of the strengths of this game is there is very little to interact with.  Too often horror games have you working on finding puzzle clues or weapons or health items.  This game you are limited what you can interact with.  The lack of busy work really helps draw you into the surroundings, and you'll find things in areas you thought weren't scary yet, slowly starting to disturb you greatly.\n\nIt also makes what you CAN interact with, and see more clearly, have that much more impact.\n\nYes, there are a few moments of jump scares, but this game is a lot more about the nature of being trapped in this nightmare, where you keep thinking you're waking up and escaping, and you're not.\n\nYes, I was one of the late backers after this game was fully funded and started to play when the Beta was available.  That doesn't make my review or praise for this game any less.  Hell it was seeing the Let's Play that made me want to help be a backer and be a part of this game.\n\nThis game has many moments where the sudden disturbing imagery made me turn away, though nothing in the realm of going too far.  Honestly some moments in this game reminded me of nightmares I've had myself, which only added to how emersed I was.\n\nAlso, do not seek a strategy guide, you'll figure out all the branches eventually.  Let youself find them alone, it's a much better story that way.\n\nIt took me a few times through some areas to figure out how to get the different branch, which helped the game feel very worth the price.\n\nIf you like to be scared by more than gore and things jumping out at you, this is game is definetly worth a try.","September 30, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Seriously, all you do in this game is walk, very slowly I might add, and trigger jump scares. The devs added the capability to run but your character can't run more than 10 sec so I guess he's asthmatic.\n\nThis game is clearly a personal message from the dev on something happening in his life but that's all it should be, a message, write in a journal and don't make games dude. This is hardly a game but more of a short story and it's not told very well either. I'm glad I got this in a Humble Bundle because I'd be furious if I spent $15 bucks on this.

There was nothing creepy about the forest walking scene because I was so frustrated at how long it took to get through WAY TOO MUCH WALKING and how busy the artwork was.\n-Boring story. I get the story, I understand it, it was just boring. The characters weren't interesting and the endings were dull.\n-TOO MUCH WALKING! Unless I can get something added to the story or some intersting scenes from walking away from the main objective then don't let me walk there. Out of all the cells you could peek into, only one did anything, and that was a very predictable jump scare. If exploration doesn't do anything then stop letting us explore. As a player I expect to find something when I go somewhere, but in this game you don't see anything unless you go towards the main objectives. It's like having a game where the very last room out of 100 has a boss fight but the game lets you enter all other rooms 1-99 but they are empty.

Gore and dolls can be scary, but you kind of drowned the game in them to the point where they no longer have meaning.\n\nThe plot consists of a few 5-10 second long spoken bits which includes the endings. I get that the developer wanted to leave things ambiguous and let the player draw their own conclusions, but the fact that there is no lore to collect and no narrative whatsoever means the player has literally no reason to move through the game.\n\nI wish the developers had put the same amount of effort into making a gripping narrative or lore notes to collect (they're a horror game staple for a reason) or any reason at all to drive players to continue pushing their character down those hallways as they did dressing up the endless, empty rooms with an insane level of detail (sadly most of which is same-y gore and dolls).\n\nThis game would be hard to recommend as a free flash game.

Your character has asthma, so can run in only EXTREMELY short bursts. This is not developed or particularly meaningful in a story context, so it honestly feels like a ploy by the developer to make you uncomfortable. You don't want to run ever because what if you need it when an enemy appears??\n\nIt's an interesting premise, and it works well....for 10 minutes. After that point you know when the "horror" will appear. You are no longer engrossed in the atmosphere and the grotesque art. You are simply walking. And that walking lasts a LONG time. It feels as if the developer believed that uncertainty as to the incoming danger would last throughout the whole 2-3 hour experience. It does not, and as a result, the tediousness of walking and never running just bothered me, quite frankly. Was the art phenomenal? Yes! Was the game enjoyable? I suppose for a bit.

I was originally going to complain a little about this game, at ~$15 it became more expensive than going to a movie. One of the things I appreciate most about video games is from a time vs. money investment usually they make up for their higher price. A first run through of this game took me about 90 minutes. Making this slightly more expensive than a movie. But then as I looked around the menus I discovered there are multiple endings and paths you can take. Giving the game some replayability and making it now worth more than a movie. I'm not sure if you could see the multiple paths before you beat the game the first time (I didn't check) hence the spoiler notice before. So yeah, all in all a really good little game. I'm excited to see what else the team comes up with.\n\n-Bors","September 29, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I was really looking forward to playing this game, and the creater seems like he really worked hard and wanted to make something people loved, but sadly there is just nothing here.  I feel bad for him because based on his Kickstarter updates, he comes off as very insecure about his work and this probably wont help.\n\nThe game consists of walking around aimlessly, usually around the same area many times until the game decides to let you advance. The environment changes the more you walk around and eventually a staircase opens up to let you to the next area. The idea being you're losing your grip on reality I'm assuming, but it's just horribly boring and not scary at all. Other than it's awesome pen and paper art style it has nothing to offer.

Cuz this game would get a "probably not" from me.\n\nThis game is decent, but it's just not good enough for me to recommend it to people.  I'm not going to bother going over what the game is about since you can see it from the trailers and description in Steam.\n\nSo the pros:\n\n* Very interesting art style.  I actually thought it was very neat.\n* Some pretty effective freak-out moments (this will also be in the cons; it'll be explained)\n* Interesting progression.\n* Pretty interesting base story, though the reveal was a bit anti climactic.\n\nCons\n\n* Repetitive.  I get it's supposed to be, but it started to get to me a little bit because of the next point\n* Thomas is the most out of shape, slowest person ever.   He has two modes.  Walk (where he walks slowly) and "Run" (where he looks like he's running but he's walking at slightly faster than our normal walking speed).  Not only that, but if you "run" even just one step, Thomas starts breathing heavily.  Look at your bedroom right now.  Imagine running from one side to the other.  Thomas will take 5x longer than you and he'll be out of breath.  This is what makes it repetitive.  Because you have to go through very similar rooms over and over you want to get thru them fast if there's nothing interesting in them.  But he walks so slowly and gets out of breath so quickly it gets annoying.\n* Not only that, but apparently running even just one step is like the loudest thing ever.  Like I'm running in a long hallway because it's a long hallway and all of the sudden I hear a noise and the blind crazy dudes come running out of no where and pounces on me to kill me.  Great.  The way this SHOULD be done is if you run and the crazy dude is on screen at all they should make a noise and run in your direction.  If you stop, they should stop and look around unless you're with in a certain distance from them.  But no, they can not be anywhere on screen and if you run a single step, they'll come a'runnin'.\n* There was one part of the game where it was actually impossible.  I died about 15x because they blocked off the entire hallway except one small area.  They had a blind crazy man patrol the area.  He started where it was blocked off and ended where it was blocked off.  After about 15 deaths, the guy finally spawned in the place where I think he was supposed to (he wasn't patrolling the bottleneck anymore).\n* The big babies were fairly absurd.  In Amnesia and Outlast if you try to hide while the guy is right next to you, they obviously know where you are and will grab you.  In this game, you can jump into a cabinet while the guy is right next to you and they'll get confused.  Really?\n* Many of the scares are of the "jump scare" persuasion.  That means sudden image accompanied by a loud noise.  Yes, it makes you jump, but IMO it's a very cheap way of getting a scare.","December 21, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I'm going to go into full spoiler detail here so if you for some reason still want this 'game' then stop reading and understand it's your own fault for making such a poor choice with you money.\n\nNow spoiler alert, the game is walking to te end of a hallway several times in which if you see a door above you don't wory that's either an empty room or just a checkpoint room. Now you might ask what do you need checkpoints for? The insta kill enemies (which there are only three kinds of) which are all just a slight variation on the oh so amazing gameplay stratgey of walking around them slowly. I say walking because the dev team decieded to not just remove the run feature but cripple it to the point that I would suggest just never using it. There's no punishment for not running either, it's just how long you want to waste walking through halls with nothing to see. Also any 'scares' the team added were something you were thinking about an hour before they did it. Oh look some windows I hope nothing appears while I'm walki-Oh hello jumpscare good to see you again FOR EVERY SINGLE WINDOW I WALK PAST. The story is nill, you get the impression your sister died when you were young and you're stricken with grief because you promised to keep her safe and that makes you crazy or whatever so you're locked up in a looney bin. I can't stress this enough that there is no game here, the first minute of gameplay is repeated without change until you finish the game. I've played games free flash games with more anything really. Also I'm sorry but the visual style isn't nearly as cool as they thought it was, it turns any scene into a laughable mess.\n\nTL;DR This isn't a game, and you shouldn't waste your money on it.\n\n","March 8, 2015","false","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunently thats where the good points end.\n\nYou know how most games have distingushing features in their levels and streamline the design so that the player knows where they are in the level design and don't constantly wander back and forth wondering if they're going the right way towards the next object that will progress the plot? Well, this game doesnt, and because of the constant reused assets I kept wondering whether I was going the right way or whether I had inadvertantly backtracked and needed to reverse my course.\n\nIn itself that would only be a moderate annoyance, but theres also the issue that the levels have way to much *nothing* in them. Out of the time I spent in the first area, I estimate only about 10% had an event in it, either a scare or a monster or something to do, the rest just being padding going from one room to another.\n\nAnd when stuff does happen, its not well balanced. In the second area, I wound up having to get from one scene to another without being caught by zombies, but there was no way to tell where the zombies were in the screen other than trial and error, there was no way to lose the zombies if they did spot me due to how slow my character ran, and even if I did know where they were sneaking around them was nearly impossible due to how small the areas were, so I would constantly get caught, die, get sent back to the last checkpoint, repeat ad nausium.\n\nHonestly, this is one of the worst indie games I have bought and played.

Davidson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/R_C_Davidson/","111 products in account","This is an interesting game that provides some chilling moments during play.  The story of Thomas Smith, while simple, pretty much makes you think a little, maybe even make your own conspiracy theories.  Both the atmosphere and the sounds give you a chill, and I'm impressed that the game manages to spook you without the use of the over-used jump scare.  There are a few problems, though.  You can finish one of the story modes in no time, I say about 45 minutes to a hour tops, so you might complete the whole game, if not collect all four achievements, with 4-5 hours.  Also, whatever enemies there are in the game aren't the scariest things ever.  You can easily get past them with the most obvious way possible.  Only thing that could make getting past the enemies more obvious was to put in neon signs, and the ones that chase you will give you at least a little bit of a problem.  That being said though, the reason why people play horror games is to get scared, and in that regard, I think it does a good job.  If you're looking for cheap jump scares, like most indie horror games do unfortunately, then this is not the game for you.  Otherwise, this is a game worth experiencing, though the length might effect how much it's worth.","October 5, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While the graphical style is very interesting, what moved me most was the extremely creepy (and intensifying) music as well as the excellent sound assets. However, there is something you definitely need to know: The game is short. Even with branching paths the game only takes a few hours to finish. And it must be said that there is relatively little replayability once all the branches have been unlocked and all the levels played. In light of that, the price point might be an issue for you, so you might want to wait for a sale if you don't mind the wait. However, it's less of an issue if you think of it like a movie in the cinema. A couple hours worth of entertainment for a few bucks, but I can certainly understand if you want to wait for the DVD release to keep the metaphor going. If you pick it up, though, make sure to get the full cinematic experience: Darkened room and headphones. Use a gamepad with rumble if you have it for smoother controls and more feedback. Overall a very enjoyable if short ride.","October 11, 2014","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A game with a distinctive art style (black & white ink drawings), really good sound design (particularly for a 2D game), and minimal UI (non-existant, really).\n\nNot a "pleasant" or "fun", game, you play as a nightmare-plagued protagonist repeatedly woken from one nightmare, only to discover that he is still experiencing it. Cleverly, this scenario is not just a feature of the game's story, but also serves to progress the game through it's levels, as well as functioning as a checkpoint system if and when you succumb to the game's infrequent hazards.\n\nWhile I can't say that I "enjoyed" this game (horror isn't a genre I generally seek out), it was certainly a worthwhile experience. I'd recommend it to people who either enjoy horror, or are interested in playing "personal" games (games that are strongly influenced by the creator's life experience).\n\nMy biggest complaint would is one that can be leveled at nearly every horror game—when faced with an enemy or situation that results in repeated failure, a previously frightening experience ceases to be so through a) repetition, and b) a changed mindset (when the player switches from being immersed in the experience to looking at the game analytically, in an attempt to overcome the progress-blocking obstacle). It only happened to me at one point in the game, and I was able to re-immerse myself in the horror experience later on, but I was never as scared as I had been prior to that point.","October 11, 2014","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You play as Thomas, seemingly forever stuck in a perpetual nightmare/sleep state. He dreams in black and white, he dreams of death and murder. Creepy broken dolls lay strewn within the walls of his home. He dreams of monochrome tombstones and blood stained asylum walls. But...is he really dreaming? The game forces us to accept dread, fear and vulnerability. Thomas cannot wield weapons, he can't fight. All he (or you) can do is survive.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are very straighforward. Directions, sprint and an interact button. That is all. But do not take this simplicity for inadequacy. The game is very unsettling. The scares are very well crafted and will make you think before making your next move. There are equal parts subtle and obvious scares. Neverending Nightmares is an exercise in psychological horror, throwing you in between worlds and catching you off guard in the process. Cheap jumscares are a thing of the past and Neverending Nightmare gets my vote for progressive horror gaming.\n\nIf you're looking for a different kind of horror, the kind of horror that is deep rooted within your subconscious, then this is the game for you. My only regret? Not playing this in online mode, so now I have no achievements. But that's ok because in my opinion Neverending Nightmare has a high replay value and three different endings to keep you entertained (and afraid).\n\nIf you'd like to see my take on this brilliant game, go here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNfGiLomjks&list=PLAiqVOZlx0AhavAEyxjX5XANGj_54ydvq","October 15, 2014","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm sure those familiar with atmospheric horror games, like Silent Hill will find shared ground with Neverending Nightmares.\nNeverending Nightmares is about the mind of Thomas and his love for his sister, Gabrielle. In nightmares, or as I'd call this more a night-terror, people who are close to us tend to take the brute of the darkness. This "Edward Gorey" styled game is all about immersing yourself inside this bleak nightmare and the sound makes a huge part of that, so headphones is recommended (and turn off the lights and play it by yourself for more intense effects). As the nightmare continues, you make choices that can alter where the horror takes you. For better or worse, the choice is yours to make. And don't worry, if you thought that nothing was after you in this game, you are sorely mistaken. I won't divulge exactly WHAT is coming for you, but use your imagination. But I do warn the faint of heart, there are cringing moments and disturbing scenes, not quite on par with Saw, but gets close with its self mutliations and morbid topics like suicide.\nIf you're not paranoid, jumpy, tense, nervous when playing this game, you're probably playing it wrong or it's not your cup of tea.\n\nNow that those remarks are done. My thoughts. I must say wait for a sale on this game, in my opinion, for as little content as there is in this, it's not worth the $15 price tag. Cut off $5 and I think that would be reasonable. The game offers very little as far as replayability, so if you like your Amnesia custom stories, might want to look elsewhere. I've spent almost 90-120 minutes on this game and I've completed everything. Granted, I've been a little spoiled and I was playing it wrong for much of that time. Which is why I say to savor this and play it like you WANT to be scared. Creeping along dark hallways with nothing but a candle to keep you away from the shadows and unerving sounds makes a very tense and slow moving pace. Afraid that if you run, you might run into something you won't be able to escape or hear coming over your own breathing and footsteps. This game sets a great atmosphere for those willing to take the steps and immerse themselves into it. If you feel like you're lost, just keep walking. The labyrinth of the mind is very easy to get turned around in, so just keep pressing on and you'll head in the right direction in this game.\n\nClosing remarks, the game is great for those willing to dive into the atmosphere. For those requiring more action and jumpscares, look elsewhere. Bring the price to $10 and I'd definitely recommend buying it. Perhaps if they added in some other endings, this game could have some more replayability.","October 12, 2014","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The sound design is excellent, with competent voice acting, the ambient sound, effects, and music do wonders for instilling a creepy vibe throughout the experience.

Perhaps I expected too much. I know from the post-release emails begging for good reviews that this isn't what developer Matt Gilgenbach (who clearly tried really hard and cares deeply about the game, to his credit) wants to see, but I feel it's my duty to provide an honest review to combat the frankly ridiculous amount of hype.\n\nAs others have said, this barely qualifies as a game for starters. I'm not against "experiences" and "digital novels" (I enjoyed Dear Esther, even), but this just doesn't feel like anything. I even disagree with the positive comments about there being decent tension and creepiness - it's a disappointing mess of cliches: creepy dolls? Check. Random dead stuff? Check. Horror movie-style insane asylum? Check. And seriously, for a game allegedly about mental illness, was that last one really in the best taste?\n\nThe story is practically non-existent. Just when I thought it might be getting started, it ended. I honestly had to check to make sure it wasn't some weird bug. It really feels like the devs ran out of time.\n\nThe thing that piqued my interest in this game though, the sole reason I backed it, was that it's supposed to be about mental illness. As someone with a long history of mental illness myself, I was excited to see a more believable, more intelligent treatment of the subject. Boy was I disappointed. In all honesty, I see nothing relating to mental illness in this game besides the lazy cliches you find in pretty much every horror title (see above).\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the art direction is about the only thing this game gets right. As others have said, the black and white, hand-drawn style is fantastic. But there's no way it's worth anything close to the asking price.\n\nSorry, Matt. I really, really wanted to like Neverending Nightmares, but it just doesn't deliver. I don't regret backing it, but I can't recommend it either.","December 20, 2014","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A psychological horror game inspired by the experiences of a man suffering from his own very personal, genuine psychological horror? Count me in. As both a lover of horror and as someone who is fascinated by what makes other people tick, this game seemed a sure-fire hit (to me).\n\nDoes is succeed? Sort of. I'm giving this a thumbs-up because I feel emotionally attached to it as both a backer and a horror enthusiast, but I can't say I wasn't a bit let down.\n\nThere is very little gameplay to speak of - minor stealth sections are fine, but they grow repetitive quickly. I don't want to write this off as a walking simulator, because 1) I hate that term, and 2) I love walking simulators (Dear Esther, to me, is a stunning work of art). However, there just isn't all that much to this game. Keep walking right. Look at another portrait. Go into another empty room. Wake up in a different bed. Walk right again. Meh.\n\nThe best part is the atmosphere. The soundscape is truly stunning. Play this game with headphones, please. I've haven't heard audio this precise and well-designed since the original Thief games. And the visual style is simply gorgeous.\n\nI love thte idea of multiple endings, but slogging through the same corridors three times again to find them all was too much.\n\nBuy it, play once for the phenomenal atmosphere and a few good scares, but don't expect too much from it.\n\n","November 13, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its subtly creeepy, so little so that you can actually play this alone in the house, but at the same time, so much so that you'd wish someone was hugging you while you played.  While there are jumpscares scattered, its not very much and most of the times, the thing to suffice spooking you would be the atmosphere. Which may get old after a while.\n\nThe storyline on the other hand.\n\nFrom the start, you don't learn much about what the eff is going on. All you know is that your Thomas, and your supposed to just walk walk walk. and find out things. It does sort of draw you in, but I should say that the two endings I've experienced so far were quite a let down. They were effective, short, and they made sense, but, it still was a letdown.\n\nGameplay itself is repetitive, you're just walking and there are a set number of "enemies" which you mostly avoid in two ways. Setting of scenes mostly follow the nightmare you happen to be playing. It's sort of otherwordly, but not otherwordly enough such that you'd be staring at the art with awe. (Im guessing Silent Hill would be where the art makes you stare like woah wtf) But the cutscenes really make yu go woah wtf (because seriously... wtf is going on) and some of the scenes (related to the jumpscares) do make you go WTF as well.\n\nWould I reccomend you to buy it?

Gameplay wise I have mixed feelings. 90% of the entire world in the game is noninteractable (Basically you cannot examine or do anything with most things) so you’re mostly just walking and walking and walking until you find the next scripted event that will progress you to the next part. That can actually get a little dull mainly because you’re stuck with a very very slow walk. You can run but you run out of breath ridiculously quick making me think this dude has asthma or something. So basically you’re kinda forced to go through this game rather slow. Perhaps this was intentional. Maybe the developer wanted us to play the game at a slower pace. But for me I kinda caught early on that there was going to be lots of periods where there are no threats at all.\n\nClearly this game’s intention is to be more of an experience than like a typical “game” although there are some sections where you have hiding mechanics and stealth mechanics. I’d say I’d like if this game had like written files to pick up and read but I think they’d rather you try and piece things together on your own rather than having the game write it out for you.\n\nOverall I say the developer probably accomplished exactly what he wanted. Which was for the player to experience a vague unclear story for them to try and interpret. The game is pretty much the right length too so it doesn’t overstay it’s welcome or last tooooo short. I still kinda question it’s selling price but…\n\nBut anyway. Yeah. Good ♥♥♥♥. Would like to see him continue game development for years to come including after Devestated Dreams.","December 6, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nothing about it feels good, the endings are bittersweet at best, and only if you don't take in everything and don't complete the game. Altogether it tells a horrifying story, not so much scary as that of someone suffering from extreme trauma and mental instability in a nightmarish dream world. Nothing about this game feels good, as such I must recommend it.\n\nThe endings may seem contradictory, but taken altogether, they actually paint a little bit more of a horrifying story. Insomuch that my own interpretation is that Thomas had lost a sister to suicide in his early life, then later in life after struggling to move on from that had lost his daughter at a similar age, reigniting the trauma from before and causing him to fall into a deep and inescapable depression. I suspect others will have different interprepations.","December 7, 2015","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The atmospheric build up managed to easily cross the line from a slow burn to intensely boring. I usually have very good patience for walking simulators and non-combat games but this pushed that way too far.\n\nAnd even when the game does get going, all you have to look forward to are monster encounters that rely on extremely simple stealth mechanics. Then the encounters get harder and harder, as if the developer forgot they weren’t making a Platform game. Nothing kills a horror game faster than obvious game mechanics and dying over and over and over.\n\nWorst of all, there are no new ideas here besides the art-style. Hunted house, creepy asylum, scary little girls. It’s like someone took a book of incredibly lazy horror tropes and made a game out of it. It even has the bald creepy baby heads all over the place, like it copied it’s homework from Alice: Madness Returns.\n\nThe story is told just vaguely enough that my curiosity didn’t even kick in. if there’s some twist at the end of this game I can’t be bothered to find out because the rest of it doesn’t drop any clues.","September 26, 2014","false","1.0"," 24 of 50 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","24","50","0","1"

The problem is that instead of atmospheric horror that ♥♥♥♥s with you, Neverending Nigtmares has three different enemy types thaat you just have to sneak past with the same method everytime. Once you know how to get past the enemy, it's simple. It's not a scary game at all, squandering its potential by having to sneak past the same monsters room after room.

And, Ironically while I did indeed get both of those things I got nothing else. The gameplay is nearly non existent except for avoiding some very easy to avoid enemies (which is sad considering that the enemies are visually well designed and scary/disturbing) and walking from empty room to empty room which becomes exasperating as you learn that all of the rooms are basically copied and pasted over and over and over again. Puzzles are nearly non-existent and unless you have severe brain damage chances are you wont have to think very hard about any of them.\n\nStoryline is probably one of the weakest in any horror game I have played which was dissapointing considering I went through the trouble of getting all the endings because I thought that they may have all been connected only to find that they were not. The game starts with this whole little sister motif that could have been interesting only to derail into completely unrealated stuff about your wife depending on how you played the game and then no matter what ending your going for it just sort of ends suddenly with a ending that had zero build up.\n\nIt even comes complete with a "IT WUS ALL A DREAM!!!" ending which made me slightly angry at the laziness of it all.\n\nI dont get why this game is rated so highly, its not deep or well written, its not a good horror game, and its boring besides a couple choice moments.","October 11, 2014","false","3.0"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

Some games are merry-go-rounds.  This game is a dark ride.  It doesn't try to be anything else; it completely surrounds you with its atmosphere and takes you to another world, and like the best dark rides, that other world will haunt you long after you get off.\n\nI would put this game firmly in the "art game" category, and so immediately some people are going to be turned off.  It's not a terribly long or challenging game.  It will only take a few hours to play through it, and it won't take much longer to get all the endings.  There are enemies and it is possible to die, but the enemy encounters are very simplistically set up and the penalty for dying is a relatively tiny slap on the wrist.  There aren't any puzzles, and the game holds its cards very close to its chest in regards to story.\n\nHowever, this game isn't about that.  It was designed entirely around the experience of playing it, and it is an experience that you're not going to forget any time soon.  The hand-drawn graphics are striking, the music and sound design are excellent, and some of the unsettling, disturbing, and violent (and oh, man, this game is violent) imagery will probably haunt me for the rest of my life.  It's paced very well to maintain a constant, rising tension, and the short length ensures it doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nThe controls and interface are incredibly simple.  You move with the cursor keys or WASD, there's an interact button and a run button.  And that's it.  There's no inventory, no puzzles to solve, no health or resources to manage; you just walk around and look, progressing further and further along the linear path ahead of you.  What is truly remarkable is despite how simplistic it is, and how little challenge the game offers, the accessibility still doesn't come at the cost of atmosphere, which is amazing and suffocating at times.  The major theme throughout the whole game is mental illness, which, despite the scariness and the gore, doesn't feel exploitative at all.  It's approached in an very understated and tasteful way, and I think anyone who has ever had some kind of mental illness will immediately be able to connect with the player character, Thomas.\n\nIf I had to make any real criticisms about the game, I would say that the endings come a bit abruptly and I would have liked to see more variety in the enemies.\n\nOverall, I wholeheartedly recommend you buy this game, especially if you're looking for a good horror game for Halloween.  It's a stunning, unique, and simply horrifying little game that, despite its brief length, you'll be thinking about long after you step away from your computer.  And besides, we need more quality horror titles like this; so play it and support the tiny indie studio that made it!","September 26, 2014","true","78.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klaimen/recommended/253330/","klaimen","Klaimen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klaimen/","2737 products in account","I played through Neverending Nightmares for the first time last night. My Steam record says I played it for 1.7 hours (I didn't take a break). So, indeed, the game is rather on the short side. Still, it managed to capture me and I was focused on the nightmares 100% all the time. The gameplay is simplistic: Walk around with WASD/Analog stick, interact with Space/A button, sprint with Shift/B button. There is no actual puzzle solving, the focus is set on exploration and finding your way around. As the character is weak, he is unable to fight and has to flee/hide from enemies. Also, he can sprint only for a short time, eventually stopping to get some air - fleeing has to be well planned. This gameplay "limitation" reminded me a lot of the original Silent Hill games, where protagonists got worse at combat and having to breathe after running around for a long time.\n\nThe presentation is rather unique. I believe most of the nightmares are supposed to take place in a castle of the 19. century, and the hand-drawn sketchy art style helps you time travelling into this nightmare world of the past. Lots of details help you navigate through the castle, but also disorientate you on purpose, by shifting corridors and rooms and replacing wall paintings, wardrobes and such. While the game starts almost fully black & white with a minor amount of colored objects (those you can interact with), the amount of disturbing elements (blood, body parts) increases in time. The pacing in this buildup has been done really well, in my opinion. There are jump scare moments, but they are anything but cheap, they rather support the already uneasy atmosphere. The character and enemy design is convincing enough, though I wish there were more of both kinds.\n\nAs stated already, I recognize a lot of inspiration taken from the Silent Hill series - such as the character entering holes and staircases going deep down multiple times, but there are more examples. Neverending Nightmares is a great way of telling nightmare stories. While it doesn't involve much action and interaction, the scariness comes from your imagination, as you start to recognize how this believable world slowly turns into a true nightmare!\n\nI would recommend the game to people who don't put their focus on action/combat, but rather atmosphere and exploration. If uncertain about this, maybe wait for the game to go on sale!","September 28, 2014","true","3.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

There are some jump scares but they are few and far between. Areas are large and exploration requires a fair amount of endurance. This combinded with an increasingly oppressive atmosphere really create a kind of horror that you don't often see in games. I rarely felt frightened, more disquieted. It's a slow burn that builds up over time as you feel more and more out of control, a feeling aided by the modest control set.\n\nI will say, for people who dislike a "less is more" design philosphy, Neverending Nightmares can leave something to be desired. In spite of how quickly the game can be completed, there are segmets that seem to stretch endlessly. Combined with the reuse of art assets this can break the tension and create dull moments. A player expecing more direct engagement or variety could be disappointed.\n\nThat said, I feel like these are intentional design choice. The game is crafted to express the thoughts and experiences of the lead developer's struggles with mental illness, specifically depression and OCD. Much of the explorative gameplay feels as though it pushes you to look at everything and leave no path unobserved. For my part, this evenually left me somewhat inured to the shock value of the esclating horrors while me general unease persisted. It was a very interesting experience and left me with plenty to mull over after the game's conclution. Regardless of any shortcomings, I feel that the style and vision expressed in Neverending Nightmares makes for a completely worthwhile experience.","September 27, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Lots of cool ideas. Love the graphics. The audio is awesome. But I ended up liking the whole a lot less than I hoped I would.\n\nAs a game it fails for me. Except jump scares (ok, there's a couple of nice ones) it wasn't scary to me. Creepy? Sure. The audio is the element working best at being oppressive and unnerving. Having no clear goal is a problem, that leaves exploration. But the levels are so empty that it wasn't fulfilling. There are no puzzles per say, you just progress in a rather straight line and double back when you find a dead (no pun intended) end. There are very few interactive elements, and a lot of those a rather bland, like many family portraits that are never of any use or reference to anything as far as I can tell. There are a couple of ennemies to dodge or run from, and if you die to them you'll restart in a nearby bed and do it again, or maybe it'll be one of the few story related ones and it'll make the 'story' 'progress' which inside of a level is basically redoing close to the same thing, but with slightly more messed up decoration and little less light.\n\nI do get the link to depression. Helplessness, repetition, little control over things.. As a statement I can appreciate it. As a game, it is just that: repetition. Maybe having my own battles with depression makes all of this a bit more mundane to me, I don't know.\n\nIt is also just too slow for me.. Between wondering what could be the next jump scare and the slooooooooooow walking pace of the character, I found my mind drifting away, bored. Single elements, graphically, are really well done, but with so much repetition in tone, it becomes too samey to be scary to me.\n\nSo. Is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really, either !! It is a cool thing expressing Matt's experiences, but I don't think it is a great game as is. I do wish for such things to exist, and I did pledge towards Matt's second title's KS (and would again if a 2nd attempt is made). If you're reading this still, you're probably curious and open enough to want to give it a shot, and to such people I would absolutely recommend a try. If you found this almost at random and are looking for a game-game, this is a harder sell to say the least, unless you're really easily unsettled and scared by disturbing imagery.","September 4, 2015","false","3.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

They're my particular favorite when it comes to pouched drinks, on top of others like Capri Sun. While they may not be as healthy as the others (but then, none of them are particularly healthy, really), I've found that Kool-Aid Jammers have a stronger flavor than the other brands, and don't have that watered down feeling that some of the others have. My personal favorite flavor is Cherry, and it's usually the only flavor I buy - there used to be a Cherry Limeade flavor that was better, but they seem to have stopped selling those. Kool-Aid Jammers might not be the best drink you could get, but they're good, fast drinks for when you want something with a stronger taste than water but want something more hydrating than a soda, with the convenience of a pouch meaning you don't have to take a lot of time away from your game to grab one.\n\nThe reason I'm talking about Kool-Aid Jammers instead of Neverending Nightmares is two-fold; not only did my Kool-Aid Jammer outlast the game, but I also found it more interesting. Nevending Nightmares is a game that puts up a nice face in terms of atmosphere and art and sound design, but quickly falls apart when you actually play it. The game is, as the title implies, about a character experiencing neverending nightmares. You wake up in your bed, walk through one of three environments, and at the end something kills you and you wake up in the next nightmare. This goes on for about one hour (for a game called Neverending Nightmares, it sure does end pretty quickly), and then the game ends. Every now and then it'll bring in mechanics familiar to horror game fans, like a monster that you have to hide in a closet to avoid or an enemy that you can't sprint by, but these are few and far between and the enemies are so basic that it doesn't even feel like an effort to avoid them, let alone anything that might make you feel nervous around them. The only reason I even know what they do when they catch you is because each of them do it at least once in the scripted next-level death. The art style is unique, and the audio is well-designed to boost the atmosphere (though the special "headphones" sound option it encourages you to use seemed more like it was meant for bad headphones than ones more suited for gaming, and on my Gamescom 780 it just pushed all the sound to the front speakers of the headphones instead of giving a good surround experience), but so much of your time spent in the game is spent just walking past almost identical rooms over and over until you finally stumble upon the thing that kills you, and it's just not very entertaining. I'm not saying I want some PewDiePie youtube fodder game full of jump scares, but it's just hard to stay invested in a game with this little substance.\n\nThere are apparently three additional levels that I missed leading to two different endings (though I have no idea what I did to "choose" the path I ended up on, since there isn't really anything in terms of dialogue or obvious story), but after seeing how long and tedious the final nightmare in my branch was I really just didn't care enough to see the others. I really wanted to like this game, but in the end I just found it extremely repetitive, and while some games make good use of down time to build up the atmosphere for a payoff, this game just feels like nothing but down time, leading to an unsatisfying conclusion that just leaves you wondering what the point was. Neverending Nightmares currently costs $15. A 10-count box of Cherry Kool-Aid Jammers costs $1.88.

Lets find out.\n\nFirstly, the "game" is drawing "inspiration" from Matt Gilgenbach (lead designer) struggle with OCD and depression.\nSecondly, its hardly, what you can call a game. I like such "games" that arent just copycats etc - that are somehow a bit unique - what we have with NN its definitely very very unique - also its not a "game" you encounter any days.\nSo, those are definitely pluses for NN.\n\nBut does this suffice, to make it of any game worth playing?\n\nLets start with the gameplay. I played it with the 360 controller. Works pretty well - didnt try the keyboard, yet.\nYou steer your character (a.k.a. Matt Giglenbach?) with the left analog stick, and buttons are used only minimal, RT to run and A (or was it x?) to interact with your surrounding. Nothing else special to mention, about this.\nThis works definitely. Problem is, there arent many things to interact - and most are just un-useful pictures or disgusting, deranged, sick scenes in close up - only rarely you have to pick up a candle ot an axe.\n\nThen the running (RT) is just so utter useless - because, somehow "Matty" (I will refer to the character as "Matty") can only take bout 5 steps running, before he runs out of stamina - then he stops running, and starts choking.....so two reasons for this: Either he smokes 3 pack of cigarettes per day or he is an allergic asthmatic.....??!\n\nThis is not the worst - NO - because the game is  so damn slow paced - you somehow get provoked to run through the always same backgrounds (yes they are all the same, with some re arranged interior etc - but if you saw one, you saw them all (3 themes Asylum, creepy house, Woods with Cemetery) so this is still not the worst, NO for some reason "Matty" makes this "sighs" and breathes heavily when you use the run button - so this is so annoying, one want to turn off the sounds, because it really is uber annoying.\n\nSo, you are able to control "matty", but there isnt much more in the game. There are about 3 types of "enemies" - and since Outlast, you have to hide, too, in a cabinet (I hope not all horror games are that much of a copycat) - and thats about it. Nothing else. really its just a boring walking simulator.\n\nThe visuals are kinda great (thats the reason why i bought it...) I love the dark, gritty stlye of the game. There isnt much to complain about it, except that the bg getting repetitive - and there are perhaps a bit too much of brutal, deranged, sick disturbing images (and again copycat here: since Madworld etc, its an art stlye, make a game in B/W and leave the blood as...well blood.....) - but as mentioned, the artsyle is great, but since its all that bloody etc, you have seen it all, after two screenshots.\n\nSounds and Music are okay, i guess. Except the flaws with "Matty", stated before.\n\nSo, I have no clue about depression or OCD (at least, i am not aware of) but I doubt, one sees all days such disturbing ♥♥♥♥, as "Matty" does - also, there is some kind of strange sexual thing in it (incest - but I dont wanna say so, if its not true - but marrying your sister........well.....i'm no Freud......so i cant judge this.)\n\nThe Verdict:\nGreat visuals in a disturbing sick - not understandable way told - i think there is some sort of story, but one can hardly find it. Useless Walking simulator, that wants to be a "game", but did just fail, to make this experience a decent one, also failed, to tell us about depression & OCD - heck, it failed in every way - as a horror game too, so it does nothing good at all - except that it teaches us, to make a bit of research before one buys such heap of crap. Also tell me, what happens, if anybody tries making games.....no offense......sorry Matt.\n\nSorry, I really wanted to like this........but I cant........","May 14","false","2.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Instead, the game begins immediately, and without any GUI to distance you from the action, you being your neverending nightmare...\n\nThe graphics and atmosphere are very unique, and the hand-drawn nature of the game really helps establish a surreal setting that only increases in horror and intrigue as you progress.  The audio is integral to the experience, and pulls you in even further to this cacophony of mind-bending, psychological distortion of an adventure.\n\nHaving said that, the length is bad not because it's too short, but that it feels like there's so much more story and setting to explore.

Players walk the labyrinthine halls & rooms of a decaying house. What are you looking for? How do you get out? It's not clear. The house alters each time you traverse it. A dead-end path now opens onto hallways. Nothing is stable. Nothing is trustworthy. The game repeats environmental elements to inspire OCD thought patterns. Did you try that door already? Better try it again. Each successive nightmare journey through the house reveals more of the PC's story—and more of his psychological landscape. Play it at night with the headphones on & you'll get the shivers.  I personally find this game scarier than the PT demo.\n","October 4, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The added sharpness of the visuals and having headphones available on my PC makes it an even more enjoyable experience, but both are quite impressive.\n\nAfter about an hour of playing, I have to say that I am very impressed so far.  The game creates a wonderful level of tension and gradually builds up the story and atmosphere.  The noises and visuals blend well together to create a unique and wonderfully tense experience, which can lead you to get started are even panicy at times, as you race to avoid especially troubling encounters.\n\nThis is definitely one of those rare games that makes you realize that it is very possible to transcend from a "gaming experience" into a true form of art.  I highly recommend it, especially to fans of horror in any of its forms.","September 29, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The art style is nice with the dark, detailed, hand drawn style but the over use of bright red blood negated the impact for me as it made it seem overly childish. The music and sound effects are excellent especially they way the sound effect subtly herald the approach of an enemy. The music together with the visuals create a great atmosphere that reminded me of the good silent hill games in places. The story is disappointing it starts of with mysterious hints as to what is going on but never really develops. I suppose they had to keep it vague to get it to fit in with each of the different endings but it just felt like it was going nowhere then suddenly an ending happened. The main problem is that this game mostly involves slowly walking through very similar corridors until something happens causing you to wake up and repeat the process. howlongtobeat.com suggested this game would take 1.5 – 2 hours to complete so I started this game with the intention of playing the whole game in one session but after an hour or so I was too bored to carry on. On another occasion after dying and waking up I took a wrong turn and inadvertently started heading off in the wrong direction, because the levels are so repetitive I did not realise this until I had got all the way back to the very beginning of the section. I guess the repeated similar environments were supposed to give the impression of being trapped and heighten the sense of horror but in the end it was just boring.","October 8, 2015","false","4.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I really did. And I tried my best to fully immerse myself in its dark atmosphere, playing with headphones, taking it slowly and all. It worked well for a few minutes, but then...the game ended. After less than two hours, it was over. And the ending was abrupt, weak and somewhat inconsistent. There are multiple endings, yes, but they are simply determined by which path you (blindly) choose in the last few sections, there are no big puzzles or significant choices to make during the course of the game. And seeing all of the three endings doesn't really make things better. They make everything confusing and nonsensical at first, they become clearer after putting a bit of thought into them, but still you are left with a sense of something missing.\n\nNeverending Nightmares is not an awful experience to endure, on the contrary it is filled with undeniable inspiration, but as it is it's a totally rushed and incomplete work. And that saddens me a lot, because it's a terrible waste to see a title with such a beautiful, deeply unsetting visual design and so much narrative potential fail to deliver something up to the expectations. It would have taken so little to make this game really beautiful and worth playing that I really cannot condone the way it's been presented. And it's just a terrible pity.

It doesn't rely on jumpscares or even the fear of a jumpscare; instead it build's a creepy and disturbing atmosphere through sound design and the effective shaded 2D art-style, which makes blood really stand out. The game follows Thomas, a man seemly stuck in a world of his own making and your task is to somehow escape. The game plays off imagery of depression and suicide to build a world where we, as the player, are not only afraid but also sympathise with Thomas' plight. The story thread about Gabby is contradictory and often leaves you wondering who this women/girl actually is, with different areas of the game offering different explaination.\n\nMy one complaint is that a lot of the same enemies and enviroments are used far too often and the game is FAR too short (i completed the beta in about an hour). But I would still recommend for horror fans!","September 27, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I finished the game as well as to find all the endings, all in 3 hours (It was meant to be 2 on mine but it was actually 3 hours because I started from the middle of the game itself sometimes). Would I recommend it? With some hesistation, yes. Wait for a discount would be better.\n\nNevertheless, the game brings out a different horror genre itself. Other games scares you with well planned jump scares. This game however, makes you uncomfortable to the core and adds mental stress to you at times, which should be a psychological horror genre game. The atmosphere can be pretty scary and freaky too.\n\nThe art style of this game is inspired/ originated from Edward Gorey, which gives a distinct style as if everything is drawn out with ink. The intensity of black horizontal lines are the marks of bright and dark areas. The game has only black and white unless there are objects that you can interact with or there is blood (red).\n\nThe level design is great and because of the art and colour style, the players do understand what can be interacted without the help of a tutorial though the enemies do take time to figure about on how to avoid them.\n\nThe sounds are really aiding with the atmosphere as well. It's distorted, the music is weird and is out of place and makes you more uncomfortable. If you play the game, be sure to wear a headphone. They have made it so that the experience is more immerse with headphones.\n\nThis game is an unforgettable experience and I would give it 3.8/5","September 27, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Matt Gilgenbach, the creator of Neverending Nightmares, suffers from depression and OCD, and this game exists to help convey what that is like.  The player will experience anxiety, dread, and general discomfort.  Of course that is because there are jump scares and monsters that are trying to kill him, but the point is the feelings that are transmitted.  The visuals are inspired by Edward Gorey, and of course incredibly disturbing, and the sound will keep the player on edge at all times, especially with headphones.\n\nNeverending Nightmares does have a story, but it's disjointed and intentionally vague.  There are three endings, but none of them are canon.  You can try to put the pieces together to create a cohesive whole, but it's like having 450 pieces of a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle. Connections can be made, but you won't necessarily get the whole picture, and that's the point.  Clinical depression is not a rational thing.  There is not always a reason for people to feel depressed, except that their brains tell them so.  Be aware of this when you are trying to interpret the story.\n\nThe game is also heavy on symbolism, from the enemies to dream tropes that are lying around, like blood, teeth, and even the player's own slow running speed.  While the entire game, if you go for all of the endings and branching paths, will probably end up taking less than 2.5 hours, I would still argue that it is worth the purchase for the unique experience it provides, as well as for its part in helping spread awareness of OCD and clinical depression.  This game is great, and I highly recommend it.","October 4, 2014","true","4.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

In Neverending Nightmares you play as Thomas who is unable to wake up from nightmares. Everything leads into a new nightmare.So how is this game ? Its quite good honestly. The game was made by a person who suffered from mental illness. So ill try to explain how the game is played. You walk around in a 2D enviroment and you walk from door to door till you go deeper into the nightmare and once the nightmare wraps up you have the ability to go back and replay them and try to get a diffrent ending and theres three of them. The game also throws a few enemies to the mix and all of them act diffrent. The game is quite suspensfull and sometimes frighting to say the least. But the game has a few issues as well. A confusing layout which is hard to tell where youve been and where you are. The game is incredibly short only under an hour if you only plan to get one ending. Neverending Nightmares is also quite pretty to look at and it really has outstanding sound effects too, i highly suggest you play in the dark with headphones. Overall Nevenending nightmares is an excellent horror game for fans of the genre and i suggest everyone to pick this game up just to see how awfull it is to have a nightmare let alone never to wake up from one.

The penciled in artstyle with highlights of color is certainly interesting and is something I really enjoyed seeing compared to so many dull, grey, 3D horror games. The images in the backgrounds are also very well done with plenty of both overtly horrific images as well as many subtly disturbing images. There are also a few jump scares sprinkled throughout for good measure but they are spaced far enough apart that they dont become tedious. I should also mention the sound design is really quite supurb. When using headphones you can hear plenty of slight noises such as whispers or footsteps that increase the dramatic tension. Last of all the price is fairly reasonable. I was able to buy this game during a winter sale for $6.75 USD which is less than I've paid for much worse games.\n\nTHE BAD\nThe biggest complaint you will find from myself and others is the lack of player agency (walking simulator is in the tags for a good reason). The actual gameplay largely consists of only walking forward and avoiding enemies and even when avoiding enemies it's a simplistic affair as you will likely only die a couple of times before recognizing a pattern in the enemy behavior. Another major issue is that the game manages to be both short (about 2 hours for 100 percent completion) and yet tedious. You'll see many recycled hallways that you'll have to run through with the shortest invisible stamina bar in the world. While this repetitive nature does help the game feel more like an actual nightmare that you cannot escape from it does lose its charm fairly quickly.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you have a few extra dollars in your steam wallet and want to try a different but short horror game give Neverending Nightmares a try! For anyone that is looking to get the best for their money this one may be worth a pass.","December 20, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is some really nice ideas here and the art style is great. That said it is short (not a bad thing really), but the game has three ending paths with choices at the end of two chapters to decide the ending. So to see all the content you have to replay the same chapters and make the choice at the end to see the additional ten minutes of content.\n\nPros:\n\n- Some effective jump scares\n- Wonderful art style.\n- Lots of wonderful creepy imagery\n- An interesting horror story which did not over stay its welcome.\n\nCons:\n\n- Backtracking.... To see all endings you have to replay about 20 to 30 minutes of content. This is simply the biggest issue with the game.\n- Monsters/puzzles are all extremely easy. You see a cupboard then there is a good chance a monster will be in the hall and you will avoid it by hiding in the cupboard... The monsters in the Insanity level I thought were just desturbing imagery until the end of the chapter one kills me and it turned out they had just been easy to avoid up until that point.\n- Very linear game play apart from the 3 endings. This makes back tracking frustratingly dull.\n- Yes porcelain dolls are creepy, but are heavily overused to the point it just becomes funny.\n\n\nOverall, this was a unique game and I did generally enjoy the game. It is just a shame that back tracking is such a pain to view all content. The game has flaws but care and time went into making an interesting horror game experience. Therefore, if you enjoy horror games or if you enjoy games that use an interesting art style its worth giving the game a go.","December 27, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a ton of content but there is 4 different endings so the replay value is high. Mostly this is a walking sim with a ton of atmosphere but the way it is put together & it's story being open to your personal interpretation gives it a unique feel among similar games. I'm not gonna BS you, the game is short & lacks any type of real gameplay (i.e. no way to fight back against enemies, not much interaction with the enviroment) so if you're looking for horror game with action this not for you. On the other hand if you're looking for a unique horror experience & not adverse to more of an experience than a game this may be for you. IMO the only real con about this game is the price, I feel that $15 is a little steep for what it offers but if you can get it on sale I highly recommend this game.","February 17, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is very little jump scares involved in the game and the few that are involved in ways that fit the atmosphere of the game. The imagery is frightening (and gets pretty disturbing at points), the subject matter gets incredibly dark, the audio presentation is amazing, and the story manages to be abstracxt enough to get your own interpretation, yet clear enough so that you can be entertained by what you are seeing. It is a game that rewards thought, which is a rare aspect of stories in games.\n\nThere are only a few complaints I have, the first being that, while the art style is well drawn and adds to the atmosphere, I found there to be a slight bit of eye strain due to the amounts of small lines of various different monochrome shades that represent the darkness, which tends to just look incredibly awful in motion, which is even worse due to the flickering when the screen moves, so you may want to pass on this if you have especially sensitive eyes.\n\nThe other being that the game is kind of simplistic gameplay wise, and you spend most of the time just walking left or right, while occasionally trying to figure out how to slip by an enemy, which is in a rather simplistic way each time. The game is also light on content and can be beaten in about 4 hours, although it can be a bit longer if you take your time. Overall though, I highly reccomend this game. It really knows how to handle horror and atmosphere incredibly well and is one of the most underrated games of 2014.","April 19, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very atmospheric and kind of disturbing. I didn't find it scary, but I don't think a lot of games are. It captures the feeling of wandering through a nightmare where you are unable to exert any control, you just have to stay on the move. However, it does have some flaws. I found that the game didn't successfully keep me in a state of immersion, so a lot of my complaints would be nitpicky for any other genre, but I think that with horror it's really important to keep the player from thinking about how they're playing a game.\n\nThe Gorey-esque line drawings are great and I liked the effects when you move into lighter and darker areas. However, you can see the seams of the 3D-looking-2D effect often enough to be jarring (the straightjacket guys turning their heads, for example.)\n\nThere's not really a lot of game here (that's not bad necessarily, there's nothing wrong with being an interactive experience) and I was sort of expecting more puzzles, especially with all the flavor stuff to look at. At first I was trying to examine every piece of furniture and object in the house and I was actually a little disappointed to realize that only things in color were interactive. Having such an obvious tell made it seem less immersive. Also, it seems like they front-loaded all the non-plot related weird stuff to look at, because there were quite a few hotspots with nightmare stuff in the first area and then nothing for the rest of the game.\n\nI found myself getting frustrated with the slow pace, especially on replays trying to open different paths. I tend to play for long sessions and unable to not do that, and I think this game would be better parceled out gradually. There's not a lot of game here, I got it on sale but at full price it seems like a lot. I have one more achievment to get, by the time I 100% the game I'll probably have spent less than 3 hours on it. I could see myself having the desire to periodically revisit the game, though.","January 26, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a ton of content but there is 4 different endings so the replay value is high. Mostly this is a walking sim with a ton of atmosphere but the way it is put together & it's story being open to your personal interpretation gives it a unique feel among similar games. I'm not gonna BS you, the game is short & lacks any type of real gameplay (i.e. no way to fight back against enemies, not much interaction with the enviroment) so if you're looking for horror game with action this not for you. On the other hand if you're looking for a unique horror experience & not adverse to more of an experience than a game this may be for you. IMO the only real con about this game is the price, I feel that $15 is a little steep for what it offers but if you can get it on sale I highly recommend this game.","February 17, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is some really nice ideas here and the art style is great. That said it is short (not a bad thing really), but the game has three ending paths with choices at the end of two chapters to decide the ending. So to see all the content you have to replay the same chapters and make the choice at the end to see the additional ten minutes of content.\n\nPros:\n\n- Some effective jump scares\n- Wonderful art style.\n- Lots of wonderful creepy imagery\n- An interesting horror story which did not over stay its welcome.\n\nCons:\n\n- Backtracking.... To see all endings you have to replay about 20 to 30 minutes of content. This is simply the biggest issue with the game.\n- Monsters/puzzles are all extremely easy. You see a cupboard then there is a good chance a monster will be in the hall and you will avoid it by hiding in the cupboard... The monsters in the Insanity level I thought were just desturbing imagery until the end of the chapter one kills me and it turned out they had just been easy to avoid up until that point.\n- Very linear game play apart from the 3 endings. This makes back tracking frustratingly dull.\n- Yes porcelain dolls are creepy, but are heavily overused to the point it just becomes funny.\n\n\nOverall, this was a unique game and I did generally enjoy the game. It is just a shame that back tracking is such a pain to view all content. The game has flaws but care and time went into making an interesting horror game experience. Therefore, if you enjoy horror games or if you enjoy games that use an interesting art style its worth giving the game a go.","December 27, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, having now played the game, I actually think it does a really good job of showing the kind of mindset people who suffer from these kinds of illnesses experience.\nNot only do I think the game does a good job of showing what it's like inside the mind of people who suffer from these illnesses, but I also think it does a good job as a horror game in its own right. Whilst some of the more frigtening moments are just jump scares, it does very well to create a very creepy environment that really made me feel like I had to escape.\nI also liked the cool, hand-drawn art style. Being creepy, yet simplistic, it manages to fit in well with the eerie World in the game, whilst at the same time fitting in with the underlying tone of the game, that is trying to get across what it's like to suffer from depression and O.C.D. as suffering from O.C.D. often makes simple tasks a source of great distress and anxiety, which the art style seems to be a metaphor for.\nTo summarise, whether you just like horror games, or whether you're interested in getting an insight into what it's like to suffer from one or more mental illnesses, Neverending Nightmares is a game I'd recommend.","March 24, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean that as a compliment.\n\nI wouldn't say that this game is necessarily bad. It's got a pretty good atmosphere and decent jumpscares. The artwork's great (they even make it easy to spot landmarks so that you don't get lost, even though pretty much everything's in black and white), and the voice acting is pretty good, as well. Each section of the game pretty much has its own unique set of monsters with the exception of one or two, and that gives a pretty good variety. It's short enough to show a friend to just play through really quickly - I got all of the paths in 3 hours.\n\nA lot of the time, I wasn't really that scared, which is sort of bad news for a horror game. While the atmosphere is pretty scary at first, it sort of fades once you actually get to see each of the monsters - the mystery sort of disappears, and it's really easy to learn how to deal with them pretty quickly. I think the main problem with this game is that it's just a ton of walking with only a small handful of scattered monsters or jumpscares in relatively few places. I don't want to make a joke like "Walking Simulator 2015" or anything like that, but that did make this game pretty boring. Like I said, if you want to get into horror games, this is a good place to start, but not for $15.","September 6, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's very little gaming to do.  All you do is march down long hallways, listen to the moody music, look at the creepy imagery, and eventually you get to the end.  Some may even compare it to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but that game had plenty of things for the player to do.  It wasn't just a forced march down dark hallways; you had goals, and the monsters were actively chasing you!\n\nHaving little to do gamewise isn't necessarily a bad thing.  To The Moon was very much like this, but what set that game apart from this one is the story.  To The Moon, Lone Survivor, and Amnesia all have a complete story to uncover at the end.  Neverending Nightmares does not.  It leaves you with a bunch of confusing pieces of a story with no resolution--yet another game that thinks being vague is the same as being profound.  (I'm looking at you, Braid!)\n\nAll you do is march down long hallways, open doors, march down more long hallways, and at the end of the march is a jump-scare.  These jump-scares are effective, but after the fourth time, it becomes routine.  Oh yes, and dolls are creepy.  We get it.  Dolls *are* creepy.\n\nNeverending Nightmares feels like it was built around its soundtrack.  The levels are ridiculously long just to make you absorb the music.  The ambient horror music makes this game, and it does a very good job creating atmosphere.  The art style is especially memorable.  I've never seen a game look like this, and it adds a lot to the creep factor.\n\nSteam won't let me give this a neutral rating, but it deserves one.  I didn't hate this game, as it did a very good job creating atmosphere and jump-scaring me more than once, but I found the delivery more tedious than scary, and the 3 payoffs at the end do not provide a satisfying resolution to all that marching.","September 1, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is essentially a two hour arcade minigame from an old Sierra adventure game, and is incredibly frustrating. The motifs are relatively tries and repetitive. And it has the problem that alot of brawlers have, of a 2d character on a 3d plane. But, something rather interesting happened when I finished the game last night. This morning as I type out my review, I am incredibly tired, for all last night, my dreams were all night terrors. Everytime I blink, I see the world in cross hatch. And this kind of immersion I hacen't expererienced since I first played and saw Pyramid Head staring at me from behind red bars. And that was when I was seven. There is actually a bit towards the end of  the game that is an obvious rip off of Silent Hill 2. This game is described as an experience of a life with ocd, but feel this description could apply to any mental disease. Actually, I think the best way to describe it, is as a nightmare Eric Chahi might have after watching a box set of Vincent Price films. In the end I'd recomend this game to three types of people; anyone who'd like to understand what it is to be mentally, anyone who never got the chance to play PT before it was removed from the PSN, or anyone whose a fan of excellent atmosphere. It's a little bit Edgar Allen Poe, and a little bit of Clocktower, and a little bit of B-Movie gore, and a lot lot lot (that's three lots) of Silent Hill. Without meaning to spoil anything, the ending is frustrating, and doesn't offer any closure, but it isn't a deal breaker. Oh, and don't tell me it's open to interpretation. Blade Runner is open to interpretation because I know what I'm supposed to be interpreting.","June 7, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The penciled in artstyle with highlights of color is certainly interesting and is something I really enjoyed seeing compared to so many dull, grey, 3D horror games. The images in the backgrounds are also very well done with plenty of both overtly horrific images as well as many subtly disturbing images. There are also a few jump scares sprinkled throughout for good measure but they are spaced far enough apart that they dont become tedious. I should also mention the sound design is really quite supurb. When using headphones you can hear plenty of slight noises such as whispers or footsteps that increase the dramatic tension. Last of all the price is fairly reasonable. I was able to buy this game during a winter sale for $6.75 USD which is less than I've paid for much worse games.\n\nTHE BAD\nThe biggest complaint you will find from myself and others is the lack of player agency (walking simulator is in the tags for a good reason). The actual gameplay largely consists of only walking forward and avoiding enemies and even when avoiding enemies it's a simplistic affair as you will likely only die a couple of times before recognizing a pattern in the enemy behavior. Another major issue is that the game manages to be both short (about 2 hours for 100 percent completion) and yet tedious. You'll see many recycled hallways that you'll have to run through with the shortest invisible stamina bar in the world. While this repetitive nature does help the game feel more like an actual nightmare that you cannot escape from it does lose its charm fairly quickly.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you have a few extra dollars in your steam wallet and want to try a different but short horror game give Neverending Nightmares a try! For anyone that is looking to get the best for their money this one may be worth a pass.","December 20, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingtengu/recommended/253330/","kingtengu","kingtengu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingtengu/","65 products in account","I just found one of the 3 endings of Neverending Nightmares (in 1.4 hours). This intrigues me for the replayablity factor that is presented,  however the thought of trudging (and I use that word literally to describe the speed at which the asthmatic main character moves) through labyrinthine corridors deters me from pursuing them for the time being. Even if I were to find all 3 endings, I'm not sure I'd ever revisit this title though. There are some games I do revisit from time to time, this is unfortunately not going to be one of those titles. I'd say the current 68/100 metacritic score is accurate.\n\nWhat the game does well:\nThe atmosphere is done well, and I particularly enjoyed the Edward Gorey aesthetic used in the design, as well as the use of color to draw attention to specifc details. The few frights and encounters kept things interesting, as well did the atmospheric music (definitely play with headphones).\nThe running is short-lived and easily expired, which presents the user with choices to make especially when present in more dangerous situations.\nNon-reliant on Jump scares:  Neverending Nightmare might have a few tricks of its own in the jump department, but its focus on the environment and sound are its strong points.\n\nWhat could be improved:\nThe Pacing - The character speed could probably be sped up about 1.5 to 2 times their current speed with as much walking around is required. I'd liken the current speed to that of wading through knee deep water,,, for the entire game.\nIf you want to make a character move that slow, then the atmosphere needs to be more engaging (whether that be more benign haunts, more background detail to focus on, or slow changes to environment as the character moves though it). Neverending Nightmares does provide all of these, however it feels as though it's not quite enough as you slowly  navigate its corridors.\nConsidering I found one ending in 1.4 hours, you could argue the speed is artificially extending the play time.\nThe Ending(s) - I've only seen one ending so far. It was more like a quick scene rather than a fleshed out closure, so the payout felt a bit weak considering the narrative through scenery the game otherwise provides.\n\nWho I would recommend this to:\nOne of my friends got bored, maybe getting past the first nightmare only and then moving on. However, they tend to be more action oriented rather than savoring that slow build-up.\nIf you enjoy games that focus heavily on exploration ("wander quests" as I call them) and enjoy a slower pace in a dark room, then you'd probably enjoy this title. For anyone who enjoys horror games, this is a nice title to have especially if you can look past its faults.\nFor the brevity of the game though, and what little it does perform, I'm not sure I can recommend this game at it's 14.99 price. I have a hard time spending slightly less on that for a movie theater ticket as is.","July 12, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fun 4 or so hours to explore everything and unlock all of the endings.  Minimalist game play and great atmosphere.  The art and music combine to make a very creepy experience, as do the various little details and jump-scare type moments.  The only downsides are the slow movement speed (more infuriating on subsequent play-throughs when unlocking additional endings) and some of the monster avoidance, such as one moment when the player is required to do a thing to pass a monster but previously that thing has gotten the player killed.\n\nThere are a couple things I think could have been further expanded on or changed.  Several objects may be examined, but rarely is there a point to doing so.  Many reoccuring elements aren't really explained, or even explored to a point where the player can make informed inferrences.

As it stands, rather than setting the world on fire and becoming a revolutionary classic, you're an above average, competently executed horror/adventure hybrid.\n\nBefore we get to why this game falls short, let's take a moment to acknowledge all the things it does right. First off, it is creepy and unnerving throughout. The atmosphere is incredible. This is accomplished by a beautiful, unique, and simple (yet also nicely detailed) art style. The detailed closeups of items scattered throughout the world are a very nice touch, and do a lot to help flesh out the world. Backing that up is some of the best sound design I've ever encountered in a horror game. No exageration, it sounds every bit as creepy as you could want. Not wanting to spoil anything, the third section of the game made me so genuinely uncomfortable because of the sound design, that I actually had to walk away from the game for a little bit.\n\nBeyond atmosphere, I want to commend the game's designer for being so openly influenced by mental illness. I don't have much to say about that right now, but that took guts, so, well done. Knowing this information going in helps significantly appreciate a lot of design choices.\n\nFinally, in addition to the atmosphere, the level design is great itself. While only existing of pretty straight forward hallways and paths, the world itself gets a lot of distance out of this simplicity, even as the vast majority of movement occurs on a 2D plane. The paths you can take branch out, twist around themselves, and generally seem to shift around you. It's honestly creepy, and unnerving as you try to make sense out of the impossible geometries the game builds and lets you explore.\n\nIt's worth noting that this game is not particurally long. As many people have pointed out, it only takes about an hour or two to finish a playthrough. However, I won't hold this against the game too much, as its length feels appropriate. It does what it wants to do, and then ends without overstaying its welcome. And yes, $15 dollars for 1 hour of play is a bit steep in comparison to a lot of games, but the budget conscious among us could always wait for a sale to save a few dollars. It's worth noting that despite the cost and relatively short length, I didn't feel ripped off or cheated out of my money.\n\nSo now, we come inevitably to the part where I need to break out the criticisms. First off, and this is the most minor of my criticisms, as big as the game world appears to be, it seems to consist of a lot of empty space. There are plenty of uninteresting dead ends, as well as some repeating elements that start to lose luster very quickly.\n\nNext up, and more damaging to the game overall, is the enemy design. The game starts out with positive points in this category because you've got absolutely no offensive capabilties, and no defensive capabilities beyond running away, and even that can only be done for short distances. These facts make enemies legitimate threats, and keeps this from approaching anything actiony, and keeps you feeling disempowered and helpless, the key elements of horror. However, from this strong start, the game quickly surrenders the advantage.  There are a very small number of enemy types throughout the game. While this isn't the end of the world, the enemies are largely uninspired. They are mostly humanoid, not truly anything too horrifying or mostrous. But again, this could be overlooked, or may even be something some people like. But what ultimately is the final nail in the coffin on this issue, is that dealing with the enemies is just dull. They are mostly just tests of patience, more than anything intrinsically interesting to encounter or deal with. They are easy to figure out how to deal with, and once you accomplish that, they do little more than add arbitrary wait times to each encounter. There are a few puzzles which use the enemy mechanics to interesting effect, but to be honest, other than serving as the essential threat to life itself, the enemies serve little purpose. In a game with as great an atmosphere and understanding of pacing and discomfort, it's practically criminal that the enemies are so weakly designed.\n\nAnd finally, my biggest criticism of the game comes up. This has to do with the structure of the story. I'm going to try to avoid all spoilers about specific events and occurances of the story, but I will be talking about narative structure here. The important thing to know is that the game has multiple endings based on which paths you take throughout the game. These are mostly subtle choices, that honestly you won't notice until you get told by the game where the choices were at the end. Having multiple endings is the greatest flaw of this game, despite how well they are integrated into the gameplay. To explain why, you need to understand that the game is drenched in symbolism, from small details of the environment, to enemy design and even gameplay mechanics. But by having three separate endings, the developer essentially rendered two-thirds of the symbols encountered in a given playthrough completely moot and meaningless. While having the multiple paths does pad out the length of the game, as you backtrack to find all the divergent paths, I'd rather have one very solid ending than three weak-ish endings. The only real defense that I can think of for this is that having multiple endings contributes to the themes of ambiguity throughout the game, but this is a pretty weak justification. These endings are also mostly cliched, and not particularly exciting, especially when contrasted with the incredible atmosphere on display.\n\nSo, if the game is short, has weak enemy design, has an ultimately dissappointing story, and generally has weak gameplay, why is there a big thumbs up next to this review? Well, for all of the criticisms I can fairly levy against this game, as I said, I never felt ripped off by this game. I was engaged for as long as I played it, and even the ending, while abrupt and weak, wasn't a deal breaker by any means. It also is one of the few games I've found that describes itself as psychological horror, and does enough to earn that title. While there are a few jump scares, they are used sparingly enough as to not weaken the game, and the rest of the game puts you in a disempowered place and truly messes with you, leaving a lingering sense of fear and unease. If you're a fan of real horror, and not the empty meaningless YouTube-bait horror with exclusively meaningless jumpscares, definately give this game a shot.","July 18, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/literaryvideogames/recommended/253330/","literaryvideogames","Literary Video Games","http://steamcommunity.com/id/literaryvideogames/","23 products in account","Neverending Nightmares offers a breath of fresh air in a genre dominated by experiences like Slender: The Arrival and Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  This side-scrolling game combines hand-drawn aesthetics, unsettling atmosphere, and sparse but terrifying jump scares.\n\nOne of my few issues with Neverending Nightmares arises in what I consider to be lazy storytelling. Although I enjoy abstract and cryptic plot-lines, I couldn't remember the name of the hero's sister after finishing my first playthrough.  Considering that Thomas and Gabby are the only two characters in the game, you would hope I'd be able to tell you a bit more about them than I actually can.  (I know they're siblings, and I know Thomas is older than her, but that's pretty much it.)  Secondly, the story occasionally sacrifices depth for shallow creepiness.  Sure, I thought the lecture in the asylum was creepy—but did it reveal anything about the protagonist?  Not really.  That said, the story does have one thing in its favor: multiple endings establish this game as one with high replayability.\n\nSecondly, even though Infinitap Games claims Neverending Nightmares seeks "to promote a greater understanding of mental illness," I rarely felt as though the game actually discussed this.  While one of the endings delves into this theme, it is easy to miss if you play without first reading up on the backstory behind Neverending Nightmares. The goal was commendable; it's too bad the implementation wasn't there.\n\nMy complaints, though valid, pale in comparison to the many positive qualities of Neverending Nightmares.  Some people might be concerned about the simplistic gameplay—over a period of two to four hours (depending whether or not you choose to find all the endings), you will do nothing but walk, run, and interact with maybe a dozen objects.  I admit this sounds tedious, but in reality the game's simplicity results in a sort of streamlined horror:my limited options heightened the tension because I knew I would be unable to hide or fight back.\n\nNot that the tension needs heightening.  This game possesses an incredible atmosphere, dark and dense and forbidding. The atmospheric tension starts with a unique art style: the black and white dichotomy creates a sparseness that elevates the few colors in Neverending Nightmares.  My pulse spiked whenever I saw the vivid redness of blood, and I grew paranoid when I discovered a yellow candle.  An under-appreciated aspect of the art lies in its incorporation of shadow.  Dynamic shadows based on light sources swerve and flicker around Thomas, and thin lines of blackness darken rooms.\n\nOf course no creepy atmosphere would be complete without audio, and I'm happy to say that both the music and the sound design are well done.  One of the Kickstarter rewards for Neverending Nightmares allowed backers to create a sound that would appear in game, and the variety of these sounds helps make this experience even more nerve-wracking.  Additionally, all of the audio is specially crafted for headphones.  The way certain sounds only register in one ear or the other kept convincing me that there was someone behind me.\n\nWhile the jump scares don't quite match up to the superb atmosphere, they still frightened me.  Some of these scares are traditional: expect to be chased by several humanoid monsters.  That said, there are plenty of unexpected surprises as well.  I won't mention them here, but rest assured that you will be jumping at many different moments.  (Now that I think about it, I guess you shouldn't rest assured.)\n\nUltimately, Neverending Nightmares is horror with a message.  If you are willing to spend fifteen dollars on a two to four hour game, you'll discover a beautiful, terrifying experience.  Like me, you may be left wanting to know more about Thomas and Gabby...but nonetheless, I recommend fans of the horror genre pick up this indie title.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 8.7/10\n\nThis review was written for Literary Video Games.

Simple: I got it on sale and I'm a sucker for atmosphere. Still, it's a 6/10 when it could have been an 8.","July 19, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fun 4 or so hours to explore everything and unlock all of the endings.  Minimalist game play and great atmosphere.  The art and music combine to make a very creepy experience, as do the various little details and jump-scare type moments.  The only downsides are the slow movement speed (more infuriating on subsequent play-throughs when unlocking additional endings) and some of the monster avoidance, such as one moment when the player is required to do a thing to pass a monster but previously that thing has gotten the player killed.\n\nThere are a couple things I think could have been further expanded on or changed.  Several objects may be examined, but rarely is there a point to doing so.  Many reoccuring elements aren't really explained, or even explored to a point where the player can make informed inferrences.  The game leaves a lot of the "why" up to the player; gamers who are used to (or expect to) be fed all of the information will be disappointed.","July 16, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This intrigues me for the replayablity factor that is presented,  however the thought of trudging (and I use that word literally to describe the speed at which the asthmatic main character moves) through labyrinthine corridors deters me from pursuing them for the time being. Even if I were to find all 3 endings, I'm not sure I'd ever revisit this title though. There are some games I do revisit from time to time, this is unfortunately not going to be one of those titles. I'd say the current 68/100 metacritic score is accurate.\n\nWhat the game does well:\nThe atmosphere is done well, and I particularly enjoyed the Edward Gorey aesthetic used in the design, as well as the use of color to draw attention to specifc details. The few frights and encounters kept things interesting, as well did the atmospheric music (definitely play with headphones).\nThe running is short-lived and easily expired, which presents the user with choices to make especially when present in more dangerous situations.\nNon-reliant on Jump scares:  Neverending Nightmare might have a few tricks of its own in the jump department, but its focus on the environment and sound are its strong points.\n\nWhat could be improved:\nThe Pacing - The character speed could probably be sped up about 1.5 to 2 times their current speed with as much walking around is required. I'd liken the current speed to that of wading through knee deep water,,, for the entire game.\nIf you want to make a character move that slow, then the atmosphere needs to be more engaging (whether that be more benign haunts, more background detail to focus on, or slow changes to environment as the character moves though it). Neverending Nightmares does provide all of these, however it feels as though it's not quite enough as you slowly  navigate its corridors.\nConsidering I found one ending in 1.4 hours, you could argue the speed is artificially extending the play time.\nThe Ending(s) - I've only seen one ending so far. It was more like a quick scene rather than a fleshed out closure, so the payout felt a bit weak considering the narrative through scenery the game otherwise provides.\n\nWho I would recommend this to:\nOne of my friends got bored, maybe getting past the first nightmare only and then moving on. However, they tend to be more action oriented rather than savoring that slow build-up.\nIf you enjoy games that focus heavily on exploration ("wander quests" as I call them) and enjoy a slower pace in a dark room, then you'd probably enjoy this title. For anyone who enjoys horror games, this is a nice title to have especially if you can look past its faults.\nFor the brevity of the game though, and what little it does perform, I'm not sure I can recommend this game at it's 14.99 price. I have a hard time spending slightly less on that for a movie theater ticket as is.","July 12, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is essentially a two hour arcade minigame from an old Sierra adventure game, and is incredibly frustrating. The motifs are relatively tries and repetitive. And it has the problem that alot of brawlers have, of a 2d character on a 3d plane. But, something rather interesting happened when I finished the game last night. This morning as I type out my review, I am incredibly tired, for all last night, my dreams were all night terrors. Everytime I blink, I see the world in cross hatch. And this kind of immersion I hacen't expererienced since I first played and saw Pyramid Head staring at me from behind red bars. And that was when I was seven. There is actually a bit towards the end of  the game that is an obvious rip off of Silent Hill 2. This game is described as an experience of a life with ocd, but feel this description could apply to any mental disease. Actually, I think the best way to describe it, is as a nightmare Eric Chahi might have after watching a box set of Vincent Price films. In the end I'd recomend this game to three types of people; anyone who'd like to understand what it is to be mentally, anyone who never got the chance to play PT before it was removed from the PSN, or anyone whose a fan of excellent atmosphere. It's a little bit Edgar Allen Poe, and a little bit of Clocktower, and a little bit of B-Movie gore, and a lot lot lot (that's three lots) of Silent Hill. Without meaning to spoil anything, the ending is frustrating, and doesn't offer any closure, but it isn't a deal breaker. Oh, and don't tell me it's open to interpretation. Blade Runner is open to interpretation because I know what I'm supposed to be interpreting.","June 7, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It tries to become a survival horror, but takes shortcuts that make it feel more like a flash game than a full product. The best comparison is with P.T. which uses a similar idea: revisiting the same small area with minor changes at every iteration. Unfortunately, the game has you go into several rooms with no real progression. Each time you make a startling discovery or die, and end up in your bed. but the time to reach that climax is slow, stagnant, with an abrupt change. It lacks crescendo. There is a bare-bones stealth area where you hide in a closet while a grotesque baby-faced grunt shakes it. This mechanic is poorly developed, as you only have two directions to flee, and it is a matter of waiting until they are off-screen.\n\nI played one session and did not return, because only 1/5 of the game is actually content, and relies heavily on jump scares and exploration of mostly static environments. Items that you do examine are paintings with no interest or plot progression, as if they were added for either showing off artistic skills or lengthening gameplay.\n\n","May 24, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A 5/10. Why? Alright, here it goes:\n\nVisuals are amazing. The game's artstyle is really interesting and, while most of the time you're basically walking around the same couple rooms with little difference from eachother, the artstyle makes sure it's a creepy, disturbing and often sick world you're thrown in.\n\nThe sounds are really good, the soundtrack is really atmospheric and there is one track in particular when you're reaching the end of the game that is REALLY creepy. Even the voice acting is good, not amazing, but good.\n\nThe story and the gameplay is where it falls. Storywise, you're thrown in a world in search for something, something that you really have no idea what will be. You just walk around and see things popping up, trying to make some sense of what's going on. However, the game itself gives you three endings, each one completely different from the other, so you just choose which one you liked the most and there goes your story. Maybe I overlooked it? Alright, but the gameplay made me do it, because they didn't even throw in any puzzle to make you feel like you're actually playing something. Hell, even point-and-click games feel more "gamey" than this almost senseless walking thing.\n\nTHE VERDICT: Beautifully atmospheric, this "game" should have been made a movie instead.

This is to try to spook you by having a bird run into the window or a glass break when you least expect it. Very cliche. Yet after this happens it is not enough confict for me.\n\nThe main character that you play as, looks really boring in design. Like a brown nosing corporate YES man in PJs. You can sprint which causes the main character wheeze for breath and stop after 4 seconds. You hear yourself cough a lot, which really kills the pace. Its already a slow game without these pauses.\n\nFinally I made it to some grave of my sister that died to find her in front of me to start the next nightmare with some terrible dialogue. IM BORED ALREADY, and not interested for the next nightmare.\n\nThe art is decent. I do not care for the black and white style for the whole game. I dont mind if you have black and white modes, but as a base, I feel its lazy these days.\n\nI will admit I didnt give it much of a chance, but the chance I did give didnt impress me.

Even before the branching plotlines and multiple endings, the game's trio of primary settings offer more than enough dread to deal with.\n\nDespite its admitted inspiration in struggles with OCD and depression, Neverending Nightmares opts for a more metaphorical take on its subject matter than anything literal. The game looks at what such struggles feel like, or felt like for the creator at least, through the lens of horror rather than attempting to recount the experience directly. The bulk of the game involves waking up to an eerie, foreboding environment that only slightly changes with each return to supposed consciousness. Every wakeup is followed by a new attempt to find a way out of these increasingly imposing scenarios, searching each area for new tools to progress and usually ending in an unexpectedly horrible way. As things progress, human-but-not-quite creatures join the environment in trying to stop you, but never quite to the point of being a showdown. Even though this realm is apparently your own mind, you have no real power here.\n\nThe game's monochrome visual style is striking and memorable, with some interesting techniques used to add gloom and otherwise obfuscate areas when necessary. The only color that comes into play is red, which is used selectively but liberally for gore when warranted. The soundtrack is subtle, but haunting, and what few sounds the handful of enemies make when you encounter them are enough on their own to make it clear they should be avoided.\n\nNeverending Nightmares does a great job of managing difficulty as well. Puzzles often rely on a bit of wandering at first to trigger certain appearances, but don't feel overly drawn out. Enemies are easy enough to avoid in most cases, with later encounters taking a bit more strategy, and the consequences for failure feel justified but horrifying. As things increase in difficulty and complexity, levels offer checkpoints to keep repetition down.\n\nThe multiple endings aren't overly numerous, and I liked how it wasn't entirely clear which one, if any of them, was the "real" ending. As you finish the game, a level map unlocks, showing threads between what you've cleared thus far and making it easier to figure out where you should be looking for alternate choices to enable different progress. All in all, this is one neat little horror package, and the connection it has to the developer's personal experience makes it that much more worthwhile.\n\nHere's a little peek at what you're in for, if you're curious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhHjjUdKy8A","January 10","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is to try to spook you by having a bird run into the window or a glass break when you least expect it. Very cliche. Yet after this happens it is not enough confict for me.\n\nThe main character that you play as, looks really boring in design. Like a brown nosing corporate YES man in PJs. You can sprint which causes the main character wheeze for breath and stop after 4 seconds. You hear yourself cough a lot, which really kills the pace. Its already a slow game without these pauses.\n\nFinally I made it to some grave of my sister that died to find her in front of me to start the next nightmare with some terrible dialogue. IM BORED ALREADY, and not interested for the next nightmare.\n\nThe art is decent. I do not care for the black and white style for the whole game. I dont mind if you have black and white modes, but as a base, I feel its lazy these days.\n\nI will admit I didnt give it much of a chance, but the chance I did give didnt impress me. With the lack of direction that the start, poor pace control, and cliched pop out horror, which gave me a scare back in DOOM 2 days. But DOOM 2 was fun.

A 5/10. Why? Alright, here it goes:\n\nVisuals are amazing. The game's artstyle is really interesting and, while most of the time you're basically walking around the same couple rooms with little difference from eachother, the artstyle makes sure it's a creepy, disturbing and often sick world you're thrown in.\n\nThe sounds are really good, the soundtrack is really atmospheric and there is one track in particular when you're reaching the end of the game that is REALLY creepy. Even the voice acting is good, not amazing, but good.\n\nThe story and the gameplay is where it falls. Storywise, you're thrown in a world in search for something, something that you really have no idea what will be. You just walk around and see things popping up, trying to make some sense of what's going on. However, the game itself gives you three endings, each one completely different from the other, so you just choose which one you liked the most and there goes your story. Maybe I overlooked it? Alright, but the gameplay made me do it, because they didn't even throw in any puzzle to make you feel like you're actually playing something. Hell, even point-and-click games feel more "gamey" than this almost senseless walking thing.\n\nTHE VERDICT: Beautifully atmospheric, this "game" should have been made a movie instead. I'd totally watch it and crap my pants more than I did by playing it. Unfortunately, it wasn't.","October 10, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's very little gaming to do.  All you do is march down long hallways, listen to the moody music, look at the creepy imagery, and eventually you get to the end.  Some may even compare it to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but that game had plenty of things for the player to do.  It wasn't just a forced march down dark hallways; you had goals, and the monsters were actively chasing you!\n\nHaving little to do gamewise isn't necessarily a bad thing.  To The Moon was very much like this, but what set that game apart from this one is the story.  To The Moon, Lone Survivor, and Amnesia all have a complete story to uncover at the end.  Neverending Nightmares does not.  It leaves you with a bunch of confusing pieces of a story with no resolution--yet another game that thinks being vague is the same as being profound.  (I'm looking at you, Braid!)\n\nAll you do is march down long hallways, open doors, march down more long hallways, and at the end of the march is a jump-scare.  These jump-scares are effective, but after the fourth time, it becomes routine.  Oh yes, and dolls are creepy.  We get it.  Dolls *are* creepy.\n\nNeverending Nightmares feels like it was built around its soundtrack.  The levels are ridiculously long just to make you absorb the music.  The ambient horror music makes this game, and it does a very good job creating atmosphere.  The art style is especially memorable.  I've never seen a game look like this, and it adds a lot to the creep factor.\n\nSteam won't let me give this a neutral rating, but it deserves one.  I didn't hate this game, as it did a very good job creating atmosphere and jump-scaring me more than once, but I found the delivery more tedious than scary, and the 3 payoffs at the end do not provide a satisfying resolution to all that marching.","September 1, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even before the branching plotlines and multiple endings, the game's trio of primary settings offer more than enough dread to deal with.\n\nDespite its admitted inspiration in struggles with OCD and depression, Neverending Nightmares opts for a more metaphorical take on its subject matter than anything literal. The game looks at what such struggles feel like, or felt like for the creator at least, through the lens of horror rather than attempting to recount the experience directly. The bulk of the game involves waking up to an eerie, foreboding environment that only slightly changes with each return to supposed consciousness. Every wakeup is followed by a new attempt to find a way out of these increasingly imposing scenarios, searching each area for new tools to progress and usually ending in an unexpectedly horrible way. As things progress, human-but-not-quite creatures join the environment in trying to stop you, but never quite to the point of being a showdown. Even though this realm is apparently your own mind, you have no real power here.\n\nThe game's monochrome visual style is striking and memorable, with some interesting techniques used to add gloom and otherwise obfuscate areas when necessary. The only color that comes into play is red, which is used selectively but liberally for gore when warranted. The soundtrack is subtle, but haunting, and what few sounds the handful of enemies make when you encounter them are enough on their own to make it clear they should be avoided.\n\nNeverending Nightmares does a great job of managing difficulty as well. Puzzles often rely on a bit of wandering at first to trigger certain appearances, but don't feel overly drawn out. Enemies are easy enough to avoid in most cases, with later encounters taking a bit more strategy, and the consequences for failure feel justified but horrifying. As things increase in difficulty and complexity, levels offer checkpoints to keep repetition down.\n\nThe multiple endings aren't overly numerous, and I liked how it wasn't entirely clear which one, if any of them, was the "real" ending. As you finish the game, a level map unlocks, showing threads between what you've cleared thus far and making it easier to figure out where you should be looking for alternate choices to enable different progress. All in all, this is one neat little horror package, and the connection it has to the developer's personal experience makes it that much more worthwhile.\n\nHere's a little peek at what you're in for, if you're curious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhHjjUdKy8A","January 10","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I backed this on Kickstarter because the creator had an interesting idea I wanted to see flourish into a game. I purchased this and didn't immediately play it but I did save the game for my 2014 Extra-Life charity stream.\n\nI played through, and beat, the game in about 1.5 hours. Those 1.5 hours weren't exceptionally difficult nor were they thought provoking. The only reason the things in the game meant anything to me was because I Kickstarted the game and knew that the game creator focused the game around his own anxieties and fears. This doesn't really come through in the game if you don't know those things.\n\nI hate to base a review around the price of a game but I don't know...this is a coin toss for me. I'm going to not recommend this game. All you do is walk left or right...there aren't any puzzles, there isn't any dialogue, the scares are telegraphed and not especially scary (subjective, I know), and the short nature of the game make it really hard to recommend.\n\nIf you want to pick it up I would say get it as cheap as possible.

I backed this on Kickstarter because the creator had an interesting idea I wanted to see flourish into a game. I purchased this and didn't immediately play it but I did save the game for my 2014 Extra-Life charity stream.\n\nI played through, and beat, the game in about 1.5 hours. Those 1.5 hours weren't exceptionally difficult nor were they thought provoking. The only reason the things in the game meant anything to me was because I Kickstarted the game and knew that the game creator focused the game around his own anxieties and fears. This doesn't really come through in the game if you don't know those things.\n\nI hate to base a review around the price of a game but I don't know...this is a coin toss for me. I'm going to not recommend this game. All you do is walk left or right...there aren't any puzzles, there isn't any dialogue, the scares are telegraphed and not especially scary (subjective, I know), and the short nature of the game make it really hard to recommend.\n\nIf you want to pick it up I would say get it as cheap as possible. Your mileage may vary but I felt this was a huge letdown.","January 25","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is also very fitting for the game and its subject matter. Then the story itself was intriguing to me, as someone fascinated with dreams and nightmares who experiences a lot of both the premise meant the game was bound to interest me.\n\nYes, the game is rather short, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I often enjoy short games, they can be just the thing when you fancy playing something but have other things going on. It also keeps the game from being repetitive, in order to make this game longer a lot of new creatures and endings would have needed to be added, by which point the plot would run the risk of getting stretched too thin. I feel like Neverending Nightmares strikes the perfect balance for those who don't mind if a game is short.\n\nAs far as how scary this game is, that'd depend on what gets to you, for instance, for a person afraid of dolls a large portion of this game would be very creepy. For me there were other things that would creep me out, I'm afraid of the dark and stairs make me very uneasy. They have covered a lot of based and there were a couple of bits where I jumped (although I'm admittedly easily startled).\n\nLastly, I'd say that while I definitely recommend this game to people who don't mind a short psychological horror experience that isn't action-oriented, if you are sensitive to imagery or references to suicide or self harm then this game will likely not be for you, so basically, player discretion is advised.","January 31","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty slow and repetitive. The mechanics are simple, so once you get them figured out you just... keep moving forward. The Protag can't run for more than a few seconds before he gets winded and has to take a break, and also walks slow, which I find to be very frustrating. Admittedly, that was probably intentional, but it feels like there's a lot of empty rooms to pass through.","January 29","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In recent years there has been a slew of more or less interactive games about mental illnesses, perhaps the most discussed being Depression Quest.\nNeverending Nightmares is also said to be based on the developers own experience living with ocd and depression, but where Depression Quest was a choose-your-own-adventure text based game this time we have a proper adventure game.\nOr what at first glance looks like a proper game. Yes there is a character to control and progress to be made but don’t be fooled to think there is much more gameplay here.\nThe whole game consists of walking endless corridors, sometimes opening doors or clumsily trying to avoid a few monsters.\n\nThe striking art style is admirable, in still pictures it resembles some crude underground comic from yesteryear and in motion the facial expressions and body language of the main character helps transfer a feeling of utter despair and terror as you blindly navigate the endless corridors.\nBut here also lies it’s main problem - sure the atmosphere is there but it’s not used to tell the gamer anything, the story is non-existent until the very end.\nWhile I can sympathise with the design decision to keep with the theme of a looping, never ending nightmare it also takes away the incentive to keep playing as you are not given any reason to do so. In the end it was an empty experience more filled with boredom than horror.","January 18","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it was another horror game for me, as a huge fan of horror, to consume. It is said you shouldn't expect something from a game when you don't know anything about it. But the excitment got the better of me. It was the unigue artwork in the screenshots that got my attention big time. I expected ( or was hoping ) some good scares, a good story, clever gameplay and maybe even puzzles. I was so stupid to think like this because when I eventually played I was let down by my own expectations.\n\nThomas is a boy ( or a young man, can't really tell ) who is experiencing terrible nightmares which never seem to end. As he wanders around his nightmares looking for a way out he sometimes comes across these monsters which will instantly kill him if they get too close. Everything is very straightforward; passing through multiple dark hallways and rooms, sometimes with a candle on hand and sometimes not. And sometimes he will find his sister which results in either one of them  experiencing something grisly.\n\nLike I said the artstyle is what made me so interested. Black and white with occasional colour to draw the attention of the player to a certain object. There is gore involved so when blood is on the walls or the innards of someone out, it's of course very red. In my silly opinion the art looks like it could on a book. If it wasn't so dark or so gory I could imagine this kind of art being in a children's book. And I mean this in a positive way. I've seen a lot of people mention Edward Gorey ( I didn't know about him before ) and there was one developer who confirmed they got inspiration from his work.\n\nThe artstyle is where the positives end up, unfortunately. Earlier I described the nightmares as being terrible but the thing is that in Neverending Nightmares they really aren't. If I had to describe NN with one word it would be simply boring. Mind-numbningly boring. I played at night, just like I always do horror games to keep myself on the edge, and I almost fell asleep. I was immensely bored and annoyed. I know what is it like to have depression because I suffered from it. And I regularly get nightmares. But I think this game isn't able to properly convey the feelings of such dread, even if the lead designer became inspired by his own struggles. I didn't expect my experience to be filled with jumpscares because honestly I don't like them either. But there was basically nothing happening throughout my playthrough and it made me annoyed. And when something did happen, something very small ( that's what it felt like anyway ), it revoked no kind of emotion in me.\n\nA big problem is that there is no context for anything happening. You are just this boy roaming in his own nightmares, encountering random monsters and looking for his sister ( or in the next nightmare she was not his sister ). And then when he does find her it ends in something bad and the end. Why? What? When? Who? All this in just under two hours. And despite being so short I felt it was too long. Too much padding by making you walk through same looking rooms and hallways over and over. Too long because it felt like nothing happened.\n\nNeverending Nightmares is so short that after completing it and all the achievements I had to idle couple of hours more to get my trading cards. This would have been absolutely fine if the experience had been worth it; one of my favourite video games happens to be Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and it's short as well. It's a wonder I managed to write this much about a game that is shorter than two hours but I guess it's just my disappointment speaking.\n\nPersonal Rating: 2/5 - Negative","April 11","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
