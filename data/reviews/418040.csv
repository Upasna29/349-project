THat's fine if the game is upgraded at all but it doesn't even take up the whole screen.  Instead it's a little window in the center as if the game is supposed to be made for an iphone 5 held vertically- which it clearly was.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/418040/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","hocus is a small logic game where you control a cube and roll to a target place. The twist in the gameplay is that the whole level design is based on the Penrose triangle[en.wikipedia.org].\n\nYou might get afraid of complex controls in those levels but don't worry, you can use a mouse (click to a place to move to), or a gamepad with analog stick, which I'd recommend. If you ever get lost or you won't know which directions you can move to, there's a circle with arrows on top of the screen that shows you. This can be really helpful at times when you'll be just wandering around the level, unable to find the right path.\n\nThe game has totally 65 levels, and all those have low difficulty. You can track the right way before any movement, or just move randomly until you find the right way in few minutes; it's up to you. This game can be a nice relaxing experience if you don't mind the ubiquitous optical illusion. It took me 98 minutes to beat all levels.\n\nGraphic style is minimalistic, which fits the game perfectly. The aural experience of hocus is made of a tranquil song and a sound for the cube's movement. While the game is ported from mobile platform, it's still a polished experience, I haven't found a single gameplay or visual bug through my playthrough.\n\nConclusion:hocus isn't a game that would make people excited, but it's a sleeper in many people's backlogs that deserves a play. It may be short but it offers you enough to enjoy levels designed with M. C. Escher's optical illusion in mind; you'll be done in about hour and half, and I think it's ok for a unique 2€ game.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","April 29","true","1.6"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

It's obviously a port from mobile, but oh well, it's playable.\n\nThe influence from Monument Valley is obvious, but it manages to do its own thing with the concept.  In fact, I'm enjoying this a bit more than Monument Valley.\n\nThough the graphics are lacking (almost completely), in Hocus, the intrigue of the perspective-twisting mechanic is given more room to breathe, freed from Monument Valley's ham-handed attempts at world-building in this emerging genre that is inherently poorly-suited to real, meaningful world-building.\n\nHocus does one thing and does it well, so I guess you could say it follows the Unix philosophy","November 18, 2015","true","1.8"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","30","43","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/recommended/418040/","pogobeta","Pogo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/","467 products in account","I usually get grumpy about mobile games getting ported to Steam, but I also have a soft spot for optical illusions and games based on them.\n\nHocus has a simple premise and is easy to start playing. Player input consists only of choosing which direction to move the red cube in an effort to guide it to the exit (or is it the entrance?). Once a direction is chosen, the cube moves until it reaches a junction, where it waits for your next instruction. There is no camera movement, because the fixed perspective is essential to the puzzle.\n\nThe early levels are simplified to get you accustomed to the rules. Later levels are more complex, but not necessarily more difficult. The only real downside with this kind of game is that since movement is necessarily limited to six possible directions, it becomes more of a 3D maze than a puzzle as many would think of it (I am totally fine with this, though). There are a few sections (especially in late levels) wherein many joints have only 2 available directions, and you spend more time moving/waiting than thinking/deciding. Most levels have more than one path to the exit, though the last few steps are usually fairly specific.\n\nThe splash screen states that the use of an analog gamepad is recommended, but I had a much easier time controlling the game by clicking with my mouse.\n\nI've seen a few people get bent out of shape over the price difference between this version and the mobile version. Here are some solutions:\nBuy it through your mobile device's app store\nBuy it through Steam when it is on sale\nShut up\nI've also seen a few complaints about how the actual game takes place in portrait mode (common practice for games that start out as mobile) with wide border sections on the left and right. This is evident to anybody who either watched the video or looked at the screenshots. In the actual game, the "empty" space is taken up by a slightly blurred version of the preceding and subsequent puzzles. This fact has no impact on the gameplay, and I think that using raw screenshots would have confused shoppers, as there would appear to be three puzzles on screen at once. Personally, I would have preferred solid white space on the sides, both for added focus on the puzzle at hand, and to fit in with the minimalist/tranquil aesthetic.\n\nAdditional levels will be added (at least 10 have been announced so far), and I assume they'll be around the same difficulty as the existing late-game levels.\n\nIt's a short, inexpensive puzzle, and I enjoyed it.\n\n₦ out of 10","January 1","true","2.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The levels also require zero skill to complete; one could finish every level with enough moving about as there are no puzzles.\n\nBoth the repetitiveness and lack of difficulty could be changed with the addition of new mechanics and features as the game progresses.\n\nI give this game a substandard 3/10 as after very little time the game becomes boring and too easy.\n","November 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Based around impossible shapes and the like and the game is basically treated as if everything that looks like it could touch is touching, so the puzzle becomes figuring out which sequence of moves gets you to the goal. It's a fun mechanic for a while, but after 65 levels of it, felt a little tiresome and repetitive. Apparently more levels are planned too, though I doubt I'd revisit this game to play them. Sound is minimal but pleasant. For a low price (a dollar or under) I'd imagine this would be worth the money and apparently it's on the app store so I'd say buy it there unless you can get it really cheap here. But it's a decent enough puzzler, for sure, if not a bit basic.","December 1, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you like mind-bending puzzle games, you will definitely like this one. I like it, becasue I can't see the solution path with one look, and I try a little to find the path.\n\nWith an analog gamepad it is preaty easy to use. I wish I could play with my keyboard but I guess the perspective doesn't allow that. The mouse or touch screen does just fine.\n\nI'd say price is very affordable, considering the hours of puzzles I am getting.\n\nI guess only downfall is that the game doesn't scale when I go fullscreen. I am sure the developer is aware of it and has a pretty good reason not to scale.\n\nCan't wait for expension packs :)","November 19, 2015","true","1.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Start at 0, and ask yourself the following questions:\n\nQ #1) What do you think of M.C. Escher's art?\n- If you LOVE it, add +7\n- If you Like his art, add +4\n- If you don't know who M.C. Escher is or don't like his art, add nothing.\n\nQ #2) Do you like casual puzzle games that have simple mouse controls and get more difficult as you progress?\n- If you say "HELL YES!".. then add +12\n- If you say "Ehh, sometimes they are cool".. then add +7\n- If you say "Not really, sometimes but rarely".. then add +3\n- If you say "Naw" or "Hell No!".. then add nothing.\n\nQ #3) Do you enjoy trying to solve fancy labyrinths that get pretty complex the more you solve?\n- If you say "OMG, I LOVE MAZES!" then add +10\n- If you say "Ehh, sometimes they are fun".. then add +6\n- If you say "Not too much but they can be okay".. then add +3\n- If you say "Nope" or "Who the hell wants to solve a dumb maze?".. then add nothing.\n\nSCORING TO DETERMINE IF YOU SHOULD BUY THIS OR NOT:\n\n- Scored 24 or more total points?  .. Then this game is a "MUST BUY!" for you!  ;-)\n- Scored 17-23 total points? ..Then chances are you will really like this game!\n- Scored 11-16 total points? ..Ehh, you might like it for about 10 minutes, but probably not a recommended game for you.\n- Scored 0 to 10 points? - Naw, I'd look for a different game, unless you catch it on like a '90% off' sale or something.\n\nMy personal review score from the video above I posted is a 79%.

This game has brought me more fun than most puzzle games where they are either too simple or mind-numbingly hard. This game is just a fun perception puzzle game that mixes the hard and easy to create that "Ah Ha!" moment right as you finish the levels. The fact that it might get a level editor is just plain amazing, and makes it alone right now is better, in my opinion, than a lot of "Puzzle" games I see on here. The developers are active and listen to the community and the concept is simple, but complex at the same time. It is a type of game that you can play over and over again, and the fact that it is $3 makes that game a pretty good deal. The music is very comforting and relaxing, while the puzzles can sometimes leave you thinking. The animations are pretty smooth and the game is just very pleasing to look at.

The game presents a simple labyrinth that you have to navigate; as should be obvious from the screenshots, there aren't that many branches, so the labyrinths are rather simply structured, if nicely presented. I spent ~2 hours to solve all 65 of these. The problem with this is that this would've taken even less time if the game wasn't so very slow. And I'm not even talking about the 5-second wait as you select a level that is spent watching some simple 2D animation, I'm talking about watching the red cube trundle along with an annoying electronic sound. You see, the cube moves automatically along any leg of the labyrinth once you set it in motion with a swipe of the mouse or a flick of the joystick, because unless it is at a branch it can't go anywhere else anyway, but while you can think 3 turns ahead easily, you have to watch the cube actually complete the journey. Slowly. Which bores me a lot, in fact so much so that I can only take this game in small doses or I'd get the urge to smash things.\n\nI suspect this slowness was introduced to hide the fact that there isn't really a lot to the labyrinths - if you could just swipe the cube along the legs quickly, you'd just as quickly blast through the game, which wouldn't be a problem if it had 200 levels or only cost less than a dollar (which it did in the sale).\n\nSo why would you want to play this? Besides looking cool, the labyrinths are really rather simple (so far, anyway, like I said I've completed 40 of 65), which means there isn't really any feeling of accomplishment that would offset persisting through the annoying slowness of the game which thus becomes its fatal flaw.\nUnless you want to show off by playing something that looks more like modern art than a game, there's no reason to buy this -- and if you do, you really ought to get it for your smartphone, shouldn't you?","December 1, 2015","false","2.7"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","3"

Escher's optical illusion drawings and all incorporate impossible shapes. They are essentialy 2D mazes that give 3D impression. It is a mobile port, you can play it with mouse or gamepad. You will lose sense of direction playing this, getting dizzy is also not out of question. :) Good thing is that you can always look in which directions you can move by checking circle on top of the screen, without it aimlessly wandering around would be common. Minimalist design will let you focus on puzzles with no other distractions.

I'm not saying make some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Escher-inspired game that runs worse than a legless grandpa and sell it. You'll be torn to shreds with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviews and endless shame. So, don't do that. Actually do it so I can make fun of you and egg your house.\n\nBut this Escher game is pretty sweet and on point. It's simple. It's not perfect (I'd like a 'quit' button in the main menu, and a simplistic view mode that only shows you the puzzle you're currently trying to get through, instead of showing you the previous one you just beat plus the next one on the sides), but it's worth your time.\n\nYou just move a little red cube around some crazy ♥♥♥ designs man that will spin your brain juices around til it hurts. Though this game suggests using a gamepad, just pointing and clicking where you want the cube to go feels absolutly fine. Yet my left hand sits over my WASD keys just craving for some love... she'll be fine though. And keep your Xbox controller in your mom's underwear drawer where it bloody belongs. ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥.\n\n60+ puzzles with more to come. Even after completing most of them you still won't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. That's life right there, bro. That's life.\n\nMove on.\n\nAnd if you place Hocus high, well then....\n\nPlus I don't like how this is the only game in my library with the first letter in the title being lowercased. Hurts me eyes. That's such a weak complaint, though. I guess it's alright. Maybe that's just another way they're ♥♥♥♥ing with us.
