If you enjoyed gameplay in titles such as Xenogears this game is for you. The story leaves some to be desired but the addicting gameplay in terms of control layout makes for a type of JRPG that hasn't been seen in a while. Turn based with button designated moves like Y for upwards attacks, A for downwards, X for Paralyze and B for ranged it keeps the turned based mechanic feeling fluent and fun through a somewhat recognizable outing. I give it a 8.5 based on the re-introduction of what made old-school niche RPG's fun and the fearless attempt at completely changing a gameplay layout from its prior successor. Although a lot different from Agarest 1 and Zero in terms of gameplay it makes for my personal most enjoyable entry into the series and could see this adaptation of mechanics extending its lifespan of the Record of Agarest War series to become one of the most favored in the genre in a long time in the niche market to come, Also Runs in 1080p/60fps.\n\n8.5/10","February 19, 2015","true","151.8"," 130 of 166 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","130","166","6","8"

I played a good number of JRPG's in high school and college, but it's been a couple years. Take this all with a grain of salt.\n\nPros:\n-Extensive character customization\n-From assigning points to stats, choosing what skills to train and deciding the formation of your characters. Min-maxing this is a challenge in and of itself, and will feel rewarding for those willing to dive into it.\n-100's of hours of gameplay for those devoted to completing this game and getting the best ending (and for only $20 or less on sale)\n-Combat is showy and has big numbers (again for those into that)\n-Music is honestly great.\n\nCons:\n-You need to know going into this game that when a character says "hey, go here!" you aren't going to get any more direction than that. Objectives aren't marked on the greater map, and you will actually have to go where the objective is to find it. (Once you get to the sub map it will show up as something being there.) Basically if you don't know where you are supposed to go you are going to end up searching the whole of the world for your objective.\n\n- I honestly found many of the characters to be  extremely  abrasive.  Once getting to the second generation, I kid you not, the first lines of the new main character is him saying (and I paraphrase here) "I'm only doing this because I was promised ♥♥♥♥♥s". He then turns to the female lead and tells her he would really like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ her. O,o  The character treats women as property and they all seem to just go along with it and accept their fate to be sex slaves.\n\n-As far as equipping and improving your characters, there seems to be a lack of availability of improved weapons outside of the DLC that is offered. If you look at the other agarest games you can see that the dev's generally release a 20$ game and then 40$ of DLC which makes the game easy beyond belief. They give you a taste of what the DLC is like by including a small pack with the game itself. Can you beat the game without the DLC? Yes. Is it a complete grind? Pretty much.\n\n-When it comes to endings there are two: the bad ending and the "one true ending". (This is apparently a commonality between this game and its predecessors. ) Know that if you want the good ending you are going to have to make all the "right" choices, complete all hunters’ guild quests and complete every event available. It's a lot of work, and if you miss one thing you get the bad ending. If you don't care about what kind of ending you get then this isn't a big deal, just something to know before diving in.\n\n\nFor people who are diehard fans of games like this, you'll enjoy it. There's a lot here to enjoy. If you are someone who like RPG's but are used to a more guided approach, this game can be very frustrating. For people who don't necessarily understand Japanese approaches to sexuality and duty, the motivation of Agarest's characters can be really confusing. If you are just looking to see anime boobs, go play another game or use google. There is some fan service, as to be expected, but it is actually a pretty small part of this game (thankfully).\n\n\nPersonally, will I play this game more: Maybe? It's hard to say. This game is easy to lose time to, frustrating and ultimately decently rewarding. If you are iffy on getting this game, just wait for a steam sale, and consider picking up the DLC with it. It will make the game a lot easier and if you change your mind about using it you can toggle it off and grind the game like everyone else.\n\n\nI can confidently say I've played much better JRPG's. I'd give this game 5/10.\n","March 4, 2015","false","101.5"," 286 of 403 people (71%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","71","286","403","24","13"

The game uses the same "Universe" but has a totally new story and battle system.\n\nThe battle system (to me) feels something like Tales of Graces mixed with turn based combat. At first, it is confusing and I must admit it is just button mashing whichever you think does the most damage or fastest to end battles faster (down/A is the fastest btw). During the first generation of the game you will gain new combat abilities and skills which you can then use as combos so the battles should be less button mashing and more strategical (although the tutorial I admit doesn't really explain it that well). I learnt by playing it mainly and watching some vids on youtube. When you do slowly understand bits and pieces of the battle system, it gets way more fun to do combos and also you will need to use them to beat bosses in later generations (mostly if you are playing in Hard). Later generations the battles get harder but you should have at least a vague idea of doing combos and stuff by then.\n\nThe Universe/world is now somewhat open world with random battles popping up every now and then. There is still the "move from this spot to next" like the previous Agarest series as "dungeons/caves etc"\n\nThe game is still has its dating sim/VN effect. There is a new "mini game" where you can play to get affection/stats for your waifu's but is totally optional if you don't want to play. This is just massaging waifu's which is weird-ish and hard to do but it's a good new part of the game.\n\nOverall, with the new storyline, the game is very interesting and fun to play. There is no lag for me when I play. If you are looking for a J-SRPG that is way worth your money (easily 80+ hours to complete) I would recommend the Agarest series.\n\nOne extra thing I will add is the censorship of this game. It is missing 4 CG's one playable massage character for the first two generations (because she is considered a child) and a DLC character that you had to pay for and could ONLY use in fights(I believe? Also because she is considered a child). But if this is what it takes for this game to get onto Steam it is well worth. The missing content is about 5 minutes of gameplay out of a 80+ hour storyline.","February 20, 2015","true","221.4"," 58 of 77 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","58","77","4","2"

As the third entry (or so) in the series, the game's battle system has been much improved.  The game is a grindy rpg with romance elements and a highly scalable and complex  battle system that revolves around customizable characters (e.g. no fixed classes).\n\nThe problem that prevents me from recommending the game is the high price of the DLC and the altered/removed content.  When I play a game, I like to know that I have a chance at least to see all of the content that the game has to offer.  I probably won't have the opportunity to play through more than once, so it is important for me to feel like I am getting the full experience.   As you can find detailed elsewhere, certain content from the original game is not in this steam PC version.\n\nAdditionally, the absurdly high price of the DLC is a problem. The DLC items help reduce the highly grindy nature of the game and make it a more bearable experience for people whose available gaming time may not be what it once was.  The DLC would be fairly priced at $1-3 per pack, not where it is at the time of this review ~$8 per pack.  Purchasing all of the DLC would actually cost more than the original game.","April 6, 2015","false","23.0"," 53 of 74 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","53","74","6","1"

Cutscenes blend both hybrid-CG art and dynamic 2d sprite events, a big step up from the much more traditional route the 1st game had. Even more important is the gameplay; they made combat MUCH better in my opinion. It's similar to Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth where emphasis is on chaining combos at a fast pace (still has a strategy grid as well, so it's a blend of real-time sRPG), instead of the dreadfully slow sRPG style from its predacessor. It definitely feels more engaged and doesn't make combat feel like a chore anymore.\n\nIt's a huge step in the right direction. If you enjoyed the dating sim aspect of the first one but couldn't get into the combat, I highly recommend this sequel as it improves drastically over the tedious nature of the first game, it's actually fun to play.","February 19, 2015","true","16.2"," 39 of 53 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","39","53","0","0"

Of course it's not without its cons (every game has them), but something to keep in mind is that it's extremely good and easily appreciated for a 3 year old niche game.\n\nFavourite part of the game:\n• As always in the Agarest series, it has the incredible aspect of "you will naturally end up with the one you like more if you choose options you normally would".\n--> A lot of people make a claim that this is deterred by the desire to reach the "true ending".  If you truly want to enjoy this game, don't look up a guide for it.  Turn it into your own experience.  The developers have also learned from the other Agarest games and added a "normal ending", which doesn't restrict access to things the "true ending" gives you.\n\nOther stuff:\n• The combat is extremely entertaining once you get the hang of it and look up a tutorial video or two online.\n--> I was originally deterred by the apparent complexity and that it's unlike Agarest Zero and the first, but this was quickly overcome and this combat system is definitely more enjoyable (at least for me), because it's faster-paced without compromising strategy too much.\n• The characters are absolutely lovable, and for reasons other than their 'sexiness' and which waifu you like more.\n• The story always has you interested and plays out almost like a visual novel, which is fantastic since a lot of the cut-scenes can take up more than 10 minutes.\n\nCons:\n• It's not obvious where you should go next.  Easily the biggest problem with this game, but it's not too much of a problem if you know how to navigate everywhere and don't mind being lost for a few minutes every once in a while.  The important thing is that it still says that a location has an event if it has an event.\n• Strict "true end" path.  I repeat though, for maximum enjoyment it's best to not look up a guide and odds are you'll get the normal ending if you actively try to visit most events and finish most commissions (small objectives) anyway.","March 14, 2015","true","51.5"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apsalar54/recommended/312790/","apsalar54","Apsalar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apsalar54/","1935 products in account","The developer provided a key to Original Group for the purpose of this review.\n\nThis is a difficult game to write about.  What it does, it does very well for the most part.  It's just that "what it does" may not appeal to a broad audience.  This Agarest game has the sort of epic, sweeping plot we expect from JRPGs, complete with deicide, ancient mysteries, untapped powers, and (of course) amnesia.  The amnesia on the part of the rather unlikable protagonist makes it easy for a player to jump in even if they have not played Agarest 1 or Zero.  The characters are much more central to the movement of the game than the epic plot tropes are.  There are many characters, each with distinct, well-written and fleshed-out personalities and motives.  Each has a role to play and the player has some minor control over the direction that role takes.\n\nSo what is the actual gameplay like?  There are two basic types of gameplay in Agarest 2: tactical battle and visual novel.  The visual novel portions, though very well-written, are long and unavoidable.  The choices you make in these sections affect the love characters feel for the protagonist- because like any good visual novel, these sections ultimately amount to a dating sim, in this case spanning three generations of characters.  The tactical battles are curious.  If you are expecting something in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics look elsewhere.  The grids on which the battles take place determine the viability of your various combos and is not a field you can manually move around.  What's more, the combos in question are executed arcade style- I found myself mashing buttons maniacally to maximize damage.\n\nIf these types of battles don't appeal to you, be wary.  Agarest is a grind, a very serious grind.   The vast majority of game time is spent fighting battles again and again and again.  I find them to be pretty fun battles, but after a while I find myself throwing on Netflix while I absently mash through battles to fulfill my goals.  The battles become more fun once you unlock all the various character customization options, but just getting there takes a good five hours of grinding.\n\nWhich brings me to the last point I want to be sure to mention.  I found the text-based in-menu tutorials on how to use the various systems so confusing that I actually understood less after reading them.  I learned how the systems worked through trial and error.  I'm not sure how much of this is due to obtuse writing and how much is due to ADD.  The menu pages are ornately decorated to the point of gaudy opulence.  These decorations add nothing to the information and for me, someone who struggles with ADD, I found them incredibly disruptive.  I know others out there have the same struggle, so prepare yourself if you do.  For those who don't struggle in this manner, enjoy the gorgeous menus.\n\n6.5/10 Recommended to fans of visual novels and folks who play JRPGs for the plot and don't mind a good long grind.","May 12, 2015","true","8.8"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etian_helvold/recommended/312790/","etian_helvold","Etian Helvold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etian_helvold/","186 products in account","The third game in the Agarest series (a series of Tactical Japanese Roleplaying Games), one that got a lot of changes done to it. The game is certainly different most notably the overworld and the battle system.\n\nThe story is set in an alternate Agarest, with only its background related to the previous games.\nIn Agarest 2 you follow the tale of Weiss, a young man who met a young Archeologist named Fastie and with his help found the seal of Chaos, a god of Agarest, Weiss wanted a miracle, he wanted someone he loved brought back to life, a life given while in service to the Gods. Chaos refused to give him a miracle and Weiss slew him out of frustration for their supposed negligence. As Chaos was slain a massive light engulfed Agarest. Weiss wakes up with no recollection of his past, gravely injured and being healed by a young woman called Aina. Soon after he meets Eva, a woman who claims to be an "Agent of the God", mocking Weiss and calling him a God Slayer, she explains it to him he must become a Spirit Vessel for the rebirth of the god he slew but for that he must collect the power that was scattered upon his death, otherwise along with the increasing number of demons the world would be doomed.\n\nThis game is completely independent from the other two, but I do recommend that you play them by order of release (Agarest: Generations of War, Agarest: Generations of War Zero and then Agarest: Generations of War 2) because the games share the same universe and still have lots of references and common knowledge.\n\nIn terms of graphics the game has improved, you can see the art has evolved quite well though still similar to the previous games and that the sprites and effects have improved a lot too.\n\nThe voice acting and the translation I am not able to review as I don't know Japanese. The Japanese voice acting like in most JRPGs is nice because it usually beats any english dub.\n\nThe gameplay is quite different and has become a bit more complex as well, it's still turn based combat during each turn all of your characters play and you may choose to do several actions such as:\n- Attacking\n- Support actions (items/buffs and heals)\n- Standby (doing nothing is an action... right?)\n- Exchange character with a waiting character\n- Escape\n- Ex skills which are buffs that consume SP and affect all the party members in formation and finally change the leader of your party.\nAll of these actions above add "Wait" to your characters, "wait" may cause them to skip their turn and affects turn order, in case you accumulate enough "wait" your characters will go into "Overwait" which makes them unable to attack and skip quite the amount of turns.\nI won't go into further detail as the tutorial explains the game quite well.\nLike in my review for Zero, I suggest you watch a gameplay video or two possibly one that includes the tutorial.\n\nCompared to the other games, Agarest 2 has improved mostly on the graphics as I'd say the gameplay is a matter of opinion, personally I enjoyed this one the most. Weiss can be costumized just as Sieghart (Zero's main character) was in Agarest Zero using a system similar to the card system.\nThe only sad thing about this game is that it lost a DLC and a few CGs to the censorship when it was originally localized for the PS3.\nI've heard the game is far better than the PS3 version it works perfectly on most computers that meet the requirements.\nI'll be updating this review later, possibly with a small description of the combat.\n\n","February 20, 2015","true","257.4"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","18","27","2","0"

But still falls flat\n\nMy exposure to the Agarest series has been quite long. In fact from the very first Generations of War, up until ZERO and now this. This installment was supposed to be the defining chapter for the series and to me, it fell quite short in very many ways. For every positive outlined below, there will almost certainly be an overbearing glaring negative.\n\nTo begin with the new animated character portraits during spoken dialogue mark a fascinating turn for the series going forward. This simple addition to the visuals provides some flair to the tedium of still having to read through text "visual-novel" style. Did I mention that despite the voice acting present, all voices are in the native Japanese? While not inherently bad as the voice actors are competent, expect a lengthy script with PLENTY of reading. As for the environments, well there's some variety and even change when it comes to battle transitions. Sadly there's still no environmental interaction to be had within battles\n\nGameplay revolves around traversing a world map, transitioning to a battle screen, then taking part in grid-based turn-based combat featuring members of your party. In a marked departure from the earlier games, you don't position all your characters on the grid with a Move phase then Attack phase. Instead you can now determine formations prior to fights, obtain stat bonuses per formation then switch leaders around to change the formations (hence bonus) mid-fight. Since there is no separate move phase you get into formation and then press one of 4 Face buttons onscreen to perform attack types such as Launch and Stun etc. Since this system has become combo based in order to maintain high damage strings it's become a case of button-mashing with minimal strategy involved. And since the battles are RANDOM in nature......... Now, levelling up. This title has THREE separate level up variants consisting of "Technical Points" (for moves), "Party Points" (ability points shared out within the party) and "Control Points" (enabling you to SET moves in your character's repertoire including combinations). As you can imagine, juggling all these is complicated and tedious at best.\n\nThe story...... is quite atrocious really. On top of the usual kill the demon and marry one heroine per generation (max out at 3), motives for doing what is needed are pretty much non-existent. Add to this the lack of any sort of intrigue (the light political intrigue of the earlier Agarest wasn't bad) and you end up with an unnecessarily lengthy tale whose characters fit set cliched molds.... At least the music especially in special boss dungeons is great. Don't let me even get started on how long it will take before you start fighting the heavy hitters with their loads of three-tier experience points.\n\nSo, should you buy this game? Proceed with caution if you must, but if you are prepared for a LARGE chunk of your time being eaten up by a mediocre tale, then be my guest. Get it on a sale. A significant sale..... Ahhh yes. There's plenty of DLC offering weaponry, add-on dungeons, smithing loot and experience points for the spikes in difficulty. Which brings me to another demerit. Every single piece of DLC for this game is just pricey... Why would I have to PAY for stuff that should be ingame and unlocked especially if you meet special battle conditions/story conditions?\n\nYou've been warned.","June 22, 2015","false","73.6"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","19","31","2","0"

The battle system has been changed quite a bit, there is less strategy elements involved but they have focused on making it quite a bit faster by tying your characters skills to 4 keys:\n\n(L) for ranged attacks.\n(K) for down attacks.\n(J) For stun attack.\n(I) for Burst attacks.\n\nThis allows you to pull off smooth combos with the addition of allowing you to use the arrow keys to switch between characters on the fly, but unfortunately, can't move your characters around the battlefield and you can only control 4 characters now instead of 6. Despite the combat being toned down on the strategy elements, you feel more involved with the combat instead of giving instructions and watching your characters do the moves.\n\nYou can now freely move around the world map instead of following set's of lines laid out for you, which has lead to a lot less of "You must do this battle to proceed" stuff (even though they are still present at certain loactions) and more of you will engage in combat at random times, but they have added the ability for you to manually engage in battle by pressing the page up key.\n\nSkills are laid out differently and are no longer tied to weapon slots, you must gain new abilities by collecting books and equiping them on a character, to which you spend TP you get them. Once a character has got the skill, it is tied to one of the 4 move sets and some have special conditions that you must meet with that character before you can equip it on said character. It also teaches you to give specific characters certain skills as they can use them more effectively then others.\n\nThe art design is very similar to Agarest Zero and follows in it's foot steps when it comes to the cutscenes but Generations 2 now includes proper animated cutscenes and even delivers in the whole opening that animes usually do.\n\nAt the end of it, I personally enjoyed my time with it. The combat for me feel's more interactive and a lot faster then it's predecessors but it is unfortunate that you can't move the characters anymore. The story is pretty much the same just told a little bit differently which I don't really mind as much, as they seem to know what they're doing and would rather stick with what they know how to do rather then mixing it up. It can be a bit daunting at first glance with the leveling up system, skills etc, but you will come to understand all of it as the tutorial explains the mechanics pretty well. All in all, I would recommend it, you will have a blast with it as it's RPG elements are quite indepth and it will provide you with hours and hours of content for it's asking price.","February 19, 2015","true","11.3"," 31 of 56 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","31","56","3","4"

Additionally, the story and writing feel like they are doing the same thing with little changes with many of the characters being essentially reskinned versions of past.\n\nAs for my hours - A) I accidentally left it on overnight a couple of times and B) I was trying to get through to review it for my site but eventualyl the game just didn't work for me personally.

Proceed with research in hand before contemplating whether you should buy it (MasterLL's channel has a playthrough of the PS3 version of his youtube channel if you want to see the game in action.)\n\nFull thoughtsOk so this is a weird one.\n\nThe game has a fun combat system that can take a little time to get your head around. The flashy attacks, and fluid sprite animations are a joy on the eyes. Despite the fact some attacks can take a silly amount of time to complete, you may just end up never skipping them because they are so over the top, they're fantastic. Japanese anime like attacks at their finest.\n\nHowever everything else is just... meh. The characters are typical japanese anime tropes for the most part. There isn't anything wrong with this if they are done well, but I thought that only a few of them were entertaining to watch. The writing isn't too bad though and the japanese voice acting is above average. There is no english dub for the voices so if you don't care for reading subtitles this might irk you.\n\nThe story is also sort of nonsensical. Nobody ever questions some of the stuff going on. For example you proceed through generations of characters where the child of the previous protaginist will continue on 18 or 20 years in the future (I think its around that long...). So some characters pass away yet another character who should be dead somehow manages to stay alive and, no one seems to bat an eyelid about it, despite him being human. The reason why is given later but you'll have probably worked it out yourself way before this happens. And generally the plot towards the end gets so little explanation that the objective for their quest begins to become questionable. I won't spoil anything but I've read better stories out of a childrens book.\n\nAlso FANSERVICE. FANSERVICE EVERYWHERE. Seriously there are minigames where you have to massage your female companions in order to improve affection, their stats, or technique points. And if you are going for a paticular ending this may be seen as mandatory, unless you want to spend hours grinding. The fanservice was toned down in this version though as it seems to be censored during some scenes and images/dialogue was removed or altered.\n\nAnd you will grind in this game. Not for levels however, more for the comissions and materials to make better weapons. If you do purchase the game I'll give you a hint and say that the strength of your equipment if far more important than your levels, especially when you start reinforcing them.\n\nSo despite the fact I've put around 143 hours into the game I can't recommend it. I like it despite the negativity you might be seeing from this review but honestly you could put those hours into a game that is far better than just anm average game. Proceed with caution if you do decide to play it, and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE for your own sake! Go for the true ending path (Might need a guide for this one.) The normal ending is a punch to the stomach after the time you put into it.

The problem is that its missing everything that made the first two games so great and it falls short of being an enjoyable experience and more tedious than anything else. Lots of times I find myself backtracking just to get the True Ending by making sure I killed a certain amount of monsters. The issue is that some areas are just so far and tedious to get to that you will run from several battles just trying to get their. Honestly the change to an open world rather than an interactive Maps ruins the game because it doesn't give it a clear objective of where to go. In previous game there was always a red dot saying event and that was great because I knew where to go and red dots means places unexplored. In this game you are told in dialogue and thats it, a lot of times they will just reference that the team should go to a new cave or mountain without much detail where the mountain or cave even is making it a goose chase.\n\nAll in all I think I will finish the game to get my money's worth but I cannot recommned this game with confidence. If you are a big Agarest fan just go in with the mentality that this is nothing like the first 2 then that should give you an idea to not get your hopes up. If you want to get into the series play 1 or Zero because those are amazing and have an amazing story.\n\nPros\n+ Ability to escape\n+ Arguably better visuals\n+ There is a main central city with dynamic side characters\n+ Jainus + Chloe was a very touching story\n+ Improved Monster book\n\nCons\n- Battle system isn't so easy to understand\n- How you learn skills is pretty difficult to understand at first\n- Main Characters past 1st Gen are not likeable at all\n- No sense of direction\n- Story isn't very enticing","August 7, 2015","false","46.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

I haven't had fun in a while since the previous Tales games, Fire Emblem Awakening, Bravely Default, Ni No Kuni, Legend of Heroes, and such that I've played. This is another fantastic gem you can get on Steam.\n\nYESSES\n\n+ Story:\nGenerational storytelling and endings tied to quests and dialog choices. No loss for not playing the other two games.\n\n+ Memorable cast of characters:\nEach character you come across has a unique personality. Proud to modest; willful to docile; wise to arrogant; funny and serious. Their words and actions create a reaction in you. Along with cirumstances in the story, you are made to yearn, wonder, and imagine about them.\n\nYou have male MCs who unconciously attract bodacious herems. You have OPAI, PANTSU, EICHI, partial nudity, bouncing chests, and cheapshots. All the girls have perfect shapes and sizes.\n\n+ Profound skill and combat system:\nThis is an SRPG -defined- . Four types of attacks which can be sequenced up to 3 times (similar to Hyperdimension games); including combination attacks; Originals; Ultimate attacks; Finishers; elemental attributes; stats and abilities; support and extend skills; tons of items and upgrades; and limited-movement (easy to grasp) grid-based battles.\n\nIt might appear confusing or intimidating at first, but don't be. It's just "there" for you. With a fair difficulty curve, you're in no hurry to master it. If you do - and you create an effective party - you will feel like a badass.\n\n+ Visual Novel elements included:\nI'm a (J)RPG and VN fan. SWEET. Here you find lip syncing, facial expressions, and fluid sprite animations that only CH and IF can provide. Almost life-like in any VN game.\n\n+ Music\nThe touching melodies move me. The head-pounding metal makes me pause, listen, and sing/play along in the middle of battle.\n\nSO-SOES\n\n~ Romance:\nNeed more time and intimacy with WAIFUS, romantic choices and scenes, but not to be a complete Gal Game. The game does follow up on your romantic choices. Relationships are shallow and get cut off at three points in the game.\n\n~ World and level design:\nSix islandic regions to explore, spiced with random battles which can be avoided with a special item later in, random battles on a key/button press, occasional treasure points, minimal though slow backtracking, and warp points that unlock as per the story, thankfully. Overworld looks flat and lifeless. No curious caves or dungeons.\n\nIncludes "Point Maps": Maps within the overworld that I can never navigate swiftly, and where 'free cursor navigation' would do best, my friendly developers. They have nodes that contain random battles like flipping old food plates to see what types and number of vermin there are. My only motivation to explore was for monster hunting, XP/item grinding, and story progression.\n\nSpeaking of such, story progression and access to special scenes are scripted and event-based. You visit a place to watch an event only when available and that's -it-. Can't look back unless you've collected those events in your 'encyclopedia'. No revisiting places or people out of curiosity.\n\n~ Enemies:\nChanges in size, color, skins, and names. Very rarely you encounter unique-looking bosses, and for story bosses it's just a given to look unique. You may also notice the switch between 2D puppet animations and 3D models, which is agreeable from a design standpoint. Enemies can also learn the same attacks that you learn. Hunting can be a pain. It's a pain to get surprise encounters when you're overleveled and you have to sit and watch them squirm, only you want to escape because they aren't the monsters you're hunting.\n\nNOES\n\n- Not enough unwholesome content:\nIf you endeavor to empty that tissue box or stain your peripherals, then find another game. Then again, my standards could just be higher than yours.","March 5, 2015","true","113.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

It's a roleplaying game, whatever happened to scrolling through a menu to find an attack, or simply hitting the button labelled "attack"?!\n\n2) The storyline.

It crashed after the first battle, and never started up again, even after reinstallation. The game is practically made out of gum and a toothpick and if you look at it wrong it will smash into a million pieces and never work again.\n\n4) Downloadable content is far too expensive without the flash sales.

The combat systems is well done for the genre, which is critical since the gameplay follows a linear schematic of running between cutscenes/dialogue sequences with battles sprinkled in there. There is not a whole lot of room for exploration. While that is not necessarily a bad thing (linear stories can be very strong and very well done), the main plot seems a bit repetitive even in the first generation and by the second generation is completely predictable.\n\nI will admit that I did not finish this game, but gave it about 12 hours of my time hoping and praying the game would get better, as many JRPGs start off relatively slowly. This one just never took off for me, and was genuinely offputting starting in generation 2. This might be up your alley if you enjoyed the rest of the series, but it didn't do it for me.","December 27, 2015","false","11.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

So do not expect to develop every character by buying every skillbook and getting every playable character to learn everything during the main storyline. Having high or low level do not affect much, Over levelled = the EXP/TP diminishes. Underlevelled = huge payoff on EXP/TP. Which means you will reach a point of saturation and it becomes overly time consuming to train everyone, this happens at the start of 2nd Gen onwards. This is something that causes high difficulty in the main game, The game bosses gives you the bare minimum's worth of TP, spending them wisely on 4 characters each Generation, the HARD mode will be playable even without DLC for newbies. The DLC for this is game breaking, only the extra characters were worth collecting.\n\nStory: 5/10\nGraphic: 7/10\nBattle system: 9/10\nReplay value: 8/10\nDLC: 2/10\n\nLike:\n-Improvement in the combat system making each battle pace much faster than its predecessor, thus less repetitive\n-Interesting dialogue and characters\n-Tutorials are adequate and not overly lengthy\n-Beautiful environment\n-New game+ to replay the game with existing equipment and items unlocked in item store\n-Doesn't have too much missable in the storyline other than the True ending which require certain affection level of characters\n-TP shop, without the DLC your only hope of overkilling bosses in the 1st/2nd Gen is buying a weapon to do the job. The game wouldn't be fun without it\n-The Hard mode which has additional end game features is playable even at first try\n\nDislike:\n-Dialogue can only be fast forward, it cannot be skipped\n-Storyline is repetitive, each generation is about finding the 3 maiden\n-Not many different BGM\n-DLC equipment making the game very easy\n-DLC dungeons are mere clones of places/ enemy in later part of storyline\n-No story progression for DLC characters\n-Main characters carry the gun/spear/scyth/sword/staff/knuckle in the same way, making some weapon look very awkward\n-Game is too short, I had a very long playtime because I was discontented with the main character created at the end of each generation.\n-Character sprites in low definition (Have a look at Fairy Fencer F, they are capable of such improvements)\n-If you didn't pay attention to where to go next, you will have to venture or find a walkthrough or ask someone on the forum. The game doesn't repeat itself on the next objective.\n-If you are having 6 loot or more in one battle, it will not be shown. Eg. I stole 2 items, overkilled 4 monsters are one go- there should be 2 steals, 4 overkill loots and maybe some normal/rare drop. Only 5 is displayed.","September 16, 2015","true","195.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I highly recommend this for JRPG gamers and for RPG gamers that wants to add an anime feel on their RPG experience. The story is immersing and the characters have certain interactions with the main character that makes you feel more "into the game".\n\nThe only thing that I don't like with some of the JRPG games are the "true endings" route wherein if you make a false move, even for just one decision, you'll never be able to get a good ending. This made me become reliant on walkthroughs for the game since I always want to finish RPGs without walkthroughs in my first run. But since the story is so epic, I wanted to have the true ending in first run.\n\nThat is the only CON that I can think of. The graphics are great and very anime styled. The characters profiles and stories are in-depth. The game mechanics are unique and very interactive since it has this combo feature. Overall, this is a good buy in the Steam store (you can always wait for a sale and its even better...  I bought it at a sale price plus all DLCs and I don't regret doing that) for the JRPG fans and RPG fans that want to try a new twist to their games.","October 12, 2015","true","97.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Expectations\n2. Explanations\n3. Recommendations\n\n\n1. Expectations\n\n- I love agarest 1 (A1) and zero (A0) and I will return to Zero and eventually 1 since they are such good games.\n- I expected  agarest 2 (A2) would have a similar battle system to A1 and A0 "It does not"\n- I expected A2 to have same level of romance and party builder "it does it better"\n- I expected A2 to have better graphics than A1 and A0 "it does that"\n-The ingame tutorial would help me alot "nope"\n- Overall i started out A2 with a negative view and stopped playing because the battle system was too complicated and different\n\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The battle system: in A1 and A0, each move done during an attack was planned out and chosen by you in order and then executed when you press a button. In A2, the attack consists of your direct inputs on your controller/keyboard one after another in succession under a time limit.\n\nThere are 2 implications that this causes:\n\n1. You need to know exactly what you plan on doing beforehand before you attack. Even more so than A1 and A0. When you start an attack, you cant stop and think.\n2. Button mashing is the default way to play without the brain\n\nThis is V different to A1 and A0. At the stage of 29.10.2015, I am 14 hours into the game and have just worked out how to do combination attacks. I read up guides on gamefaqs and steam discussion and now i feel like i actually know how 10% of battle works. I dont even know what SP does or why to use it etc. The battle system is COMPLICATED\n\n-Romance and relationships: This is where I feel A2 has outdone A1 and A0. in A1 and A0, your relationships with your party members do not play much of an impact during battle, now it does. Also, getting to know NPCs in town is also a cool addition. For me, character development in this game feels better than A1 and maybe even A0.\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n-A2 has a different battle system to A1 and A0. If you loved the battle system in A1 and A0, please watch a youtube battle of A2 before you decide whether to buy this game\n\n- Please read a guide on how to battle from gamefaqs and steam discussion. It really really helps\n\n- If you already have this game and are stumped by the battle system, i recommend push through and keep at it.\nIt actually gets much better as time goes on and you master it. It gives a good feeling once you work out a combo or a combat mechanic and use it to your advantage. The only other time i have felt that feeling of "discovery pleasure" was in the dark souls series.\n\n-If you liked the romance in A1 and A0, then try this. Its different but somewhat better I feel.\n\n*Update to follow as I continue to play*","October 28, 2015","true","27.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are searching for some quick fun and a easy-to-understand-gameplay, you may be better off with another game.\n\nStory: 6.5\nCharacters: 5.0\nGameplay: 9.0\nSound/Voices: 6.0\n\nStory\n\nTo keep it short: There is probalbly not much in here, you haven´t seen somewhere else allready. The story is nice but ovarall pretty predictable. You have to become a vessel for a new god while fighting of demons. These two things are what keeps the story going. To be absolutly honest, I found myself skipping through the story in the later parts. It just didn´t catch me. Regardless, I can see that the developers really tried and at time I liked what they presented. So I give a 6.5 for the story.\n\nCharacters\n\nMaybe I will receive alot of hate for saying this, but the characters where the main point which almost made me drop this game. Firstly I want to make a general statement in terms to character presentation. I found it really hard to take any of them serious. Why? Because of the *breast bouncing* thing.\nConversations with the heroins normally go as follows:\n\n"We have a very serious discussion about the future of this world" *breast bouncing*\n"Your deeds where a terrible mistake" *breast bouncing*\n"You have to make up for your errors" *breast bouncing*\n"..." *breast bouncing*\n\nWhile I do like breasts, this was totally ridiculous. I was irritated by it the whole time and can only assume the developers did this to make the heroins appear more attraktiv. Which in my oppinion absolutely failed.\n\nAs this section is allready pretty big, I will keep things a little bit shorter as I originally had planed. There where a few characters I liked but the main problem is that there where to many that ranged from "I don´t care about you" to "Please shut up...seriously just shut up". The Fiona-girl got especially on my nerves and the third generation MC made me start the whole game all over again to get a second-generation MC I could use further in battles, as I my first thought after a battle with the third gen MC was...ugh nope...\nSome people mentioned that they didn´t like the sec gen MC. In my opinion he was the most human of the three MCs and the one I liked the most too. To keep things fair I also have to say that I really liked the more mature Fiona of the third gen. Nonetheless, I can only give a 5.0 for the characters in this game.\n\nGameplay\n\nThis is where the game really shines. I have to admit, it almost took me 20 hours of gameplay-time to understand the battle and character system. The tutorial really doesn´t help much and I really had to google many things. If you are into these kind of complex things (as I am), you are rewarded with some of the best combat and character system I have seen in a long time. The system is complex without giving the impression of anything in it to be unnecessary. You have to micro-manage many things to build a powerfull party. I really liked that. I give a 9.0 for the system while reducing a point for the fact that you have to google even the tiniest bit of information. That includes the lack of quest markers and others things that would really had made your life so much easier.\n\nSound/Voices\n\nThe soundtrack of agarest 2 is decent. There are some tracks, especially the battlethemes, that are really nice. The voicecast is done nicely too, but then again I have to admit that I had to turn it of because some characters drove my blood pressure into higher grounds (Oh just shut up Fiona!! I don´t care if you got a level up). I give this section a 6.0 while reducing a point for the need to turn the voices of.\n\nConclusion\n\nAgarest 2 is a nice game in which you really can sink your time into. Sadly the Story and Characters aren´t as strong as the gameplay. I would still recomend this game as something you can enjoy while ignoring the story, as it offers lots of challenging fights with the possibility to customise your character alot.\n\nIf you are looking for something that has a strong story and good characters try "G-senjou no Maou" (Yeah, it has sex in it, but as I said, I like breasts).\nIf you are looking for something that is easy to get into, try Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn.","April 20, 2015","true","103.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/s4tdlover/recommended/312790/","s4tdlover","Rishoune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/s4tdlover/","31 products in account","After having lost a few weeks of sleep to Agarest: Zero, I was eagerly awaiting Agarest 2. Infact when I saw it release at about 4am on steam finally, I could not have clicked the "Buy" button any harder. And for sure a lot has changed in the third game. Now that I found time to actively play through it thoroughly, figured a review wouldn't hurt.\n\nOverall, it's very fun. There are many, mostly positive changes to the series compared to the previous game, Agarest Zero.\n\nStory:\nIf you're able to immerse into a game's plot or story, you'll enjoy Agarest 2 or any Agarest game. But whether you're a returning fan or new to the series, be warned that Agarest 2's story is far darker, cuder, and more of a "grim reality" compared to previous games. However, just like in-game, there's always light in the dark. You'll end up appreciating the happy moments all the more. Just don't go into it expecting child-friendly content. Just like in a good anime, there will be swearing, inneundos, and action a-plenty. Not for the easily-offended or too-uptight.\n(Personally, I loved Gen2. The character developement and characters overall were by far my favorite by the end.)\n\nCombat & In-game features:\nAs opposed to previous entries where you would move your party around a board, then initiate attacks in turn order, Agarest 2 tried, and very well succeeds in changing the combat pace of the Agarest series. You no longer move around a board, rather you sit on "your side" and launchs attacks at enemies, which can move you out of formation or into enemy territory. And rather than picking a bunch of commands, you now input the attacks as they happen. While it will seem basic at first, eventually with practice you'll be chaining many different combo and group attacks in one long chain (and as a bonus, the bigger you combo chain, the more damage per-hit you deal for that chain).\n\nA few things were blundered with though. Firstly, navigation and finding events or even the main quest can be extremely irritating. You have no markers on the minimap, no arrow, no way to re-read the last event to see where you're meant to go, so if you stop playing the game for awhile and can't remember or did not write it down, you may spend a lot of time searching for it. And in the same suit, the game will often unlock 'optional' event fights or mini-bosses you can find around the maps when you complete Commissions, but it tends to be cryptic in that fact. I was nearly done with Gen1 before I even realized some of these events were actually spawning event-monsters.\n\nBalance:\nI remember one fight in Agarest Zero's 2nd Gen, that I shamefully admit was a brick wall, I could not beat it until I caved in and purchased the best weapon DLC pack they had. However, I've yet to encounter such a "great wall of china" difficulty spike in Agarest 2 (I tribute this partially to the new combat system, when learned it can be heavily abused in your favor).\nThe temptation of DLC will always exist, and there are times when it does seem like it'd be a good idea to spend $5~$10 on a pack, purely for the sake of breezing through. I haven't needed to do so, but if you really like the game and are having trouble or don't want to spend a fair amount of time farming/upgrading, pick up any of the packs when they go on sale, even just 1 can make all the difference. But unlike previous games, some insanely powerful gear can be obtained early on with some time investment. But whichever is your personal preference, either route is enjoyable.\n\nCustomizing & Chars:\nAs usual in an Agarest game, there's a healthy and entertaining cast of chars you'll have throughout the game. And while they all come leaned towards one playstyle or another, the amount of customizing in terms of skills and stats you can do with them is rather interesting. Which is nice considering Agarest: Zero was rather restrictive in that sense.\n(I do miss the dynamic changing outfits based on their affections from Zero though).\n\nOverall it's a great addition to the series, as well as a good game for anyone new to the series, great game series overall, you'll spend a good amount of enjoyable time in any Agarest game really. But I will re-iterate that of the series, 2 is the darker of the games (not a bad thing, if you're more of a fan of the more serious stories. If you're more into light-hearted, I recommend Agarest Zero as your starting point)","June 11, 2015","true","95.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

That's the word that best sums up the game for me.\nI wish I had waited to purchase the game rather than pick it up on sale.\n\nThings disliked.\n\n1. Odd purple tint to all the characters and backgrounds.  It gives the backgrounds a washed out feel and the makes the characters' skin tones take on a  ghoulish cast.  No idea what the  intent was - a faux retro feel, a throw back nod to the days of CGA monitors.  Whatever the reason,  looks awful.  As I can't think of any reason someone would do this on purpose, perhaps it is some odd graphical glitch that only shows up when running this game.\n\n2. New combat system.   Needlessly complicated and tedious.   If you prefer turn-based, strategic combat, and are not a fan of button mashing then turn back or abandon all hope of avoiding carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n3.Character design.   Bland.  This may not be a fair assessment, as I didn't get far into the game due to the purple haze and button mashing combat.\n\n4. Story.  Can only judge from the short time played, but it started out bland and generic.

What is the point?\nI was very dissapointed cuz the game itsself looked very nice and like one of the good ones of the genre but one second after opening a new file you will be getting bombarded with op items and the maximum amount of money to begin with.\nYou cannot dispose of this stuff and there is no orientation at all.\nSo in conclusion I was so frustrated by the game taking the challenge and everything else away from me that I quit after like 2 hours and layed this game to rest.\nIts very sad because I think it could have been a pretty good, yeah generic but good game of the genre but this really messed it up for me.","May 12","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then delight as this new entry into the series completely forgoes the core of the previous games to deliver you a thoughtless battle system which world bore even the therapist you'll need to get after using it. But maybe you weren't in it for the combat, you were in it for the "plot". Then they've got you covered, more autistic character designs, blander characters,  a story that was inspired by that fanfic you wrote back in 9th grade, incomprehensible motivations, a massaging mini game with about as much depth as a water biscuit and waifus with even less. A commendable departure from formula and a great reason to give up on life.","May 23","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
