While FrankNJohn may appear to be just another roguelike, it's also very much a twin stick shooter in disguise.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IReS8H_ovbo\nStarting with basic head attacks you progress through the world killing creatures, each level is multilayered and set around a 'tree of life' set in the center. You are able to clear them completely or just make a beeline for the next portal. Clearing levels is far more rewarding as you have the chance for more marbles (currency) and skull caps. Marbles gives you the ability to upgrade skill trees after your characters death which results in future playthroughs becoming much longer as you become more powerful. Skill trees included Damage, Defense and Utility and the  games 'hub world' seemed to contain secret areas to break open once becoming strong enough.\n\nSkull caps are really the essence of the game, each having pros and cons while some had entirely unique powerups set on timers. During play I discovered all manner of caps, most being reference to great games from the past. Examples include Turtle Cap (TMNT) which provides a full body shield, Bomberman Cap which gave the ability to drop bombs as you moved and the Sonic Cap, which provided a great speed boost of course.\n\nWhen first playing you will notice the art direction and level design, it's very distinct and beautiful, quite similar to the Trine series. Couple that with the music which was put together by Ben Prunty (FTL/Gravity Ghost/StarCrawlers) and you really do get drawn into a Tim Burton-esque world.\n\nFor Early Access this is a solid game that's addictive already (just one more turn!). At this stage it only includes the one area 'The Garden of Denial' and a boss fight with spider Queen Sheela but in future it will add many more zones, bosses, skullcaps and local co-op support. Would love to see online co-op added but I'm not sure if that's possible. Also I'm sure they are planned but achievements would be great. :)\n\nIf you enjoyed games like A Darker Purpose or The Binding of Isaac, FrankNJohn is basically a 3d third person version with similar dark twisted humour. Worth shortlisting and recommended. Cheers.","March 16, 2015","true","2.1"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","30","37","2","1"

From the fantastically done theme, the amazing music from Ben Prunty. Tight controls and clever twin stick combat. FranknJohn is a game that will surprise you for an Early Access title. With very little bugs in the game and more awesome content to be added. The game itself is a fair mixture of difficulty and progressive gameplay. Giving you skill tree upgrades and power ups to help you along the levels. However more enemies appear as you get deeper. All whom have their own tactics and strategy to defeating. With bosses, local co-op, and more of everything to come. I am very excited to see where this 3rd person roguelike ends up.\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttp://youtu.be/X-U4Oa25vow\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","March 4, 2015","true","1.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

There are quite a few different heads available that are used to attack in interesting ways, or that grant you passive bonuses such as speed or greater defense, or special triggered abilities. Unfortunately you generally find yourself using the same ones time and again, as some are of limited utility. The game is currently very early access; there is currently only one set of stages, which you won't mind playing through many times. The enemy designs are also quite unique and interesting.\n\nI would recommend purchasing this game if you're an avid fan of action rogue-likes and want to support the development of what is sure to be a great addition.","May 9, 2015","true","3.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Gameplay is extremely addcitive and oh boy does this game make your heart wanna break out of your chest when you are swarmed by enemies. For anyone who loves a real challenge and a great sense of humor in video games this is the game for you. Its rogue like smasher up style compells you to keep crashing and bashing until you have destroyed everything in your way.

The level of polish at this point of development is great!","March 13, 2015","true","6.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

If you've ever played games such as Binding of Isaac and A Wizard's Lizard, you'll feel right at home with this game. The AI can be a bit derpy at times, but since I'm not one for insane difficulty, I don't mind the fact that most enemies charge at you only. Also, they only have the first area created (as of this writing) so I'm sure they'll be adding more varied enemies/attack patterns.\n\nAudio isn't bad. Music can get a little samey at times, but all in all, it fits the feel of the game quite nicely.\n\nDo I recommend? Definitely. Glad I bought it and I can't wait to see what the developer has for us next.\n\nTL;DR: Great Roguelike, 8/10 Solid game all around.","April 7, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's not worth the 15USD at this point in my opinion.\n\nSo why don't I recommend it?\nIt took me roughly 2 hours to finish the game. There's one area, randomly generated (good replayability) and it has 3 levels that basically repeat themselves.\nThere are around 10-15 enemy types I would estimate, but they generally act in a similar way. There is one boss in the end of the area and it took me 4 seconds to beat it with the best weapon in the game.\nThis game has a solid base to it and a lot of addicting elements, but still has some bugs and it definitely lacks polish.\n\nTo be a game worth the price of 15$ they need to add at least an area or two, make the levels at least a little different from each other, and add copmlexity and strategy to the game. Other than that, it could be a solid little roguelike.","August 22, 2015","false","2.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

He wakes, with no memory, bursting from his grave, with a head that can only stay on his body with the help of a chain.

At first, you don't know where you are or what to do. But that is normal for Frankenstein errr... FrankNJohn, right?\nSoon you figure out that you have to go to the bright door, the Garden of Denial. There you toss your head around. Yes. That's your weapon. Think of it as a Morning Star. The head on a chain and Frankie's body is the knob. So hit your head at everything... also other monsters, who attack you on sight. Some can drop marbles, bushes drop marbles when you walk through etc. etc.\nSo the goal is to collect as many marbles as possible before you die.\nYou always respawn in the "Frank-Cave" - meaning at the start, upgrade your abilities with the marbles you collected and go to the Garden of Denial again to collect mooooore. But be careful... all collected marbles will be gone when you go through that portal, so better spend them. There are various levels. I managed to get to the Garden of Denial Level 2 once. So I guess you have to find a way out of this maze? But that's just a hopeful guess, not fact.\n\nAnyway... it was fun while it lasted. And it was kind of cool to hit stuff with the head. But... it is a very repetitive game and I'm not really such a repetitive person that plays for upgrades only...\n\nWould I play again? Yes. Would I buy again? No. So you see, I'm a bit torn... so I just looked at the price and for me, personally, it's too expensive for what it is. But if you like that kind of game it is worth a try.","March 7, 2015","false","5.9"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"
