Example: moving out of the way of the wider projectiles is impossible without certain speed level ups. So if you are happy to join a smashing your head against a wall from time to time until you have enough experience to past then you should like this game.\n\nSome pacing issues I found: Shield takes a while to reload outside of battle meaning waiting between rooms for it to reload is artificially making the game seem slower then it should be.\n\nWeapons having to "reload" each time you switch also takes away possible skill elements to the game as well.\n\nSolid enough nothing genre changing at all. Recommend to people who seen videos of the game play and like it. Looking for the new genre or to be on the start of something "early" then not for you.\n\nRest in video:\nhttps://youtu.be/1E04LutoIQo","March 11","true","2.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I'm sure there are better games, even within the same price range. I only paid just under Â£7 for it and still feel like I didn't quite get my money's worth.\n\n","March 23","false","2.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Otherwise, you might find some enjoyment out of the top down shooter but not a terrible amount.\n\nPros:\nIt does what it says it does\nThe gameplay is solid at least\nThe weapons all have a slightly different feel to them, if only slightly\nYou keep your progress when you die so leaving the game is just a matter of suicide\nVirtually any system can run this\n\nCons:\nPistols feel useless - Dev Defended this....it's still a useless weapon to take.\nYour soldier even upgraded moves too slow to dodge the fire\nYou do not automatically reload when out of ammo - This has been changed since I did the review\nDespite holding down the trigger, sometimes randomly stop firing your gun even if it has ammo\nGrenades are not only hard to aim but hard to time and not really worth the end all be all they should be for the effort\nNothing special here at all\nDeath doesn't matter much to you, at all taking away some of the challenge, sometimes you actually want to die to just level up or get it over with\nGraphics and Art are uninspired and pretty drab, even for a lower bit game\n\nOverall Score: 2.9/5\nRage Factor: 0.5/5 (I got Almost No Emotional Response playing this game at all)\n\nVideo Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWJ-Gq332C0","March 12","false","0.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

This means that any enemy of any remote difficulty is a death sentence.","June 4","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
