I'll start off with some quick points about this version in comparison to previous versions. The actual game will be discussed in more detail below.\n\nVs Playstation:\n+Smoother look on the characters\n+No disc swapping\n+English translation has been tidied up and the plot is more coherent (No one seems to talk about this, but it's major in my eyes)\n-Swearwords have been replaced with !@#$ style characters.\n\nVs original PC release:\n+Hassle-free, in my experience (40+ hours) <-- This is the key thing for me.\n+PSX music added, as opposed to the awful original PC music. Huge plus! The song "One Winged Angel" now has vocals like it should do :)\n+Rendered characters are now synced perfectly when walking over a pre-rendered video.\n+Videos look smoother and match the PSX version, which is very nice in comparison to original release.\n-Default keyboard controls need two hands. Original PC release had default keys all on the Numpad. Meaning you can scratch your chin or drink coffee while playing. Easily resolved anyway :)\n-Yet another thing you have to create an account for. This time for Square Enix. Once you've done so, you can pretty much forget about it.\n\nI have an Xbox controller, but never tried it admittedly, so can't comment on that! I found the game plays perfectly with keyboard.\n\nIt's surprising how well Final Fantasy VII has aged. I hadn't played the game for nearly 7 years now, and was expecting it to be incredibly ugly. Don't get me wrong, it IS incredibly ugly, albeit in a charming way now. Rather than a good looking game being badly ported, this is a bad looking game that's been ported just right. You can't change your resolution (to my knowledge), but there's absolutely no need to. The game makes use of pre-rendered backgrounds and the resolution they chose for the 3D characters was a good compromise between smoothness and not sticking out too much from the backgrounds. It does look much better than the PSX version, and a bit better than the original PC release.\n\nI am also happy that they stuck with the original PC version's English translation. If you've only ever played FF7 on one platform before, you may not know that the PC version had a much neater, tidier translation. I'm not talking about a complete overhaul like some of the other Final Fantasy remakes. This is still the original story told in what the original PSX translation was trying to do. Any line that was fine before, is unchanged. They simply removed some (admittedly funny) spelling mistakes, and only changed lines that really did not make any sense at all. It makes the game feel more natural and therefore I highly recommend a replay if you've only played on the PSX before. The one noticeable, and unfortunate, change is that the swearing has been replaced with !@#£ style symbols. You can still tell they're swearing and what word they were going to say, but this unnecessary censorship felt a bit out of place. Still, it doesn't make or break the game. And just to be clear, this isn't new to the Steam version as it was present on the original PC release.\n\nAlso, as I might as well say it now: The story IS really good. As FF7 is one of the most popular entries in the franchise, it sometimes gets a lot of flak from people who seem to only want to dislike popular things. These are personal games, which you should play for yourself, and FF7 offers a deceptively complex story, with a fantastic combination of twists. 'Twist' is a harsh word, because it implies a sudden and unexpected change in the story's direction. This is not the case. The 'twists' are completely natural and only serve to make everything before fit into place better. The combination I mentioned earlier is in reference to twists which you will definitely understand on your first time through, and some which may only make sense with a bit of thinking or a replay. The latter are not essential to understand, but you'll feel a satisfying sense of revelation if you do. All in all, this is a well-thought out constructed tale. It may not be as fast-paced as you'd like, but the end result is very satisfactory.\n\nThe gameplay itself is surprisingly fast for a 90s JRPG. You can get through battles pretty quickly, and most of the attack animations are short enough to not be too annoying. With the exception of summons; huge magical attacks shown in a lengthy animation of a monster being summoned and inflicting damage on your enemies.\n\nThe Materia system is still great and offers lots of customisation for your characters, although it's not as complex nowadays as it used to be. To be clear, Materia are 'gems' which you attach to characters to give them extra abilities or magic. As a Materia is used, it gains its own experience and gets progressively more powerful. The only complexity comes from managing who has what materia, and this is the one area of the game where the age really shows. You can only quick swap between character's Materia screens for the three characters in your party, rather than every available character. Therefore you are forced to constantly swap characters in and out to get the best setup. [EDIT: A number of comments have corrected me and pointed me to the Exchange option, which negates this complaint of mine!]\n\nIs it worth £10? Admittedly, this port probably generated no where near the amount of work needed to justify the price, but the quality of the game does. Therefore it's a tough question to answer. I suppose if you look at what you're getting, then yes, it is worth the price. Your first time through the game can literally take 60-70 hours. My replay was 40 hours long, and I know the game extremely well.\n\nThis is now my favorite way to play Final Fantasy VII. And that is probably the one thing you needed to know.","October 17, 2014","true","67.5"," 810 of 842 people (96%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","96","810","842","16","20"

With it's first release on the Playstation back in 1997, this release is a repackaged version of the PC port released in 1998.  With cloud saves and achievements, it doesn't really stand out to people who may have already bought the game or have it elsewhere.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII uses almost all the assets from the original PC version of the game. Music was re-encoded to OGG Vorbis, but was still based off of fairly ugly MIDI tracks that the PC used. Thankfully they are easy to replace as some poeple have even decided to use remixes of said tracks instead.\n\nVisually the game is very dated. 2D backgrounds, 3D sprites from that era with resolution stretching 2D elements while providing a modicum amount of improvement to the 3D models. While in the field, higher resolutions don't really help, but in battle scenes and in full 3D environments (Chocobo Racing, Submarine Minigame), there is a noticeable improvement.\n\nControls are a bit awkward as for a 360 controller, the triggers, d-pad, and right stick aren't usable. However, you can get around that either by binding everything to usable controls or using a utility like JoytoKey.\n\nThis is a bare-bones re-release, with the hard work for making it work with a modern OS stripped away for most people.\n\nUpdate: SquareEnix has managed to replace the MIDI quality music with PSX quality tracks. This means the game's music sounds extremely detailed compared to the original PC release.","July 8, 2013","true","8.2"," 474 of 537 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","474","537","0","13"

I stand among these people. For many of us who were kids in the 90s, Final Fantasy 7 was and always will be the first truly epic game we ever played. So I’ll admit that I am definitely biased to love it, as it was my personal favorite game during a number of years of my childhood. But that isn’t why I’m going to recommend that you consider trying it. You should consider it because Final Fantasy 7 is a classic piece of video-game history that revolutionized the genre and because it’s a kickass game.\n\nAt the time it first released, there were a handful of other large RPGs with huge worlds and a lot of gameplay (relative to the era), but they were uncommon and unpopular in the Western world. Final Fantasy 7 reached a pinnacle of awesomeness for RPGs that was unprecedented and subsequently elevated the genre into the mainstream gaming market outside of Japan. Not only did it have sound RPG fundamentals, but the sheer amount of variety of gameplay it offered was quite revolutionary for the genre. Chocobo racing and breeding, the motorbike scene, the snowboard scene, the Golden Saucer, the Don Corneo segment, and more all contributed to shattering the status quo for the genre. A lot of young gamers went from not knowing about RPGs to one of them being their favorite game ever. Not only that, but it became one of the cornerstones which provided a foundation for the genre to grow towards what it has become today. If there was a Video Game Hall of Fame, Final Fantasy 7 would no doubt be in it.\n\nObviously, with more recent RPG blockbusters from franchises like The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, and Fallout, it is hard to continue to consider Final Fantasy 7 to be an “epic” game by today’s standards. Somehow it still feels that way to me. Or at the very least: since I enjoy the genre, I still find it quite fun to play.\n\nSo I will admit that it definitely has been a long time since Final Fantasy 7 was one of the best games in existence. That said, even after the erosion of the sands of time, the game still feels exciting, intriguing, and massive to me. Even on my 8th playthrough I pick up on new subtleties in the story or discover new secrets and items.\n\nThe story is interesting, if not a bit convoluted. (Some of the story was cut away to make it “less confusing for the Western market” or some such silliness. This wound up making it more confusing.) The Materia system is fun and, combined with the traditional XP leveling, continuously offers the satisfaction of progress as you play through the campaign. The world is intriguing and still semi-large(ish) even by modern standards. The characters are perfect clichés of the very clichés that they themselves introduced. And one of the best parts of the game will always be the intimidating boss battles with the signature music. It is doubtful there will ever be another kid who says Final Fantasy 7 is his favorite game ever, but most modern fans of the genre will enjoy this game despite its age.\n\nSo there are a few reasons you may want to consider trying this game if you never have.\n\nIf you consider yourself a true aficionado of the gaming industry, you will probably want to play Final Fantasy 7 at least once in your life. Even though there is a “remake” on the way (or out by the time you read this), I would argue you should play this version at least once to really experience a legendary piece of video game history in this semi-unadulterated state.\n\nOr: if you don’t care about any of the historical mumbo-jumbo, and just are looking for a fun, turn-based JRPG, then you can comfortably look to Final Fantasy 7 for that as well.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","January 11","true","48.8"," 266 of 293 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","266","293","12","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/recommended/39140/","BavarianGod","[AReV]BavarianGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/","3478 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T156pjmUxlE&list=UURLmXiAxqgzAGPO64W78sSg\n\nBased on it's simple ultra low poly chibi characters and it's low resolution, pre-rendered backdrops, younger gamers would have a hard time believing that Final Fantasy VII was a cutting edge title in 1997. In addition to being a technical marvel in it's day, along side Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time, it was an important ambassador for the potential of 3d graphics in gaming. Squaresoft had been working for some time to make their characters more emotive in order to sell their grand fantasy stories. With it's pre rendered cut scenes and fresh diesel punk and cyber punk informed sci-fi setting it allowed JRPGs to explode in popularity in the west.\n\nBoasting one of the most thrilling openings in RPG history, players take control of Cloud Strife as he joins the terrorist group AVALANCH in order to destroy a Mako reactor. Cloud's former employer, an evil corporation named Shinra, is using these reactors to harvest a new form of energy that is destroying the planet and each of AVALANCH's members has a personal reason to fight against Shinra except for Cloud. Annoyingly enough, Cloud starts off as an angsty, aloof ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but slowly opens up, dealing with his own bag of issues over the course of the game. The rest of the cast is colorful and generally likeable. During the fight against Shinra a new threat emerges, shaking the plot up and introducing players to one of the most iconic villains in history. It's a narrative that is compelling though it seems a bit more silly now than it did upon release. Square has desperately tried to recapture the magic of Final Fantasy VII and often it feels like they have only managed to parody their own classic game. Final Fantasy VII established several character archetypes that are regularly found in many modern Final Fantasy titles and they have never been as likable as they were in VII.\n\nWhat hasn't been cheapened by the failures of subsequent Final Fantasy titles is the combat mechanics. While the turn based structure may feel slow by modern standards, the materia system remains a phenomenally flexible system that effects everything from what weapons you want to use to your character's stats. Materia are magic crystals that are a byproduct of the mako reactors in the game world and allow characters to use magic. Each materia falls into one of several catagories: spell, command, support and summon materia. Each weapon and piece of armor has a number of slots to place materia in and some slots are linked allowing support skills to compliment offensive materia. For instance a poison materia linked to an added effect materia on a weapon allows characters to poison enemies or deal elemental damage. Final attack materia combined with life materia will instantly revive characters when they fall in combat giving yo a second chance during tough encounters. Characters don't really have classes, statistically some are better suited for certain roles than others but the right equipment allows any character to function in a desired role.\n\nPersonally, what has burned Final Fantasy VII into the deepest part of my memory for the past 17 years has been the soundtrack. From it's delicate melodies to it's whimsical themes, the soundtrack to this RPG classic is every bit as ambitious and epic as the rest of it's design. Since characters relay their dialog in text, the soundtrack serves as their voice. Hearing a character's theme several years after playing the game is like hearing the voice of an old friend. There is more humor, love, suspense and wonder in this game's sound scape than many entire franchises.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII is a classic and it's certainy worth revisiting for even experiencing for the first time. Thanks to a recent re-release on steam as well as versions available on the PlayStation network that's pretty easy to do. Unfortunately the port for steam isn't exactly exemplary. The controller support requires a mod to function properly, there are a handful of bugs and it requires registering with Square Enix. On the upside, there is cloud save support and achievements. In any case, I'd buy a lackluster port of a bonna fide classic if it convinces Square Enix to take a break from releasing embarrassing new entries into their flagship franchise in order to give gamers new and old a properly remade version of what is, arguably, the most popular game in their company's history.","January 6, 2015","true","26.9"," 235 of 256 people (92%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","92","235","256","13","10"

But...\n\nDO NOT BUY IT HERE, AVOID!! Here is why: (besides that the music is terrible midi version and not the good ps1 version)\n\nIt is a 15 year old SINGLE PLAYER GAME. SQUARE have decided to finally put their prized games on steam...so why is that? why now? Unfortunately theyve gone down a dark and corrupt road...even as low as stealing...yes, i used the word stealing, because that's what this is.\n\nYou need to register your personal information, which is required to be able to login to their online client, so that you can play this single player game. DRM...oh but it goes a lot deeper than that. Afterall, why have DRM on a single player game?...\n\nThe terms and conditions of this unnecessary online integration, is THEY ARE SELLING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER COMPANIES AND INSTALLING SPYWARE. In this aspect the game shouldnt cost you anything as theyre already making the money off of your private information which they have no right to deny you access to the game after pre-taking your money.\n\nBut oh it gets worse...it also repeatedly installs a tracking cookie into your all your browsers in order to spy on your activity.

They have taken your money ILLEGALLY first, and given you the agreement later.\n^\nThis warrants a potential Class Action Lawsuit, which if it happens, i will be joining.\nSquare-Enix would not have a leg to stand on if people got organised enough to create this lawsuit against them.\n\nQ: "I bought it, but didnt agree to these rediculous terms...can i get my money back because i was mislead and missold this item?"\nLegally you are entitled to a refund because you were, mislead, and tricked into buying something that had dangerous conditions given to you AFTER the sale, which is illegal.\nBut to answer your question,\nNO, YOU JUST GOT ILLEGALLY ROBBED, SCREW YOU GIMME MONEY. YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK? YOU CANT HAVE IT BACK, AND NOBODY IN THE WORLD, INCLUDING STEAM IS GOING TO HELP YOU GET IT BACK ( i love you steam, but not helping people get refunds in this case, is again, an illegal procedure because YOU and SQUARE have not given any warning, any notice that these conditions exist before the sale). You just got robbed, and no authority on the internet has the balls to challenge this because "Big company" gets complete fkin immunity from the law.\n\nSquare has gone so down deep in greed and corruption, that they are taking your money, and NOT giving you your game until you accept their spyware and contractual agreement to sell your private information....and NOT giving you the money back if you do not agree to do so.\n\nIV BEEN ROBBED, and have been refused my money back...having NOT been given the product i paid for.\n\nIts criminal...anyone one of us would be arrested and either fined or given a small jail sentence, yet these guys are getting away with it like theyre above the law.\n\nAll the in-detail parts below\n\n---EVIDENCE SECTION---\nThe agreement link: http://account.square-enix.com/agreement/eu/#\nYour Privacy link: http://eu.square-enix.com/en/documents/privacy\n(if you are in the US, you may have different links than these im a British European)\n\nSTORING YOUR INFORMATION: (this parts the same for most companies, straight forward)\nQuote 1: (agreement link) "The Registered User agrees to keep the Square Enix Account information updated, current and secure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rpgmistress86/recommended/39140/","rpgmistress86","RPGmistress","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rpgmistress86/","31 products in account","Final Fantasy VII was one of the first RPGs I played, and the first game I bought for the Playstation. I had never seen anything like it at the time. Such a big, immersive experience. Three discs long! It was the first time I had seen a game span multiple discs. There's a lot to cover, so let's get started.\n\nBreakdown of the game itself:\n\nGraphics - The graphics in FF7 are very much a mixed bag. The 3D models used in battle are about as detailed as you could achieve for 1997, at least for console gaming. The models used outside of battle, however, are very blocky and much smaller. They sort of look like squashed down versions. It may take some getting used to if you're coming from a game like FF8, for example. FF7 uses pre-rendered backgrounds, which looked far superior to the 3D textures of the time and look great on standard def TVs, but look a little pixellated on higher res computer monitors. The FMVs still hold up pretty well, even if they're nothing mind blowing like they were for some of us back in the day. Personally, I think the spell/attack animations hold up the best out of everything, graphics-wise. I love seeing the animation for spells such as Aqualung. :)\n\nMusic - FF7 has some of the best music ever put into a video game, if you ask me. Nobuo Uematsu is a fantastic composer, and this game simply wouldn't be anywhere near as charming and compelling without his score, which does an incredible job of setting the mood for much of the game. Many of the tracks will tug at your heartstrings during the game's more emotional scenes, and many other tracks... Well, they just sound plain cool. The boss battle theme really got me pumped the first time I heard it, and I used to look forward to upcoming boss fights just so I could hear that music again.\n\nBattle mechanics - FF7 uses an active time turn based battle system. You can have three characters in your active party, and each can equip a weapon, armor and accessory. Each weapon and armor has slots in it, which you can place little orbs in called materia. Materia are where you get your special abilities. Without them, you only have the standard attack and item commands during battle. Materia come in five varieties: Green, which contain magic spells. Blue, which alter the effects of a materia it is placed next to, if those two slots are linked. Red, which contain summons. Yellow, which enable extra battle commands (Steal, for example). And purple, which are basically stat boosting materia. These categories of materia are referred to as magic (green), support (blue), summon (red), command (yellow) and independent (purple). There is a TON of materia in the game and each weapon and armor can hold up to 8 materia orbs, so character customization possibilities are practically limitless. The materia system is honestly one of my favourites of any Final Fantasy or RPG.\n\nPlot - You are Cloud, a former soldier of the Shinra corporation, which is basically the biggest world power in Final Fantasy VII. After parting ways with them, Cloud embarks on a new life as a mercenary, ironically being hired by a militant anti-Shinra group known as Avalanche. As you progress through the game you'll learn more about Cloud and his comrades' pasts and the various secrets the Shinra corporation holds, as well as the mako energy that's become so profitable for them. Along the way you'll meet lots of interesting characters, and there are even two optional ones you can recruit. I think that's a pretty good outline without venturing into spoilery territory. The characters in this game really have a lot of depth, for the most part, which is one of my favourite aspects of the game.\n\nControls - FF7 was originally released for the Playstation, but didn't make use of the analog sticks. It used the D-pad to move your character around, so you should be able to configure it to work with just about any USB gamepad you happen to have. You can also use your keyboard if you don't have a gamepad or simply prefer not to use one.\n\nIssues specific to the Steam release:\n\nFirst off, if you get an error when launching the game, try going into your program files (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY VII\ for example) and right-click on FF7_Launcher.exe. Select "Properties" and go into the Compatibility tab. Here, tick the box that says "Run this program as an administrator." This fixed the issue for me on my Windows 7 machine.\n\nThe only other issues I've had running the game have been it crashing a few times. Once when I first played through it on my laptop in 2013, just outside of the Mythril Mines (after travelling through them), and a couple times when casting Beta on my current playthrough. Not ideal, but nothing to really worry about. Just make sure you save often and always after a major accomplishment.\n\nSo, a few things about the Steam port. For one thing, you now have achievement trophies. These are little badges that show up on your Steam profile to let all your friends know how awesome you are, lol. Well, something like that. You'll gain a badge for getting to certain points in the story, and there are badges for getting the most powerful limit breaks, maxing out your characters' levels, collecting materia, beating optional bosses, etc.\n\nOne big change I'd like to talk about is the sound. The music in the Steam release is nowhere near the quality of the original Playstation version's. Luckily, this can easily be remedied by searching through Steam's mod section, where you can find mods to replace it with the original music, or even higher quality mixes (I recommend the one based around FinalFanTim's remastered soundtrack). :)\n\nThere are a few other little changes here and there. Some of the dialog has been cleaned up a little, a few of the curses have been replaced with the iconic @%#$% characters, and... The models have mouths. Basically little black circles pasted onto their faces. It looks pretty silly to me, but it's not a major distraction (you can also mod the graphics if you're so inclined).\n\nI think that about covers it... Final Fantasy VII is widely regarded as one of the best JRPGs of all time, and it's definitely high on my personal list. Give it a try. For $11.99, it's well worth it.","July 20, 2015","true","138.9"," 102 of 110 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","102","110","5","5"

This relies on SE's servers working, which they didn't at the time of this review.\n\n* You MUST have or create a Square account before it will launch. This is *Mandatory*, so yet another set of credentials that will need to be created and remembered. Haven't gone through that process yet because of outages. - No clear warning on the STEAM page for this game.\n\n* From a brand new install, the ff7_en.exe file gets picked up by AV applications like Comodo apparently as malware, even though it's clean. This is apparently a known issue, and has been since July 2013 at least - There is NO warning about this on the STEAM purchase page.\n\nHow the hell can you butcher something so badly? I haven't even managed to launch the thing successfully yet due to these issues, which is why I have a stunning 0.2 hrs on record for the game, attempting to launch, get to the auth part, then then AV eating the .exe ..

Curious,I installed and played the game on my then-fossil PC and found myself lost into the game for weeks!For I discovered a new genre.RPG,as the cool kids used to say.\nCut forward to 9 years.RPG Scenario has completely changed with Bethesda and Bioware as the demigods of WRPG.Souls' franchise has been hailed as the masochist's paradise.CD Projekt Red is promising to deliver possibly the most epic game in terms of both scope and and scale.\nSquare's Final Fantasy is struggling to keep up with its contemporaries due to the recent games which have been a complete blunder and is on the very verge of downfall should the next game fail.\nSo how does a primitive game like Final Fantasy VII hold up today?\n\n{TL;DR Version Down Below}\n\nPRESENTATION:\nOh, Final Fantasy VII was a complete looker for a game to be released in 1997 and the first game in series to have 3D graphics.\nPolygon textures, Pre-rendered cutscenes, Modelled character designs were the terms people heard for the first time.\nStoryline is above average but its narrative and storytelling is ace! This game proved that Square Soft knew how to do story right.They do have a few plotholes, but they aren't enough to bring the whole experience down.\nSure the game itself looks supremely fossil for today's standards.But when a game has memorable characters with zero voice acting...yes,picture this.. Characters with no voice actors that were memorable!\nSo yes, Great characters, a plot that just oozes intrigue to be uncovered and soul-rending music, Final Fantasy VII represents all that which the recent games seem to be lacking.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nFinal Fantasy VII is am old school JRPG in every sense which boasts an open-world setting, turn-based combat and some annoying mini-games.But you'll be interested in the former two aspects. The character progression system requires you to be playing a lot of hours because once you hit Level20,you are going to need a LOT of XP points to progress.For that reason I found myself farming XP for hours,that can be frustrating for some. The game does get tough eventually so you'll need to keep your character's levels higher and equip them with better gear from time to time.\nTurn-based combat is also very well implemented with "Materia System" which is incredibly deep and allows for some interesting mix-and-match combinations.The influence of its combat can be seen in recent games like South Park:The Stick of Truth and Child of Light.\nIt takes a while for the game to open up.By end of first 7 hours, you almost learn everything you should about the mechanics and systems.\nAnimations are still clunky and stick-like, meaning its still the unchanged PS1 version you're playing.While it does have Keyboard support, you'll still want to play using a gamepad.\nThe game can be completed within 40hours.Even more if you try to unlock all characters, learn all techniques and defeat the additional bosses. For most part, the game fulfills your needs for everything Role-playing.\n\n{FOR TL;DR SPAMMERS}\n\nPROS:\n+Satisfying storyline and narrative\n+Great characters\n+Robust combat\n+Reasonably challenging\n+Sublime music and OST\n+Features one of the best antagonists in video game culture\n\nCONS:\n-Graphics sure look outdated.\n\nVERDICT:\nAn absolute piece of masterwork.Final Fantasy VII was an achievement in RPG genre when it released.\nThe later games in the series sure had upgraded visuals and graphics but none of them come close to this one when it came to capturing the very soul of what makes RPG an RPG, like VII did.\nAll said and considered,Final Fantasy VII is the best game in FF series and one of the best JRPG of all time.\nIf you are a self-proclaimed fanatic of this genre,then pick this one up whenever you can. You owe it to yourself.","October 27, 2014","true","82.2"," 167 of 212 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","167","212","9","0"

Again. For the 3rd time. But what's nice is this game is fully optimized to play on new hardware. I won't go into specifics on what Final Fantasy VII is all about, since unless you have been living under a rock, you already know. But for those rock dwellers, I will give some basics. Final Fantasy VII is an epic turn based RPG. One of the finest in its genre. It has a grand story. Memorable characters. An amazing soundtrack. Everything has aged wonderfully, except I'd say the visuals. Luckily with the power of the MOD, you can relive this classic with a fresh spin of the visuals (just search around) giving you a new experience on this gem. The only problem with modding FFVII is that you will need to roll back the exe which will in turn disable any achievements. So I'd suggest for achievement hunters that you play through the game unmodded. And replay it later with the beautiful mods added.\n\nWith that said, aside from better new system support, this re-release of FFVII also adds a higher res for the included character designs, as well as cloud saving, and a mode which will increase HP and Gil, with a seemingly tedious process. The latter mode is completely optional, but works in a way which does not hamper any enemy level scaling. It only boosts HP/MP, and not any stats or levels. So you will get the same scaling flow you would when playing it normally. This however does mess with your limit meter. So use at your own risk.\n\n\neither way, FFVII is a great classic. Fans of it originally should check out this re-release. And newcomers need to experience this at least once in their lives.","November 25, 2013","true","12.9"," 247 of 331 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","247","331","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/39140/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Honestly, I don't care much for writing these glowing pieces on highly-acclaimed games. It's the whole "preaching to the choir" aspect that bothers me. I ran into this before back when I reviewed Resident Evil 4. Everyone knows FF7 is a great game, so why even bother with the review? I should just save myself the time & effort, make a humorous reference, then sit my ♥♥♥ down and drink...oh right. So I have to say something significant. I have to put words on a page that somehow match the importance and majesty of this classic JRPG. So let's get started.\n\nLike any other game series, Final Fantasy has had its humble beginnings, its ups, downs, controversies, and even today we're uncertain of where it'll go next. Like any good lemming we follow along, buy the latest games, all the while hoping that eventually Square-enix will take the franchise back in the direction we want it to go in. The thing is, there's always been one path, and game-development isn't about what "we" want. FF13 might be a wildly different game compared to FF1, but if you played through most of them, you could see how such a divisive entry could be released. It's the accumulation of elements, taking what works, changing what doesn't, and evolving into something different. But we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 is probably not the best JRPG of all time. When it comes to opinions; I don't touch best/worst anything. FF7 is a great JRPG, and certainly a remarkable entry in the series. Part of its quality is in its spectacle. Yes, I'm actually talking about the flashy stuff. Even in its earliest entries, Final Fantasy was always about grandness. In FF3 for the Famicom there was the discovery that your world, was just a tiny floating island in a much larger world. FF7 works in a similar fashion, with that tiny island being Midgar. The battles in FF games have always pushed for more special effects. Everyone remembers their first time casting Ultima in FF6, just like the first time they summoned Knights of the Round.\n\nThis touches on another aspect of FF. No effort (no matter how slight) goes unrewarded. One of the aspects I've always enjoyed about FF, is that I can wander into a forest in the middle of nowhere, and possibly bump into a unique monster. Perhaps this monster has a cool special move, that looks really neat, and maybe I'll be able to make it my own (via blue magic or otherwise). Other entries (like FF9) mix things up, like having mini quiz-shows hiding in the forest. It relates to one of my favorite aspects of the original Baldur's Gate. By simply wandering the outskirts you're bound to encounter more than just monsters. There's a lot of neat little discoveries in the dozen or so optional areas BG1 had. FF7 is a much more linear game, yet it still understands the importance of deviation.\n\nThe character models...I actually can't complain about them. Yes, nowadays we can simply mod everything so that it looks uniformly superb but...well I'm starting to see the appeal of those blocky wonders. This isn't nostalgia talking either, this is something I just noticed in my most recent play-through. Squaresoft put a lot of work into giving NPCs life. Even today, NPCs in RPGs are only good at standing around, walking in random directions, or (in the case of later Bethesda RPGs) doing a bunch of "radiant dynamic AI" actions that somehow look more robotic than if they were just scripted. A lot of NPCs in FF7 do things, memorable things, things that humans would actually do. Early in the game, there's this woman waiting at a train-station. Now this woman isn't anyone important. In fact, you're supposed to pay attention to the flashback this woman is a part of. Regardless, her boyfriend/husband arrives via train. He's back from war, and he's so happy he does his best Gene Kelly impression, by swinging around a streetlight.\n\nI can't state enough just how brilliant these little moments are. There's no dialogue between these unimportant NPCs, they don't factor into the plot, and yet they add so much. The two most recent FF games I played through were FF13 and FF13-2. The few times I ran into NPCs they're just...standing around. Sometimes they walk, and they say a line or two when I walk past, but that's usually about it. Actually, FF13-2 did have the kids that run around the beach, one of them trips a lot. It might not sound like much, but that little bit of life makes the experience a lot more believable.\n\nComplexity. The first Final Fantasy was practically Wizardry with an overhead view. Even then, it had numerous ideas that offered replay value. The most obvious one is the class system. Once you decided on your party, that was it. Whether you went with the traditional (Fighter, Monk, White Mage, Black Mage) the different (Thief, Thief, Red Mage, Red Mage) or the ridiculous (Four White Mages), you were stuck with that party until you won the game. FF1 was an altogether difficult entry, with numerous random encounters that could wipe you out. One of my most memorable party-wipes was when my party of 4 was killed by a handful of ghouls. Every round they did 1-2 damage, and every round they paralyzed everyone. That was about 25 years ago...sheesh.\n\nBy the time FF4 came out, the random encounter was no longer a serious threat. I never saw the easier battles as a "dumbing down" of FF. These RPGs have numerous mechanics and design decisions to keep track of. What better way to drill this into the player's head than through actual combat? The battles are there so you can figure out how everything works. Look at this way: You're always getting a new party member, new spells, espers, materia, junctions, jobs, gambits, etc upon etc. So naturally, you'll want to try things out, and not get killed in the process. It's like a tutorial...without actually being a tutorial (though FF has plenty of those as well).\n\nMost of the depth and challenge in FF comes from taking away all of the stuff you receive. This difficulty has to be player-imposed, but it works wonders for extending the value of these games. FF7 is no different, as there are low-level runs, no materia runs, and so on. Even something as simple as choosing not to use limit-breaks can massively change the game. After all, once a party member takes enough damage, their fight command is replaced with limit. Now what? Hopefully that character learned mug, or has some items that do damage. Heck, you might have to kill them yourself so their meter will drain. Suddenly those bosses you meteorained through become a lot more interesting.\n\nThe best part is, even if you play through FF7 and take everything that's given, it's still an enjoyable JRPG. This is due to pacing. Unless you're trying to max out everything, FF7 is a +/-30 hour game. That is PERFECT! I can not emphasize it enough. Those hours are going to be spent in various locales, doing a wide variety of things, and having a grand adventure. I can't tell you the number of RPGs that I've given up on, simply because nothing happens for 5-10 hours at a time. A game having 100s of hours of "content" just isn't a selling point for me anymore. FF7 moves quickly enough, and still tells you all you need to know in terms of story/characters. It isn't spectacularly written, but it's an effective story that is appropriately-paced.\n\nAll of this is why I think Final Fantasy 7 deserves respect. It encompasses everything that makes JRPGs work. No really, I believe this game is an example of flawless execution. I mean, a game like Xenogears might have a better plot & more interesting characters (to me), but between disc 2, the platforming, and  t h e  s l o w - m o v i n g  t e x t  t h a t  c a u s e s  m y  b r a i n  t o  g o  n u m b, I regard it as a "more than the sum of its parts" kind of JRPG.\n\nStill, it's like I said waaaaay back, FF7 is probably not the best JRPG of all time. It does a pretty good job of making you think it is though.\n","April 21, 2015","true","56.8"," 101 of 120 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","101","120","13","3"

If not, so sorry (sarcasm)\n\nThe PC version of FFVII! A great game gets a great PC port with a little graphic upscale on the side.\n\nPros:\nThis game is magic. Absolute gold. (And I don't even like FF games.)\nFun to play (I literally spent 200+ hours on this. I think I might be a bit biased)\nMinigames.\nChocobos are fun to ride around on.\nIt will literally keep you busy for hours.\nControls well. (Although, I did not use a controller and I'm not sure if controllers can be used. I prefer keyboards anyway.)\nMusic is sweet.\n\nCons:\nMaster Tonberry (Stab stab)\nRuby Weapon\nEmerald Weapon\nRandom Encounters\n\nAnalysis:\nUpon first glance of Final Fantasy VII, I almost blew it off. Steam Christmas sales changed my mind quickly.\nI picked it up and started it. The beginning was slow. Not slow enough to deter me from the glory that I would experience later on though.\nYou start off as Cloud, an edgy, roided up, Ex-SOLDIER mercenary. You are hired by AVALANCHE to rig one of the mako reactors to explode. You do this. Easy stuff.\nStory continues (I'm not going to spoil anything. Just look at this review and determine if you want to buy it.)\n\nYou will find enemies that you will absolutely hate. I'm quite sure my least favorites were the parasites and Master Tonberry. The story will tug a few heartstrings. I choked up a bit when a couple things happened. There'll be some twists and turns that you might not expect (Unless you were played the original. Then enjoy this masterpiece again, friend.)\nThere'll be some goofs and gaffs. The characters are unique and their dialogue is entertaining.\n\nDON'T TOUCH THE RED THING IN THE DESERT.\nStill not going to spoil anything... but when you get to the ending, Be prepared to have some of your soul ripped out of you because it's so gosh darn good.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is almost perfect. It's flaws will and have been pointed out, but I'm not here for that. I like the game for what it is and I highly recommend buying it. It's been worth the 200+ hours and I definitely got my money's worth.","July 2, 2015","true","249.3"," 108 of 140 people (77%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","77","108","140","28","6"

A lot of people will say it hasn't aged well, and I agree to a certain extent, but it's pretty easy to get past the parts that feels clunky and outdated. If anything, it just makes the game feel more charming. The world is cool and interesting, the gameplay is fun (allthough sometimes it can feel just a little bit tedious) and the story is absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe writing focuses a lot on the characters, which I think is a great thing, personally. All the playable characters got a lot of attention and character building, which made me really care about them in the end, adding to the emotional roller coaster that is this game.\n\nThere are some pretty deep themes in FINAL FANTASY VII, such as loss and identity, and life and death. This only adds to the world and story, and makes it a much more unique and interesting experience.\n\nIt's a pretty dark and complex story, at least for the time it was concieved. It does however come off as a bit much at times, like a ridiculous scene in the early stages of the game, where the main character, Cloud, rides out of a large office building on a motorcycle, all while fending off enemy pursuers with a sword.\n\nDespite this and a few other scenes, the story is very interesting and keeps you invested until the very end.\n\nAs someone who had never played this before a few weeks ago, I can see how this game became such an instant classic. I honestly consider this to be the best game i've ever played, and I want to recommend it to anyone, as long as you have the patience for the outdated gameplay and graphics.","May 3","true","83.1"," 52 of 55 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","52","55","0","0"

I had the original PC version back in the day and it ran flawlessly if I remember correctly.  I played it with my Gravis gamepad.  Again, with no problems.  This version is a disappointment all around.  The first thing you will be required to do is to create an account with Sqaure.  Makes no sense at all, but hey.  Still, it is an annoyance.  Once I finally got the game fired up, I immediately started having problems with my gamepad.  The cursor was flying all over the place.  I had to download a profile for Pinnacle to fix that and the fact that a few of the buttons would not respond at all.  Again, an annoyance.  Despite this effort my character still wants to walk to the left much of the time.  This I cannot seem to fix.  Sure, I can just plow forward and try to ignore it, but it still detracts from the game.  Lots of people have complained about the music or the fact that the graphics look terrible on current HD monitors.  That really does not bother me at all.  The same great gameplay is there if you can get to it.  The horrible controls completely wreck it.\n\nA person much wiser than me, who also owns this "updated" version, told me that it was a better idea to just use a psx emulator to run this game if you really want to enjoy it again.  He was right.  Square totally dropped the ball on this one.  They have pretty much dumped all over the game that literally put them on the map.  I am definitely NOT saying that Final Fantasy VII is not a great game.  It is.  This is just not the version you want to play if you want to enjoy it.","March 30, 2014","false","33.5"," 574 of 860 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","574","860","3","0"

I loved everything about it the world, people and music amazing. This game was my first RPG and really set the bar for others. If you ever read about why Square has not made a remake they state it is because and I quote here. "CEO Yoichi Wada said that a remake of Final Fantasy VII will happen once the company makes a new Final Fantasy title that succeeds the seventh game in terms of quality and sales, something the company has to date failed to do". Think about that for a mintue this game was made in 1997 almost 20 years later no other game they made has yet to top it...\n\nStory: This game is set on earth in another place and time. A place where the planets very blood "The lifestream" discovered by a company called Shinra, INC. Shinra found a way to turn lifestream into a power source and built reactors all around the world sucking up the lifesteam and killing the planet. You are Cloud Strife "mercerany" hired by your old childhood friend Tifa to help her and AVALANCHE put a stop to it... this story unfolds into an epic tale of love that puts the very life of the planet in your hands.\n\nGame play: The gameplay is smooth and seemless you always know what you need to do next. If you ever get stuck there are many guides that will help you figure it all out.  Battling enemies is fun you can make it turn based, or set it to active (no turns) for a greater challenge. There are many very fun and challanging mini game series in this game. A motorcycle challenge, submarine battles, snowboarding, and a few others. This game supports controllers I played the whole game with a Xbox 360 controller.\n\nGraphics: For the time period 1997 the graphics were soild the few in game movies have really nice graphics. Otherwise it's mostly blocky textures. There are graphics mods out that give the game a more updated feel. They are hard to install but, pay off if you get them to work.\n\nAudio: The music now updated is very nice! One of the only games where I used to play it just to listen to it.\n\nOverall: It has everything a rpg fan loves. A great story with wonderful music, the people all have backgrounds your can really get into. There are many side quests and challenges. You can't forget the Chocobos everyone loves those for dinner... I mean to race them.\n\nStory 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nGraphics 7/10 for 1997 10/10 if you can mod it\nSoundtrack 10/10\nDifficulty 6/10\n\nI give this game a 10/10\n\n( Square would make a killing if they remade this game with current graphics)","September 1, 2014","true","105.3"," 90 of 116 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","90","116","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ancienteclipse/recommended/39140/","ancienteclipse","Gahooligan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ancienteclipse/","198 products in account","A classic from the Playstation 1 era. This is one of the first RPG games I ever played and has always set the standard of what I expect from an RPG. It features turn based, but active combat, a fun and more-or-less easy to follow story, and decent characters and personalities though some border on the cliche. Finaly Fantasy 7 has a good amount of side quests and minigames that can eat up plenty of time. From snowboarding to breeding and racing chocobos the handful of side quests and metagames can keep you entertained for quite a while.\n\nI found that, as with almost all RPGs I play, one of my favorite things to do is collect all the strongest magics and weapons. There are monsters you can encounter that are even stronger than the last boss at the end of the main story. On top of that there are magic abilities that, if you have the patience to level them up, can make the final boss a walk in the park. Getting these weapons and magics require a great deal of grinding though, which is someting I find to be rather offputting. Squeezing every last ounce of gameplay from this title will probably take you somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 hours if youre the occational gamer like me.\n\nSince it's initial release the game has not really aged well. If youre looking for a top-notch Final Fantsy expierience I would point you to one of the newer titles. It's kind of hard to look at the old graphics in high resolution. To help this they have an "original graphics" mode for people like me. It keeps the display to 480x640, but without the inherit funnyness of a SDtv set you still see plenty of jaggies and protruding polygons. The graphics didnt stop me from playing through one of my old favorites though.\n\nAnother gripe I have about the age is the clunky controls when roaming about but it's nothing you cant get used to. The button layout can be a tad confusing on the keyboard. If you happen to have a gamepad it eases this considerably, but you're probably going to have to spend a moment remapping the default controls-- no biggie.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects about the steam version is the cloud saving. True: its usless if you dont have an internet connection where you want to play. But I like the ability to play on my PC, go wherever, and pick the game right back up on my laptop. Aside from that there is also a "character booster" if you get stuck...or want to be a badass. I have not used the feature mainly because I forgot my square-enix login stuff moments after i made it.\n\nIts not particularly weak in any areas but isnt as deep in character skill devlopment as I would like sometimes. Rather than molding your character(s) into what you want them to be, you have to play to each character's strengths-- again, no biggie.\n\nTheres no voiceover, which is a huge plus for me. The story is good, characters are likeable, the gameplay is solid, and its good on length. It's probably 20 hours on the game clock on a casual playthough if you ignore endgame badass equipment, skills, and sidequests. All-in-all its worth it if it's on sale, but if you just want a stroll down memory lane you might be better off digging out the old PS1.","November 26, 2013","true","49.5"," 134 of 190 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","134","190","0","0"

It's the best story I've ever played. I'm 27 now, and have been playing this game since the day it came out. What tells me this is a good game... I can describe to you where I was when I played it. The time of day, who had the controller, my brother or myself.\n\nIf you haven't played this before, I welcome you to YOUTUBE some of the FF7 Remake Live Reactions.

I can't hear the word Cloud without picturing golden spiky hair.\n\n*----------------SPOILER ALERT---------------------*\n\nI remember the morning I sat and watched my brother play through the Forgotten City (Capital).

It's just a repack of the original port from over a decade ago.  Some things that show it's an effortless port:\n\n-Characters faces are bugged.  All eyes are open, even if they're sleeping. All mouths are gaping, which looks ridiculous after a time.\n\n-Controller mapping is awful (XBOX 360 controller).  The D-pad can't be mapped, which makes battle menus a pain.  You'll often accidentally slide to the side and choose Defend when trying to scroll down the menu.  R2/L2 can't be mapped.  The OK button decides to go "turbo mode" frequently and skip dialog.\n\n-No 16:9 mode (I don't count 4:3 awfully stretched to 16:9)\n\n-Lots of odd crashes.  If you tab out of fullscreen, it will crash.  If your controller idles off while tabbed out in windowed mode, the game will crash.  For a non-autosaving game with 90s-style spread out save points, this is infuriating.\n\n-If it can't sync your cloud saves, you can't save the game unless you exit and turn off cloud saving (losing your progress in the offing).\n\nIf you played this in the 90s, and you want to give it a nostalgic run, go for it.  But know that you're going to have to accept a lot of lousy-port-isms.  If you didn't play this in the 90s, the dated graphics, old gameplay mechanics and PC quirks will make you regret the purchase. I wish I could give it a 6.5 instead of a "Not recommended" because it is still fun, and it's great to go back and play.","December 10, 2013","false","75.2"," 65 of 87 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","65","87","2","1"

It's a big adventure, you'll meet lots of different characters, good and bad guys. You come across so many different and unique places. There are lots of minigames, optional quests, and enemies to fight. The Materia system is really nice. It's fun to let Materia grow and allows for a lot of diversity in battle. Graphics are outdated, however, they give you that 90's feel. The soundtrack is gorgeous as expected from Nobuo Uematsu's fantastic work. People feel nostalgic for this game, and with good reason. It's a game every self-proclaimed JRPG fan should have experienced, especially with the remake coming up.\n\nIf you want to relive your childhood, or maybe experience a Final Fantasy game (or a Japanese RPG at all), then this is a good game to grab.\n\nSome technical stuff: It has DRM, it requires you to make a Square Enix-account (not that hard), and it does have achievements and cloud saving. It can be played with a controller, I recommend using this fix, or using the Steam Controller and making a layout yourself. This version has smoothed-out graphics which make it look a little bit smoother than the original PlayStation-version.","December 30, 2015","true","50.2"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","47","58","2","4"

It pushed the petty PS1 to astronomical levels above and beyond what it was intended for. Square had developed a game so indepth, so massive, that it took THREE discs just to contain it all! Great writing, beautiful story telling, breath-taking art, and a soundtrack that will sweep your mind away and invoke so many emotions are the words to describe this....AND SQUARE FREAKIN' RUINS IT WITH THIS PC RELEASE!

The new music and sounds are literally painful. A guide here on Steam shows how to get the original music, but what was Square thinking?! If you can get the work around for the music to work (or use youtube like me), see past the DRM, and fight the weird PC controls, one of the greatest games ever made lies hidden behind it all.

The holy grail. The best of them all. The pinicle of the series.\n\nDo I think that? No, actually, I don't. I liked IX more than VII personally. However, I do still enjoy this game and I do recommend it. Don't let my play time fool you, I've got 3 complete playthroughs under my belt on the PS1 and I recently purchased this PC version so I can always have it on hand.\n\nThis game holds a special place in a lot of people's hearts because it was the very first 3D final fantasy game and it has a story that hooks you early, and keeps you going throughout.\n\nIt's very important to keep in mind that this game came out in 1997. 17 years ago at the time of this review. That's nearly two decades, and this PC release of the original PS1 game is by and large the exact same graphically. They did slightly upgrade the character models and portraits, but they're still just as blocky as they were then.\n\nA downside with the PC release is the MIDI sound files are not the best of quality. That can be modded though, if you're feeling rather adventurous as modding is not a built in feature so it takes following some guides to know what files to replace and in what folders. The graphics can also be modded to make the game look more recent than it really is, but with these you have to be a bit more careful as the most popular set of mods will make you unable to gain achievements in the game or use the cloud saves. That is because the mods were created for the original PC release of the game, and not this much more recent Steam release and no one has gone through the effort of porting all those mods over to work with the Steam version to keep achievements active.\n\nThe game itself has a standard RPG story that you'll come to expect from Final Fantasy games, and as you probably know it is highly regarded by many. VI and VII are by and large the absolute most popular Final Fantasy games, and that's likely always to be the case. I really don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into specifics.\n\nA unique feature of the game is its materia system, which is a system where your weapon and armor has slots in which you can equip materia that gives you access to a specific spell. This allows you to take your characters and build them up with exactly the spells you want them to have, but you can switch it up to meet any paticular challenge without any penalties. This is particularly nice because it allows you to put the characters you most care about into your active party and not be punished for doing so. Characters still maintain a unique identity through their limit break skills. The only exception being that through much of the game you are required to use the main character, Cloud, but you're free to pick and choose the other two fairly early in the game.\n\nFor a very early PS1 game, it still features a lot of content like an overworld map, travel by airships, mini-games, optional super bosses, etc. Now, while it has an overworld map don't be fooled into thinking it's open world. It isn't. Like most of the Final Fantasy games it is by and large linear, but at about the halfway to 2/3 mark you do start to get more freedom in where you go. It's linear in that while you can wonder around the map, natural barriers prevent you from going too far from where you are suppose to get until you advance the story and unlock new modes of transportation.\n\nOverall I do think this is a good game, and worth playing through at least once if you have not done so. If you've already played through the game once before on a different system and are just curious what the changes are, I'd probably skip this as the changes in graphics is minimal.","December 30, 2014","true","35.9"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","33","47","2","0"

How I usually avoid writing these kind of things.\n\nSo you know, whether or not this 'review' has a thumbs down is completely irrelevant.\nI have a fond place in my memories for this game and it will always sit there, regardless of this ports overall quality.\nIt's by far and wide not my favourite of the series, but it sits high on the list.\n\nThat said, this is a passable port at best. At it's worst it's an OLD port of the original PC release.\nThe music, while seemingly a huge issue for some didn't even register with me.\nThe needless always online DRM for a game I've been playing since 1998 is also not a selling point, but once you've signed up for an account, it just becomes a minor hurdle to get into your game (not wholly unlike the Steam service itself). It's more a mark of the times in which we live than an actual mark against the game.\n\nAt face value, all of what made Final Fantasy VII such a fan favourite is still very much present in this port.\nBut recently sitting down to an in-depth playthrough (My first actual playthrough since buying the game on Steam) has brought some... Light issues to my attention.\n\n- Graphics:\nNo, no. This isn't a "Man, why do all the characters look like Popeye?" kind of graphical issue, this is more of a "Why update the models but not their faces?" issue.\nAs mentioned the models are updated, looking smoother with less pixelation on the edges, the characters really stand out against the background (sometimes they even stand out against the foreground for no reason) and it runs beautifully smooth, rarely any sign of frame lag. But as I said, the faces for the characters seem to have been lifted straight from the Playstation version and then plastered onto the new models.\n\nBeyond that there are a couple of fascinating new gltiches/oversights that I've noticed. First of which being the gaped, open-mouth vacant look most characters seem to have. The most hilarious example being Sephiroth. Man, is it hard to take Aeris' death seriously when Sephiroth is standing over her the whole time with his mouth wide open THE WHOLE TIME.\n\nThe second facial issue I noticed while inside the HoneyBee Inn's Group Room.\nObviously, there are some copy-pasted dudes in that room, that's no secret, but did you noticed the black guys have blonde eyebrows whenever they blink? It's not even limited to them...\nRemember the scene where Barret and Dyne lose their arms? Well the moment where Barret recoils from being shot in the wrist there's a fabulous close up of his face, blone eyebrows and all.\n\n- Controls:\nIf you're playing using your Keyboard, congratulations, you're clearly more patient than most of us...\nIf you're playing using a Gamepad... Again, You're probably more patient than any of us.\n\nThe button configuration for this game is a logistical nightmare and the games outirght refusal to relay meaningful information about what the buttons actually do is a hurdle I certainly could have done without.\nThis is a complaint from someone who is admittedly not a "seasoned PC gamer". So I'm not all too familiar with the buttons on my keyboard that don't type words or relate to something in photoshop. Nor do I know which button is "button 4" or whatever on my wired 360 controller. So that is on me. I'll freely accept that I could be better informed in this instance.\n\nHowever, if I plug my controller in to play a pre-analog game from 1997 and for reasons never explained there is no D-Pad support what-so-ever, then yes. I'd call that an issue.\nIf I have to run Joy-To-Key in the background of a port of Final Fantasy VII so that I don't have to manipulate menus with an analog stick then someone in the process of this port wasn't working hard enough.\n\nI will say though, once I got Joy-To-Key worked into the equation, navigating the world with the analog and switching to D-Pad for battle menu navigation felt so much better than the original experience on the Playstation. So, analog support is a pro, but no D-Pad option negates it entirely.\n\nFor some people I understand that this won't sound like a big problem "Oh boo-hoo! You had to configure the buttons to your liking on a PC game!" And normally, those people would be right... Kind of.\nBut with a port of a Playstation game, that is as much-beloved as this one I'd like to imagine that maintaining as much of the original experience as possible would be the most important thing to the developer.\n\nMaking the controls wonky to the point of needing outside assistance to work is counter-active to that goal.\nAnd if you can't have fun controlling a game, then it's hardly an experience worth paying for in my opinion.\n\nSo all together, there are some minor and now I think about it, really funny graphical glitches and the controls are so poorly handled that chances are you'll spend more time trying to work out how to make it all go then you ever will saving the world from slack jawed Sephiroth.\nThe game as is, isn't the most offensive port I've ever played but it's a ways off being one of the best. Like I said at the start, at best it's passable, at worst it's old and nothing learned from the years before this release was ever implemented.\n\nMy verdict? Well chances are if you liked this game already then you've likely bought it before even reading this. If not, I'd suggest buying the PSN port instead if you can, as it's essentially a 1 to 1 version of the original Playstation and requires less set-up and is no where near as fiddly controller-wise.\n","February 3, 2015","false","38.7"," 82 of 134 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","82","134","6","7"

With no way to assign the d-pad to up/down/left/right I'm forced to use the analog stick, which for this game (and its constant awkward movement angles) is seriously debilitating.\n\nCloud saving is apparently not working right now, which meant when I hit the first save point I actually couldn't save at all - even though it's telling me it's using local files, it just errors with a 'save file not found' first time I try to save.\n\nIt forces you to create a Square Enix account and 'log in' just to play the game - which is unnecessary and obnoxious, especially since the only benefit to the player, cloud saving, doesn't seem to be working, at least for me.\n\nThere are no graphical improvements here, so all in all I feel I'm better off running the original PSX version in an emulator than running this.

It's one of the best Final Fantasy games to date, which is easily said due to all of it's spinoffs like the absolutely thrilling Dirge of Cerbeus, the wonderful prequil Chrisis Core, and the ever popular movie Advent Children (just to name a few).\n\nThat said, there are some good and bad with this Steam version of Final Fantasy VII, so lets get the list going;\n\nCONS:\n\n- Requires you to be online and sign in via Square Enix before playing.\n- Cloud saving is slow (2-5 min pause) and you can't Save/Load until it's ready.\n- No additional content added.\n- Subtitles have been censored, which actually removes a bit of character emotion.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Final Fantasy VII\n- Graphical Enhancements (allowing high resolutions).\n- Video and Overlayed characters are better synced.\n- Music has been updated (uses the higher-quality playstation audio tracks)\n- Subtitles have been "repaired" to remove "engrish" language.\n- Fully mapable keys & controller support.\n- Ability to disable cloud saving.\n\nSo is the game something I would recommend?  Of course it is!  It's Final Fantasy 7 for cryin out loud!  But...  If you already own a copy of Final Fantasy VII on a console than there is no real reason to get this one.  There isn't any new content, just updating for modern PC technology.  That said, if you have the older PC version (and love it) then replacing it with this one might be a good idea.\n\nAs far as the price, I don't actually believe this game is worth $17.  I'm willing to bet most individuals who are looking to purchase this game are doing so because they already have Final Fantasy VII and are simply looking to update it...  I purchased it during a 50% off sale for $8.49, which I consider a decent price.\n\nAll in all I'm giving this a NOT recommended.  Shocked?  Well it's true that I love Final Fantasy VII but Square Enix screwed up with a few things.  First, this is a single-player only game so an internet account should NOT be a requirement.  Second, the regular price is a little high for a game that is almost 20 years old (no matter how good it is).  Third, the Cloud Save feature (which is the only real reason for being online) is so horribly slow you'd be better off going back to CD swapping.\n\nSo as much as I'd love to give this a thumbs up, because I really love this game, I simply can't.","February 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","27","40","0","0"

Many gamers, particularly RPG fans, have played through this game not once but a multitude of times. I downloaded the new Steam version and played through it one more time on my PC to assess how the game has aged.\n\nThe very first thing that I noticed about the game was the chasm between how well the audio design and soundtrack have aged versus how poorly the graphics have. It becomes clearly apparent that sprites have aged far better than polygonal characters when comparing this game to an older, sprite-based games in the series such as Final Fantasy VI. Sprites carried a certain charm to them, and remain tolerable despite their lack of beauty. Polygons, for lack of a better description, just look strange and ugly. Their blockiness represents a human character far more poorly than even a sprite can. To compare it to Hollywood, sprites are like Disney cartoon of the '70s, while polygons are like the bad special effects of the '80s. The audio, however, has aged gracefully. Nobuo Uematsu's score has always been perfect for the game, and I remembered how fond I was of it the first time around immediately upon starting the game again.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII, to me, was the beginning of Square's "hit-or-miss" character design specifically regarding western gamers. As a western gamer, I just can't see the appeal in a character like Cait Sith. While the majority of the characters still have good levels of depth and development, Cait Sith is a worthless entity who brings absolutely nothing to the game. He's a quirky stuffed toy injected into the game to please a culture that I just can't understand. Square Enix has continued down this path even further in future games, particularly in Final Fantasy XII, which saw two cherubic children as the main protagonists. Yuck. But there are some game-savers here. Cloud is such a deep and human character that it's worth playing through the game just to witness his growth. Sephiroth's villainy hasn't shown age, either. He's still one of the best gaming villains in history, a title well earned.\n\nIt's obvious what to expect from the gameplay. This game is purely old school JRPG. It doesn't bother me, as it's a type of game that I once had a huge affinity for. I can jump back into the more slowly-paced, active turn-based battle systems any time and still enjoy it. To others, it may be a bit more tedious. This is especially true regarding random battles. As an old-school JRPG player, random battles are familiar to me and sort of a necessary evil. To others, the tedium may be intolerable. It's difficult for me to be objective enough to say.\n\nI've always loved the materia system. It's my favorite form of character development in any Final Fantasy game, and it holds up. Growing your materia through the management of your weapons is so much fun, and the high-level materia such as Slash-All and Double Cut really make you feel all-powerful toward the end portion of the game..\n\nThe main complaint that I have about the game is an issue that never seemed to bother me before. The control of Cloud through the various pre-rendered areas is absolutely atrocious. Pressing up on the directional pad will sometimes cause him to go left or right, and pressing right or left on the pad will sometimes cause him to go down. There's no clear indication of when this will happen -- It's unique to each area. This becomes particularly annoying in areas where random battles occur. Very often I'd find myself doubling back due to this, and fighting far more random battles than I actually had to.\n\nI wouldn't be able to conclude this without mentioning the cutscenes and minigames. The idea of rewarding players with a CGI cutscene during certain parts of the game was a fresh, new concept at the time of the game's release. Seeing the devs at Square flaunt their graphical prowess was mind-blowing, and the cutscenes were unlike anything in video games at the time. They truly were rewarding, and I remember being so impressed as a 12-year old first playing this game that I recorded them on a VHS tape for later playback. The minigames were also groundbreaking, but have aged poorly. Bad control plagues many of them, specifically the motorcycle and snowboarding games. But the inclusion of these changed the genre for years; the lack of minigames in a post-Final Fantasy VII JRPG would be a strange omission for a later title.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII has got its problems. In some cases, it's aged beautifully and become the historically powerful title that gamers expected it to be upon its release. Final Fantasy VII brought RPGs as a whole into the mainstream. Without Final Fantasy VII, games like Mass Effect 2 and Fallout 3 may never have been developed at all. The graphics and control, however, will be nearly unbearable to any gamer going back in time to play this game for the first time.\n\nAs far as the Steam specific port that I'm reviewing here? Unfortunately... It's total trash\n\nEvery resolution that isn't 640x480 windowed looks terrible. They've upped the resolution on the characters and NPCs, but the pre-rendered backgrounds are the same so they look awful in any other resolution. And don't even think about going to 16:9. All it does is stretch the picture to fit the screen. Barf.\n\nThere's also a persistent black bar along the bottom of the screen that is only ever filled in when accessing the menu. Imagine you're watching a film in letterbox, except that there's only one black bar on the bottom of the screen and no matching bar on the top. Just awful.\n\nOn top of the graphical issues, Square's ridiculous DRM is present. You must log into Square Enix when you first start the game. People already hate Uplay. Why would Square do this? It's an idiotic move.\n\nI'm a die-hard PC gamer, but even I have to say that the best way to play this game in the modern day is to download the PSone port from the Playstation Store and play it on a PSP or a Vita. I wouldn't recommend the PC port to anybody that isn't looking to modify it heavily, as mods are basically the only reason to purchase the PC rerelease.\n\nPeople have also mentioned the music quality being subpar compared to the PS1 version, but it honestly didn't affects my experience at all. I've played through the game probably a dozen times since 1997 at this point, and while I definitely noticed the music being different, it didn't seem any worse than the original game.\n\nIn conclusion, this game still remains a must-play for anyone who liked the original or any gamer looking for a history lesson. Like an old painting, Final Fantasy VII continues to be historically relevant and is worth seeing and experiencing if only to recognize the influence it had on present day gaming. But the paint has aged, and the artwork is unfortunately not quite as vibrant and stunning as it once was.\n\nJust don't play the newly released PC port. It's a bad.","December 6, 2013","false","79.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","3"

Something I would have liked is to have less battles along the way when traveling but it's good that way aswell so you level up constantly and have a better chance through the game. But I recommend it to all players who have enjoyed other final fantasy games. This one is a classic and would be a good one to try if new to the ff series.

The game's good and the music's cool and everything, but... Did people really care that much for these emotionless-looking blocks of people that consisted of two 3D polygons? Also the backgrounds are in really bad resolution and the game feels pretty slow... Especially in battles where there actually appears to be lag! Was this seriously  what the original game was like?!\n\nLook, being faithful to the original release of a game is good. I love originals more than remakes most of the time! But there are some games that are better when they're remade, such as Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver. I think Final Fantasy 7 should have an HD version by now or something? I don't know, but this original PS1 version here just isn't drawing me in as much as I thought it would. It's NOT keeping my attention... Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance? Still...\n\nEDIT: ARG! How could I forget that whole... What do you call it? DRM? Why would you do that for a game that supports no multiplayer in anyway?! And don't give me an argument involving updates... That's Steam's deal, not yours Square Enix! People hated the Xbone for pulling the very stunt you're trying to pull on me now!

Final Fantasy VII starts the player off in Midgar, a city that uses the Planet's energy to use everyday tools such as electricity. A terrorist group called AVALANCHE plan on destroying the complany thats pretty much in charge of the world, Shinra Inc. Now what does this have to do with ur character? Well Cloud used to work for the company as a First Class SOLDIER but he eventually left and is now fighting with AVALANCHE to destroy Shinra. There is another plot in the story besides taking down Shinra which is killing Sephiroth. Im gonna let the players discover how big of a role almost every character is in this game no, series. Final Fantasy VII's story is so big and explained that there are 3 parts of it. Crisis Core is before the events of Final Fantasy VII and Advent Children which is a movie which takes place 2 years after Final Fantasy VII.\nThe presentation is simply amazing. Even though this game was first made on the Playstation 1 in 1997, the graphics still look amazing to this day. Almost everything is hand drawn such as the background but when ur enterting a train for example, the whole screen changes just to make the train move and than go back to the hand drawn background. The only reason y every character is almost entirely made out of polygons is because of the size of the game. For those who dont know, This game came with 3 discs on the PS1 so it makes sense for characters to be polygons.\nThe gameplay is awesome and theres 2 types of it. The first type of gaming is just roaming around in the world map and through villages/towns. The second type is the Role playing. You must wait till ur time gauge fills up in order to choose wat to attack. There are diffrent kinds of magic in this game and when you level up ur materia (items to improve ur characters) u may get increased damage as well as new spells such as using Cure3 when leveling up ur materia. You not only earn EXP but u also earn AP for materia. There are also Summons in the game like in almost every Final Fantasy game. Even though u ccant skip any cutscenes of summon cutscenes, its always nice to watch some animations such as Knights of the Round (Best Summon) and Bahamut ZERO's cutscenes.\nI give this game a 10 out of 10 because even though this may not be acceptable graphics for this generation (2015). it still shows that u can break the limits of a PS1 by simply using more discs.","December 15, 2015","true","114.7"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","61","30","49","9","2"

You're going to jump in a long and fantastic adventure, in a fantasy world, populated by crazy creatures and wonderful, charismatic and lovable characters. Be aware though, "fantasy world" doesen't necessarily means "perfect, colored and happy". No. In this world there are death, pain, depression, corruption, broken hearts and broken dreams, avarice, homicide... This list could continue. Yes, you live in this kind of world, but you don't care at all, you're interested only in your profit. Oh, but things will change. Soon you'll rediscover emotions, passion, you'll rediscover life. You'll rediscover details of your life that will remember you that you used to be real. You used to be alive. And you can be once again. Learning the values of llove, friendship, sacrifice. When you will be called, along with your bizarre, imperfect but tight-knit group to save humanity. If this isn't enough, you got a serious problem. I shouldn't even talk about graphics or gameplay, here they doesen't count. But some people is just obsessed, so... It's a classic turn based RPG well structured, with an open world exploration outside the battles. The graphics are not new, but is remastered, pleasant for the eyes compared to the PS1 version. The difficulty is hard, the asked efforts are many. Is this not enough? Come back to Call Of Duty then. This game is effort. This game is emotion. This game is life.                     (Sorry for my bad english.)\n\nItaliano:\n\nDa dove comincio? Stai per tuffarti in una lunga e fantastica avventura in un mondo di fantasia, popolato da creature pazzesche e personaggi stupendi, carismatici amabili e ben caratterizzati. Ma attenzione, "mondo di fantasia" non significa necessariamente che sia un mondo perfetto, felice e colorato. No. In questo mondo esistono morte, dolore, depressione, corruzione, sogni e cuori infranti, avarizia, omicidio... La lista continuerebbe ancora. Si, tu vivi in questo tipo di mondo, ma non ti interessa particolarmente, sei interessato solo al tuo tornaconto. Oh, ma le cose cambieranno. Ben presto riscoprirai le emozioni, la passione, riscoprirai la vita. Riscoprirai particolari della tua esistenza che ti ricorderanno che una volta eri vero, una volta eri vivo. E puoi esserlo ancora. Imparando i valori dell'amore, dell'amicizia, dell sacrificio.  Quando verrai chiamato, assieme al tuo bizzarro, imperfetto, ma affiatato gruppo a salvare l'umanità. Se questo non è abbastanza, hai un serio problema. Non ci dovrebbe essere nemmeno bisogno di parlare di gameplay e grafica, qui non contano. Ma certa gente è ossessionata da cose del genere, dunque vi accontento. Il gameplay è il classico RPG a turni ben strutturato, con esplorazione open world fuori dalle battaglie. La grafica non è moderna, ma è rimasterizzata, resa piacevole agli occhi rispetto a quella per PS1. La difficoltà è alta, l'impegno richiesto è molto. Non basta ancora? Allora torna pure a giocare a Call Of Duty. Questo gioco è impegno. Questo gioco è emozione.

Many gamers can tell you how iconic this gem from 1997 is. One piece of evidence showing that it is the most iconic JRPG game and one of the overall most iconic games of all time is its main character, Cloud, who many consider to be the most iconic JRPG character of all time (Cloud has the most playable appearances of any FF character of all time, including his addition to the latest Smash Bros game, and is the second most reoccuring character in FF games being beaten by Gilgamesh only - including non-FF games, Cloud may be the most reoccurring FF character of all time).\n\nIts graphics were revolutionary (at the time), and its story is one that will live with most who have played it for the rest of their lives. Not only is the story immersive, but it also does something a lot of games fail to do, which is focus on all of its main characters. The game shows each character's growth and backstory in such a way that it is near impossible to not get emotionally invested in them. It even makes you feel particularly sorry for the bad guy, especially if you find some of the hidden secrets in the game that explain his story a bit more. It isn't the most popular Final Fantasy game of all time for nothing.

I even did a « downvote » evaluation.\n\nAlright, I knew that I would try to game more and that I might like it\nand would change my evaluation (actually, I really did one but I\ntrolled a bit on it. oAo Kinda. Was more like frustrated xD)\n\nBasically, Final Fantasy VII is a wonderful game.\n\nYou might get lost in the beginning and hate the game (total beginning), but keep playing.\nTrust me, you will thank me later.\nThe story is amazing, the game is pretty long itself. They were many quests\nnext to it, even though the game is from 1997.\nMost of players, when they first played the game, got lost. They did not know what was\ngoing on in that kind of uggly Factory area.\nBut the game will explain you what was up at this time, a bit later.\n\nThe fighting gameplay is awesome and kind of original, for a old RPG game kind!\n\nThe game has some glitches that makes the game unique.\nI really hope that, in the FF7 remake, they would put the "duplicate item" glitch system back.\nIt's one of the main reason of why players love this game. xD\n\nAnd you know what !?\nAfter doing the game, SquareEnix offers you an awesome and beautiful movie named « Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children » which is the following of the Story.\nWonderful movie look for a 2004~2007 movie made.\nThe only one thing I regret about that movie is the Kid voice acting.\nLike in many movies but oh well! I'm getting out of the topic.\n\nPlease, buy FF7, enjoy every minutes out of it. Even the most annoying minutes. There is so much to do.\n\nStory, fights, chasing materias, growing chocobos, playing in Gold-Saucer, improving your character, hunting Achievements.\n\nUnlike my first evaluation, I do recommend you this game.\n\nPeace! ♥","January 28","true","138.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","10","14","3","2"

It was revolutionary when it first came out for the PS1, and was one of the best selling games of 1997. The PC port is amazing. The original soundtrack was replaced with a newer soundtrack, and the graphics were also dramatically improved. I, personally, did not enjoy the music that was put into the PC port of this. However, with the aid of mods, I was able to replace the PC soundtrack with the classic PS1 soundtrack.  The PC port also offers 3 different graphics choices, depending on the preferences of the user. The user can choose between the PS1 graphics, or the PC graphics, as well as a mod that gives combat 3D graphics. One downside of this game, is the fact that you have to create a Square Enix account to play. This was a disappointment for me, but not enough to keep me from playing it. Aside from the technical aspects of this game, the gameplay is amazing. This is by far, the best game I have ever owned, because of the great story, the great soundtrack, the amazing combat, and the replayability. After spending over 500 hours on this game over three different game systems, I won't be stopping any time soon. I highly recommend FFVII, and honestly, this game is worth much more than $11.99.","December 2, 2013","true","160.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

I bought this PC game to  support the future development of Final Fantasy games on the PC platform, however if this is the way Square Enix plans to treat the PC platform they just shouldn't support it at all.\n\nI was aware of the DRM when buying. Having a single Square account seemed easy enough to handle and I was craving some nostalgia. So I created a Square account, but apparently it takes a while for the game to register an account creation because it didn't immediately register that my account was valid. I tried logging in on the opening screen for thirty minutes to no avail, but when I came back two hours later Square was finally ready to let me play my game. But when I started playing, I found myself in a fresh new nightmare.\n\nThe controls are atrocious with a keyboard. To keep things short, in order to interact with people, doors, and items in the game the character must be facing the object. The buttons are too sensitive and if I don't take my fingers off the movement keys at exactly the same time the character moves to face which ever key I take my finger off last, even if it's last by less than a millisecond, making the character turn in a direction the item is not in. It is infuriating to try to talk to people or open doors because of this sensitivity. I found my self trying many times just to interact with characters.\n\nIn order to not deal with this issue, I tried plugging in a controller- and the controller just as bad as the keyboard; the only way to move a character using a 360 controller is with the joy stick, the game IGNORES the directional pads altogether. It feels so wrong using the joystick in this game. Complaining about feeling may be nit-picky to some, but after spending so much time playing the original FFVII using the directional pad and playing all the other FF games using a directional pad, I have the question why Square willfully made this game ignore them. The PS3 and PSP versions of this game do not force players to use the joysticks, why do PC players, who normally enjoy the freedom of choice, get the short end of the stick with this game? I bought the game for nostalgia, and without good controls there is definitely no nostalgia.\n\nAt every turn, even from first booting it up, it seems Square Enix did not want me to play the game. So I have not played this game. I'll probably come back to it when I'm less infuriated, but ,if you buy it, do know this game comes with issues that Square Enix willfully put in the game.","January 31, 2014","false","4.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

Whilst not my own personal favourite, there is a lot here to love.\n\nAlthough looking a little jaded by today's "modern" standards, back in the day the graphics were thought of as a technological breakthrough; VII is the first true 3D game of the FFs. It may be a little blocky now, but if you really take issue with that then there are plenty of nice-looking mods for the PC version.\n\nAt its heart, FFVII is an underdog story, telling the tale of a ragtag resistance facing a corrupt organisation (and later on, something even worse - a threat to the entire planet, coming from a villain who is without a doubt the most recogniseable of the series.) The characters are (mostly...I'm ignoring the existence of Cait Sith for the purpose of this review) a likeable bunch, with mixed backstories and rather good development. Cloud comes off as a little dull and bland to begin with, but he comes into his own later on. Occasionally the plot may take a little turn for the confusing and wacky, but it's largely resolved to a clean degree (anything that isn't is explained more in-depth through the spin offs.) The villains are very entertaining, and in some cases you really end up hating them - which is the point, naturally.\n\nThe Materia system is a nice touch - any character can equip any skill, and the more you battle the more powerful these skills become, and the more often you can use them. There is a real sense of progression and accomplishment.\n\nOf course, as expected by now, the music is another accomplishment. This game probably has my favourite "standard" boss battle theme of the lot, except from maybe that of VI. The town themes largely have their own feel (an East Asian theme for Wutai, a tribal one for Cosmo Canyon, etc.) Also, "One-Winged Angel." Those of you who have played this before know that I need say nothing else.\n\nThis is the "entry game" for a lot of players, and it does give a very nice feel of what to expect from the other games. It wasn't afraid to take risks with both technological boundaries and storytelling, and should be admired for that reason alone. As I mentioned - not my favourite, but no less of a gaming classic.","May 8","true","48.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

As a result, when it became available for a remarkably good price of four USD I picked it up.\n\nThat said, they could have done a much better job on porting this game.  By the numbers:\n\n1.  The controls are permanently set, and if you don't own a gamepad you're permanently saddled with the most non-intuitive control scheme I've ever seen, where the binds make little to no sense and are scattered all over the keyboard.\n\n2.  The client is inherently unstable, to a point where I suffered from 4(!) crashes by the time I had finished the first battle.  I'm talking complete crash to desktop restarts here.\n\n3.  In addition to this glaring problem, the client hangs severely even when next to no load is being placed on the system.  The first fight, as mentioned earlier, while not overly complicated and only requiring a total of 4 attacks including the ones against the player character took me over five minutes to complete.  Now I know that I don't have the best computer in the world, especially when I'm playing on my laptop like I am, but this system has no difficulty handling modern games.  It should be taking FFVII and bending it over the table, but instead it hangs... especially in the CGI sequences where I had to use CTRL+ALT+DEL to force close the client a few times because the video had picked a spot and froze while the TERRIBLE 8 bit sounding music was on a 2 second loop that would make the most patient man in the world go insane.\n\nTo sum up, while I was very interested in playing this game, and I am sure that if it is patched to a playable state it will be excellent and enjoyable, I simply cannot recommend it to anyone in its current condition.  Ya let me down Square Enix.","April 19, 2014","false","0.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","5"

If you're reading this to find out if the PC port is worth playing, then simply, yes it is. I heard people complain about the DRM and Square Enix account nonsense before buying it and all you have to do is make a Square Enix account through the game launcher one time and then it'll just auto log you in every time.\n\nI heard people complain about the music problems, well thankfully they patched out the terrible midi music and put back in the original soundtrack that people remember from the PS1 so that's no longer an issue.\n\nThe graphics are improved from the playstation original, they've been upscaled and look noticeably better to where this is a preferrable version to the ps1 original. There's also no compatability issues like there was in the original pc port.\n\nIf you have never played this game before, buy it, it's one of if not the best JRPG of all time, and unlike later Final Fantasy games the story doesn't completely fall apart when you look through it critically.\n","July 19, 2014","true","2.5"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","1"

If you are capable to accept the simple graphics, you should really consider to play this game. In my opinion it has by far the best in-game and battle-system, giving the player the chance to find secrets and giving him the chance to obtain Bestias (powerful summonings which the heroes can summon at a certain state in the game) which are hidden somewhere in the game. Even though it's really old, it tried to do some easy render-sequences and if you want to the graphics are, with some know-how and troubleshooting, fully modable (be careful with spoilers while doing so).

I remember spending most nights either manically grinning at how cool the game and graphics were, or heartbroken by bit of storyline. I had the guide (lost in a move sadly), and its what made me turn from my megadrive to the pc for gaming.\nFlash forward to 15 year later, when I see this for sale and think I will re-live the good old days. I have a family and work, so I'm still playing late at night, only difference is now I'm not being naughty up past my bed time. That being said there have been nights when my wife has walked in and I almost jumped out of my skin, thats how hard the nostalgia has hit me.\nFFVII has some of the best characters, and is an amazing story. The only downside is the graphics which for a 19 year old game are pretty awesome, but thats not saying much by todays standards.\nThe remake is supposedly on its way, but I am wary about the innevitably changes and how it could taint my memories. That being said I will probably give it a go, but if you havent played the game, or like me you played it years ago I would recommend having another go now!\n\nTLDR:\nRe-live your childhood, or set it right with what you missed.

Yes, in broad strokes, there's supposed to be a pattern and such, but as you get to the details it is nonsensical. Yeah, the death scene was tragic and yeah I cried, ♥♥♥♥ you I was young and had no idea and had raised that character as one of my powerhouses, but despite that the rest is just crap.

Well now customer got 1 more ID & Password to be remembered for a single player game (HEY THIS IS BAD !! It's FF VII single player offline not FF XIV)\n\nNew features : Achievement & Online Save & Character Booster\n\n(Character Booster is the worst aspect of the game, it makes the game become not fun anymore, because our character now come with max hp and max gil..... You know what ? Our hero become too strong and the enemy become too weak now !!) Why don't SE replace the bonus with something make sense which not make our character become overpower ? such as : + 10 materia of medium level + some medicine (20 potion 20 elixir 20 ether) etc etc whatever.... instead of max hp and max gil :(\n\n\nAnd i'm a bit dissappointed about the graphic option.\nDon't get me wrong... i know it's a classic game, so i don't expect any high texture like modern - Geforce GTX 770 VGA - games today.

Why ??? Because u lazy !!! u lazy !! and liar !!  U don't make any worth improvement, u just repackage it and add new but not so worth features, and sell it with lies !! That's why many customers regret to buy FINAL FANTASY VIII (Yes FF 8) (repackage product of SE), even the old original 1998 PS version of FF VIII game has better music quality than the new repackage FF VIII of 2013 !! And some of them are vowed not to buy any future products of lazy liar developer, unless bla bla...... (well u know what i'm about to say)\n\n\nI've been thinking of purchasing FINAL FANTASY VIII on Steam, but since that SE has broke this originally fantastic FF VIII (Graphic & Audio) to a disgrace level - a piece of crap, now i'm holding back !  I won't buy FINAL FANTASY VIII in this state for $ 11.99   :|\nWill that SE release some patch for this game ??\n\nWell let's see the future products of SE :|\n\n\n\n************\nUpdate FF VII\n************\n\n\nRecently i'm attaching Tifa Bootleg Mod to this FF VII\n\nIt's works like a charm... a pretty cool improvement in graphic and sound.\nBut yea ofcouse It's not a full 100% HD Remake in all aspect of the game.\n\nTifa Bootleg Mod let u to costumize character model, graphic texture, sound, weapon,\nmenu style, icons , better trainer, and more...\n\nTifa Bootleg mod can upgrade ur FF VII music & also FMV cut scenes to a better quality ones.\n\nTifa Bootleg can also make this game graphic strecth to widescreen resolution, but\nu will notice that's something wrong there, cause the game wasn't designed for,\nand never been remake to support widescreen display.\n\nThe mod is the only way to play FINAL FANTASY VII HD Remake version :)\nCoz that lazy hand Square Enix will never do it, except the FF community.\n\nNah... nah.... SE will never remake FF VII, too much effort for it,\nthat's what they thought.\nThanks to the community for this work.\n\n\nU can launch FF VII from Steam. but with limitation of the mod's resource.\nTo use all of the resource from the mod, u need to launch FF VII from Tifa's Launcher,\nbut by doing this : losing achievements and save games.\n\nYes not a perfect mod though, but for me this one is good enough.\n\nThe installation is quite easy, but yea the pain is u need to download around 16 GB :D\n\nThanks to FF Community !!","December 24, 2013","false","134.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Well let me assure you, I played the original PSX version for hundreds of hours when it came out. FF7, while not the best of the series (a title which belongs to KEFKA....er, I mean Final Fantasy 3.....er, I mean 6), is still a classic masterpiece which paved the ground for many modern roleplaying titles ever since. If you have never played it before, you need to do yourself a favor and give it a shot........just not THIS version.\n\nIts most unfortunate because there is almost ZERO load time, a boon which will cut HOURS of wasted time out of your adventure which you were forced to deal with in PSX-era. (I made it out of Midgar in less than 5  hours....true, I know what to do and where to go, but its still hours faster than Id ever manage on the console, considering it took a good 20+ the first time or two).\n\nThe in-battle graphics and sprites on the map are anti-aliased to the point of looking like chibi vinyl figures. Best you can do with such old software. Still, it looks very crisp and pleasing to the eye. Music, controls, difficulty ETC are the same as the PSX disc, only with the additions of Steam achievements.\n\nThe downside to applying anti-aliasing to the realtime characters is also what ruins the game IMO: while the characters and battles are crystal clear, the pre-rendered backgrounds suffer HORRIBLY, and wind up even more pixellated than on a 32-bit machine. I had a hard time figuring out what I was looking at for hours until my eyes adjusted to the blocky diarrhea all over the screen. Thank god I remembered where to go and had the arrows to help me along, or Id honestly have gotten stuck a number of times trying to figure out whats an actual path/door/exit and whats just garbled CG background shading, probably wasting that gained load time mashing X all over the place trying to find the way out. I couldnt play the game much larger than 800x600 lest it turn into a blobby mosaic, and after having put hundreds of hours into the original, I couldnt take much more than 6 on this version before I just said "OK, this sucks, maps look like ♥♥♥ and I know how it ends....next game".\n\nIf youve played FF7 before? Stick to your nostalgia and your original discs. If you havent? This is not the version you are looking for, young spiky-haired Padowan.","December 31, 2014","false","7.4"," 45 of 85 people (53%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","53","45","85","12","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronfarley/recommended/39140/","aaronfarley","Alfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronfarley/","468 products in account","Final Fantasy 7.\n\nPossibly the most Iconic Video Game that SquareSoft/Square Enix has ever made. And for good reason.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7, although the graphics compared with today's games are completely rubbish, however back in 1997 these graphics were top of the line. The cutscenes amazed fans and enticed them.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 has a great, gripping storyline, Filled with humor, horror and of course sadness which anyone who knows anything about Final Fantasy surely heard of the tragedy that happened with one of the main characters. Not only does it have a great storyline but it has one of the most iconic and loved antagonists, "Sephiroth", much more then just a "Mummies boy" as many fans and haters stated, he has one of the best battle themes and of course best Limit Break, "SuperNova".\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 has a excellent soundtrack composed mainly by Nobuo Uematsu but the PC Version was given, poor horrible MIDI formats. Luckily Square Enix upgraded them but it isn't the same as the original PSX version.\n\nNot only is the main quest great but it also has a brilliant side quests and entertainment. You can learn the history of the playable characters during Disc 2/Disc 3 and you can spend your hard earned Gill at the Gold Saucer, betting on Chocobo Races, Smashing SOLDIER off bikes or just slide down a snowy slope on a snowboard some idiot kid gave you.\n\nStoryline: 10/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nMusic: 6/10\nSide Quests: 10/10\nAddictivity: 9/10\n\nOverall, great value for money. And is definitely one of or THE best RPG game ever made. No wonder fans all around the world still want a PS3 / PS4 Remake.

If you have never played it or any newer FF, you will love it. Lots to explore, fun side quests, some rather amusing scenarios you'll chuckle at, and a dark story to follow. The battle system is dated but very easy to learn but can be made interesting through 'sneaky' materia(magic) combinations. It is a fantasy world and sometimes things just seem to defy logic, just remember its japanese game things will be strange.\n\nIf you have played this game, then purchasing this version has nothing new for you unless you're N/A region. and even then its 2 optional bosses. everything else is the same. just looks nicer. doesn't play faster isn't harder, and some of the dialog appears changed.","April 10, 2014","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was always one of those games that I wanted to play, but could never find a copy of, so I was ecstatic when I found out that the PC port was available through Steam. One Steam sale and 36 hours later, I now finally understand both the hype and the hatred towards this game. Personally, I really enjoyed it and consider myself a part of the hype category. A colorful cast of characters that are well-designed and well-developed, a combat system intertwined with the Materia spell system for unique encounters and boss battles, and an amazing plot that kept me invested all the way through. Few JRPGs have held me for as long as this one has, rivaled only by the Kingdom Hearts franchise. There may be other entries in the Final Fantasy series that can be argued for over VII, but I can understand and respect why this game is held on such a prestigious pedestal.","December 9, 2013","true","35.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Has a few bugs and some glitches, i cant remember where in the game, but they are easily bypassed.  Other than the few bugs, fantastic port, great game, brings back all the great memories from the original game on ps1.  This game also has a a massive amount of save blocks (unlock final fantasy 4) so you can save your game at all the cool parts in the game.\n\nIf you dont know the game, the story is detailed, the characters are awesome, and the game has tons of extras throughout the game.  The materia and limit break system takes a bit to get used to if you have never played this but its not difficult.  The game also has a feature to turn on max levels if you dont want to grind and work the trenches.  The game is not HD remastered, it is pretty much exactly the same port as the PS1 version, we are still waiting on that from squaresoft.  Considering this was made in 1997, its very impressive.\n\nIt is worth nothing that skill wise many of the characters are the same.  It is not like ff4 with a specific dragoon or ninja, or ff6 with a specific thief, or a specific martial artists.  The characters are differrent in look, have different weapons and limits, but they all have access to the same materia.  It would have been cool to have unique skills for each character to really set them apart not just from the story and visual, but in battle as well.","January 9, 2015","true","104.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But, with cloudsaving that, more often that not, doesn't work, an immensely rocky entry because of an account requirement for a single-player  game that should not have been a concern even months after launch on Steam, and multiple progress stealing crashes, FF7 for PC is not a game I can recommend, even as a diehard fan. It is just too much hassle, both in and out of the game.\n\nUpdate: Not really as upset with the game, but I still don't recommend the game, even to my friends. People who love Final Fantasy will play this regardless, just as I have. I don't encounter nearly as many crashes as I used to because I play it on a stronger computer, but have still encountered some. Cloudsaving is still a consistent problem, however. Though it works more than it doesn't, the times it doesn't are frustrating and can go on for as long as an entire day. The irony in this is that the player requires an account or linking of Facebook info, in part, because of this feature. To force a player to go to such lengths just to play a game that never required this in the first place for a feature that works so infrequently is not a good justification. This is not even mentioning that Steam has these functions covered, should the effort be put in. In text, it seems like a poor port.","December 8, 2013","false","90.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Majority of enemy encounters can be dispatched by holding down the O button.  You can't strategically use your Limit breaks in combat as you're forced to use them whenever they happen to pop up.  And 90% of the time, characters are all functionally identical besides "melee or ranged".\n\nMateria was criminally undercooked, there's not a lot to it. Something as simple as making Cloud levels materia faster, but will cause it to be weaker in the long run, would have helped.  Or some kind of mechanic where like: Tifa adds extra Agility stats to a materia as it levels up, so that can be swapped onto other characters to help out their stats.  Something to make me think about my party, how it's growing, what lineup I'm running, and how often.\n\nIt's not always clear where I'm supposed to go, or what I'm supposed to do.  Seriously, how was I supposed to know I had to be looking for a battery for that lift thing, or that I'm supposed to pick some (seemingly) unrelated text option for that guard to unlock the next zone.  Trial-and-error, or just wondering around talking to everyone hoping they tell you something useful does not make for good game design.  I wont fault the story's execution as it was standard for the time, but the endless text-dumps aren't helping.\n\nI don't hate this game, and I'm not being deliberately provocative.  This game is just not nearly as amazing as people would have you believe, it could have been so much more.  I acknowledge that this game is totally a part of history, and deserves all the recognition for being groundbreaking (it was).  But this is not the greatest game ever made, it's not even the greatest Final Fantasy, not by a longshot.","April 1, 2014","false","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

No other RPG you will ever play compares to this game. It was the first of its kind, when it came to visuals, story, and complexity. The materia and stat systems are created very well, and the game has around 50 hours of gameplay. This may not be a big deal today for an RPG but in 1997, the reaction to that was: Holy ♥♥♥♥.

Has a few bugs and some glitches, i cant remember where in the game, but they are easily bypassed.  Other than the few bugs, fantastic port, great game, brings back all the great memories from the original game on ps1.  This game also has a a massive amount of save blocks (unlock final fantasy 4) so you can save your game at all the cool parts in the game.\n\nIf you dont know the game, the story is detailed, the characters are awesome, and the game has tons of extras throughout the game.  The materia and limit break system takes a bit to get used to if you have never played this but its not difficult.  The game also has a feature to turn on max levels if you dont want to grind and work the trenches.  The game is not HD remastered, it is pretty much exactly the same port as the PS1 version, we are still waiting on that from squaresoft.  Considering this was made in 1997, its very impressive.\n\nIt is worth nothing that skill wise many of the characters are the same.  It is not like ff4 with a specific dragoon or ninja, or ff6 with a specific thief, or a specific martial artists.  The characters are differrent in look, have different weapons and limits, but they all have access to the same materia.  It would have been cool to have unique skills for each character to really set them apart not just from the story and visual, but in battle as well.","January 9, 2015","true","104.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do I have alot to say. First of all, this game has always looked like a fun and expansive RPG with many possibilities. It looked like an enthrawling adventure across a distant and obscure land. And I bet it is! But... Final Fantasy VII's prolougue just rubbed me the wrong way. I mean, first of all, the random encounter rate is atrocious,due to this and the battle system where an enemy can hit you while you choose an attack, I couldn't even beat the prolouge. AND THE FREAKING TIME LIMIT!!!!   I can't even put into words the absolute rage this time limit caused me. First - The Random Encounter Rate is FAR too high and that eats up about 6:00 of your 10:00 minute time period AND the game expects you to go speak to a random non-essential NPC in order to continue, this NPC isn't on the screen when you pass him! You have to remember where he was and just talk to him! LASTY atleast for the PC version, I was still getting my controls down during ths! I was slipping up, hitting buttons extra times and very simply screwing up. My apologies to diehard Final Fantasy fans across the world, but I just can't whole-heartedly recomned this game.

It also had quite a deal of depth in the nature of option side-questing things that would give you good rewards for the effort (even though there were some I had not even tried/found.)\n\nThe musical score definitely had some wonderful pieces in there that definitely set the mood and the feels with the story. Speaking of story this is where I believe it faltered a little. There were some parts that I felt were not needed or were not explained thoroughly for what it was showing. Some parts felt even patched in just to add more to the story and extend the gameplay. If it kept to the main theme of what the game hummed all along the story would have been solid.\n\nIn the end though: I'd still give it a few more playthroughs just to see all the bits that I had missed for a first playthrough and try different team combos.","February 18, 2015","true","149.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This was when I was just a little kid, and was quite excited about the Japanese release of Final Fantasy VII. It took me months to beat this game on first try, and about 8 years ago, I bought myself an English version of it and beat it in 1 week. I still remember myself doing the final battle over and over, as it was very entertaining back then. And now Final Fantasy VII has got some HD treatment (Not sure I can call it a full HD....as it appears only the character models look decent and the background looks quite distorted still as the original. Meh, prob not a HD. Doesn't matter though) and what can I say. This game just never gets old. As I bought the Japanese version of FFVII on day one, I just had to buy this one on day one as well, as a hardcore, long time Final Fantasy fan.\n\nMusic is just outstandingly epic. Even to this very day, I still listen to "You Can Hear the Cry of the Planet"\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBRAkpXTmCs\n\nWhich is possibly one of the most powerful music ever composed by mankind.\n\nGameplay. Well, what can I say. I beat this game twice, in both Japanese and English versions, played the final boss battle for over 50 hours. This game, is almost like a standard of RPG. Am I exaggerating somehow? Not even.\n\nStory. Well? I have never encountered an RPG that has a better story than this game.\n\nIt is purely filled with the best elements that the best games normally possess. The only other thing that I can say about this game is that this is truly the best game ever made.\n\nNo wait, it is actually more than just a "best game". This is, a Mona Lisa of all RPGs.\n\n10 out of 10 = Masterpiece","March 19, 2014","true","233.4"," 73 of 142 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","73","142","0","3"

When I pick those games up again, I usually don't complete them and almost never feel the excitement and joy I felt when I was younger. I usually am bored within a couple hours at most, finding myself looking forward to putting down the controller.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII is different. I don't have the same nostalgia regarding this game that I do for some others, but this is a game I picked up planning to just plow through the story once again to see if it lived up to the great game I used to think it is. Well, I ended up getting sidetracked early on, exploring every little thing I could. I was grinding for limit breaks on characters I never had any intention to use. I still managed to be in awe at some cinematics despite their obvious age.\n\nThis game is about as impressive as games can be. If you're looking for a JRPG and haven't played this, I urge you to grab it and sit down with it.","November 5, 2014","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What the hell else do you need to know? It's still one of the best JRPGs of all time, and the game that would come to define an entire genre for over 10 years. Ignore whatever preconceptions you might have had about this game being overrated, or any kind of bad taste left in your mouth from the mostly-terrible Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. This game really is as good as you've heard, from the tight and expansive battle system, the highly customizable characters, the massive world filled with nooks and crannies to explore, and, of course, a great story. In Final Fantasy VII, you play the role of Cloud, an ex-SOLDIER working with a resistance company called AVALANCHE to take down his former employers, the Shin-Ra corporation. Along the way, you'll encounter giant rideable chickens, swords the size of your house and then some, more existential crises than you can wave a giant unwieldy sword at, and, of course, a whole pile of homoeroticism. The PC port could be better, but it's still pretty decent.

When I first met with the title Final Fantasy, it was on my PSX many years ago. Right now the visuals are outdated. Ofcourse they are, because the game is 16-17 years old (almost an adult). But still one of the best jrpg out there in my opinion. You could ask me, that why is it so good, I will tell it, but remember, these are only MY opinions, not facts. First, i loved the whole story, the flashbacks, backgrounds of the characters. Second, i rly loved almost every music in the game (Imo Cosmo Canyon Theme is the best). And the third, that i like the most and miss in many other games, these are the mini games. For me the most fun was the Chocobo racing and the Chocobo farm. And one more thing, if I'm correct, then FFVII was the Game of the year in 1997. And one little thing, if anyone saw the movie Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, but never tried the game, then I highly recommend atleast 1 playthrough.","January 4, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was released in 1997 for the Sony PlayStation. As with many installments of the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy VII consists primarily of three major areas: an overworld map, field maps, and a battle screen.\n\nThe overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, across which the player travels between the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on chocobos and in an airship or sea vessel.\n\nOn field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments, consisting of 2D pre-rendered backgrounds which represent locations such as towns or forests.\n\nThe battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, such as a building's interior or an open grassland, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies." -  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII\n\nThis is a turn-based RPG, that is when in battle, you take a turn and then the enemy takes a turn. It can be tedious at times as most RPGs can be and is filled with out of the way side quests and mini-games. The game does get more difficult the further you get into the storyline, however you can always go out and over level whichever boss you happen to be stuck on.\n\nThough despite its the repetitiveness and blocky graphics, Final Fantasy VII still has some of the most memorable story lines and characters to date. I would definitely reccomend this game to the younger generation or anyone with a budget looking for something fulfilling and entertaining to play.","August 25, 2014","true","181.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Final Fantasy 7's models can look very gross and undetailed to new-comers, but you get used to it and it becomes not half-bad. Some of Final Fantasy 7's mechanics are a little weak or just weird, (I'm looking at you "All Materia") but it has many strong points as well such as the wonderful story.

This was different to any other game I had played, the story was rich and enthralling, the score and graphics were both bright and vibrant but also moody and atmospheric when the scene dictated it and there was so much FMV that it felt like you were playing an interactive movie. The variation in scenery, the number of side activities, the secrets and the challenges keep this game alive for days longer than the main story (which is fairly large in it's own right as it is).\n\nEvery Final Fantasy fan has their favourite and I'm not going to argue with anyone that doesn't agree; I have played and continue to play every one of the main series titles I can lay my hands on and although each of them has their charms I would still rate VII as my first choice.\n\n","October 18, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/39140/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","Final Fantasy VII has long been one of my all-time favorite games.  The updated Steam version corrects some of the problems that occured on modern Windows systems due to some rushed coding on the original PC version, but more importantly, it makes a formerly rare PC game available once again.\n\nThe plot of FF7 is very rich and detailed, but unfortunately poor translation and the rush to complete the game caused the story to be very confusing.  In many ways, the mystery of the plot adds to the game experience, while it does cause some frustration at the end.  Because of the rich storyline, I found it was worth many playthroughs over the years to look for the additional clues and hidden plot points that explain some of the details and where all the characters fit in.\n\nAnd it's the characters that make the game interesting.  The primary cast of Cloud, Tifa, Barrett, Aeris, and Sephiroth remain some of gaming's most iconic and memorable characters.  And the supporting characters, major and minor, are also fascinating.  The guilt and dual-nature of Vincent Valentine, the relationship between Cid and Shera and his regret, Reeve's internal conflict, the stories of characters like Zack, Ifalna, and Lucrecia who reveal the origins of the crisis, are all interesting to explore and witness, along with the villians such as Rufus, Don Corneo, and of course, the truly despicable Hojo.  This is a story where people aren't always who you think they are, characters are in conflict with each other and themselves, and terrible losses occur on the way.  For gamers of my generation, there is a single scene I won't divulge here, but you'll know it when you see it, that sticks with you long after the game because of how strong the characters are.\n\nAs far as the game mechanics, it's pretty well done.  FF7 introduced the ATB timing system to Final Fantasy games, which combined real-time and turn-based mechanics very well.  Like other FF games, it's about a lot of stats, a lot of random fighting for experience and AP, and I lot of organizing equipment screens, but the systems in FF7 are not so intimidating or confusing as other games in the genre.  Many of the stats don't have a lot of importance in most situations, making fine-tuning the numbers less necessary so long as the characters are leveling enough and have decent gear.\n\nWhat makes FF7 unique, even among FF games, is the materia system.  By arranging gems called materia, a character can gain magic and special abilities and change them as necessary between fights.  Unlike FF8's junction system which discouraged the use of magic, FF7's materia grows in strength when it is used and equipped.  The materia system is something I've always liked about the game.\n\nIn many ways, the game hasn't aged perfectly.  Mainly the graphics, and the wonderful soundtrack was originally presented in a midi format. This version updates the midi to OGG, but still isn't great.  Unfortunately, the excellent work by the Qhimm forums on restoring the PC version of this game to greatness is not compatible with the new release of the game, only the original and Platinum Hits versions.\n\nOverall, this game is legendary, and essential for anyone who calls themselves a gamer.  If you play normally, expect 40 hours of gameplay, if you choose to explore and look at everything while combing for secrets, make that 60-80, and if you rush and use walkthroughs, you can do it in 20.","December 9, 2013","true","94.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But if it's actually held up all these years, that's a little more subjective.\nExpect blocky character models and low resolution (but still quite good looking, IMO) static backgrounds, and all the spelling and grammar errors from the original PC release are still here. However, the music has been replaced, the original MIDI soundtrack is now the same music used in the Playstation release, and the game overall has been optimized to run on new systems. The actual game mechanics and combat system are solid, and the story is also still good.\nIf you've never played the game, don't come in expecting something that can stack up to a game released today in terms of graphical quality. If you can look past its age there's still a great game and plenty of time to be wasted in it, though. If you're looking for a nostalgia kick then it's definitely worth the price as well.\nThe only detractor from what's overall a good game is the extra layer of DRM, requiring a Square Enix account, but considering it can be activated with your Steam account and ignored once you set it up the first time, it's hardly a hassle.","November 28, 2013","true","53.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Doesn't deserve the sheer amount of praise it gets, but it's still a classic / fantastic RPG at the end of the day. Final Fantasy VII practically pioneered the 3D RPG (albeit, very oddly. Look at those polygons!), and paved the path for several other famous 3D RPGs as well. The Materia system makes for a unique, simple game mechanic that's easy to understand and use. Steam's $12 pricetag fits like a glove for this.

The thing with Square Enix games is: that one can decide for one self how to follow the story and complete it. The thing is; even if you complete the side quests along the way; you will always be guided towards the main-story. This makes the player feel they can decide for themselves what they would prefer doing most in the game.\nWith the graphics smoothed and optimized for modern PCs, anyone can take part in what this game has to offer.\nI will strongly recommend this game to be part of your gaming history.","December 30, 2013","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Final Fantasy 7's models can look very gross and undetailed to new-comers, but you get used to it and it becomes not half-bad. Some of Final Fantasy 7's mechanics are a little weak or just weird, (I'm looking at you "All Materia") but it has many strong points as well such as the wonderful story.

That said, it's probably the quintessential posterchild for modern day JRPGs, and one of the games that helped bring them to the mainstream. Final Fantasy 7 is easily one of the better JRPGs ever made, but also one of the most overrated. Also keep in mind, this game requires you to be always online, for DRM purposes, but gives no real benefits to this requirement other than Achievements.

It was the edge that gave Sony dominance in the console market, the hammerblow to Nintendo's pride and the straw that broke Sega's back. It represents the pinnacle of Sqauresoft's history and in the eyes of many, no single player RPG has come close since. It also spawned one of the most recognisable bad guys in gaming history. The heavy anime style gives it a very Japanese feel, Nobuo's music is fantastic, from the energetic guitar based battle themes to the heartwrenchingly sorrowful Aerith's theme. A game that excited a generation, filling our heads with unforgettable memories of an awesome, immersive experience. It's a must play for any hardcore RPG fanatic.","July 21, 2013","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Doesn't deserve the sheer amount of praise it gets, but it's still a classic / fantastic RPG at the end of the day. Final Fantasy VII practically pioneered the 3D RPG (albeit, very oddly. Look at those polygons!), and paved the path for several other famous 3D RPGs as well. The Materia system makes for a unique, simple game mechanic that's easy to understand and use. Steam's $12 pricetag fits like a glove for this. If you're kind of iffy on RPGs but want to try one anyways; this is the game for you.","December 13, 2013","true","54.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was the edge that gave Sony dominance in the console market, the hammerblow to Nintendo's pride and the straw that broke Sega's back. It represents the pinnacle of Sqauresoft's history and in the eyes of many, no single player RPG has come close since. It also spawned one of the most recognisable bad guys in gaming history. The heavy anime style gives it a very Japanese feel, Nobuo's music is fantastic, from the energetic guitar based battle themes to the heartwrenchingly sorrowful Aerith's theme. A game that excited a generation, filling our heads with unforgettable memories of an awesome, immersive experience. It's a must play for any hardcore RPG fanatic.","July 21, 2013","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It has great story, characters, music, and it's fun to make your own decisions to see how everything turns out. Unlike other RPGs this one has pretty fast paced battles, and implements mechanics that other RPGs don't, making this game unique. The default PC controls can be a little difficult to get used to, but are easy to use in most circumstances and you can change them any way you like. One feature I like is the Limit Break feature, because getting the crap beat out of you then taking your revenge with a Braver or Cross Slash Limit Break can be very satisfiying. I can't wait to get farther in the game, and I would personally recommend this game to any fan of RPGs or Final Fantasy.

I thought it wasn't going to be as all the fanboys says it would be. "OH MAH GAWD THIS IS BEST GAME EBER" basically that. So I played alittle and I'm like, it's alright. But let's say a year later, a really good youtube channel (The Completionists') were doing a special on FF7. Since I saw that, I'm like, "Hey! Why not finish this game so I don't get any spoilers from the video!" It jurastically changed from that. I couldn't stop playing. It's like it was sucking me into this game. Although if it weren't for the PS1 music patch for this game, I wouldn't be here and playing this version, because I would be playing on the PS1 (but if I would have, it would take years because I never get on my PS1 on a daily basis). The graphics are a step up, and if you see a side-by-side comparison of the original vs this one, you only see that the character models are more high-def, and the pre-rendered graphics are displayed in a better resolution. Other than that, there is no difference gameplay-wise, except for the SUPER-OP character booster. What it does is that it makes any 3 of your characters in your party right now have 9999 hp and 999 mp (I'm not sure on the gil, it wasn't 99,999 but it was like 60,000 or something like that) other than that, it doesn't give you status buffs, nothing else. Just that (preety weird if you ask me, but you know, Square Enix will make anything worse *Puts on sunglasses*). It will also feel weird the first times using the keyboard, and I have found some mini-games unplayable when using my layout (A is OK, B is CANCEL, D is MENU, Space for START, Shift for SWITCH, Page Up and Down for left and right bumpers 'PS1 controller') and it is real nice that you can use an XBOX 360 controller even though I don't have one, I just use my PS3 controller and have some software to emulate the 360 (I'm not going in-depth about that). You can also use a PS2 controller, but you need an adapter (the best way to play if you ask me, but again, I don't have an adapter). In conclusion, it is the best Final Fantasy I've ever played, but not the best game I ever played.","April 21, 2014","true","76.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was different to any other game I had played, the story was rich and enthralling, the score and graphics were both bright and vibrant but also moody and atmospheric when the scene dictated it and there was so much FMV that it felt like you were playing an interactive movie. The variation in scenery, the number of side activities, the secrets and the challenges keep this game alive for days longer than the main story (which is fairly large in it's own right as it is).\n\nEvery Final Fantasy fan has their favourite and I'm not going to argue with anyone that doesn't agree; I have played and continue to play every one of the main series titles I can lay my hands on and although each of them has their charms I would still rate VII as my first choice.\n\n","October 18, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But still one of the best jrpg out there in my opinion. You could ask me, that why is it so good, I will tell it, but remember, these are only MY opinions, not facts. First, i loved the whole story, the flashbacks, backgrounds of the characters. Second, i rly loved almost every music in the game (Imo Cosmo Canyon Theme is the best). And the third, that i like the most and miss in many other games, these are the mini games. For me the most fun was the Chocobo racing and the Chocobo farm. And one more thing, if I'm correct, then FFVII was the Game of the year in 1997.

First time playing any PC version of it. Fixes in the dialogue were made. I appreciated the bug fix for magic defense added from armor. The better graphic mode was neat, but I preferred the original mode. Don't really know why the bad midi soundtrack was ever a thing on these PC versions. Immediately replaced those files.\n\nThis port is almost completely true to the original PlayStation version. There are some issues that I have begun to identify from these recent playthroughs, but this is still a great game for the same reasons I enjoyed it years ago.\n\nEdit: Had to confirm that you do get the proper music files now. You don't have to worry about downloading and replacing any game files.","December 14, 2013","true","106.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(At least to me in my opinion it's not.) Sure it's personal opinion here but other Final Fantasy games have a much better story and better characters, such as Final Fantasy VI on the SNES and Final Fantasy IX on the Sony Playstation.

After spending some time living as a lady in the slums, he realises he isn't meant for such roots and decides to wage war on the local pimp who ♥♥♥♥♥s out woman as if they were objects.\nTogether, with the help of his female companions, they strike down the slumdog pimp and soon set their sites on bigger motions in works, Why stop the lesser evils when they can overthrow a government who oppress their people in order to gain monopoly for themselves?\nOur hero, Cloud, then sets off, hesitantly, on his way to see change brought to the land and its people. Through trying times, he bonds well with those around him and gains invaluable strength and bravey through out.\nSoon the group learn they are in way over their heads when they come across a talking dog, who's tail is constantly on fire (he doesn't seem to mind, though), and through the actions of said dog, they learn of a great evil at work. Sephiroth.\nSephiroth was once a mentor, an idol and symbol of hope to Cloud, and the world at large. However, after learning of dark secrets kept from him, Sephiroth seeks vegence on those who wronged him - the Goverment known as Shinra. He learns he is nothing more than a lab experiment and that his mother was an alien. Naturally, Sephiroth is all like "hold the damn phone here, guys... The hell is this?" - having never met his mother, his desire to be passionately held becomes unbearable, to the point of dangerous obsession. He even steals her dead head.\nSo, Cloud and his merry crew, who at this point are like "... This guy is mental, he's trying to summon a meteor with magic to kill everyone on the planet because he has mother issues... We should really do something about that", go about in search of an even greater evil. That being Septhiroth.\nAfter some forsakend, unforgiveable, and downright ♥♥♥♥ing twisted, ♥♥♥♥ sucking, lego ♥♥♥♥ing, herpes ridden deaths and Cloud loosing his mind, because, you know... He isn't actually the person he thinks he is, they confront Septhiroth, give him a slap on the rest and tell him "Mummy said you should be a good boy now".\n\nThat's pretty much Final Fantasy VII, oh and there's also naked men bouncing around on beds, girls dressed as beads... I mean BEES, some weird ninja girl obsessed with stealing and a dude with a gun for and arm who suffers with suicidal tendancy. Oh and there is Zack Fair. And snow boarding, there's also a dating simulation thing in there. Did I mention future seeing stuffed animals with cats on their heads who are controlled by some dude in a goverment building?\n\n9/10.","January 16, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The amout of mods available for this game to make it into HD is astonishing, 16GB but astonishing - I have yet to install these mods yet but once i do i shall be uploading videos or some ♥♥♥♥, i'm not entirely sure but enough about me and mods - the game right?\n\nFinal Fantasy has a way of destroying the ♥♥♥♥ out of your time, you play the game at 9AM and you get off at 8AM, its just one of those games that gets you instantly hooked, the storyline and plot is a bit iffy but once you're towards the end it will all make sense, sorta. If you've played any other Final Fantasy Game that isn't Vincents offspring or Crisis Core - You will know, this is a pretty original Final Fantasy.\n\nAlot of people love the movie because of the game even if neither of them are any relevance to eachother besides the characters and summonings + Sephiroth Battle, speaking of Sephiroth battle - Let me make this crystal clear if i can - how can every boss you encounter me so mutated then you meet sephiroth and he's just stupidely mutated then at the very end {SPOILER} You hit a 0 and he dies, sweet, dramatic ending to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fight\n\nBesides all that, alot of people have found exploits and random things about the game in which the average person wouldn't look for, this is always fun to explore on youtube or google. I do recommend this game because I've never personally bought the same game more than twice and usually thats for a friend so for me to have bought this for 4 - 5 in a row now - Pretty astonishing.\n\nBut i know you guys don't know me, this is a review for the game so ♥♥♥♥ you. :D\n<3\n\nUPDATE 17/06/15 - So i herd you like re-males, it would appear that this game is being remade.\non next gen, FF7; this beautiful game is going to make me cry at night now.","January 16, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The more I hear it, the more I realize what an empty, vain and pathetic thing it is to have so little bad to say about something that instead you have to resort to devaluing everyone else's praise for it. Once I really got into it I thought to myself "Damn whoever caled this overrated for the millionth time, who steered me away from this gem with a criticism not even able to really say anything about the games faults, and damn me for being dumb enough to listen to such an empty claim" This game has faults, yes, but none of them make it any less of a great game.\n\nFF7 is one of many masterpieces to be plagued with these claims of being "overrated" I have never played the original, I was never touched by the nostalgia, I do not think it is the best game or even the best RPG game. But hell, it deserves the praise it gets through and through. Like many other entries in the FF series, it has an amazing, unique battle system that is fun to test and level up in, a good story with plenty of shockers, feeling and depth, not to mention the godly soundtrack. I give this game a 9.5/10 easily, and provided the remake isn't chock full of DLC and other money grabs I will be getting that as soon as I can.\n\n\n","March 4","true","44.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Am I ecstatic that they put it on steam??  Do you even have to ask???  For those of you that have never played any Final Fantasy games, I totally recommend that you try this one first.  The graphics are the same as they were on playstation if there are any of you that are like me and remember the game.  Steam also has a guide for all of those hiding potions,GFs, etc... and guides you through.  The only change that I've seen so far of couse are that you use the keyboard keys instead of the playstation controller.  The keyboard keys are not hard at all and pretty well lined up. I would recommend this game to anyone young or old, because   even back in it's newest days it had an awesome story line.  I have yet to see a game come even close to this game's story line.  The story line,and the fact that in many parts of the game you are free to go run around the map and level are  two of the best things about this lovely turn-based rpg.  There are many other good things about it but I'd rather not spoil anything for you.  Happy Gaming!

Chances are if you're buying this you've played it already.  If not, well you'll get to see what all us thirty-somethings are talking about.\n\nThere are options to run at a higher resolution and dither the textures and stuff like that... but there isn't much point.  This game has polygons and fmv's and whatnot - but it's really born from a 16-bit era design philosophy.  Keep that in mind while playing - it's more about the story than the presentation - and that story is a parable for the true struggle of our age, which is why it resonates with so many people.\n\nThe irony here is that Squenix is behaving more and more like the evil corporation in its cautionary tale...\n\nWorth the 40 or so hours, I say.

The more I hear it, the more I realize what an empty, vain and pathetic thing it is to have so little bad to say about something that instead you have to resort to devaluing everyone else's praise for it. Once I really got into it I thought to myself "Damn whoever caled this overrated for the millionth time, who steered me away from this gem with a criticism not even able to really say anything about the games faults, and damn me for being dumb enough to listen to such an empty claim" This game has faults, yes, but none of them make it any less of a great game.\n\nFF7 is one of many masterpieces to be plagued with these claims of being "overrated" I have never played the original, I was never touched by the nostalgia, I do not think it is the best game or even the best RPG game. But hell, it deserves the praise it gets through and through. Like many other entries in the FF series, it has an amazing, unique battle system that is fun to test and level up in, a good story with plenty of shockers, feeling and depth, not to mention the godly soundtrack. I give this game a 9.5/10 easily, and provided the remake isn't chock full of DLC and other money grabs I will be getting that as soon as I can.\n\n\n","March 4","true","44.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well. If your a gamer like me, who plays games by heart and not eyes (heart being story and eyes being blown away from games featuring explosions guns and violence), then this is a game for YOU. Before I go in depth of how amazing this game is, I must tell you how I got into the Final Fantasy franchise.\n\n\nAs a kid I shied away from the series because honestly the roman numerals in the games was just too confusing and at the time I was a strict Nintendo fanboy. Times have changed, I am no longer a strict Nintendo fanboy though I still am but now I accept other games. I gave Final Fantasy 1 a try and quickly got hooked. Then I moved on to 2 and at that point it was clear I am now a Final Fantasy fanboy. I then went to 3, and at the time (all of this happened recently btw), there was a Steam deal going on. The Square Enix publisher discount stuff. Final Fantasy 7 and 8 were in that, and I had some spare change and decided it would be a fantastic idea to purchase two Final Fantasy games with the highest amount of reputation within the franchise. I did not regret that decision, it was clearly worth buying. Now, back to our discussion on why the game is great.\n\n\nThis game, is addictive. No, not addictive in a bad way like Minecraft (You know, playing all day losing your mind). Addictive story-wise. The story in this game is ENGAGING ON SOO MANY LEVELS. IT DOES NOT AT ALL FEEL LIKE I AM PLAYING A GAME ITSELF, BUT WATCHING A MOVIE WITH A DEEP STORY AND AMAZING CUTSCENES AND FLASHBACKS. The gameplay itself is interesting and apealing to me. When I play the game, I don't care for the gameplay, I am anxious to see what happens next in the story. When a game gets you feeling like this, it is clear why Final Fantasy 7 is regarded or arguably one of the greatest games of all time. Its games like this one we just don't see anymore, it really does suck because I myself wish that these games with all these DLC's and micro-transactions would just STOP and use this game as an analogy to what a perfect game should be. This game is a classic, I had no problems with it other than how frustrating it was to get my freakin Square Enix account setup. If you can get past that one problem, you got yourself a perfect beautiful game right here. In conclusion, I say if you are one who enjoys a great story with fun gameplay, then this game is worth your 12 dollars. Or, at the moment if the deal is still going, its half off.","February 7, 2015","true","174.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The least any newcomer to the Final Fantasy franchise can do is to play the original first before any potential shortcomings the remake may have to offer.\n\nFor most the 1997 release was their first Final Fantasy and is therefore special to them. Upon replaying FFVII on Steam I had such an overwealming nostalgia which quite honestly surprised me. I could remember everything so clearly even after almost 20 years since first playing it. Everything was the same as I had imagined it even back then, though I will say that this updated version has a few things which had been changed. Certain dialogue and so on, though I don't think this is such a major issue to many.\n\nThe Materia system is still top notch, though now I am certainly more cautious with what I use instead of throwing everything on a character just because I had it, as I would have done on my first playthrough. Plenty of mini games to keep one entertained when sick of grinding or just want to take a break from the story. The battle system was exciting for its time, especially with the added Limit Breaks which were a huge improvement on VI's Desperation Attacks. which were quite frankly rubbish. The fact you could save the special attack for a better time as well as evolve them into better ones by using them was a reason to try out every character, just to see what they did. With the new release, the old battle system will certainly be dead and buried so we can probably say goodbye to many of the epic moves and abilities we once encountered.\n\nThe soundtrack? 11/10. Nuff said.\n\nIf anything, this is one of my least favourite Final Fantasies in the franchise, though it was my first. Even though I prefer most of the others, this truly is a special game that will not only challenge you, but become a part of you in the process.

I was petrified to see this very odd encounter that was unfolding before my very eyes. Once the payment was complete and of course printing out my confirmation email and carefully writing down my confirmation number for my personal records I quickly installed and attempted to play my newly but oddly obtained copy of Final Fantasy 7!  I checked all the options within the launcher to make sure the upmost  compatibility. I click play and my screen goes black...appears this very ominous logo on my screen "SQUARESOFT". I wait.....I wait some more....I click, I press ESC, my heart begins to race as this mysterious logo just stays on my screen! I rapidly start spamming all the keys on my keyboard! nothing happens! I finally Ctrl+alt+tab and I become blinded by this blueish-green screen with a few options. I choose "Open Task Manager" and a new window appears! I decide to put this horrible experience to an end, I had to make this my seventh and final attempt to live this fantasy.","September 12, 2014","false","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

In my mind, this is the equivalent of if square had come into my childhood home, taken my ps1 memory card, doused it in gasoline and then flipped me the bird as they dropped the match.

Though I still suggest that if you haven't played this game before that you should at least try it. Just because someone on the internet doesn't like it doesn't mean that you should be turned off by this game. If it has such a strong fan-base after all these years, it should                         still be played to at least try to see where everyone is coming from.

The least any newcomer to the Final Fantasy franchise can do is to play the original first before any potential shortcomings the remake may have to offer.\n\nFor most the 1997 release was their first Final Fantasy and is therefore special to them. Upon replaying FFVII on Steam I had such an overwealming nostalgia which quite honestly surprised me. I could remember everything so clearly even after almost 20 years since first playing it. Everything was the same as I had imagined it even back then, though I will say that this updated version has a few things which had been changed. Certain dialogue and so on, though I don't think this is such a major issue to many.\n\nThe Materia system is still top notch, though now I am certainly more cautious with what I use instead of throwing everything on a character just because I had it, as I would have done on my first playthrough. Plenty of mini games to keep one entertained when sick of grinding or just want to take a break from the story. The battle system was exciting for its time, especially with the added Limit Breaks which were a huge improvement on VI's Desperation Attacks. which were quite frankly rubbish. The fact you could save the special attack for a better time as well as evolve them into better ones by using them was a reason to try out every character, just to see what they did. With the new release, the old battle system will certainly be dead and buried so we can probably say goodbye to many of the epic moves and abilities we once encountered.\n\nThe soundtrack? 11/10. Nuff said.\n\nIf anything, this is one of my least favourite Final Fantasies in the franchise, though it was my first. Even though I prefer most of the others, this truly is a special game that will not only challenge you, but become a part of you in the process. It can be a bit of an eyesore to look at in this day and age, but if you love a story rich game then there's nothing really stopping you from buying this game.","January 12","true","64.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are the same as they were on playstation if there are any of you that are like me and remember the game.  Steam also has a guide for all of those hiding potions,GFs, etc... and guides you through.  The only change that I've seen so far of couse are that you use the keyboard keys instead of the playstation controller.  The keyboard keys are not hard at all and pretty well lined up. I would recommend this game to anyone young or old, because   even back in it's newest days it had an awesome story line.  I have yet to see a game come even close to this game's story line.  The story line,and the fact that in many parts of the game you are free to go run around the map and level are  two of the best things about this lovely turn-based rpg.

With Final Fantasy VII's historic release on PlayStation in June of 1997, role-playing games were finally given the respect that they deserved and the RPG genre is now one of the most significant and defining on the system. Following the story of Cloud Strife, gamers were taking on a fantastical journey that encompassed three CDs and over 40 hours worth of gameplay. The game continued the trend of using the series' staple turn-based battle system, complete with melee and elaborate magic attacks.","January 15","true","64.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember putting in 70+ hours into this game when it first arrived to Playstation back in 1997. What I can say is that the PC port, while not the HD remake we always hoped for, provides a little more polish than it's 1997 counterpart and remains a distinct landmark in the Final Fantasy series.\n\nGraphics & Story: For the era it was produced in, FF7 had compelling graphics along with full motion video and a great cast of unique and interesting characters. Famous scenes such as Sephiroth's walk through the flame engulfed Nibelheim or the fateful moment in the Forgotten Capital provide the gamer with the type of immersion that has tried to be replicated through numerous games following FF7's release.\n\nMusic: With Nobuo Uematsu at the helm, there was no doubt that the soundtrack would be any less than great. One-Winged Angel is one of the most memorable compositions in Video Game history and Aerith's theme provided the perfect emotional tone for that pivotal moment in the Forgotten Capital.\n\nAgain not much more I can say but that I can't wait for the HD remake - 10/10\n\nUpdate: Mar 16, 2015\nFinally finished my 100% achievement file. Hoping we hear something regarding a sequel or remake in 2017 on the game's 20th anniversary. Give Final Fantasy VII a try if you've never played it before. This classic is certainly worth the time.\n\nUpdate: June 16, 2015\nWell holy hell....the remake is happening.","February 20, 2015","true","84.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A complex and very intriguing storyline with likeable and relatable characters brings the story to life. You have endless sidequests to do that can take away the edge of grinding. If you are not a fan of grinding for exp and levels, then this game may not be for you. It has great replayability.\n\nIf you like RPGs and do not mind reading vast amounts of dialogue, then I highly reccommend checking this game out!

I saw a game outcast - you know,an epic game for that time... the problem was that outcast needed some additional drivers in order to run and as a kid I did not know nothing about drivers. Because i was just a kid and even though he already bought me outcast, we went back to the store and the salesman told me, that i can exchange a game with another one, so when i looked up, I saw it on a shelf - "Cloud, holding this massive sword (buster sword) behind his back". I've told dad: "Dad, that's the game that i want", he "obeyed" me and we took it home.\n\nCame home, sat down and installed the game - started it and the arrow keys weren't working - as a kid I knew how to use only arrow keys and i didn't even try to bother with other ones, so i tought the game was broken - and god bless my ignorance, i think that a couple of days have passed when i've figured out the controls - numpad.\n\nWhen I've started the game, (since i'm not from America nor Britain) I had poor knowledge of english - I got terrified how many dialogs were popping out and got really depressed when i didn't understand most of the written words -  "That's it, i've decided to delete the game".\n\n2 years have passed, I turned 9, other games and cartoon network were teaching me english at that time, so i've decided to give FFVII another go... and that's when it happened... I couldn't stop playing FFVII for 2 years. I found the story so interesting, even if there were words that i didn't understand, I had a dictionary besides me and the game helped me to learn english (the funny thing was, that i've pronounciated words differently, since i've never heard the words before). My short story and conclusion to this game is, that sometimes you just have to wait for the right time and that you must never give up :)\n\nALSO - my trip down the memory lane:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXUEErlWBgiMQxL0NCP3SvqyqWSHHx6Rr","August 15, 2014","true","45.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MAYBE_WAS_A_BAYBE/recommended/39140/","MAYBE_WAS_A_BAYBE","I love to roleplay 1995","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MAYBE_WAS_A_BAYBE/","301 products in account","Final Fantasy VII is a special game, there basically none like it.Not for its history but there are not as much potential games being made like it, not enough games with its ambition or originality. It transcends all of what is expected and surpasses all basically. This game is not overrated or neutral in my book, in fact it is indeed considered underrated now for me, it’s been a while since people experience it’s raw power but it is still is to this day one of the best games ever made. . Of course the stands of its title as the best game ever made are still pretty known yet dismissed which is very sad because this is an overachiever of an experience ESPECIALLY compared with the rest of its series and many of the genres.  It’s faster than what its series is normally is; its gameplay is simpler and funnier, having personally one of the best mechanics ever, the materia. Especially considering this is one of the best games I’ve played I recommend it to anyone really. It’s just a nice smooth experience even if you aren’t the type to play big games to the end; I really recommend this, even I someone who cannot support this type of length it is still a game that every second manages to show me something cool. It is basically my saving grace on long JRPGs and perhaps video games in general. The gameplay is one of the most mechanically best I’ve seen, simple and straight to the point unlike many other games that take a long time to get to the basic of it, this one gives you it all at full front and doesn’t hesitate to make it entertaining at all times. Magic is simple to use by any character using the materia system which is the best system ever, they’re these little magic pearls that once equipped within your weapon can be used, they can also be combined with slots that are combined slots which you can make combos with such as (A “Cure” materia with an “All” materia makes it possible to use that magic on all). On top of this the materia can be leveled up as you battle to be more efficient by gaining , not only this, all characters within the game are extremely useful even without the power to equip any materia you wish from battle power to healing! Every character has a Limit Break which is when they get hit a couple of times and can’t take it anymore, they will release a power blow that is mostly based on their characteristic, for example Tifa Lockhart will use wrestling moves done by a roulette a system, and Aeris’s first limit will be to give some health to the 3 of your team.\nThe entire game’s backgrounds are made with these amazingly animated CGI pictures that are filled with detail and are always cool to look at, it has beaten any texture or tile pack in its genre of how memorable and incredible it’s visuals are. Not only that but a fair share of interactive cutscenes blending in with the game’s models, an insane amount of in-battle animations with over a thousand enemies with their unique attack patterns and styles and in general lots of effort put into to the limit.\nI used to dislike this game due to my short attention span I grew to notice how much it has to offer especially compared to others of the genre; it has indeed a wider variation of options while remaining simple and straight to the point, from dialog, to character selection, to how many weapons and powers you can acquire, different styles to take on an enemy entirely there are various choices to do on side missions side too and you can collect rare items as you explore a giant world, collect more, experiment with powers, there are multiple statues that are negative and positive, a round of elemental powers given to about anything in the game including actual weapons you receive, accessories that facilitate you by nullifying certain types of times and just a huge number of other statistics that yes while describing seems complex but seems very natural and simple within the game, all this to discover new ways to make gameplay easier and this is all done in a balanced manner quickly.. It’s a bit long to go into detail about each content you can go to but as an example there’s a materia that allows you to turn enemies into items.\nThe plot is amazingly crafted and designed; it is filled with foreshadowing, flashbacks and not an adventure that manages to keep continuing without any breaks and always a bigger goal in front.  Out though yes everything within the game is almost as If a satire of how simple it is, mostly everything is based of clichés and yes it’s mostly comical and never 100% reassured (I mean c,mon by this point you would tell yourself “Oh I guess the magic goop heals all of the plot’s wounds” to be honest or “Must be symbolic” because really It’s a just science fantasy with a more serious turn), but that only comes within the standards of nitpicking, I mean honestly, if you were to go to the single first bone of this game realistically you would think to yourself “Isn’t ecoterrorism flawed?”, but don’t worry they later on in the game kind of regrets what he did to save the planet SO HEY Plot filling exists at a high level in this game, this game can truly sustain itself in terms of plot elements sometimes even if it’s silly so I’ll end it at that considering there’s many other silly major plot concentrations that can be easily taken away in a bad way if you don’t see it from the adventurous perspective or ATLEAST EXPLORE THEM!  What’s there is there, it’s a simple story within a typical cyberpunk sceneario and I’m more than ok with that, other than that the implied adult themes are strong… And the adult themes that are straight up shown are STRONG TOO! This game is still pretty grimdark to this day, it was the first of the series to introduce real issues such as poverty, world pollution, life goals, what death means to a person and how to live with it amongst other deep contents in which the game casually comments on with a quote or 2, perhaps even an entire character built on the topic. Some may complain on how it tries to deep but for me it’s more the merrier, it isn’t the best psychological take on characters but it certainly isn’t the worst, especially compared with what Japanese media takes as “Psychological” it could BE WAY worse.  Either way I appreciate it’s psychological tones it gives the plot way much depth and it doesn’t deliver itself at first glance, anyone against it must REALLY hate people with actual personalities that are basically perfect cardboard main characters, again it’s balanced because the characters themselves are competent, which is needlessly to say the necessary for a character, outside of that you can have your emotional problems as long as you use it to power yourself within your journey, I give this long speech about character development because IT SEEMS This HAS BEEN DONE WRONG MANY TIMES and Final Fantasy VII manages to do it alright. This is THE adventure, the most over achieving product in history, this game manages to hold my attention in all of the aspects it gives, a great and full of effort game that has grown out to be known as the best game ever made numerous times, it comes with a dark well designed plot filled with numerous great characters, it’s silly, humorous  and memorable,  it’s filled to the brim with content which is all amazingly crafted (which honestly is the reason why I fear this review might be TOO basic to cover up the entire game), there are 4 hour long documentaries which document every aspect, nook and cranny from this full of experience game. I mean it doesn’t seem much like it but I’m actually trying to refrain myself from writing more than a book here considering there is so much to comment on! This is my Final Fantasy. Also not full revie","August 24, 2014","true","776.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Game. Is. FANTASTIC!!!. If you ahven't already been pursuaded to buy and own this classic let me be the one to do so. if I have to be the one to do so then you must be living under a BLOODY ROCK! This game is marvelous and quite challenging. Anytime you look up a guide just remember that you couldn't back when this came out. So try and do it yourself before looking something up. Also, If you haven't heard of this game then you're lucky, nothing has been spoiled to you like it has to me, but going through and playing and experiencing it myself I feel emotions for this game. Yeah, it's THAT type of game. I reccomend this to anyone who's heard of this game, or just looking for a fun RPG with great plot. Even if you ahte RPG this game may change that for you. If you're not so sure then wait for a sale to buy it. Despite all that praise though there is one problem. The stupid launcher, you have to sign up for an account with Square Enix website. After that though it's pure, Local saving fun RPG with fabulous plot. Buy it on Steam because you can't really get it anywhere else, and yes, the Keyboard controls are weird, you can change them by In-Game pressing "V" and changing them from there. Otherwise deal with it, because it is weird. I deal with it (othe rthan PgUp and PgDn becaue I have to use Fn to access those buttons.) So, Bottom line, PLAY THIS GAME.","March 29, 2014","true","66.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So what's the deal with this release?\n\nWell it's on PC, Steam, has cloud saving, a booster thing that makes the game easier, and achievements that made me play this game much more than I otherwise would have (I'm crazy, ok?). It also has a piece of DRM that i've heard is a real nuisance for some, but I didn't have too much trouble with it. You have to make an account, but once I linked it with my Steam account I never had to worry about it again. The real problem is the instability of their server, which takes down cloud saves during busy hours (during the sale it did, but not after that was done with). It does save locally though, and it updates your cloud save once that gets going again, so it's not really a big deal. Nevertheless, I felt the need to mention all this.\n\nAside from that, this is FF7 as it was on the PS1 ~15 years ago (I still have a [friend's] copy :o). Everything. The story, gameplay, optional content, and even some glitches (W-Item) carry over to this version.\n\nThat's really all I need to say, I think. Chances are you already know if you like this game or not. And if you never played it... well, you can if you want to. I had a decent time, but people tend to love or hate this game. Less because of what it is and more because of what it did: became a "standard" for JRPG's that has more or less remained the same ever since, for better or worse.\n\nOk, i'll stop now. Buy if it interests you. You get what you expect: an aged PS1 classic that plays competently on the PC and has a few nice little additions.","December 6, 2013","true","73.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The translation and graphics are superior to the PSX version and it's most likely going to be cheaper than actually purchasing a physical copy.\n\nAs for the game itself, the flaws are all still there and have become as glaring as ever with its age. The story still is as nonsensical as ever, the super deformed characters still look ugly, and the materia system actually destroys the traditional RPG formula for balance and makes each character essentially blank canvases outside of their base stats and limit breaks. That can be fun at first glance but it becomes very bland when every character essentially operates the same way and the end game becomes so single-minded. It's also a turn based/random encounter affair so if those kind of games get on your nerves you should avoid this at all costs. Lastly, the characters are your standard JRPG affair (although at the time, these archetypes in video games weren't common in North America) and most don't really evolve past their initial character development, especially outside of the party.\n\nThe good?\n-The materia system is fun, flexible, and broken. I can't say I agree with it on a balancing or variety level but on the surface it's fun and gratifying.\n-The story ends up being paced pretty well throughout the entire journey which doesn't happen very often with JRPGs.\n-Random encounters are paced very well for a JRPG and I didn't find myself ripping my hair out until the final dungeon (two battles every screen with a mastered Enemy Away? Nah).\n-There are many side-quests that feel naturally implemented into the world and I enjoyed most of them aside from Chocobo breeding which was nothing but tedious.\n-The pre-rendered backgrounds are also usually pleasing to the eye (then again, they're a stark contrast to the awful character models that populate them).\n-The music and sound effects are great and overall the presentation has a charm to it that most JRPGs don't.\n\nMy personal outlook on the game may have soured a bit over time but the core of the game holds up fairly well to this day despite some obvious flaws. I rate it overall a very strong 7. A worthwhile experience that I think gamers insterested in the history of the medium should attempt to tackle, especially those who are familiar with Japanese RPGs.","November 30, 2013","true","83.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I played the original, on the PS1, all the way through at least four or five times. FF7 was the only game I liked enough to get me to shell out the extra 20 bucks for the guide, just so I could find and/or beat every little side quest or hidden area. It absorbed many countless hours of my youth.\n\nNot to long ago, I found FF7 on Steam and quickly bought it for second time. Now I never did find my old guide (not that you need it with the internet), but I played Final Fantasy VII once again and loved every minute of it. I was reminded of it’s great story and characters, awesome weapons with unique leveling up, the way powers can be mixed together, and the great interface for both battle and world map. I enjoy that you can spend hours racing giant birds around for an awesome hidden item or fighting through a tough dungeon for a unique weapon. But the game doesn’t make you, very little of the required gameplay is grinding. This game does not require continuous, fast button mashing. So if you like to take frequent, short breaks from the game controller to enhance your video gaming experience, Final Fantasy VII is great for that.\n\nAfter completing this game once again, even though it took a bit longer because of that pesky thing known as a job, I still find it to be my favorite game ever. It has everything that made it great on the PS1, but the PC version is much smoother because of the updated hardware. If are a fan of the original, have played others in the series, or just enjoy RPGs or good games, it will be more than worth it to buy FF7, a great game all around.","July 21, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Use the Windowed mode instead. Also you need to specifically enable the cloud saving feature as it defaults to off, and make sure your controller (if you use one) is compatible with (and is set to the mode for, if a dual mode unit) XINPUT, not DirectInput (although it's an old game and you might expect it to use DirectInput, SE HAS updated it to use the modern Xinput system and DirectInput won't quite work right!).","May 5, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now you've probably heard this before from dozens of people, whether it be your friends, gaming magazines, internet or basically any other form of communication; written or spoken, Final Fantasy 7 is one of the best games of all time, and though now it may seem like an overrated, outdated RPG nearly 17 years later, it deserves the title.\n\nI only beat this game once, and have dived back into it thanks to this updated re-release on Steam. Visually, it's eye-candy to me. Though current-day gamers might turn thier heads, this game looks awesome and if it weren't for the PlayStation's graphical limits, i would say that this is the way the developers originally invisioned the game back in 1997, fluent animations, sharper character models, and just overall better looking port.\n\nThe Story is something else, The story of Final Fantasy 7 is not a forgettable one. You begin as part of an eco-terrorist group who is hell-bent on destroying the world's biggest power company for killing the planet, hours into the game later you find yourself on a mission to save a world that is doomed to complete annihilation at the hands of a super-soldier who is "taking back the planet". (i hate to give away to much spoilers.)\n\nAs for the gameplay it is your typical, run-of-the-mill, turn-based JRPG. for a series who practically invented the genre, this game doesn't stray to far away from it's predecessors in terms of the battle system and means of progression, hell if you're having trouble understanding how to play, there are countless websites dedicated to this game as well as an in-game tutorial, have fun.\n\nIf you are a fan or RPG's, JRPG's, or curious about the genre, PLAY THIS. you are doing yourselfs a huge injustice by reading this and playing some damn Final Fantasy 7, you will not be dissapointed.","December 23, 2014","true","22.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Never played this game and looking to see what it is about...\n\nor\n\nB.) Played it and are looking to see how Steam does it.\n\nIf you're an "A" -- don't worry this game has an amazing story, and in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest RPG's ever made.  Go ahead and spend the MASSIVE $11 (I paid $40 for it retail the day it came out for the good ole PlayStation!)\n\nThe review for you "B" guys is below.\n\nDespite some personal technical difficulties with saves and re-downloading this is for the most part much improved over the original version.  I'm not 100% on this but I feel like the dialogue got cleaned up a lot, it just flows more like native English and less like a half-decent Japanese translation to English.  The only downside to me is that it doesn't seem to use the PS style of controller I wanted to use for playing it -- at least it doesn't let me use it very well.  However, it is perfectly fine for the mouse and keyboard.","January 18, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This Game Can Certainly Be Called One Of The Best Games Of All Time, Being That It Has An Amazing Story, Loveable Characters And A Truely Customizable Way To Play Being That Materia Can Be Used On Any Character And It Can Be Of Any Kind (Ex. Cloud, An Offensive Magic User May Have Some Healing Magic). I Also Love The Way The Cutscenes Work, And How It Has Grapics Similar To The Original PS Version Of The Game. Also Things Like The Side-Bosses Ultima WEAPON, Ruby WEAPON, And Emeral WEAPON Make The Game All The Better Being That It Doesnt Make All The Fights Completely Story Related And That You Can Fight These Side-Bosses At Anytime After Meeting Certain Requirements. I Also Am Very Fond Of The Combat System, Which Is Very Much Like Every Other FF Combat System But It Is Still Amazing And The Feature Of Limit Breaks Blows Other RPG's Out Of The Water! It Also Has A Fairly Decent Amount Of Hours You Have To Put In To Get To Sephiroth's Final Fight. Another Thing I Enjoyed Was Having Some Sidequests To Get Quest Items That Really Help In The End Of The Game, Like Tier 4/Extreme Limit Breaks. It Is Also Very Story Rich Making It Something To Definitly Buy.\n\nMy Overall Rating For This Game Would No Doubt Be A 10/10, Because It Has A Great Story, Nice Combat That All FF Games Have, Some Fun Sidequests, Takes A While To Complete (Took Me About 40-50 Hours+ To Complete), And Has Amazing Characters Who Even Have Their Own Little Backstories","January 29, 2015","true","98.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loserprance/recommended/39140/","loserprance","unnamed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loserprance/","148 products in account","Despite my coming to the party 18 years late, Final Fantasy VII was one of my favourite games I played in 2015. Expecting greatness when I went in, I tried my best not to get immersed in it thinking it was good because of all the universal praise it gets; it didn't take long for me to realize I didn't have to, because I could see it for myself.\n\nBefore I get to the actual meat and potatoes part of this review, looking at the negative reviews, I see a lot of criticism towards Square Enix about having to make a Squenix account in order to play, which is understandable in 2016 with a lot of people being very protective of their information (seeing as some personal information is mandatory to sign up, if I remember correctly). If you're so worried about this, I recommend you read more about it, because if I'm going to be honest, I'm not familiar with what Square Enix can and can't do with what you give them. If you don't want to support Squenix, I don't want to support piracy, but you should put some thought into it.\n\nI'm also going to make it clear that this is the only Final Fantasy game I've ever played; if you've played other games in the series and are looking for a comparison, this guide is likely not for you.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII is thought of universally as one of the best RPGs, or even one of the best video games of all time, and while I'm not sure how much I agree with that, I can definitely stand by the claim that the majority of its praise is well deserved.\n\nThe characters are all memorable, creative and unique, and are personal enough to make you care about what happens to them and the world around them. The dialogue between them is excellent, and portrays a great level of personality and emotion, and creates great relationships such as the passive-aggressive friendship between Cloud and Barret, and how Yuffie is seen as the immature Materia loving ninja girl always looking for a fight.\n\nThe 85-song soundtrack is incredible, with songs that portray emotion and songs that portray anger, or a sense of adventure, or a feeling of despair, anxiousness, being back in your hometown, any song you'd expect in a dramatic RPG, just done better, and made to work on PlayStation 1 hardware, no less (although I don't really know how all that works). And if you enjoy it as much as I do, I recommend you listen to the official Final Fantasy VII - Piano Collections album (Cinco de Chocobo and Tifa's Theme are my favourites).\n\nThe graphics, in all honesty, have NOT aged well; the pixelated battle backgrounds, while revolutionary for their time and still a nice touch today are not amazing visually, but in terms of the blocky and polygonal model appearances and the repetitive shrug, anger and disappointment animations used for nearly every character with a humanoid build, they're charming in a sense, in the same way people look at the 30+ year old Super Mario Bros. Mario sprite. And if the PS1 style graphics bother you that much, there are indeed graphical mods out there (although I couldn't tell you much about them, I've never used any).\n\nDespite being a typical RPG, the gameplay is fresh and exciting, even going into it today. The Materia system, in which you attach magic-based attacks, monster summons, or bonuses like HP Plus or Magic Plus makes the entire magic system more interesting and complex, and the unique 'ATB' battle system allows for real-time RPG combat as opposed to turn-based (although this can be configured in the game's settings; if this is your first Final Fantasy game you might want to read about ATB because it can be confusing at first; I actually jumped into this game expecting turn-based and was surprised when the enemy would attack me in the middle of a menu. If this is not for you, look into the options menu.) Limit breaks keep the battles interesting and can quickly turn the tide of a losing battle, used by filling the Limit Gauge which fills the more damage you take (but make note this is far from a crutch to help a bad player.)\n\nAnd the last thing I'm going to mention, but far from the least important, is the story; while complicated and sometimes unnecessarily complex, the story of Final Fantasy VII is a long roller-coaster of surprise and drama, involving AVALANCHE's quest to stop Shinra Headquarters, Sephiroth's rampage and plot to kill the world, black materia, lifestream, Mako energy, among many other subjects.\n\nBranching storylines include Cloud's conflict with his real self, Barret's disappointment in himself for failing to protect his hometown, and many other unique and dramatic storylines within the game. It's honestly a lot to keep track of and remember, and even harder to write about, but the point I'm making is that the story is never lacking in any places and you never feel as if what you're doing has no important outcome or consequence; I was thoroughly entertained without the game, which I honestly didn't expect; I expected to play it continously every day for maybe an hour, but I would spend days playing in 6-hour periods, which is something I rarely do for any game I enjoy, just to see what would end up happening because of the actions I took in the past.\n\nIn terms of things I wasn't pleased with or I feel could have been done better, I feel like I need to make note that the story is pretty hard to follow at times, and it can be hard to lose track of what you're doing and why you're doing it, but this might just be a personal thing.\n\nOn the topic of cons, this game has a lot of unnecessary minigames, and I mean a LOT of them. What makes this worse is that this port of Final Fantasy VII, while completely functional and complete with Cloud saving (heh), if you're playing on a keyboard, the game is not set to recognize what button you have to what input, so if you're being instructed to press a key, it will say [CANCEL] for example instead of [X]. This goes the same way no matter what kind of controller you're using; a friend of mine played it on a GameCube controller.\n\nBack on the topic of minigames, I'm having Vietnam flashbacks remembering a marching minigame in which you have to press the keys it asks for (which you might not be familiar with because it doesn't tell you which letter on the keyboard), and other similar minigames in this vein. There's an unnecessary amount that honestly could just be changed into a cutscene, such as a slap-fight between Tifa and the female Turk (although this one was actually kinda funny), a squat battle (you heard me), pushing barrels onto Shinra soldiers who are chasing Aeris (or Aerith ♥♥♥♥ you), among others. Some of them are fun for the most part, but generally speaking I feel like they're just wasting my time, but I appreciate the effort to give the user some control.\n\nBut despite the game's problems, I would recommend Final Fantasy VII to anybody in a heartbeat. TL;DR, the characters are unique and personal, the music sounds spectaular and works great with the game, the story makes you care and keeps you involved, and the gameplay is nothing you've seen before. I would recommend this for full price.\n\n[this is the part where i don't know how to close a review]","February 7","true","59.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

How do you review a game with so much hype and pomp and fanatical emotion? It's easier than I thought it would be, given that I can play it again. It's just like I remember. FF7 is like putting on a warm sweater and drinking hot cider. It's a comfort-game. Let me explain.\n\n\nFF7 came out when I was 11. I did not get to play it until I was 12. Everyone told me how great it was--and how it was introducing western audiences to the Japanese RPG world by storm. So when I got a used Playstation, I got the game.\n\nI did not know it at the time, but this FF game was unlike the six that preceeded it in terms of setting and magic system. So I had no bias to base my analysis off of. All I knew was that the Materia system was great. It was easy to use and learn--and as I got better at the game, I began to think up more complex combinations of Materia and equipment. (Woo, Curse Ring and then Added Effect/Destruct in linked Armor slots) There were literally, thousands of combinations. And that's not even touching Enemy-Skill, Morph and Manipulate.\n\nThe Materia system was rock solid. You could completely customize what characters you felt would be best for certain combinations. You weren't constrained by this idea of a Character Class--at least in regards to magic. In terms of weapons, yes, perhaps that was more restricted--but I loved it. Everyone was different--it was perfect. You could create an awesome balance between tanks like Barret and speedsters like Tifa---with characters like Nanaki, Vincent and Yuffie--who were skilled physically and magically.\n\nAnd of course, you can't have a game without good characters. Despite the foamy mustache that Square has gotten from milking FF7 for everything its got--don't believe what they've done to Cloud. In FF7, he was not the whiny little angst-machine that Square has turned him into. He went through big things in FF7 and he got low--but he came back. He got back up, dusted himself off and kept going. That was the entire point. But Square would have you thinking he spends all his time whining and moping around. Not true. When Advent Children came out, I was quite confused because their Cloud wasn't acting like...well, Cloud.\n\n\nAeris is your Mary Sue Last of her Race, Magic MacGuffin Carrier Female White Mage thing. I make a point to get her out of my party ASAP. This is only because I personally don't like her. I hate her snippy attitude, her selfishness and her blatant disregard of everyone around her--except for Cloud. She is the most irritating character. However---that is just my personal opinion (besides, the game did me a solid and I forgave them at, you know, That Part). As a character--Aeris moves the plot along and she IS a helluva powerful White Mage/Magic User. When I have to have her with me, I always put Cover on her and Fury---so whenever she takes a hit for someone, it ramps up her Limit Break bar and then she busts out the Holy magic.\n\n\nTifa kind of lists back and forth between annoying and cool. She's the fistfighter/monk character and between her and Aeris, I'll take Tifa. She can deal some real damage (Powersoul + Curse Ring = Constant 4x damage infliction) and she has a real connection with Cloud. Whereas with Aeris--her thing with Cloud feels very shallow---Tifa actually feels very natural with Cloud. She cares about him, deeply. And when you learn about him--he cares about her.\n\nBarret is your angry tank/heavy gunner. I would say he's probably the least characterized (except for Cait Sith) but he's a good long range strong arm.\n\nNanaki, I really like too---he's very calm, collected and thoughtful. He's very reasonable, not one o pin blame like Barrett does sometimes.\n\nCid Highwind is my favorite--tough-talking roughneck chainsmoking pilot. He gets jipped a lot for some reason. But he's the Reluctant Leader. He can lead, he's fine with leading---but he can also follow. He's not insecure like Barrett and if he needs to step up, he does. And his crew respects him for it. He's got balls--but he's not a jerk. Cid curses and is kind of rough and tumble---but when he makes that one short speech about how their planet is wandering small and lonely in the universe, it shows a little more in there.\n\nYuffie is my favorite of the ladies. Okay, yes, she'll steal your stuff---but she has so much personality (and she doesn't fawn over Cloud). She's straight-forward, to the point, hilariously awful sometimes. And once you get her leveled up--she is a straight up badass. One of my favorite things to do when Cid is the leader---is put her, Vincent and Cid together to go on the Train Mission. OMG, funny. She is so hilarious. She's like a Chaotic Neutral---might save your life, might steal your car. And I love that about her. They seem to have gotten away from her character type later--which I think is a real shame. (Also, I ship Yuffie and Reno forever.)\n\n\nAnd then, of course, the Big Bad. THE Big Bad. Sephiroth. A psychotic momma's boy, who will kil you, your dog, your dog's puppies, your kitchen table and then burn your house down. He literally does not give a crap about anyone or anything--but gaining power and reclaiming Gaia for Jenova. His brutality is brought home--and made personal. Cloud's backstory with Tifa in Nibelheim, Zack and then finally culminating with Aeris in the Forgotten City. His menace, his power--its legendary. You hear about Sephiroth at the very beginning of the game. You don't even see him until several hours later into gameplay. And even then--its in Cloud's flashback. The way Sephiroth is presented is masterful. They talked it up, told you how strong and crazy-evil he was, built and built and built on it--until you finally get to see him for yourself and for once, he's everything that you've heard.\n\n\nThis was what made it for me. Excellent pacing, a good blend of character types so that you can customize your party how you wanted (I'd rather not like a character, than be indifferent to the characters; FF8's characters were so bland--I hated it), an intuitive and creative magic and battle system, tons of sidequests, hours and hours of things to do. To just explore the World Map.\n\nI feel like this was Square at its very best. When they wrote a complex but compelling story, a game where--each time I play, I find something I didn't know was there. I only recently discovered the Curse Ring in Mideel--or if you visit Johnny's parents in Sector 7 before its destroyed, his father talks about Nibelheim (I was like: WHOA!) and countless other small details that enrich the gameplay. Its what keeps me coming back over and over again. I've played this game countless times--and each time, I enjoy it.\n\nYeah, the graphics are old. It doesn't matter--its the story, the mechanics, the characters. Advent Children had beautiful graphics, beautiful. But its story was completely lame, the plot was ridiculously stupid--it was all just fanservice. So I dont even bother with all the other stuff that Square came out with to milk the FF7 cow.\n\nI'd say they should just remake FF7---but I'm afraid they'd start messing around and changing things. Don't trust 'em. Haha.\n\n\nThis is one game--where it lived up to its hype. It exceeded my expectations. I saw FF7 when it came out on EA's website and I about had a heart attack. I bought instantly, that very night, that minute. And then about a week later, it came out on Steam. And I got another copy on Steam--just so that I'd always have it. Look passed the graphics, immerse yourself in the story and the dynamic characters. It's worth it. I would have paid $30 for a copy of this game--and they're selling it for $12. Worth every penny.","December 27, 2013","true","81.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/39140/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nFinal Fantasy VII (FF7) is a turn-based RPG that was released in 1997 on the Play Station Console by Square Co., Ltd (in 2003 they merged with Enix, creating "Square Enix"). Final Fantasy VII (FFV) is one of the most popular games in the series.\n\n-please note before purchase-\nI need to add a comment that, I tend to review the game alone, however for Final Fantasy VII you are required to creature (or use an existing) Square Enix account. Achievements/Steam-Achievements, and other features are accessible through that account... I don't really know many of the perks because I just jumped through the hoops to play the game. But to some people, that's a deal breaker.\nI just wanted to give people a heads up. Thank you for reading the rest of the review.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You play the game as the main protagonist "Cloud", whom is probably tied for being the most iconic figure in the series with the antagonist "Sephiroth". You start the game as a member of the terrorist group AVALANCHE, Cloud has just been hired and is providing combat assistance to the group... Good thing too, the raid doesn't go nearly as planned.\nAs the story progresses you're limited to only to the city of "Midgar", after hitting the pinnacle of the story within Midgar (oh, you'll know what I'm talking about, if you make it that far. I was praying for a save point, I wanted to go to bed). You'll suddenly discover the world is a much larger place then you ever thought.\nTo people who are new to the series, it's easy to brush it off as "oh, that's nice, a large world map *yawn*." Try to imagine seeing it as a little kid playing the PlayStation? To many of my friends this was the first game in the genre they had played, so naturally it's actually a very memorable experience. After this excellent transition, you realize "wow, this game is going to be a big long one" and it is, it came in 3 disk set.\n\nGame Play: I needed to do some research to refresh some of the terms used to describe the Final Fantasy VII combat system. I have played several Turn-based RPG's, however FF7 utilizes "Active Time Battle". The main difference is that there's a visible timer that counts down before you can make your next move.\nI had no idea that's how the game worked, so when I first played and my enemy had hit me three times while I was trying to learn the menu... well... needless to say I was more than a little surprised. "WHAT! You cheaters! I don't know what any of these moves do!" I have no shame in admitting I almost lost my first battle, and I lost my first boss battle in the first 20 minutes of the game. Yeah, go ahead and laugh at me; but this was my first time encountering that mechanic.\nOutside of the combat, there are many in-game events that you do throughout FF7, sometimes it's pressing key sequences to ride a snowboard, or chocobo, or arm wrestle. While very fun with a controller and on the original game console... with a keyboard and mouse the controls and tutorial still use the old button names. So there's extra difficulty trying to accomplish those. I end up failing MOST mini events because I don't know which button I'm pressing.\n"Press select" mmmmk, letssseee... which one is select... *presses X* *Cloud face plants*. Well that was fun, let's try that again...\n\nAchievements: There are 36 Achievements for Final Fantasy VII, and four categories; 1) Person joins your party, 2) you do your first breaker limit with that character, 3) you do your last breaker limit with that character, 4) Some ridicules long end game achievement.\nI've played 26 hours so far (05/14/15) and only have 10/36 achievements, so naturally getting all the steam achievements will be quite an accomplishment in this game.\n\nPrice: Final Fantasy VII is priced at $11.99, considering the amount of time you'll spend playing FF7 to get through the whole story alone, that's a very fair price. However, if you're just collecting games to your "maybe I'll play it someday" list, you should probably wait for a steam sale.\n\nConclusion: The only real negative things I have to say about the game is that I don't like making accounts to log into an offline-game (but that's just the way it is), and using a keyboard isn't nearly as streamlined and seamless as using a controller.\nI personally love the story, the characters, and will be spending more time playing the game, I suspect I've just moved on to disk 2, So I've still got a lot farther to go before I beat the game... Then there's the whole thing about figuring out the achievements.\nI recommend this game to anyone who played the original game and wishes for some nostalgia, people who want to experience "Active Time Battle" game play in an RPG, or anyone casually interested in the story behind any of the characters in the FF7 world.","May 14, 2015","true","26.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am going to give an opinion of the game but I wont go into depth becuase I am sure I would end up leaving something out even if I sat here for 7 hours trying to write the review, so here it is:\n\nThis game is one of the best games I have ever played, if not the absolute best. Nostalgia is not a factor here what so ever as I first played this game last year after buying it during the holiday sale. This game is NOT overhyped by any means, don't let someone's opinion of that prevent you from playing this game. It was amazing when it first released and it is amazing now.\n\nThe music is perfect and fits every situation in the game while sounding great.\n\nThe story is better than almost any I have ever experienced in a work of fiction, including novels and movies.\n\nThe graphics are simple, but because they are stylized I like the way the game looks anyway, simple does not always equal bad.\n\nIf you love turn-based gameplay, the you will love this game. If you don't like turn-based gameplay, you might warm up to it after this game. Having three chracters with an "Active Time" system makes the battles fast paced and forces you to think quickly.\n\nThe materia system will you an extreme amount of freedom when playing, allowing you to have characters act similarly to any Final Fantasy class type. Or you could just make them unique, they don't have to mirror any class if you want them too. Combos of many different types are possible with the materia system as well.\n\nThe characters in this game are some of the most well done, multi-dimetional characters I have ever seen in a work of fiction. Both the chracters and story end up being so complex (without being messy) that to this day people still have heated debates on them. This game also has a habit of making unforgettable moments for the player, but for obvious reason I wont state examples.\n\nThere is so much more to this game, but as I said before, I am not going to make this a long review.\nThis game is a perfect 10 out of 10, you really should play it.\n\nAlso Cloud Strife, the main character of this game, is now going to be in Super Smash Brothers 4.

Check\n\nOpen world RPG? Yes my dear, check.\n\nGood battle system? Oh yes, check.\n\nWhat negative points does this game has? Honestly, i think none, its easily one of the best games of all time.\n\nIf you love 90's pre-rendered cut-scenes, then you're also gonna love this game.\n\nIt has absolutely everything you need in an RPG, the materia system itself is one of the best skill systems of all time.\n\nNow, the pc port.. Is it any good? Yes it is, it runs flawlessly, it has a good setup, it allows the old graphics system (used in the ps1) and a more "fresh" one, with some filters etc which is nice and i'd recommend using that one.\nIt also has controller support, that works quite well, 0 issues when it comes to setting up the controller and using it in game. (apart from the "press switch" scenes etc, which are rare and non gamebreaking, they are completely fine).\n\nIt has full support for recent hardware, it will run in every pc, yes, every pc, anything can run this game, it has full suport for 1080p too.\n\nSo, if you're looking for an excuse to buy this game.. Well, its incredibly cheap on the steam sales, and i can assure you, you'll have your money worth it and not only that.. But the game itself is amazing.\n\nEasily one of the best games of all time, for me the game of the 90's, for some the best game of all time, for others a piece of history in gaming,","November 12, 2014","true","47.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

That said, I feel I've gained enough of a feel for the game to write a useful review.  I'll update this once I'm done...\n\nQuick Review:\nDated, yet lovable graphics.  Good MIDI soundtrack.  Enchanting story with winsome characters.  Fun battles with varied opponents.  Customizable fighting style to fit many approaches...\nA little slow paced for the impatient people, but decidedly worth the time...\nI recommend.\n\nGraphics:\nNot very impressive for the times.  I personally have some knowledge of how games are made, so I can at least partly appreciate how fantastic this must've looked on release.  It was one of the pioneer games that showed the incredible potential of what games could be.  That potential (graphically) is being realized today, so hats off to Square Enix for boldly helping kick things off for us...\nHowever, it's not really all that great by today's standards.  The character models are so low-poly, it's near laughable.  The backgrounds are very nice compositions, but so heavily pixellated that it's sometimes difficult to see what's what.\nThe camera angles are creative and dramatic, and the special effects are varied and entertaining, but again, not even close to the same level as today's games.\nOverall, it was hard for me to get past the graphics at first.  But as the game progressed, they were varied enough and creative enough to satisfy my experience.  Anyway, they get overshadowed by the rest of the game's magnificence...\n\nStory:\nAbsolutely beautiful.  I haven't even gotten halfway through this game, and i'm already so invested with the story that I'm analyzing it and pondering it during the times I'm not playing.  Sure, there's a smidgen of predictability to it.  Sure, there's times where the "cheezy" is so intense you can taste it.  But the dialog is so brilliantly written, the flashbacks so creatively executed, the story so perfectly told, that it resonates with the player and draws them in.  You are fed a steady diet of backstory, side-details, and glimpses of the future the whole time.  Nothing is crystal clear to you, leaving you wondering over the mysteries all around you.  The characters are fleshed out until you feel you know them and feel a connection to them.  I felt my protective instincts awaken every time the hero's friends are put in danger.\nNOTE:  No voice actors, the dialog is in text form.  It may sound bad in theory, but honestly the emotions are carried across just as well or better than voice actors could do.\nLight-hearted, heartbreaking, infuriating, thrilling, etc.  The emotions are a roller coaster.  I've enjoyed the ride so far...\n\nGameplay:\nThe pacing of this game is a bit iffy.  So far, I would say that is the biggest obstacle to any player's enjoyment of this game.  IF YOU ARE A NATURALLY IMPATIENT PERSON, THIS MAY NOT BE THE GAME FOR YOU!  If you have any patience at all, it's worth pushing through the slower moments of the game.  The game doesn't hold your hand at all, so if you can't figure out what to do next, it can be frustrating.  I find it all the more rewarding and believable, myself.  It feels like your on an adventure where you don't know what's around the bend.  It could be just another monster, a friendly town, or you could be thrown into the middle of an enemy's fortress, or sent undercover in the bad guy's army.  You could find a potion lying around, or stumble across a weapon that packs some serious punch.  The feeling that anything can happen really allows me to enjoy every moment, even when I'm stuck on what to do next.\nThe battle system is intruiging.  It's turn based, so the strategy is in knowing your enemies' strengths and weaknesses, as well as your own.  The variety of enemies is great and keeps the battles fresh.  There isn't a book (in game, anyway) that you can consult to prepare for battles.  You can analyze your enemy only the first time you encounter them, and this contributes to the "anything can happen" aspect of the game.\nThe Materia system allows the player to heavily customize their party.  You can adapt them to your own playstyle.  Experimentation is necessary and encouraged.  Almost the only way you can learn new concepts is to try them out.  If you aren't the type of person that enjoys that aspect of gaming, there are tons of guides you could use to cheat with.  Us adventurous sort enjoy the thrill of the unknown, though.  And this game has plenty of unknowns.  There's a smattering of small, unimportant characters that you have to make decisions with.  Sometimes, the decisions mean nothing.  Other times, they can be rewarding beyond what you were expecting.\nThe world map is fine, but perhaps a bit slow to traverse with so many random battles popping up.  It can get annoying, but it's not a dealbreaker at all.\n\nMusic:\nGood tunes.  A lot of folks seem really enamored by the soundtrack.  I like it a lot, but it's not the best part of the game for me.  It is well-crafted and enjoyable, though.  Not to be overlooked...\n\nPlayability:\nSUPER IMPORTANT!!!!!  THIS GAME REQUIRES AN INTERNET CONNECTION AND MAKES YOU GET A SQUARE ENIX ACCOUNT!  Was very annoying to discover, but hasn't affected my gameplay yet.  I'm totally okay with it, but some folks have been surprised by this and it really threw them for a loop.  SO BE WARNED.\n\nOverall:\nThis game is a story, one that you can influence.  It has a linear structure to be sure, but it's told in a way that makes you feel like it's all unscripted and untamed.  The characters will win your heart, and the battles will win your mind.  And the villain is epic.  So epic.  Sephiroth is a beast.  I am a Kingdom Hearts fan and that's the main reason I dove into this franchise.  No regrets...\nBuy it, fools.\n\nEDIT:  Finished the game!  It kept it's epic feel all the way to the end.  There were a couple times when it was difficult to discover where to go next, but it just took a bit of time and exploring.  The end game became so much more difficult than the rest of the game, that I actually had to consult a guide to combat Master Tonberry (who isn't even a boss).  But though I thought it was disproportionately difficult towards the end, it wasn't at all impossible.  The only gripe I had about the ending was the lack of save points (spots in the game where saving progress is allowed).  The last hour and a half of the game I played without a chance to save.  It probably doesn't sound like a big deal to some, but it annoyed me a good bit.\nGood conclusion to the story, though.  Plus a fun batch of cutscenes to finish with.  Still two thumbs up to this fantastic game!","March 2, 2015","true","50.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Or at least, this version used to. The good news is Squenix has patched the game to have the original Playstation version's music meaning better quality instruments and One Winged Angel with actual lyrics now, so that's one flaw scratched off the list and no more need for music mods unless you want 2014 Triple A level orchestra guff. I haven't run into any serious bugs either.\n\nThe big draw of this version is cloud saving (I get the joke, thanks Square) which only works some of the time, and a Booster system that gives you more Gil and buffs your stats so you can just enjoy the story. For casual fans wanting in on FF7's story its pretty neat. For vets like me, eh, its there, its optional, its not hurting anyone, we can play it the real man's way if we like.\n\nOtherwise the game is unchanged from 1998, same gameplay, same story. Unfortunately since this is the later PC port of the game it uses the updated translation in its script, so no more Aeris declaring that "This guy are sick" anymore, some of the swearing is Q*Berted and various other bits. Yet Cloud still tells you to attack the first boss when its tail is up. Git.\n\nI'd still definitely get this game, especially for the base price of £9.99, if you wanna check out some quality olden day RPG before all the Triple A cinematics, borderline quick time events, social gameplay and gratuitous shots of Lightning's breasts amongst others (I mean we got Tifa for that but SSSSH)\n\nalso Aeris dies at the end of Disc/Act 1.

That said, I feel I've gained enough of a feel for the game to write a useful review.  I'll update this once I'm done...\n\nQuick Review:\nDated, yet lovable graphics.  Good MIDI soundtrack.  Enchanting story with winsome characters.  Fun battles with varied opponents.  Customizable fighting style to fit many approaches...\nA little slow paced for the impatient people, but decidedly worth the time...\nI recommend.\n\nGraphics:\nNot very impressive for the times.  I personally have some knowledge of how games are made, so I can at least partly appreciate how fantastic this must've looked on release.  It was one of the pioneer games that showed the incredible potential of what games could be.  That potential (graphically) is being realized today, so hats off to Square Enix for boldly helping kick things off for us...\nHowever, it's not really all that great by today's standards.  The character models are so low-poly, it's near laughable.  The backgrounds are very nice compositions, but so heavily pixellated that it's sometimes difficult to see what's what.\nThe camera angles are creative and dramatic, and the special effects are varied and entertaining, but again, not even close to the same level as today's games.\nOverall, it was hard for me to get past the graphics at first.  But as the game progressed, they were varied enough and creative enough to satisfy my experience.  Anyway, they get overshadowed by the rest of the game's magnificence...\n\nStory:\nAbsolutely beautiful.  I haven't even gotten halfway through this game, and i'm already so invested with the story that I'm analyzing it and pondering it during the times I'm not playing.  Sure, there's a smidgen of predictability to it.  Sure, there's times where the "cheezy" is so intense you can taste it.  But the dialog is so brilliantly written, the flashbacks so creatively executed, the story so perfectly told, that it resonates with the player and draws them in.  You are fed a steady diet of backstory, side-details, and glimpses of the future the whole time.  Nothing is crystal clear to you, leaving you wondering over the mysteries all around you.  The characters are fleshed out until you feel you know them and feel a connection to them.  I felt my protective instincts awaken every time the hero's friends are put in danger.\nNOTE:  No voice actors, the dialog is in text form.  It may sound bad in theory, but honestly the emotions are carried across just as well or better than voice actors could do.\nLight-hearted, heartbreaking, infuriating, thrilling, etc.  The emotions are a roller coaster.  I've enjoyed the ride so far...\n\nGameplay:\nThe pacing of this game is a bit iffy.  So far, I would say that is the biggest obstacle to any player's enjoyment of this game.  IF YOU ARE A NATURALLY IMPATIENT PERSON, THIS MAY NOT BE THE GAME FOR YOU!  If you have any patience at all, it's worth pushing through the slower moments of the game.  The game doesn't hold your hand at all, so if you can't figure out what to do next, it can be frustrating.  I find it all the more rewarding and believable, myself.  It feels like your on an adventure where you don't know what's around the bend.  It could be just another monster, a friendly town, or you could be thrown into the middle of an enemy's fortress, or sent undercover in the bad guy's army.  You could find a potion lying around, or stumble across a weapon that packs some serious punch.  The feeling that anything can happen really allows me to enjoy every moment, even when I'm stuck on what to do next.\nThe battle system is intruiging.  It's turn based, so the strategy is in knowing your enemies' strengths and weaknesses, as well as your own.  The variety of enemies is great and keeps the battles fresh.  There isn't a book (in game, anyway) that you can consult to prepare for battles.  You can analyze your enemy only the first time you encounter them, and this contributes to the "anything can happen" aspect of the game.\nThe Materia system allows the player to heavily customize their party.  You can adapt them to your own playstyle.  Experimentation is necessary and encouraged.  Almost the only way you can learn new concepts is to try them out.  If you aren't the type of person that enjoys that aspect of gaming, there are tons of guides you could use to cheat with.  Us adventurous sort enjoy the thrill of the unknown, though.  And this game has plenty of unknowns.  There's a smattering of small, unimportant characters that you have to make decisions with.  Sometimes, the decisions mean nothing.  Other times, they can be rewarding beyond what you were expecting.\nThe world map is fine, but perhaps a bit slow to traverse with so many random battles popping up.  It can get annoying, but it's not a dealbreaker at all.\n\nMusic:\nGood tunes.  A lot of folks seem really enamored by the soundtrack.  I like it a lot, but it's not the best part of the game for me.  It is well-crafted and enjoyable, though.  Not to be overlooked...\n\nPlayability:\nSUPER IMPORTANT!!!!!  THIS GAME REQUIRES AN INTERNET CONNECTION AND MAKES YOU GET A SQUARE ENIX ACCOUNT!  Was very annoying to discover, but hasn't affected my gameplay yet.  I'm totally okay with it, but some folks have been surprised by this and it really threw them for a loop.  SO BE WARNED.\n\nOverall:\nThis game is a story, one that you can influence.  It has a linear structure to be sure, but it's told in a way that makes you feel like it's all unscripted and untamed.  The characters will win your heart, and the battles will win your mind.  And the villain is epic.  So epic.  Sephiroth is a beast.  I am a Kingdom Hearts fan and that's the main reason I dove into this franchise.  No regrets...\nBuy it, fools.\n\nEDIT:  Finished the game!  It kept it's epic feel all the way to the end.  There were a couple times when it was difficult to discover where to go next, but it just took a bit of time and exploring.  The end game became so much more difficult than the rest of the game, that I actually had to consult a guide to combat Master Tonberry (who isn't even a boss).  But though I thought it was disproportionately difficult towards the end, it wasn't at all impossible.  The only gripe I had about the ending was the lack of save points (spots in the game where saving progress is allowed).  The last hour and a half of the game I played without a chance to save.  It probably doesn't sound like a big deal to some, but it annoyed me a good bit.\nGood conclusion to the story, though.  Plus a fun batch of cutscenes to finish with.  Still two thumbs up to this fantastic game!","March 2, 2015","true","50.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So,these other characters that join your main character are interesting,fascinating and unique.Having their own rich personality as well and their own stories.PLUS POINTS.\n\nNow for the negative part..\n\nFor some reason,I feel that the amount of damage you can deal is pretty "suckish" even if you level up pretty high.Either that or the enemies are superbly strong.Or it could be both.I say that because from my experience from another Final Fantasy game,FFX to be exact,I levelled up my characters to a pretty decent level(not all the way to 99) and I could still win and complete the game)Some enemies can just easily land you one-hit kills.ONE-HIT and you're dead.This pretty much means that it's kinda tricky to take down enemies.It can be really frustrating sometimes.I remember when I was stuck near the final stages of the game where I had to beat the enemy boss.He was so difficult to take down even after 30 mins.I've seen several people on youtube who posts videos of their ff7 gameplays on beating this boss and they successfully did it but I realised something.I've seen people who levelled up their characters all the way to lvl 99,acquired special items from side quests,special moves etc(basially it's like they've gone through almost everthing in the game) and yet,it still takes some time to beat the boss.So it's still a little bit tricky but it's possible.And to get to lvl 99 and acquire all those special items and moves is a whole different story.You will need A LOT OF PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE with this game.That is like the key to this game.If you have that,then this negative part of the review should not be a problem for you~\n\np.s This review is a personal view and opinion.I understand that not everyone will agree with me as they have their opinions as well.I can respect that.Also,everyone's gonna have their own different and unique experiences from the game.Oh and one more thing I need to admit.Remember I said you need a lot of patience with this game?Yeah...I don't have that.So I'm actually stuck at the final boss.Yup.I do NOT have the time and patience to do all the side missions and battle for hours and hours just to get to lvl 99 all just to beat that one freaking ♥♥♥ boss.I find that it's not worth my time.But if you feel otherwise,by all means go ahead~ There's an amazing cutscene after that and well,not forgetting the sense of satisfaction and achievement it bringsTvT\n\nAll in all,it's best to have your own experience of the game:)\n","April 1, 2014","true","26.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's engaging, it's fun, and the world is so huge, with so much to explore. There's a great variety of enemies, as well as different activites, including many fun minigames. The story is amazing, there's so much going on, yet it all fits very well. And the soundtrack, superb.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, I really liked the "turn-based but with some real time thrown in it as well" approach this game has. It makes the battles feel more dynamic as well as strategic. The Materia system is really cool as well, and, in fact, I might prefer it more than the old "your character gets to learn these specific spells"; in this game, you can equip your characters with whatever magic/summon/command you like, not to mention that the Materia that doesn't fall in those categories can provide different bonuses to your character.\n\nI think this review could go on and on for pages, but even then I don't think I'd ever do justice to this game with my words. All I can say is, I enjoyed it greatly, and, if you're a fan of RPGs, I think you will too.","April 7, 2014","true","110.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game itself, FF7, is actually a great game.  The port for steam is ♥♥♥♥ing god awful.  It hardly ever works and does crashes.  If it works well for you, then enjoy it and you're lucky.  I have logged several hundred hours on PS1.  If it doesn't work and you want to really play this, get a PS1/PS2, hell, even buy from PSN and the original or a really good emulator.  I have been playing games for about 20 years +.  Overall the Final Fantasy series is a top 5 for me.  8/10 (no game is perfect).","December 7, 2013","false","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

This is the most nostalgic game of my childhood and I've beat it about 10 times. Its easily one of the most influential games of all time. As far as this version, its ok but not perfect. I would say the best way to play it is the ps1 classic on the Vita. This game is a direct port of the original and somewhat flawed PC version however the Steam version does have enhanced character models and has been patched to include the original PS1 soundtrack instead of the midi files.","August 26, 2014","true","37.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The entire VII compilation (from Before Crisis to Advent Children) is something I hold very near and dear to my heart. VII isn't everyone's favorite Final Fantasy installation, saying it doesn't live up to it's hype, but I honestly think you can't overstate how EPIC this game is. It rightfully holds its place on the pedestal of one of the greats in the series--and in gaming entirely. Classic FF battle mechanics with the addition of a GREAT materia system makes necessary leveling up enjoyable. Graphics are most certainly dated, but to be honest, it’s so easy to look past playing with blocks of colored polygons for characters on maps. That’s how good it is. An engrossing story; good gameplay; a memorable, iconic soundtrack; and the most beautiful characterization and character development (especially if you follow the ragtag team throughout the compilation) that isn’t selective to a choice few party members—and you’ve got yourself a game that still remains strong after nearly 20 years.","December 22, 2014","true","93.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"
