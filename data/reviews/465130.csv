The camera no longer jerks around when you change directions. It makes SUCH a huge difference. I really reccammend that you try the game now!\n\nWicce looks really cool at first glance. It does many things right as far as I'm concerned. The visuals are spot on, and I think the sort of 'puppet' style animations fit very well. Stylisticly Wicce is great. The soundtrack is really on-point, too. The soundscape provides a really nice atmospheric feel to the game, which I enjoyed.\n\nThe controls aren't great, but I didn't find the game unplayable because of them. I'd like to see some better support for customizing controls than is currently in-game.\n\nFinally, despite all the positives, we get to the one big flaw--in my mind--with this game. The speed and camera. Having the camera shift to the left/right when you face a different direction with a platformer like this, where I'm constantly switching directions is disorienting as best. This, combined with the sheer speed at which the character moves across the screen, actually started to make me feel nausious. I often found that I couldn't track anything on the screen and it was just a blur. Yes, a 2d sidescroller gave me motion sickness.\n\nI really suggest that, even though the camera makes -me- sick, that you give it a try. It's not a bad game, but it DOES need some fixes. Personally, I really hope that the creator addresses my concerns because I want to play the heck out of this game.\n\nPros:\n+ Great Visuals\n+ Great Audio\n+ Cool Theme/Concept\n+ Fun Combat\n\nCons:\n+ Character moves too fast","May 4","true","0.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

It has a simplistic plot told only with pictures, and a shallow combat system. The issue with controls earlier has been resolved as of writing this, they are now fluid and perfectly responsive.\n\nA first playthrough might take around an hour if you spend time searching for the collectables. Levels are very brief, with only a few branching paths in each. Each boss only has a few patterns and you'll pick up more than enough healing items prior.\n\nI greatly enjoyed Wicce for what it is, and for $5 I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys platformers.\n\nPros\n- Spectacular soundtrack\n- Beautiful visuals and artwork\n- Tight controls\n- Very easy to pick up and understand combat system\n\nCons\n- Low/nonexistant replayability\n- Super short","May 5","true","4.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I immediately fell in love! Here me out and soon you may feel so too!\nIt has some bugs and maybe a few glitches but they aren't game breaking. I know these are/will be getting fixed.\n\nThe story: You play as a mother named Wicce. You are a with and live with your daughter in the woods. One day you send her to granny's. Hours pass, it's already night time and she still hasn't returned. When her cat comes back and warns her about what happened she get's her trusty broom and goes out there to kick some ♥♥♥ and save her daughter!\n\nThis is the part that made me fall in love. It is a simple, yet loveable story line about love and shouldn't be taken too lightly. With it's interesting art style you feel like you are reading a fairy tale! To back it up you have a great soundtrack that reminded me of my childhood.\nThis is a great yet simple game and I love evrey bit of it!\n10/10 :D","May 10","true","0.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is not the hardest game in the world but I am frankly sick of games that kill you just to do it. Overall I like it and will play it more when I get some time.","May 12","true","0.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
