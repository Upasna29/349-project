"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeterMatias/recommended/7000/","PeterMatias","Peeta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeterMatias/","144 products in account","At the tender age of 9 years old, Lara Croft and her mother Amelia, survive a plane crash in the Himalayan mountains. Taking refuge in an old monastery, young Lara, already with an adventurous heart, discovers a stone dais with an ancient sword in it. This triggers an event that leads to her mother disappearance, and is the premise to Tomb Raider Legend.\n\nThis was the first Tomb Raider developed by Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Interactive switched the development of the next Tomb Raider game away from Core Design (the studio was shut down a little while after this decision) after the poorly received Angel of Darkness failed in the eyes of most Tomb Raider fans, and professional critics.\nTomb Raider Legend was/is an excellent Tomb Raider game, with the perfect balance between puzzle solving and combat, and an intricate story that mixes myth and marries it with real exotic locations to explore.\n\nGraphics wise, this is a game from 2006, but it holds very well to this day. The textures are well detailed and the particle system and animations are particularly impressive. The music in the game is on par with other Tomb Raider titles, which means that it's very good as well. Orchestrated music that kicks in at the right time to give an extra dose of suspense never gets old, and it's classic Tomb Raider in that regard.\n\nNew mechanics were also introduced this time around. Lara now has the ability to slow down time versus human enemies, but you can only use it when at a real close range by double pressing the jump button. When it's active time slows down and your aiming is more precise and you can target and damage more than one enemy if you are fast enough. A flashlight was also introduced and you can manually turn it on or off, and it is essencial in dark areas. You can carry only 3 medkits at any given time, and you can choose to use them whenever the situation calls for it. The amount of weapons you can carry is limited to only 2, your dual pistols and an extra slot for whichever weapon you want to carry. For the first time in a Tomb Raider game, you can pick up weapons from your fallen enemies, and there is some variation to them, from a shotgun, to an SMG, a rifle and a grenade launcher, plus a surprise weapon close to the end of the game. Another franchise first is the abbility to carry grenades. The binoculars are also very important, specially for helping you out with puzzle solving, with the ability to enter RAD mode and identify movable objects, destructable structures and mechanisms.\n\nThe characters and voice acting in the game are top notch. The script is well written and very well executed by the voice actors. They do a great job with emotions, the way the lines are delivered and acted make you feel in empathy with the characters, either it's a dramatic moment, or a cheerful one. Lara is not alone in this adveture, as her companions Zip and Allister always provide insight and advice through her intercom. These characters are not particularly deep, but they serve their purpose well and without getting in the way. Lara however is not the only true "deep" character in the game, as some characters have real motivations as well (can't really say much more without spoiling it to anyone) that make perfect sense in terms of story.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are logical and challenging for the most part, without ever becoming frustrating. The combat is fun, but the controls are a little clunky, and the enemy A.I apart from boss fights is just way too easy and not all that great. There is some texture distortion on this particular PC version, but it is rare and does not detract from the experience. I have read that some people have had some issues with this game under modern Operating Systems, but having played the game on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, I never encountered any issues or crashes of any sort. It runs like a charm on my OS. Also worthy of mention, and in my opinion a negative aspect of this version is the lack of the Steam overlay, meaning you will not be able to shift+tab to access the steam community while playing, your only option is to alt+tab, and doing so never caused the game to crash for me. There is a workaround to this issue, so I am told, but I did not try it out, and therefore can't really say anything on that aspect.\n\nTomb Raider Legend is an amazing Tomb Raider game. While not perfect, it is well worth playing.\nFor it's current price, it's a steal (even more so when it goes on sale, it can go as low as 1,50$) and well worth it. The game is a little short compared to other Raider games, but it is a fun and thrilling ride from start to finish.\n\n8/10\n\nThe Good\n\nGraphics still hold out well today\nLifelike animation, truly great music and sound effects\nVoice acting and story are top notch\nSome extra stuff to unlock which adds replayability\nGood selection of guns, fun and logical puzzles, exotic and mystical locations to explore\nChallenging Boss fights\nMotorcycle sections are fun\n\nThe Bad\n\nSome texture distortion\nCombat is a little clunky\nEnemy A.I is not very smart\nNo Steam overlay without a fix\n\n\n","November 9, 2014","true","14.2"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","55","60","3","7"

I have played the game before I had Steam account, when I got Steam account and I even have the game in Box DVD version.\nI love everything.\nReally.\nThis is the first Tomb Raider that I play it with such a joy and happiness.\nThe model of Lara Croft is gorgeous! Many years after the release, she looks amazing! When you enter water and come outside, she will be wet and will dry in time, but the effect is awesome! Her outfits are cute and they fit her body perfectly!\nShe is really a strong woman, because of her skills and great mind! This is how real women should look like. She is deadly and if you are a bad person, she will put you in the right place.\n\nThe level design of the game is awesome!\nFrom jungle terrain, to village in the desert to the snowly mountains and underground caves- there is much variety.\nSome of the puzzels could be challenging to you, if you are new to the game, but overall, they are not hard, and they are enjoyable so you will have fun with them!\nClimb, run, jump, shoot- you will do everything!\n\nNothing is more badass than riding a motor-bike on top of skyscrapers.\n\nThe sounds and the music is in very high level. Your ears and brain will like them very much.\nThe environment is awesome and you can interact with it to achieve your goals.\nThere are hidden and not so hidden artefacts in the game and collectables for you to find and collect.\n\nI would gladly play this game many more times in the future!","January 1","true","9.0"," 44 of 51 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","44","51","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jay-/recommended/7000/","jay-","jeyface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jay-/","677 products in account","Tomb Raider Legend was the return of the TR series after Eidos had successfully torpedoed it into the garbage can during the PS2 Generation. It's the first game in the series by Crystal Dynamics, and the big difference between it and the originals is the style of platforming. It no longer uses tank controls and the grid/tile based movement that the originals did, but rather goes for more like a Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (and it's sequels) style of platforming.\n\nIt's the only game of the Crystal series that they were able to go with a bit more of a lighthearted tone, so it leans heavily into the James Bond style globetrotting adventure, with the headset banter from your assistants. The levels are pretty good, with the standouts being Japan and England. The downsides are the combat sequences that are too frequent for a TR game, and some overlong motorcycle sequences that are in there to break up the pace. The majority of the game though is still based around puzzle solving and platforming which is what I wanted from a TR game.","May 19, 2014","true","9.1"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/recommended/7000/","synthsequence","synthsequence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/","442 products in account","Legend has it that the fabled Tomb Raider series was doomed to a life of purgatory, after the unfortunate creation of a buggy, rushed but well-meaning mess of a game called "The Angel of Darkness", and the franchise was to remain stagnant for many eons. Alas, a hero named "Crystal Dynamics" emerged, and a mere 3 years after Core Design's unsightly and depressing demise, brought Lara Croft back to life. The name of their triumphant return? The short, but incredibly sweet, Tomb Raider: Legend.\n\nOh, how I love this game. It got me into the Tomb Raider series way back when it was released in 2006. I'd dabbled in the older entries on the PlayStation but could never beat them (until recently that is. Check out my reviews for them! No shameful self-promotion here!), but Legend piqued my interest in the series and alas, $20 later, I have the entire series on Steam. And what a brilliant way to start again. Tomb Raider: Legend is precisely what Lara Croft needed: a beautiful, seamless and user-friendly transition to the (then) next generation of gaming.\n\nThe majority of Tomb Raider's lore is retconned, but the essentials are all here. We still (of course) have Lara Croft, and man, has she recieved a facelift. And a boob job. And a butt job. I'm gay and even I can't stop staring at her. She's still the kickass, no-nonsense, incredibly acrobatic, academic and elegant explorer who we've come to know and love. And the same applies to the gameplay; you still raid tombs, you still discover hidden treasures while globetrotting, and shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of bad guys and angry cats. All in a beautiful new engine.\n\nMan, this game is pretty. It just looks phenomenal. It has a unique, semi-cartoonish style in terms of character models, but the environments are bursting with detail and realism, and the use of effects like bloom and motion blurs are used just enough not to take away from the experience. Textures are crisp, ragdolls are hilariously bouncy, animations are smoother than jelly, and the detail is immaculate. The first time Lara emerged from water, actually visably wet and her clothes drenched, I was in awe.\n\nIt sounds amazing, too. The effort that went into the soundtrack is very admirable. Troels Brun Folmann has crafted a dynamic, unique to each level musical score which only adds to the already excellent atmosphere. Voice acting is also great, a tad unbelievable but very cinematic. Keeley Hawes brings a regal and more mature tone to Lara which I was very glad to hear.\n\nPlot-wise, it's good! I mean, nothing really new or special here. It's the typical "artifact in multiple pieces go around the world to collect them and then something happens when they're all together then boss battle". But there are some lovely villains, there's traitors, there's emotion, there's consistency, and there's enough to keep you interested in what's going on. I don't think as much effort was put in here as in The Angel of Darkness, but it works and it wraps up nicely, hinting at a sequel without resorting to an irritating cliffhanger. That said, the research that Crystal Dynamics did into ancient lore, such as that of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, do give the story a lot more depth.\n\nThe gameplay itself? Stellar. It feels so incredibly natural when Lara is rope-swinging, vaulting, shimmying, dodging, shooting, pole-climbing, swimming, and even riding a Ducati™ (yes, there's product placement) motorcycle. The levels are incredibly varied, and I don't miss the older blocky engine one iota. Movement and combat is far less restrictive, control is pitch-perfect, and the addition of Lara's grappling hook adds a lot more than one would think to the game. It's very smooth and well done. There's also tons of unlockables, which I absolutely LOVE. What happened to unlockables?! There's (many) costumes, weapon upgrades, art, models, cheats and a video to unlock, and all this encourages replayability.\n\nWhich brings me to the few negative points I have about this game. My main gripe is the length: there are only eight levels in Tomb Raider: Legend (nine, if you count Lara's Mansion, which makes a welcome return), and even with the added collectibles and time trials for each level, the game is over quickly, especially for people who don't care about 100% completion. The fact that it's quite easy (regardless of the difficulty setting) also adds to this; the game is constantly providing you with tutorials, even in the sixth level of the game, and you can utilise Lara's magical binoculars to help you solve puzzles (none of which are remotely complex).\n\nThe game is also buggy from time to time, mostly in the visual department. I noticed this especially in Kazakhstan, during a motorcycle section in which areas of the map were simply missing or transparent. Turning on "Next-Generation Content" in the video settings adds dynamic lighting and better textures, but kills the framerate (sometimes regardless of your gaming setup) and throws even more glitches into the mix, including misaligned ropes and distorted faces, and even crashing the game on some levels.\n\nOne final thing: Lara's new sidekicks bug me, a lot. They just don't shut the hell up. "Watch out Lara!" "Wow Lara, that was great!" "Whoa, I don't like the look of this!". Even Lara herself gets audibly annoyed with them. It's totally nitpicking on my part but I feel it's a valid criticism. Just shut the hell up Zip and Alister! She doesn't need your help!\n\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely. Legend was the start of something new, a rebirth that Tomb Raider so desperately needed. After Legend came onto the scene, the equally awesome Anniversary, Underworld, Guardian of Light and the 2013 re-imagining followed suit. What an excellent way to get us exploring again!\n\n4/5","November 16, 2014","true","12.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","2"

After Tomb Raider: The Angel of darkness, Core Design was banned from creating Tomb Raider games, and eidos wanted to continue the series. Most people hated the Tomb Raider franchise when this game was released, and the franchise still exists today, meaning this game is worth playing.\n\nGraphics - 7/10\nFor a game released in 2006, it has decent graphics. Even though technology was advanced, the developers wanted to make the pc port have the same capabilities as the Playstation 2. Comepared to modern day games, the graphics may look poor, but they were really good for the time. If you have a more powerful PC, there is an option called "Next-Gen Effects" which upscales the textures, graphics, and object models to the same capabilities as an XBOX360. It is easy to see the difference when compared with the playstation 2. The water effects, foliage, and wildlife looks great along with walls floors, and celings. Lighting effects are decent, but nothing special, but the game renders at a smooth 40fps on my slow laptop.\n\nGameplay - 8/10\nWhile Angel of Darkness consisted of slow animations and clunky controls, along with somewhat unplayable mechanics, Legend has certainly saved the franchise. In Legend, the Action-Adventure experience is fast paced, and animations are smooth and fluid. The player explores a vast range of environments, from the rooftops of Tokyo, Mountains of Nepal, and Peruvian Towns, and each has a certain colour scheme. More realism has been added; limit inventory space alows a maximum of 3 health packs, and up to 2 weapons. However, this has not made gameplay any worse. Gear is not upgraded throughout the game, and there is no skill system. The controls are a huge improvement compared to previous titles, but the water controls can be somewhat irritating. Combat is really easy, and the AI is not very intelligent. There are some powerful combination moves to kill enemies, which I would spoil, but are very satisfying. Platforming is done really well with a huge combination of moves. These include : vine climbing, pole swinging, flips and rolls. You will have a fun time manouvering around the environment. The biggest NEGATIVE about gameplay is that it is really easy and linear. I reccomend playing on the "Hard" difficulty at all times. The Gameplay is very linear, which I like, but some may not enjoy. Another NEGATIVE is that the game is incredibly short. It will give the player an average 5-6 hours of gameplay. Puzzles arecleverly designed, and use physics and objects in the environment, rather that flipping lots of switches. Boss fights are fun and satisfying, and require a strategy, even if they are somewhat easy. Overall, the gameplay is very fun and enjoyable.\n\nPC Port - 6/10\nThe PC port is done very simply, but very well. The Player can adjust display options easily, via the in-game menu. There are many expected graphics settings, like  resolution, ect.... Graphics can also be adjusted externally , bur running " Tomb Raider Legend: Setup" from the steam launcher. One big defect is the fact that there is no windowed mode, but you can download 3rd party software for this.\n\nExtras - 8/10\nThe game comes with a wide variety of extras/unlockables. These include Outfits, Character Profiles, Concept Arts ect... . However, it would have been nice to add achievements to the PC version of the game.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game, pulled together at the last minute. It is satisfying and fun, and reccomended if you are a Tomb Raider Fan, or a Newbie to the Series.\n\nI enjoyed playing this very much, especially now that Lara is a more likeable character.\n\nSatsit123\n\n\n","January 5, 2014","true","1.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","2"

(gameplay). Legend is a great game and what makes it so great is sexy Lara, oops! I mean it is the balanced gameplay, not so easy and not so difficult. It just feels right in everything. Maybe the fighting is not that great, but it just needs a fast aiming (with the mouse is easier, but it is ok with the controller really, not bad). Now if only they make an enhanced versions of TR4!).\n\nFor this silly price? Are you kidding? This game definitely from the best value for money games (if not the best ever!). Wow!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/7000/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","Tomb Raider Legend is a story-driven platformer that is fun to play, but a near-game-breaking bug and some awkward mechanics  belittle the overall positive experience.\nInstalled size on hard drive: 7.3 GB\n\nThe story is decent, if a little disconnected. Lara is searching for an artifact that killed her mother years ago. A great excuse to send Lara to a variety of diverse locations, from a sleepy South American town to the frozen mountains of Nepal. Zip and Alistair provide some snarky commentary as she proceeds through the levels – some of it almost breaking the fourth wall. It helps keep the proceedings light-hearted and fun, even if what is happening is quite serious. Lara herself is keen, quick-witted, whip-smart, and always ready with a snappy come-back. TR: Legend was actress Keeley Hawes first time voicing Lara, and she does an absolutely fantastic job.\n\nThe platforming is well-executed and slick, with timed movements (move quickly before the platforms collapse) and required momentum (remember to HOLD the spacebar to jump in some places, or Lara won't jump far enough). Gun-play just feels odd; lock on to a target, use the arrow or WASD keys to switch the lockon from target to target. While doing this, Lara can run, jump and dodge. There is a free-aim mode, but once engaged Lara cannot move at all, so the lockon mode will be the one used most often. I rebound the keys to what I wanted, so there is that. There are no waypoints; not really an issue in a game this linear. The climbing puzzles are generally well done; remember to use Lara's binoculars first to scan an area for hints before trying to solve a puzzle. Some bosses can only be defeated with the help of the environment, so if a boss seems like it is taking no damage, start looking around for switches and levers (and things to grapple). Nothing is handed to you in this game, though once you figure out a puzzle or boss, it will be solved or defeated in a matter of seconds.\n\nNow for the issues, and there are more of them than there should be. Lock-on would sometimes result in strange camera movements, and the camera doesn't immediately auto-rotate to the forward direction when riding a motorbike. The platforming direction controls aren't always intuitive. A similar issue plagues the QTEs; the onscreen arrows don't always indicate the correct direction, resulting in multiple fails until finding the right button-press. Disable Next Generation Content in the graphics settings; TR: Legend looks better with it, but this will eliminate nearly all crashes. And there is the near-game-breaking bug in the Nepal temple level. A cutscene, then Lara needs to run to a door, hit it (I won't say with what, because spoilers), the door will open, triggering another cutscene and a platforming section. But hitting the door doesn't always make it open, meaning progression through the game is blocked. Just keep re-loading a save until the game works the way it is supposed to (it took me seven tries the last time I played it). Ridiculous, but there it is.\n\nThe saving grace through all of this Lara Croft herself. Unlike more recent versions of Lara, this one has no lack of confidence. You never hear Lara telling herself, “I can do this.” She already knows she can, and can worry about other things. I still highly recommend Tomb Raider: Legend despite the game's issues, because there is nothing truly game breaking, and this remains one of my favorite “older” versions of Lara. If story-driven platforming and puzzling is your preference, or you just want more Lara Croft, absolutely get this one.","April 16","true","14.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I know it came out before the Anniversary edition, but seeing as it was popular enough to Make the Anniversary game, I was hoping this would top it up well. But it's not bad, regardless. The graphics are actually really lovely. It looks good, but nothing Too special in my taste. Plus, I felt like the game didn't look finished. There were areas where the characters would move around inside a car and their hair or arm would move through the solid of the vehicle. It was odd to look at, and even the animation was very awkward, and I'm pointing it out because from the time it came out. Reason why the score is actually lower is because of it's story. Incredibly bland, super cheesy, and nothing too awe-strucking.\n\nGameplay: 8\nBut I will admit, what made this game it's credit was it's gameplay. The controlers are really easy to manuever, Lara's really fun to move and play arond with, and the physics within work well. It's got pretty good puzzles, awesome boss battles, and I liked the chasing scenes a lot for some reason. It's a little bit too easy, but still got me entertained in game. Just not with the cutscenes.\n\nOverall: 7\nWhat really bummed me getting this game on Steam is that it doesn't support it's Overlay, nor could I have taken any screenshots, but that's my personal opinion, and I think TR:Underworld is the same. But beside that, it's a pretty good action/puzzle game, much like Anniversary, but don't expect much with the story. I'll still recommend it because it's really really fun!","August 15, 2014","true","5.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucassm/recommended/7000/","lucassm","Darius Vulkius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucassm/","823 products in account","Part 1:\n\nI remember a long time ago, after i played Angel Of Darkness and was heavily sad with the bankrupicy of Core Design. Damn, those were rougue times. Luckily, Crystal Dynamics came to save the day and brought us Tomb Raider: Legend.\nI was a bit anxyous, to be honest. Tomb Raider changing hands into another developer, will they bring us the same essence again?\n\nAs screenshots from the game were showed and when it appeared on the E3 of 2006, i was ready to say YES!\nWhen i played the demo, i desperately needed to play the full version. And so i did. Back theses days, i bought my PS2. Witch got me not only Tomb Raider Legend, but also Anniversary some time later (Witch i will talk in other review). I played it with no clues of secrets or other things, din't even bothered reading the manual. IT WAS FUN. I mean, really fun. I remember, one of my first things that i've done after i first finished the story mode: Going out of my house and buying me a gamer magazine (Woah, those were the times...) to be able to finish it 100%. And so i did. I was so happy when i did.\n\nFirst thing: The graphics. Even on PS2, they were beutiful. They are even better on PC. The ambients are pretty detailed and the immersion is great. I loved the art design of this game. It made me remember Tomb Raider 3. Moutains, temples and militar base. The snow part was my favorite, specially because of the change of gameplay.\n\nGameplay: Lara is like 450% more flexible than on Tomb Raider 6 and can do even more moves than the other 6 games. But it had a reason for it. As you go though stages, you will see that not you can climb, but also, run on walls (Like Prince Of Persia). I actually liked this featured and i think that it could've been more explored.  Besides that, you can roll and do a lot of acrobatic moves with it. As i said, Lara is way more flexible than in other games. It feel MUCH MORE pleasurable to play with her. Other changes to gameplay are: Quick time events. There are two types of them. One is the common one, where you have to push a certain button to not fail and die. Since there's always a checkpoint before these events, it will not give you any trouble. The second one is what i call "Quick Action And Reaction". When a "Lara's icon" appears on the bottom right of the screen, you will have a limited time to get to safety. You will have to run and jump, and react real quick to anything that is happening. An example: In the end of the first stage of the game, a chopper will come and start to blow up the bridge that you're on. You have to get to the other side if you want to make it alive. But the chopper's shoots will always vary. Sometimes they will hit a little bit forward, so you have to keep attention where you are stepping or else you will fall to death. I also had no problems with this event. I actually found it pretty cool, if you ask me. I preffer then more than common quick time events (I would love so much if Castlevania: Lord Of Shadows was more like that). The reason is because i think it's more skill based than "pressing the right button" based. Am i right?\nOkay, next on the list of gameplay is vehicles. Sometimes, Lara will ride a vehicle. I personaly had no problem with them. Expect for two things. I swear to god, the physics of this game in these parts are rather strange sometimes. What i'm trying to say is: Don't hit walls many times. Seriously, don't. And the other thing is: Gunplay while driving. It's quite obvious that you can't fire both weapons, right? Okay, so what do you expect? Enemies with less life, right? WRONG! Enemies will take 7-9 shoots to die. I mean, SERIOUSLY. Couldn't they low it a bit, so it din't got THAT repetitive? Here's a tip: Try always to fire explosive barrels and explode their bikes, it's MUCH FASTER.\nAlso, this is another things. Explosive barrels are back. And with them another "interactive destructables". What i mean is: To either explorer a barrel (That's marked with a "!") or an "interactive destructable" (Also marked with "!"), you have to press the action button (On PC: "E", can't remember right now witch one it is on Gamepad). And Lara will shoot into these places and take out more enemies (Or take ou heavy enemies with less challenge). You also can use manual aim on them (Tough i din't used manual aim in the ENTIRE game, so). These are cool. And thanks to them, some destruction is possible in this game. And, again, that could've been MUCH MORE explored. Damn, this game had a lot of potential. And may be the game where the devs took out most of the ideas and put on Tomb Raider 2013.\n\nSound: I really liked the sound of the game. I really loved the song from intro, menu, ending, mission ending and the Tokyo mission theme. It's a memorable soundtrack and does it job. Lara's voice is quite good and i think it combines with her new visual in this game. Zip is back and...Tough he is not annoying, i preffered SOOOOOO MUCH his voice from Tomb Raider 5. He sounded so much cool there, what happened? If i can say one character that annoys the ♥♥♥♥ out of me is Allister. JESUS ♥♥♥♥ING CHRIST. SHUT UP ALREADY! AND I MEAN IT THIS TIME!  THANK GOD YOU WILL DIE ON UNDERWORLD, YOU BIG PILE OF ♥♥♥♥ .\n\nThe Story...Oh boy. I think i will need to put these into parts. I will begin. With the failure of making a trilogy of the Angel Of Darkness, Crystal Dynamics tried to make their own trilogy (Witch was never a Trilogy BTW). At least they started it right. They tried to erase TRAOD from canon (Since we don't know anything that happened after the ending of it) and create their own story. Not only for the exploration part of the game (Myths, artifacts, etc), but also for Lara. That's right, this was the first game since Tomb Raider 4 (Witch only did a bit of this on the first two levels of it) that tried to explore Lara's past. As you can remember, nothing was ever said about Lara's dad and mother. The only thing you know is that they aren't showed and Lara is rich as hell. That's it. And that's where the devs tried to explored, creating a whole new story of it, introducing new characters like Amanda and Anaya. Anaya is just friends with Lara, and doesn't have much impact on plot. She just helped her to locate some things and was rescued by Lara later on the game. Amanda is the big fish in the new characters here. She's now the main antagonist. And i really mean it. She was best friends with Lara, since an accident happened and Lara had to leave her. More of this is revealed during a part of the game. And now, she's back, with hew own plan to gain infinity powers and become immortal (Well, that excalated quickly). And Lara has to defeat her by collecting all the parts of...Excalibur.\n...\nI know what you're thinking right now: "LOL, that was the best they could do?!". It has a connection. Not only Excalibur is the only thing capable of hurting Amanda, but also, Lara's mother disappeareance had something to do with her getting to another known as "Avalon". Now, with this, you know what mythology this game is about, right? Okay. Through it doesn't really happen a lot on plot (I mean, only things about Lara's past are revealed and there's the fight with Amanda and a little recounter with Lara's mother), it isn't bad. Each piece will be somewhere in the world, and that's will be a new mission. So location variety is back and this time, at least, it's good. Remember when i said i like the Tokyo mission soundtrack? It was also one of my favorite stages. I liked how they got a closed space and transformed it into a open exploration space. I just really think that the enemy of this mission in particular isn't that memorable. I can't even remember his name if you ask me.\nBut that's the most of the story.\n\nNow, we are going to talk about two major things in this game that completes theirselves: Exploration and unlockables.","January 31, 2014","true","6.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","5"

I personally liked some of the classics and Rise of the TR better, but this is a great game overall but it does have some weaknesses. One of it's major weaknesses is the length of the game. It's only 8 levels. Yes you read this right, 8. The levels are somewhat long but you probably won't get anymore than 10 hours of game-play out of it if you are playing it for the first time. However to get all of the Rewards and time trials really ups that time and can take a long time to achieve. My first time through this probably added an additional 10 hours to game-play just trying to find all the Rewards and completing the Time Trials. It has a wealth of collectibles, like most Tomb Raider games, and has a fairly streamline arsenal of weapons compared to AOD and some other Tomb Raider games. All in all though, this game has great graphics and great level design. The story is very gripping and at some times can keep you on the edge of your seat. Vehicles are once again present in Tomb Raider, however you only get to ride a Motorbike and a Fork-Lift. You get the Motorbike three times. Two of them are simply just trying to get to the next area of the game and those areas are very linear. Meaning, you have no control over where you want to go. You always have to go forward which takes away looking at the scenery (and in one of the levels it's very nice.) So not one of my favorite sections in the game but it's alright. The other time we use it, we have full control over the vehicle, but we only ride it for about 30 seconds just to make a jump over a ledge, quite disappointing. However, something new in the Tomb Raider series are Outfits. You can now change Lara's outfit before starting a level and in Croft Manor which is a nice feature. Speaking of, there is a Croft Manor level and let me tell you I love this version! I personally like the design of the classic manor better, but unlike the classics where you have maybe one puzzle and it's just Lara running around with Winston following her, this version actually has tasks that you have to accomplish to obtain objects and rewards. You start out with nothing, but in the end you'll get your Pistols, Grapple, Binoculars, and a few other things and you'll most likely find a wealth of rewards along the way. There is no Time Trial sadly and there is no way to restart the manor unless you start a new save which is sort-of disappointing since I'd like redo levels at times. Also, you can't go outside which I find an odd section that they took out. Overall Tomb Raider Legend is good. I personally prefer other Tomb Raider games, but, this isn't a bad game at all! Some of the levels are very memorable and I think it offers great replay value. I recommend this game if you like the Tomb Raider series and if you like Third Person Shooters and Puzzle games!","May 18","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, the PC version is pretty good. Make sure you use an xbox controller  and play with the settings to get the shooting functioning like the X360 version. On a positive note, Legend is far from being an eyesore. The PC version features higher resolutions and a nice "Next-Gen" mode that resembles the 360 version. The gameplay is stuff you expect in a Tomb Raider game; pushing crates, pulling levers, dodging boulders, etc. Also, Lara's mansion makes a comeback and so that's a huge plus.\n\nStoryline can be rather cheesy at times, especially compared to the superior origin story of the recent reboot. And cutscenes/ flybys/ constant chatter can distract the player from enjoying the atmosphere. The game is also pretty short and ends on a cliffhanger. Plently of unlockables and decent replay value. Fun boss fights and great music. A bit on the easy side even on Hard. However, some of the bosses on Hard mode can be a frustrating challenge. The collectable secrets/unlockables and time trials give this game some good replay value.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's everything you love about Tomb Raider, but it's a bit more streamlined for a casual audience. Puzzles are simplistic and quick. More arcade and action elements in this one. In a way, Legend reminds me of TR2.  Especially, the Nepal level. If you played TR2 and play this level you'll understand why. Legend is my favorite out of the L-A-U trilogy. Due to being more simple, Legend feels less frustrating than Anniversary. And it still feels more polished than Underworld. In other words, Legend is short, but sweet.","July 15, 2014","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Climbing and jumping, as well as rappelling have a strong presence here in a world governed by ledges, platforms and movable blocks.\nAn outlandish plot involving a legend of old drives the game onward, striking a delicate balance between absurd and mystifying. Very well carried by the voice acting, the story requires suspension of disbelief at first but just might draw you in with its "What If..." approach.\nA downside would be the underwhelming gunplay. No weapon truly feels powerful, instead a more arcade-y combat system is presented with bullet-sponge enemies and somewhat redeeming combat-acrobatics such as slide kicks, brief slow-mo-inducing flips off the enemy, and evasive/cover manoeuvres.\nBut let's face it, Tomb Raider was always an Adventure series. Expect at least 75% of the game to involve interaction with the environment, and about 25% combat. A "Hidden Relics" mini-game is included in all levels as well as Croft Manor to encourage exploration, or replay value for completionists. For extra challenge, completed levels present the Time Trial option for added pressure.\n\nGrab it on sale for a dozen hours of solid platforming.","January 23, 2013","true","20.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The combat and corresponding AI are a joke. The motorcycle parts are mildly amusing at best and feel like a chore at worst. Pushing moveable objects around is very clunky. It's unbelieveable the designers made it function so poorly. The final boss was so awfully executed. It relies so heavily on the lock-on feature and it's an utter failure.

The story is a little complicated but interesting enough and as usual the game takes you through a nice variety of environments to explore. Lush jungles, dark crypts, abandoned museums, snowy mountains and even city roof tops. There's even a cool flashback sequence that takes you back in time to an important part of the story. The music score is utterly fantastic from start to finish.\n\nIf there are any real disappointments it's that the length of the game is on the short side but since you'll want to explore every nook and cranny for secrets and suffer through the times trials (unlocking the obligatory sexy outfits for Lara) it's worth it. A few sections are really frustrating (the bike sequence in Kazahkstan) but otherwise it's pretty fair. Most of the time If you'll die it's because you didn't plan it out or zigged when you should've zagged. The controls aren't as polished as they are in Anniversary which came out a year later but Lara's movements are still fluid and easy to perform.\n\nNote: there's a few graphical glitches and game crashes in certain spots when "next generation content" is enabled.

Core's last contribution to the TR legacy, Angel of Darkness, is widely considered to be the worst in the series and CD did a respectable job at getting things back into order in the wake of its mediocrity. It's probably the oldest of the games that you can jump into without having to wear nostalgia goggles or be in the right mindset for dealing with some antiquated game design and glaring technical limitations (to be fair, though, the original was somewhat ahead of its time back when it was the new hotness).\n\nThe core Tomb Raider mechanics are all here, just freshened up a bit compared to previous iterations. There's no slowly pivoting tank controls to contend with and there is a more cohesive feel to level traversal overall compared to prior games. You'll still run into annoying camera shenanigans at times when you're trying to line up a jump or tell Lara which direction to jump in while hanging off a ledge. Most people can probably expect to get roughly six hours of gameplay by going through the story and gathering collectables they find along the way (but not necessarily trying to seek every one out), maybe throw in an extra thirty minutes to an hour if you complete the Croft Manor side content as well. Combat is limited to fighting generic soldiers and mercenaries as well as the occasional animal while supernatural elements are confined to cutscenes, quick time events and boss battles—a bit lame overall, but luckily combat has never been the focus of this series, it's just there to break up the exploration and puzzle solving.\n\nI remember when this game first came out it ran like absolute garbage on pretty much all hardware available at the time if you turned on the “next-gen” features—looking at it now, it's hard to see why. A case of unoptimized code for a console generation that was still in its infancy, I suppose. Pretty much any reasonably modern hardware should be able to brute force past the game engines deficiencies, though. I did run into some odd rendering issues with certain 2D elements, but they were merely a mild distraction and didn't prevent me from playing the game. Once you get half way through the game, however, it does have a tendency to be rather unstable at spots when using the “next-gen” content and you may find yourself having to disable it to get past certain areas without crashing to desktop.\n\nAll-in-all it's a pretty enjoyable game, a few caveats aside, if you're looking for some adventure, light action and puzzle solving. Certainly worth a play if you've never been through it before and it's on sale for dirt cheap.","February 9, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

It's a good enough game to get your Tomb Raider fix on, but it is nothing too special. Platforming and exploring the variety of zones was fun, but the combat left a lot to be desired. Most of it simply wasn't enjoyable. The combat largely consisted of just shooting some generic soldiers to death, nicking their stuff, and killing more soldiers with it. There was a farily significant focus on the combat and action, most of which wasn't enjoyable to me. But, if you happen to like that stuff then this game has plently of it for you to enjoy.","December 2, 2013","true","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Otherwise, this is another great Tomb Raider game. I believe this one had more locations and outfits for Lara than Anniversary, and the story is very good. It was released in 2006 and shows its age a little bit, but it has a "Next Generation Content" setting that makes things look better. Although, that did cause some crashes on my machine, so you might have to turn if off for certain levels.\n\nI used this game as a test to see how well my computer would do in the living room.  I brought my computer downstairs and hooked it up to the big screen and sound system.  I connected an XBox 360 controller and played the game in full 1080p.  It worked really well.  So, I can confidently do that again for future games I might prefer to play in the living room, but that are superior or cheaper on the PC.","December 9, 2012","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paulthebest/recommended/7000/","paulthebest","Paul The Best","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paulthebest/","48 products in account","Tomb Raider: Legend is the second of two games I bought last year in order to play through this seminal franchise of 90's era gaming before the 2013 "reboot" came along and destroyed the franchise forever.  The first game - TR: Anniversary - was quite fun and enjoyable.  TR:L however, was one of those experiences where I was fighting to stick around long enough to finish the game.\n\nWhat TR:L does right is capture the essence of Lara Croft as a character and the platforming Tomb Raider does best.  Lara in this game is perfectly portrayed as the confident and over-sexed adventurer we all know her as.  Additionally, by this game's 2006 release, they had expanded the game locales from the eponymous tombs to skyscapers and military bases, to name two.  Inserting Lara into these locales worked well, without too much juxtaposition of having an archaeologist run around modern sites.\n\nThe gameplay - particularly the platforming - is spot-on. It's a simple yet effective set of moves for Lara, you rarely feel that the controls are at fault when things turn to tears.  This game is the classic example of sticking with what works, even in the face of more complex and more advanced modern gameplay.  You grab stuff, you swing from things, and you jump around.  Simple.  It works.\n\nBut the problems with this game lie deep.  Principally, I began to speculate as I got further into this game that it was developed independently by two different development teams: a platforming team and a combat team.  The so-called platforming team did this game justice, as previously mentioned. This combat team however, is where things fall apart.  Combat in Tomb Raider has never been my favorite thing.  I still think that a pure platforming and environmental puzzle version of Tomb Raider would be the best game in the franchise.  The combat really shows its inadequacies in the boss encounters. Just like in Anniversary, they are disjointed from the rest of the game.  You will spend lots of time alone navigating a puzzle or whatever at your own pace, then all of a sudden a boss appears and the game throws arbitrary time constraints at you and asks the player to control Lara in ways that are not at all consistent or even to be used again within the rest of the game.  In fact, the last boss was so infuriating I didn't even bother to try to beat it again after I was thoroughly trounced by it.  By that point after almost 2 full games of this I had had enough.  This disjointed back and forth between platforming and combat is in my opinion what makes these Tomb Raider games only good games and not great.\n\nSecondly, the in-game radio between Lara and her intel people got completely out of hand. Lara would get frequent mission updates and story narrative from this two-way radio communication. I get that using that game mechanic is a great way produce a narrative in the game without having it be forced in through cut-scenes or whatever. Some games have even mastered it, think Cortana in Halo: Combat Evolved. But here in TR:L it was just too much, too frequently and in my opinion not all that important to the story.  That sense of isolation in these expansive tombs is what was sorely missing in this title. Being able to solve a puzzle at your own pace with only your thoughts to guide you is the essence of good single-player puzzle platforming in my opinion.\n\nSo my two game Tomb Raider project ends here. TR:L wasn't horrible, but I would've been mad as hell if I paid fifty bucks for it on release in 2006. If you put a gun to my head and said I could only ever play one of these two titles - Anniversary or Legend - I would immediately say Anniversary is the way to go. Legend just has too many flaws to make the run through it worthwhile.","September 10, 2013","true","15.0"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

Thankfully, this game brings Lara back to light and attempts to reconnect her with her Tomb Raiding roots with a brand new engine and great graphics. Lara Croft herself has also recieved a makeover, looking similar to Angelina Jolie unfortunetly. The gameplay has been refined to accomodate the new engine and it feels very fresh. Lara now navigates a more realistic world that finally doesn't look like it was made in minecraft. The combat now features a reticule lockon that helps show players who they are aiming at and features some cool new combat moves like jumping off of enemies and kicking them around. Lara also has a grappling hook which is used quite a lot in the game. The only problem i have with this game is that it feels more like an action game than a tomb raider game. There's no more animals to shoot at aside from like... two panthers. There's very few traps. There's epic music constantly playing like you're in some adventure movie, and worst of all is your new partners in crime. That's right... you have people yelling in your ear now telling you exactly what to do. They tell you obvious hints, they comment about everything you do, they won't shut up! It takes away from what made the original games so great, the silence of exploring a cave alone in the dark with animals jumping out and killing you.","January 2, 2013","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The combat is irrelevant and ridiculous, the bullets go every where like your having a panic attack everytime you shoot. Then, while trying to jump from 1 rope to the other, you get to the last rope (if your're lucky), the 10th time mind you, and you take your time lining up and getting the height right, and...........no, you fall to your death again, and again, and again, and again........which is only one example of many scenarios just like that. I like the puzzles, but the checkpoint system paired with the utterly useless game mechanic that make it so easy to consistently fail no matter how meticulous you are, is the main reason I dislike the whole series. Sometimes, you just want to get on with it instead of falling yet again as you jump to something and just go right through it, but you can't restart at that chockepoint, you have to do some other sequences over and over just to get back to the parts where the game falls apart.\n\nIt's really hit or miss, so that's why I think you see people that never had a problem with it, although I'm skeptical about that, and people that hate it because of the unpredictability of whether something is going to work or not based on a pixel or two difference in position. I have better things to do with my time, like take out the garbage than play a game that forces you to fail consistantly and repeatedly just to move on to another annoying quirky sequence. If the system was a little more forgiving (as in you actually grab the rope/ledge you just landed on or went straight through) then the game could be enjoyed for what it is good at, exploring tombs and ruins and figuring out puzzles.\n\nAfter a while, well a very short while, it's difficult to find a reason to play any tomb raider game instead of something else that's infinitely less annoying.","February 9","false","11.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

A game I bought at release when it came out and finished 4 hours later wondering "is that it?"\n\nContrary to the previous games, TR Legend is a straight up action shooter with sporadic puzzles. Most of the more challenging puzzles are strictly optional and the ones you are required to complete have little thinking involved.\n\nAlthough at the same time I can't blame Eidos for severely dumbing down Tomb Raider. Considering at the time everyone believed the franchise was dead due to Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness. I can blame them though for making it linear, "cinematic", full of QTE's and short.\n\nThe plot is absolute garbage, filled with extremely flimsy characters. Lara is a very unlikeable character who's entire motivation throughout the story is her mommy issues. All the player's sidekicks are annoying and serve to waste the player's time with needless exposition. I found myself sympathising significantly more with the villains of Legend than I did the protagonists, at least they had some personality.\n\nIt really did mark a huge shift in this series from it's puzzle platforming roots, into it's big budget linear cover shooter successors. Thankfully Crystal Dynamics did redeem themselves with Anniversary but took another nosedive with Underworld and TR2013.","March 27, 2014","false","0.3"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","17","38","0","0"

Especially the final battle it is so hard getting Lara to do anything. Another gripe is the nature of some of the puzzles. A good puzzle is where you know what needs to be achieved and need to go about finding a way to get there. Some of the puzzles in Legend are not really puzzles in this way. You sometimes have no idea what you are trying to achieve and only have a few interactable elements to play with. You basically just work things together until something happens.

Yes, the graphics are pretty, I dig Lara's more realistic look, and the controls are fairly nice and intuitive. But other than that, the game's just too flimsy to stand up well.\n\nThe levels are extremely short and extremely linear. The locations, though pretty and nicely varied, never confer a sense of amazement. Again, because there's just too little of them, and exploration is almost non-existent. The result is that you just breeze through the locations, and never really get that epic feel that few other games could create. Even the secret rewards aren't really secret. You practically stumble over the bronze and silver, and the gold usually isn't all that hard to find either.\n\nThe puzzles are almost insultingly simple, and that's without the blatant hand-holding by the sidekicks and the solve-everything goggles. In platforming sections, the correct and only path might as well be highlighted in neon colors. The only challenge usually comes from the stupid interaction between camera angles and movement keys. The vehicle sections are phoned in as well, simplistic and boring, a disgrace for this day and age.\n\nThe most I can say about the combat is that it's there. If you weave and dodge a bit, almost none of the mooks will hit you, and all go down with relative ease even if you stick to the pistols. The boss fights are equally simple and rarely take more than one or two tries to get right. And the taunting gets old quick. The only interesting, and dare I say epic, fight was the one against the sea serpent, which nevertheless was quite simple and would have been over even quicker if the grapple lock-on wouldn't have been confused by the multiple targets. It also left me with a bitter aftertaste, since I pretty much waltzed into its lair and then killed it for defending its territory.\n\nThe story is nothing but a ham-fisted cliché storm, which I could excuse if the characters weren't so flat and unlikable. Lara is an absolute mess. On the one hand, she's supposed to be this snarky, tough-as-nails action girl, and on the other hand her entire motivation for the game is the quest to find her lost mommy. The writers mash together these two halves of the character without anything even approaching finesse. I find Lara's flagrant, even gleeful disregard for her own life and that of others deeply disturbing, especially in the context of said mommy-issues. The villains are simply boring and cliché, the evil magic vamp, the corrupt playboy and the generic yakuza (nice tats, though). After having read much vitriol about the sidekicks, I found myself enjoying their banter quite a bit. I felt they complemented each other well, and were significantly more sane and well adjusted than their sociopathic boss. By and large the most interesting character was Nishimura, the extremely rich and extremely ripped Japanese dude in badass white tux. Why couldn't the game have been about him?\n\nAs a whole, Legend is extremely forgettable. It has some good points, but they are lost in a sea of meh. At the end of the day, there's just too little to this game, both length- and content-wise to make it compelling.","May 16, 2015","false","12.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

But on the other hand I did finish it, so while they annoyed me, I still did enjoy the game and kept playing, so from that point of view, the good parts outweighed the issues.\n\nThis is the first Tomb Raider game I've played, so I don't have any "Tomb Raider Standards" set in place. Keep that in mind.\n\nSo, before we get into what the issues are, let's look at the basics. Tomb Raider: Legend is an action platformer, with some mild puzzles in it. When I say mild puzzles, it's because while there's quite a few puzzles scattered around, they're really simple to do, and you're often told how to do them just to make matters worse. It's like, you come to place you can't reach and the game just outright goes "Hm, if only I could find something to stand on to get up there"; before you even give it a try yourself. You have a pair of binoculars that can go into a special mode, where you can focus on certain highlighted objects (the important ones) and know whether they can be pushed, are mechanisms, are fragile, or such. You hardly need to though, because it doesn't take an expert to guess that a box can be pushed and moved around. The game even sometimes tell you that "Hey, I bet I can push this". So yea, very mild puzzling.\n\nThe action parts are mainly gun combat and twice in the game, a stage where you're on a motorcycle. Seems pretty standard, and the motorcycle would add some variety to the gameplay. That's what you'd think, right ?\nWe'll get more into that later.\n\nThirdly, and most importantly, is the platforming. Platforming is pretty much the core of the game. With ledges to grab on to, a grappling hook to fly around with, ropes to climb and jump from, and such. It's pretty fun once you get a hang of it, and it's probably the main attraction, alongside exploring tombs and other interesting locations, and sometimes dodging traps while you're at it.\n\nThe controls though, can be a little weird at times. I highly suggest rebinding the keys if playing with a keyboard, because you do not want to play with default controls. They're so weirdly configured, it's like they were chosen by a randomizer, even going as far as using "k" as the grenade button. Yea, "k". Rebind them first chance you get, trust me. It makes it more enjoyable, when you know you're able to actually do things.\n\nThat all being said, let's look at the issues mentioned earlier. First issue, is sadly, the platforming. Not all of it, most of it is pretty solid. The ropes more specifically, are what we're looking at here. Oh god, the ropes. I have died so many times because Lara refused to grab onto the rope I jumped at. Sometimes they work, other times they just don't feel like it and you'll phase through them. Doesn't help the game uses a checkpoint based save system, so if you go through a bunch of stuff, and then fail at a rope, you'll have to do it all again. The checkpoints are fairly generous though, so it's not that big of a deal. Personally, it only affected me once or twice, but man, having to redo the same part over and over, just because Lara refuses to use the rope, is infuriating.\n\nNext up is the camera. Being that this a 3D platforming game, there's bound to be issues with the camera. It's just a rule, seemingly. You control the camera with your mouse, and for the most part, that works just fine believe it or not. It's quite responsive and you can look at what you want. Unfortunately, sometimes the camera just decides to turn 180 on you, and if you don't notice then whoops, down that platform you go.\nOn the bright side, the game does have an auto-grab feature with ledges, where you for the most part will catch on, so it won't kill you... Much... Just annoy you a little.\n\nThirdly is the aforementioned motorcycle stages. Oh boy, where do I begin with these? These parts are so, so boring. The terrain is basically the same bits that just keeps looping for seemingly forever (most noticable in the second one) and they just keep going and going. Sometimes, once you reach certain "key points", something new will appear and you'll think "oh thank you, is it finally over?" But alas, no, it keeps going after it for a while too. You'll also be fighting a bunch of badguys on motorcycles of their own here, but you just spam your gun at them till they flail all over the ground and leave you be.\nReally, these stages really dragged down the overall enjoyment of the game for me, just because they were so boring, repetitive, and just kept on going and going. Worst part about them, they're really stingy about checkpoints, so if you screw up (you're bound to out of boredom) you'll have to redo it. FUN!\nThe camera also sometimes messes up here, and it's really slow at turning, so if it does, you're in trouble.\nThankfully, there's only two of them, and only one of them really drags on. The first one isn't as bad, but it's not really good either.\n\nAnd finally, the grappling hook. Yup, there's issues with this thing too. Not really too many, just one. The fact that if you, while on it, touch ANY wall, you'll instantly detach. That there, is something I do not understand, and it WILL get you killed if you think you're on it, but touch the floor (yup) and detach and keep moving forward. Goodbye life, hello spike pit.\nIn order to move up and down on it, you press up (w) and the use key (e by default). If you do this quick enough, you wont crash into the floor you just stood on, but that's really dumb that you have to do that. If you use it while swinging from stuff, it's perfectly fine.\nJust, don't touch any walls. Ever. It's very shy.\n\nThe last thing to discuss is the gunplay and combat. It's pretty bland. The AI isn't amazing; they just shoot at you, throw a grenade now and then, and maybe hide behind cover. Sometimes they move around, other times they just stare at you from the open. The way it works, is that you enter a "lock on" mode (g by default), where the game will lock you onto a target (closest target) and then you just press the trigger, or hold it down. It'll auto swap to another target if the current one dies and you hover over a new one (or if you aim too far away). It's pretty simple, pretty generic and pretty easy.\nYou can free aim if you want, but you're unable to move while doing so, for whatever reason. Good thing is though, you can move around and roll around in combat, without losing the lock on, so even tho it's pretty easy, you can still look like a badass while shooting people and rolling around all over the place. The shooting isn't the game's strongpoint, by any means.\n\nThe boss battles are also pretty straight forward.\n\nThere is hidden stuff to collect scattered around the levels, and getting to it can actually be quite fun. There's also a time trial mode, where you'll race the levels, to see how fast you can beat them. So there is replayability, if you're into those kinds of things.\n\nSo overall, it's an okay platformer, with some generic shooting in it, a couple of issues and some boring looping stages. It's still fun tho, if you like platformers. Just, don't expect to need to think too deeply over puzzles.\n\nI'd recommend it if you got the money to spare and want an overall pretty enjoyable platforming experience, with some tomb exploration, trap dodging and item gathering. Else, you probably wont be missing out on much by skipping it. There's also a story in there, but I wouldn't say it's something writing home about. I personally got it for sale and had my fun with it, so that might be a factor to consider.\n\nIt does have some nice scenic views for you to look at, so if that's something you're into, that's another plus for you.","January 23, 2014","false","8.9"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","1"

I've tried everything people have suggested - update my drivers, turn off AA, turn on Vsync, etc, but there appears to be no fix that I can find to this issue, and looking it up on google has provided no real results on how to fix it.\n\nThe platforming in the game for the most part is pretty great, and like Anniversary, it's what you're here for. The combat on the other hand is weak - it's not fun at all, but it takes up a decent portion of the game. There are also two motorcycle sections which again, are pretty weak.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty basic, there were a few that I got stuck on, but not for very long. To get the golden relics however is a much more challenging task, and if you want a difficult puzzle, then they're right up your alley.\n\nHowever, due to the issues mentioned above, I wouldn't recommend the game. Anniversary had the same issue as well, and if I were to buy it, I'm sure Underworld would also have the same issue. If you don't care about the potential for your computer to blue screen or crash, then I still would recommend Tomb Raider: Anniversary over this one, that is a much better game overall.","April 12, 2014","false","6.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Sadly the puzzles are also lacking as their are very few of them. The bosses are annoying as most of them tend to rely on strange physics though this does make them challenging, it doesn't make them fun. The story is not very interesting and you could easily skip it in the series and not miss anything. I know I'm playing the games in reverse but I don't have much of a desire to play really old graphic games with even worse gameplay. Still, worth playing if you bought the whole pack and want to see the series after loving the new Tomb Raider Game. This one, is barely worth your time.","August 13, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

TRU has better graphics and ruin design, TRA has probably better controls. The story itself has a big drawback, because it leaves a big open ending. I think what makes TRL so special are the characters. Lara very often talks to her helpers, Zip and Alister, through the earplug and every time they speak it's a lot of fun. I had a lot of laugh when they comment something ironicaly or scream when Lara makes another of her live-threatening stunts. All in all, I can definitely recommend this game to someone that wants a lot of fun and puzzles.","February 8, 2014","true","63.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Promisha/recommended/7000/","Promisha","Promisha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Promisha/","380 products in account","Like Tomb Raider: Anniversary this is one is kinda hard to recommend but I'm only doing so because I found enough enjoyment and challenge out of the game to do so.\n\nControls are FAR better than the old school Tomb Raider games and movement feels much quicker. The core game play is largely still the same however - risky platforming, a few puzzles, and the dual pistols. Combat was fairly worse in my opinion however and for a tomb raider game there is A LOT of it.\n\nThe core issues with the combat comes from a few factors:\n(1) Only one extra weapon to use than pistols, which you pick up from humans. Just use assault rifle ALL THE TIME. SMG isn't as strong or accurate and the shotguns range is pathetically short its useless in most situations.\n(2) 95% or so of the enemies are generic humans with guns. Running out of ammo for your secondary weapon is very uncommon and their AI is essentially to stand in one spot and shoot.\n(3) Uninspired boss fights. They are mostly shoot and dodge until a brief window opens up to use some gimmick such as a turret, shooting a platform, or swinging a grappling hook at a clearly pointed out object. Most of them are not hard at all and were not that fun.\n\nGraphically it isn't anything spectacular but for its age it's fairly solid. There are FAR less bugs than Anniversary but there is one pain in the butt bug you will run into a couple of times that is more or less guaranteed to happen and it will crash your game. Just a heads up to get around this: reload the game, go to settings, turn off the next gen graphics option, play past the part that crashes, then re-enable the setting.\n\nSo between the crash bug and the often repetitive combat why do I recommend it? Because I still found it interesting enough for a play through. HOWEVER one caveat to that - I generally enjoy tomb raider games. Always did growing up and for the most part still do. If you're not a tomb raider fan and you are not planning on playing the sequel to this (Tomb Raider: Underworld), chances are you won't want to get this unless its on sale for cheap.","December 5, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Almost every death (even on the hardest difficulty which I played it on) comes from these issues including the camera angle changing the effects of your directional buttons, frame-rate problems causing unresponsive face buttons and an auto-lock-on system which frequently targets off-screen, out-of-range elements. The inconsistent frame rate spoils the visuals but it generally looks pretty good, especially Miss Croft herself (my favourite outfit to play in is the ripped red evening dress), and the special smoke, water, explosion and lighting effects are terrific. Special mention for an unusual and highly welcome time trial mode which challenges you to get through each cleared level within a certain time.

Joining her on her quest for the thrill of discovery and adventure are a few of her good friends, one of them already being familiar to us.\n\nThe combat system is new and improved, although the one disappointment of this game is not being able to carry more than two different weapons at a time (Your standard pistols a secondary weapon).\n\nOn the flip side however, this adds to the realism of Lara's world as in the real world, people would be limited as to the number of weapons he or she could carry around. In addition to this, there are plenty of rewards to be had, including upgrades, lots of outfits, and other such rewards.\n\nAnother annoyance is the way the game runs (Or fails to run) sometimes, resulting in help needed if the game crashes. I am usually able to keep it up and running, although I have had problems with it running in the past.\n\nThe game is rather short and straightforward and unlike in some earlier Tomb Raider Games, you are not able to return to the exact same location after having finished it with the exception of one location.\n\nOverall, this game has a few challenges here and there, and a lot of the dialogue is witty with some of it being dramatic and a little melancholy. However, I must say, this is by far the easiest Tomb Raider Game I ever played.\n\nTry the demo and see if you like it and then if you like it, buy the full version!","January 28, 2014","true","41.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though the game isn't really that long, took me around 11 hours to beat it, it's still great to go back and try to find all the hidden stuff in the levels.\nAlso it doesn't require a powerful computer to get 60 fps. I have Intel Core2 Duo 2.2Ghz and 64MB Vram. I run this great as long as I lower some of the settings a bit. I'd recommend this game to anybody.

TRU has better graphics and ruin design, TRA has probably better controls. The story itself has a big drawback, because it leaves a big open ending. I think what makes TRL so special are the characters. Lara very often talks to her helpers, Zip and Alister, through the earplug and every time they speak it's a lot of fun. I had a lot of laugh when they comment something ironicaly or scream when Lara makes another of her live-threatening stunts. All in all, I can definitely recommend this game to someone that wants a lot of fun and puzzles.","February 8, 2014","true","63.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since when did she need anyone to hold her hand? still, at least they were assistants back at the manor rather than adventuring buddies.\n\nThe game was as much fun as every Tomb Raider game is, really. A nice little platformer with the odd fight thrown in. They tossed in a few quicktime events as well, which is sad. I always find it more fun to do the cool things yourself rather than watch a cut scene and occasionally press a button during it. The story was very predictable too. But even with predictability holding it back, it was enough to hold my attention.\n\nWhile it was fun, and quite enjoyable, I don't think it holds any replay value. The story's been told, after all. Tomb Raider, for me, has always been on the same level in my mind as Indiana Jones, though. Light, fun fluff.

The game offers a wide range of environments to explore, with each level taking place at a different country, and the game-play seems to vary depending on the level, as some level focus more on attacking enemies, while other level focus on traditional tomb raiding and action adventure. Since this entry was supposed to be the reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise, a lot of changes were made. Some are good and some are not very good. Legend is just very different from Core Design's classic Tomb Raider games overall.\nHowever, I have to warn you that this game is very, very SHORT. [Light Spoiler] It contains only 7 major levels and the Croft Manor. In fact,  I think it is the same length as Tomb Raider Chronicles or maybe even shorter. Furthermore, TR Legend only presents the first halves of the Tomb Raider Trilogy story as the second halves of the story is told in Underworld.  To make up for this, this game does contain a lot of bonus contents and secrets.\nMy advice is that if you are new to the series because of Tomb Raider (2013), and you are interested in a game with interesting story , you should play it. If not, you should probably wait for it to be on sale again.","February 7, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is easy; however can get quite boring to me as you simply lock on and then hold left click for the majority. Boss fights bring some new things to the table revolving combat, and make it less repetitive and menial. There are also some driving levels when you are on a bike, with some combat, which seemed drawn out and unnecessarily long to me. All in all, great gameplay with nothing being too miserable to progress through.\n\nControls/Camera+ Easy controls\n+ Easy combat\n- Lara sometimes just, doesn't do what you want her to\n- Occasionally frustrating camera placement\n\nThe controls and camera in Legend are quite good, much better than previous games. She is easy to control, and the combat is easy to aim. However sometimes Lara just, doesn't do what you want her to, and the camera placement can be frustrating and cause you to miss jumps, but nothing game breaking by any means.\n\nAudio/Visual+ Beautiful level design\n+ Amazing variety in levels\n+ Nice sound/music throughout\n- Some graphical glitches\n\nThe levels were beautifully done, and had an amazing amount of variety. No level looked the same and each had something cool to look it. The sound and music were nice as well, nothing being terrible, but nothing truly amazing either. There are some graphical glitches that you will come across, but nothing that will prevent you from playing or progressing.\n\nStory/Dialogue+ Amazing, engaging story\n+ Interested from beginning to end\n- Some annoying dialogue from Lara's companions\n- Short compared to other games in the series\n\nThe story in Legend is amazing; I loved every minute of it. It was well done, well thought out, and kept me interested throughout the whole story. It got a lot of reactions as well, from simple laughs to "Oh my god, that's awesome!" and "Wow, Lara is such a badass!" Some of the dialogue coming from her companions simply was not needed, and just came off as annoying. Most comments and banter between them and Lara were funny or entertaining, but other parts were just not needed.\n\nQuick Review\nOverall, Legend is an amazing addition to the Tomb Raider series. Like the many other games, it has challenging and entertaining puzzles, with incredibly fun traversal. The combat falls short occasionally, being repetitive, but the boss fights stop it from being unbearable. Legend's story is engaging and interesting, and will keep you interested throughout, but is a little on the short side compared to other games in the series.\n\nAmazing addition to a beloved game series.\nBuy it. 9/10","March 22, 2015","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/7000/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Tomb Raider: Legend has the sole honour of being a game that I've bought three times now, on three different platforms, and 100%'d three different times. I've yet to regret it.\n\nLegend remains largely unchanged from it's original incarnation on the sixth generation, a fact which contributes to just what a fantastically optimized port it is. Honestly, stunning. 1 Ghz compatible? Other developers could take notes. Ran suberbly on my 1.8 Ghz toaster of a laptop, though for obvious reason it did mean having to forgo the visual changes added as the game was ported to seventh generation consoles - which range from relatively minor lighting adjustment to complete foliage overhauls. It's menu-toggled.\n\nThere were more than a few glitches - ranging from moderately amusing (floating rocks in Nepal) to moderately annoying (Lara refusing to grab ropes, plummeting to her death as she phases through them), and the game isn't lying when it says Partial Controller Support, but on the whole the experience was seamless.\n\nTomb Raider has you control Lara Croft in her quest for some contrived MacGuffin, spurred on by some event in the past and important because they say so, damn it. It's not the most compelling plot, and lacks the spectacle or involvement you'd get from an Indiana Jones or Librarian film.\n\nThat the antagonists; Rutland, Amanda, and Takamoto, are barely given any screentime to banter with Lara before being unceremoniously killed off doesn't help. Of more note are the support characters, Alistair and Zip, and Lara herself, all of whom give wonderfully entertaining performances. In one case their brilliant spurious dialogue alone manages to elevate an otherwise okay level to one of the best in the game.\n\nVariety-wise, the levels are all incredibly distinct from one another, while the enemies are unfortunately not as much. The platforming mechanics are serviceable, and for the most part responsive, but incredibly underused; the best platforming level remains Croft Manor, a completely optional area. Likewise, the combat mechanics with the various kicks, bullet-time triggers, and grapples are all well and good, but almost completely unused in combat. It's a sad waste of potential.\n\nOf note are the bosses, that take advantage of the mechanics to some degree instead of pretending that the game is something it's not. They're not particularly memorable, but none are less than on par.\n\nIt's a short game, incredibly short - if you haven't got a head for puzzles expect a good 7 hours, otherwise expect something closer to 5. Perhaps preferable to overstaying its welcome, but completely understaying it isn't fantastic either. The one billion unlockables they've managed to fit into the game help to counteract that - from concept art to outfits (hearkens to a day when they weren't just DLC, ey?) to model viewers and cheat codes, there's plenty there to play with.\n\nBest puzzles are all saved for completely optional content - that is, grabbing the gold tokens. These legitimately involving puzzles (unless it's Nepal in which case it's hidden under some unremarkable ledge. Gorramn Nepal), which often require breaking previous puzzles, are all infinitely gratifying, and would be more so if the game didn't expect you to have a near-psychic amount of knowledge as to where they are before you even begin messing around to get to them.\n\nSeriously, don't be ashamed to look up a hintbook or something to get even a vague idea of where they are. It's ridiculous.\n\nWith all this fairly good, there's some inexcusable bad. The QTEs are bad. The "developer hints"; the frustratingly slow camera cuts to completely obvious platforming sections in completely linear levels that every sixth generation platformer had, are bad. The physics puzzles that expect you ignore how physics work - in one case assuming that a 90 pound girl like Lara can send deliriously heavy metal cubes rocketing into the sky with the help of a medieval see-saw - are bad.\n\nBut overall, Legend's saving grace is that it's extremely easy to play.\n\nEverything from the writing, to the combat to the puzzles is designed solely for you to enjoy it and have fun. If you're up for a completely undemanding fun ride, to be completed with rocketing ease and satisfaction, then Tomb Raider: Legend is a game to look into.","April 20, 2015","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since when did she need anyone to hold her hand? still, at least they were assistants back at the manor rather than adventuring buddies.\n\nThe game was as much fun as every Tomb Raider game is, really. A nice little platformer with the odd fight thrown in. They tossed in a few quicktime events as well, which is sad. I always find it more fun to do the cool things yourself rather than watch a cut scene and occasionally press a button during it. The story was very predictable too. But even with predictability holding it back, it was enough to hold my attention.\n\nWhile it was fun, and quite enjoyable, I don't think it holds any replay value. The story's been told, after all.

Gameplay is somewhat mixed. Combat and acrobatics work pretty well; whereas puzzles are often very simplistic, and boss battles are very dull and formulaic. Pretty good voice acting, though the story isn't very well written. It's also not a very long game. All in all though, I enjoyed playing it (just not as much as Tomb Raider: Anniversary).\n\n6/10","May 20, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Turns out that Legend, Anniversary and Underworld form something of a trilogy or at least Legend and Underworld form a story and Anniversary gives a little more background story.\n\nAs for Legend, I enjoyed it more than Anniversary. There is more of a focus on action and "doing stuff" rather than collecting ammo and finding secrets. The story is where it's at though, that's also a main focus in this game.\n\nGraphically, for a game that's nearly 10 years old, it's nothing to write home about, 10 years ago though, it would have been pretty nice looking. They've enhanced it for PC, turn on the "next gen" features and the game looks pretty ok, with some nice lighting, water and shadow effects, makes the game almost pretty decent to look at. There are the occasional annoying graphical glitches.\n\nSound, guns pack a punch, voice work isn't tacky but it can be pretty grating some times. The one liners from the cast are lame....sometimes you think to yourself " I KNEW they were going to say that" .\n\nGameplay, puzzles are almost too easy, so easy you don't think of the most obvious solution because you're expecting something a bit harder from the TR series. The gunplay can be quite fun if you mix it up with more than just shooting stuff. Oh also, you don't have much of a choice in weapons.\n\nOne thing that carries over to Anniversary also is the annoying "trajectory" jumping issue. You THINK you are lined up properly for a jump, there's no way you could possibly miss the target or jumping from one ledge to another, make the jump and fall to your death. Then once you attempt the same jump, all of the sudden it works. It's frustrating and annoying thinking to yourself " BUT I JUST JUMPED DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE FREAKING LEDGE!!! " Dark souls eat your heart out. Using either a keyboard and mouse or controller won't make a difference either.\n\nYou can bust through this in only 10-12 hours if you're only doing the story and not the rewards. All in all, it's a good addition to the series and I'd personally recommend playing this alongside Anniversary and Underworld seeing as the stories are related.","May 26, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

[Tomb Raider 1 - 6 Angel of Darkness] Now the Crystal Dynamic reboot's..\n\nTomb Raider Legend. My Rating: 7 / 10\nThe Reboot of 2006 where the controls are different in comparison to it's simplistic father. I heard this game is practically good though it's kind of short and linear in comparison to the previous games; However this game has a lot more things to offer; Like bonus costumes, cheats, puzzle and plenty of things more. Sadly the unlockables as there are more to gain than it is to experience during in game. I beaten both the console and PC version so it's safe to say that the PC versions need some more fixes than the Console versions [oddly enough]\n\nWhy the PC version needs fixes? 1. The texture glitches are still there so you may be able to see through the maps unintentionally, 2. I had random crashes during the game before, 3. One of the cutscenes had the objects mission so carrying invisible things can be a slight problem.\n\nRight. The gameplay is pretty good; it's not too hard to get used to unlike Angel of Darkness; The difficulties can be off the balance especially during motorcycle segments where you can take massive damage from the shotgun that can kill you 2 or 3 shots on Normal Difficulty, The machine gun damage received is fine. Though the fall damage could've had an increase because I fell in the game where it should've killed me.\n\nMusic\nThe music is great for the most part. The music fits to the Atmosphere, situation the main character is suffering under and whatever surprises coming after yourself. The sounds for the guns could have a change but eh I don't care too much since the rest is just right.\n\nResolutions and Graphics.\nUnlike the previous; the settings are very limited as to one page which has Display, Resolution [1080p], Refresh Rate [60], Contrast and Brightness up to five levels, Then you got 10 tick boxes of various options. "Next Generation Content" Enable: VSync, Shadows, Anti Aliasing, Fullscreen Effects, Depth of Field, Reflections and Water Effects. For a PC game. It's not customizable in settings as it should be; Though it shouldn't be discouraging so long as you can play the game without too much a hassle right?\n\nWould I recommend buying this game?\n1. Yes but buy it in a trilogy pack: Along with Anniversary and Underworld.\n2. Reason being is if you don't like short story games then the other two would be satisfactory.\n3. If you're one of the 100% perfectionists who seeks to get everything and be as thorough then another reason to play.\n\nEnd of Review here.","June 30, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has actual puzzles, challenging platforming (in comparison), treasure-hunting which requires you to think,  combat that's both somewhat fun and rare enough that it doesn't become a bore, and above all it stars the actual Lara Croft rather than some angst-filled crybaby. I had vague memories of playing TR: Legend at a friend's house as a child and liking it, but upon rediscovery it surpassed all my expectations. This is a good damn game.\n\nThe game does somewhat suffer from a pair of tedious vehicle sections and I found that some three or four areas were so bug-ridden as to be nearly unplayable. There's also apparently this bug that gives you a Fatal Error while starting the Kazakhstan chapter unless you turn off a bunch of stuff in the graphics menu. That I'm willing to overlook such normally unacceptable flaws only speaks to how much fun I had with this game. At the point of this writing, the game is only 2 eurodollars in the Steam Store for a solid 8-14 hours of fun.

Do I regret it? No. So I overall enjoyed it. Am I going to play it ever again? Probably not.\n\nMy first tomb raider game I completed was Anniversary. I found Legend to be more enjoyable as there was a little more variety in Legend. Though Anniversary is a remake of the original, so I don't know what was meant to be similar to the original, as I never played it.\n\nPROS\n\n+for a 2006 game, graphics are good. However, (negative point here) the next generation content option, which enhances the graphics and makes it prettier, has glitches and causes game to crash on certain levels and/or certain times, so enabling and disabling after every level is annoying. I've tried googling solutions to this but to no avail.\n\n+combat is better than Anniversary. This game has more frequently fighting human enemies, and you get different guns more quickly. You also can perform cool flips off of enemies and then shoot in mid-air or kick them\n\n+more story than Anniversary, with more cutscenes and also having dialogue with characters on your headset as opposed to Anniversary you are all alone and almost felt like an arcade game (one level after the next).\n\n+very good soundtrack\n\n\n\n+compared to Anniversary, you're not entirely in ancient ruins for levels\n\n+wasn't stuck very often compared to Anniversary, so this is an easier game, at least for me.\n\n+get to ride a motorcycle on a couple levels (but controls are a little clunky)\n\nCONS\n\n-even though it's a 2006 game, the combat with guns is somewhat silly as you can't hide behind cover, so when facing group of guys with guns you are just flipping and rolling around to try and evade gun fire. The accuracy of your guns aren't good, so to make that work enemies pretty much stand in one spot. and they have quite a bit of health so you are spraying your assault rifle or mashing the firing button when using dual pistols.\n\n-some minor clunkiness/glitches with the movement (e.g. wanting to grab a ledge but ended up repeatedly jumping to it but not grabbing it, so it wasn't as smooth; somehow fell between a wooden bridge and should've fallen to my death but ended up on top of the bridge, safe). However, i'd say I died less from missed jumps than I did in Anniversary.\n\n-short game, my actual game time recorded in the main menu is over 7 hours.\n\nOverall, for a 2006 game: 9/10","December 20, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lara Croft is revisiting some darker mysteries in her past pertaining to her mother, journeys that will take her from sweltering jungles to frigid Himalayan peaks. Rude dudes are after you, as per the usual in action games, and Lara has to deal with them in varying capacities. The fights are challenging, but not overly frustrating. As you peruse the worlds, you can also happen upon collectibles.\n\nWhat I like most about the collectibles in this game is that there are levels to them. The gold and silver collectibles are harder to find than your usual bronze ones, but if you find all of the different kinds in a level, you can unlock outfits and cinematics. The replay value for the unlockables alone is quite high, but if you're here for the story, then you are in for a good one.\n\nLara is after something that she thinks points to her mother's disappearance long ago, but bad evil goons are after it too. Sure, this is standard TR affairs, but the story actually gives us a far more human Lara than the one of previous games and her grief over her mother is tangible. I like the action sequences because you are not confined to running, jumping, and the occasional grapple. You have zip-lines, grenades, and sure, you have your basic twin pistols plus a weapon that takes special ammo (one of those), but that's half the fun! Mastering what you have on hand really just adds to the thrill of Lara's adventure.\n\nAs far as outfits go, there are quite a few to unlock and most are relatively practical. There are defaults for each level that you can't change the first time you play through them (like that awful evening gown without shorts under it that Lara prances around in), and again, half the battle is unlocking different top colors and stuff. Croft Manor is explorable, which is nice for practicing difficult moves and or wrapping your head around different button mappings (there are a few in this one).\n\nNow for the bad part of this game... it is an older game, which means all of us people who have just built PCs and or upgraded to Windows 10 have to tinker around with the game to get it to work. Keep Next Gen Effects off (it's just some extra hair and skin stuff anyhow) if you want the game to run without crashing (King Arthur will always crash for you if you don't). If you like a challenge, go for it, just be prepared for some wonkiness until you sort things out. I recommend this game, old quirks and all, because it is a fun classic every fan of Tomb Raider should pick up.","January 2","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great story and good graphics (even if dated). Interesting variety of environments; levels and puzzles are rather simple and linear though so exploring doesn't feel as adventuresome as previous Tomb Raiders, but the pace is good and the fun never wanes. The inventory system and pickups have been simplified almost to the point of nonexistance, but the new shoulderlamp, grapplehook, and binoculars are welcome new equipment. Weapons are similarly minimized, as is combat in general, but the few action sequences (coupled with Lara's new moves) are satisfying. Keyboard controls are clunky I recommend a controller.

Lara is fun to listen / watch / play, her manner of handling situations with a high optimism and adaptability makes you root for her. I got attached to her personality in an instant, I felt like she was an amazing character and her reboot was heading in the right way.\nThe game may be reminiscent of the classics in the 'travel around the globe to find artifacts' style like the previous ones were and it may make you want to collect all rewards to get the bonuses. So it has a replay value and potential to become a favorite.\nI will mention that some parts of it have low amounts of effort like - shoot the mercs and complete levels in a short time on time trials. That is where Legend fails and becomes a victim of repeatability.\nThe good parts will always overshadow the weak though!\nThe various environments are a plus - from Bolivia all the way to Japan and Ghana and even Tibet , this game has them all.\nI cannot recommend this enough, it might be short but it's a great addition to the franchise.","February 11","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But then, I'm not sure that's an improvement over the tedious control method of navigating through the tricky death-defying stunt scenes in the preceding TR titles. Unless the proper buttons were pushed in precisely the right order and in precise timing, and facing the precise direction, you die. And die. And die. And die. I'm not enough of a misogynist to enjoy seeing Lara blown-up, shot, impaled, burned, mauled, eaten, or fall screaming to her doom again and again. And again. And again. Its rather troubling.

Great story and good graphics (even if dated). Interesting variety of environments; levels and puzzles are rather simple and linear though so exploring doesn't feel as adventuresome as previous Tomb Raiders, but the pace is good and the fun never wanes. The inventory system and pickups have been simplified almost to the point of nonexistance, but the new shoulderlamp, grapplehook, and binoculars are welcome new equipment. Weapons are similarly minimized, as is combat in general, but the few action sequences (coupled with Lara's new moves) are satisfying. Keyboard controls are clunky I recommend a controller.

It's a bit short but it's not expensive. Plays nice with an Xbox360 controller. I recommend turing off the "Next Gen" features. If you look in the discussion threads, you can find a patch but even then, it's too glitchy.\n\nBrace yourself for inconsistent collisions. You can shoot through some fences, but not other, identical fences. The shooting was never Tomb Raider's strong point but for a 2006 game, it feels a little like a Dreamcast game like Dynamite Cop. That's not necessarity a bad thing.\n\nThe story is pretty lousy. I kind of zoned out, to be honest. There are some quicktime action sequences which are rather pointless. There are serious bugs all over the place so you may have to refer to a walkthrough here and there.\n\nBut even with all it's flaws, if feel just a little bit like Tomb Raider 2 and that's enough for me to recommend it.\n\n","November 21, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lara is fun to listen / watch / play, her manner of handling situations with a high optimism and adaptability makes you root for her. I got attached to her personality in an instant, I felt like she was an amazing character and her reboot was heading in the right way.\nThe game may be reminiscent of the classics in the 'travel around the globe to find artifacts' style like the previous ones were and it may make you want to collect all rewards to get the bonuses. So it has a replay value and potential to become a favorite.\nI will mention that some parts of it have low amounts of effort like - shoot the mercs and complete levels in a short time on time trials. That is where Legend fails and becomes a victim of repeatability.\nThe good parts will always overshadow the weak though!\nThe various environments are a plus - from Bolivia all the way to Japan and Ghana and even Tibet , this game has them all.\nI cannot recommend this enough, it might be short but it's a great addition to the franchise.","February 11","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
