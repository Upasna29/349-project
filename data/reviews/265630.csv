It feautres a unique game style which rewards people on their notoriety which involves being able to be diverse in killing even using less powerful guns, killing people in different ways, getting kill streaks, ending kill streaks and shooting hats off people. Hence the player with the most kills may not be in fact the winner. Anywhere up to 40 people can be in a match which is usually utter mayhem.\n\nUnlike other shooters which require running and gunning, this one dictates that you stand still and aim properly so that your rewarded with greater accuracy. It also authenticates the guns of the old, by making them weak, slow and rather heavy slowing down your speed.\n\nUndoubtedly you will experience novel moments in the game like when I ran out into the street with no ammo just to realise that someone had my head in their sights, just as they were to pull the trigger a train runs over them. Talking about the trains its fun trying to hijack them, or confiscate a toilet demanding privacy, or play a concerto to a audience of axe weilding madmen. Probably the thing that had me most in hysterics is to crawl up to the back of a horse and shoot it in the backside. I won't ruin the surprise, but let's just say that the developers have all class.\n\nThere is now a competitive league for this game that showcases professionals at work. Having said that everytime i personally log into the game it feels like i'm up against these professionals. Take for instance when my team logged in to go against a few hispanic children. It was like the battle of Normandy but with sniper rifles. The game could hardly keep up with the amount of times it needed to respawn my team. The hispanic children were gunning us down every four seconds and if that wasn't bad enough, they were also using voice chat taunting us in several languages to show how versatile they are. These children were so professional I have no doubt that they were even multi-tasking while killing us, like stroking their cat on their lap between shots.\n\nHence I have a love/hate relationship with this game. The bots are often ridiculous in their difficulty and I never see a way to make them more docile so that I can learn the mechanics. The kicking system will have sniper players raging, there is no map in the game which prevents close combat forcing skillful sniping, two kicks from a player and your dead. Its easy for your character to get snagged in doorways and on furniture. Having said all that the beefs I have with the game are trivial if you are to play this game with friends. There is much to be enjoyed here and it's completely free.\n\nThe main developer has hinted that there are new player models and animations soon to be introduced in the not so distant future. There has also been a large amount of chatter in regards to steam workshop compatibility, steam inventory drop items and a co-operative mode against a constant wave of enemies. It's the developers dedication to his product and his listening ear to his fans that makes this completely free to play game worthy of a slot in your library.\n\nWith that in mind don't forget to crawl up to the back of a horse and shoot it!\n","August 26, 2015","true","18.4"," 350 of 382 people (92%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","92","350","382","61","1"

Based on the HL2 engine it generates some nice graphics like fog, water and clouds. The 6 base maps are mostly good playable. Sometimes you fall in somekind of idle mode and can fly around the map for more examinations. The player models are much simple. You have a choice of several weapons including an Indian bow and some dynamite - oh yeah! There are some gamemodes where you join the different factions Banditos, Desperados or Rangers.\n\nYou can also setup your own listen or dedicated server so that nobody bothers you. The achievements are quite simple to do with a friend together. Usually the bots are very nervewracking and strafe away from your shots. The hardest was Robin Hood (headshots with the bow from a certain distance). There's also one a grinding one: Legend - Play 500 matches. Imagine for all other achievements I just needed about 20 matches and under 10 hours of playtime. So it turns out this is an artificial gametime extender ...

Also highly replayable: if you master the gunplay and learn the maps, you can be performing some pretty cool tricks.\n\nPersonally I've found the gunplay complements different paces of games (so it's actually quite varied!). So on servers with say 3-7 players, it's more about mastering the shooting and general gameplay...\n\nWhereas on servers with higher numbers of players, it becomes a simply hilarious Wild West shootout with echoes of "Pass the whiskey!" bounding about, and plenty of genuine "WTF!?" moments (e.g. you shoot guy in face, another guy shoots you in face, other guy shoots guy who shot you in the face etc...  or in my case random encounters in bar areas with loud piano music playing...).\n\nThe FoF community is evidently still growing, but so far for me there's always been a good bunch of dedicated people online. And, as said, it's growing - so expect more people as the weeks pass ;)\n\nThe Good:\n+ It's fun!! :D\n+ It's free!! (No microtransactions or anything.. just a fun, free game!)\n+ Surprisingly solid gunplay given it's light-hearted exterior. Plays like a Source shooter, but you have to take a different approach to reloading, shooting and gun selection (well, they are WIld West guns of course!) in particular.\n+ Again, surprisingly well-designed maps / spawn points in my opinion. Learn them well, and you'll master the game no doubt!\n+ ..And a reputable amount of content (good number of (varied layout) maps).\n+ Best whiskey drinking simulator to date!\n\nThe Bad:\n- Erm.. I suppose some people might not like the gunplay.. they might consider it too 'slow' or possibly even aggravating at first. But play on a little more and you'll be getting positive K/D's!\n- Not really too much else.. It's fun and it's free. Don't like it - uninstall it! :)\n- I suppose we must wait on the devs for more awesome content (already got a Halloween update)!\n\nBottom line is this is a neat, well-executed Source arena shooter. Has good replayability because of its own twist on shooting mechanics, and the light-hearted (and almost black comedy like!) gameplay helps brighten up the game and make it really fun and interesting to play!\n\nIt's great also to see no microtransactions despite it being Free to Play. As said above - just a fun, free shooter. And ultimately - if you don't like it - then no money wasted!\n\nOh, and..

There's no old veteran bias (not saying that's a bad thing) going in this review, just a brand new player who jumped into the game knowing next to nothing about it. And what did I immediately think after playing a couple matches?\n\nUn-effin-believable.\n\nI've been wanting an awesome western multiplayer game for years after being teased with Red Dead Redemption's... so-so multiplayer experience, and this scratches that itch so freaking well. It's a little tough getting the hang of immediately, but a few matches in you'll start getting a feel for a gun or two, seeing how they recoil, how the crosshairs bloom with movement, etc. This isn't your modern shooter where just about every gun is accurate to a fault, this is the wild west where you're gonna have to get used to iron sights, heavy recoil, and frantic revolver duels that make this game the beautiful thing that it is.\n\nPros:\n-Flawless gunplay\n-Balanced weaponry\n-Dual wield almost anything\n-Excellent maps\n-Pass the whiskey\n\nCons:\n-Few maps\n-Few game modes\n-Relatively few gun options\n\nFortunately, all those cons should be going away in time. Fistful of Frags was a MUCH bigger game with much more content than what's on Steam currently, but porting the game over to a new SDK made the developer start from the ground up, rework the mechanics, and make sure the game is as polished as possible before he starts adding more content back in. Lemme tell you, the effort shows.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is FREE, and it's just a great, old-school multiplayer shooter that everyone should try. If you're a western fan, you'll love the crap out of this. If you're not? You'll probably still love the crap out of this.","May 14, 2014","true","28.1"," 49 of 55 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","49","55","0","4"

If, hypothetically, R_Yell, Rebel Yell, did indeed make a mistake in banning the guy, then public slander is not the medium to make dissent with him. Such considered, I would encourage people to down-vote that review, mark it "funny", and report it to Steam. It's a joke & slander. This is an awesome mod. And here's why:\nI've posted this linked perspective from Fistful of Frags Competitive League (FoFCL), http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FOFCL#announcements/detail/807635936125527476 in response to Rebel Yell's http://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791435254142/announcements/detail/920225927279060986, on that review in question, and mine, along with perhaps a dozen other comments from people whom I've never seen before have been deleted & blocked from further comment. All said comments were disagreeing with the aforementioned reviewer in question, in support of Rebel Yell—essentially the sole developer of Fistful of Frags. Such begs the question: why would they be deleted? It has become quite apparent that the aforementioned reviewer in question, with egocentric malice, is attempting to build negative comments in order to >>kill<< the game. Subsequently, we, the Fistful of Frags community, have likely lost already hundreds of potential players, if not over a thousand, based upon the likes for that slanderous negative review alone. https://youtu.be/mmaMINen96w http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=606407726\nEDIT, 29.03.2016: Let me clarify that I meant "uninformed misconceptions of scientific fact" when I initially wrote above in this review, now below & clarified, "science". Personal vendetta, anger, ideological misconception, ignorance, & political bias have no place in serious academia, debate, nor any serious conversation or accusation, and should never been given any respect or credence by any serious person. It's alright to have fun, be light, whatever, but serious accusations should be taken seriously, and if they're horse ♥♥♥♥, for lack of a better term, then they should be ignored or addressed as just that.  Truthful criticism is not the same as slander. Any good disagreement should be where both parties involved (not political parties, people) are eye-to-eye on objective facts & reason. As I like to say, let the facts dictate opinions, and not the opinions dictate which facts are convenient or correct, not let the opinions dictate facts, for any opinion not based upon reality, upon objective facts & reason, is a bad opinion, and may aswell not exist at all. "Waa, unprofessional", one might argue? I would suggest that people go to Yelp and see how professional business owners, of small & large companies, even corporations, respond to unjust negativity.\n\nMany great videogames originated as mods. Insurgency (Source to Source), Counter-Strike (Quake [GoldSrc, Source gold], & Source), Team Fortress (Quake [GoldSrc, Source gold], & Source), Left 4 Dead (Source), Half-Life (Quake [GoldSrc, Source gold], & Source [see Black Mesa]), DotA 2, from DotA 1 (Warcraft III & WCIII: TFT to Source 2), Mer Nostrum (Red Orchestra on Quake), Darkest Hour (Red Orchestra on Quake), In-Country: Vietnam (not Rising Storm 2, separate game, from Red Orchestra on Quake), Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, from Age of Chivalry (Source to Quake), and the list goes on & on. This is the most polished PvP Western FPS on the entire videogame market. And it's free for you to play.\n\n\nPS, I might add: R_Yell is hardly a newb at his own game, and the screenshot provided should negate all namecalling & slander in that aforementioned negative review—one of which was that he "was playing poorly". Checkout this screenshot of R_Yell, and then try to argue that he's a newb: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=493922086 Thank you. :-) Pass the Whiskey.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/WiZKiD28/screenshot/287477208227636023\n\nResigned FoFCL Open, League ADMIN: Reverse Gaming (ЯG) Season2 2nd Place 8-2 w/ only hours in-game as Guantánamo Baywatch; ЯG Season3 2nd Place 7-2 as Menopause the Pokémon & Ornge is th Nw Blck Pwr Rngr & More Cash Than You; ЯG Season4 1st Place 6-2 as Smoking Girl Scout Cookies\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/WiZKiD28/screenshot/287477208227594307 http://steamcommunity.com/id/WiZKiD28/screenshot/287477208227594037","January 22","true","206.6"," 161 of 231 people (70%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","70","161","231","28","81"

Boy would you be wrong. Yes it’s true, the graphics are simple and the maps are relatively un-detailed. But what it lacks in visuals it makes up in gameplay. The map layout is phenomenal, with most maps having several different layers and ways to maneuver about the map.\n\nAlso what stands out is the different gameplay mechanics. Rather than the all too common, 'Run-n-Gun' gameplay you see with most common shooter, FoF has a gameplay style centered around accurate aiming. There is no fast pace running and you will need to be very heavy on the 'shift' key so you can walk slowly and place your shots accurately. If 'spray-n-pray' is more your style, you can press the left mouse button (usually dedicated for aiming) and be able to dispatch shots mush more quickly with huge detriment to accuracy and movement. You can even pick up two handguns of any kind and dual-wield them! How neat is that?!\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the choice of weapons. You won’t find any high-capacity assault rifles in this game. Nope, the base weapons consist of revolvers, single shot rifles, shotguns, blunt weapons for melee attacks, dynamite, and even a bow and arrow. There are also tiered weapon crates placed around the maps allowing for an upgrade to your weapons if you need a little extra firepower. Most weapons in this game are off balance, meaning that some are far more powerful than others. This factor is balanced out by the amount of score you receive from using each weapon, referred to as "notoriety". Weaker, more skill-dependent weapons issue more notoriety per-kill and more powerful easy to use weapons warrant less notoriety per-kill.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game. It’s really is no-nonsense. There’s no ranking system, no unlocks, no score streaks, no in game cash or rewards, no DLC, no micro transactions. And best of all, it’s free! Just pure and simple western shootout. This game is brutal, and does not cater to the 'Noobs' out there. If you don't have experience, you will be slaughtered. But after a little practice, you can become one of the most lethal gunslingers in all of the Wild West and enjoy several days’ worth of awesome gameplay.\n\nWould definitely recommend!\n10/10 "Pass the Whiskey"","January 3","true","88.1"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","48","55","5","2"

Divide the spices evenly between 2 mixing bowls. Add the flour to 1 of the bowls, mix well, and set aside.\n\nRub the chicken drumsticks with the reserved spice mix. Poke all of the pieces with a fork a few times to let the flavors seep down into the meat. Set aside.\n\nPour the buttermilk over the chicken, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Cook's Note: You can also let the chicken marinate longer, even overnight.\n\nAdd the flour mixture to a large re-sealable plastic bag. Remove the chicken pieces from the buttermilk and in batches, drop them into the bag, shaking them to make sure they become heavily coated.\n\nIn a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 360 degrees F. (If you don't have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.)\n\nDrop the coated chicken drumsticks into the hot oil. Turn the pieces as they brown and do not let them touch each other while frying. Work in batches, if necessary check the underside of a piece by lifting it with tongs. It should be a deep golden brown. Cook the chicken until the pieces are crispy and brown, about 15 minutes, turning occasionally.\n\nTo test for doneness: Cut into the thickest part of a drumstick. The juices should run clear and the meat should be opaque throughout. If necessary, pop the chicken into a preheated 325 degree F oven, until they are fully cooked.\n\nTransfer the fried chicken to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain the excess oil.\n\nTransfer the drumsticks onto a serving platter, or put into a bucket. Serve the chicken hot, room temperature, or cold.","January 29, 2015","true","4.8"," 81 of 115 people (70%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","70","81","115","88","15"

The chaos that is a team shootout can be a lot of fun, or if you prefer to solo it in a free for all you can have that as well. Team play involves picking one of 4 choosable teams, the rangers, banditos, vigilantes, and desperados. Once the match starts bodys start flying. Overall the game has a good amount of weapon choices but few maps and mechanics however simplicity is not a bad thing, especially for a free game.

It focuses on it's unique gunplay and a whiskey-laden health system. It's movement speed is much slower than your average modern shooter, with certain weapons slowing your speed to a crawl, and others (mostly melee weapons) increase it to a brisk walk at most.\n\n\nMy first observation is the weapons, the game is loadout-based, although most of the best weapons are available in respawning chests found around the maps, these weapons are less than perfectly balanced, although the more powerful weapons provide less points on kill, which more than makes up for it, in my humble opinion. My main problem with the weapons is the lack of diversity, there is a few weapon archtypes (shotguns, rifles, etc.) and plenty of weapons in these archtypes, but they don't differentiate themselves enough apart from simple firepower, although the different items help to diversify your loadout.\n\nThe health system is a hoot and a holler, lost health is regained by drinking whiskey, but drinking too much whiskey gets you drunk, making your vision blurry and affecting your accuracy. This forces you to choose between being sturdy enough to survive your next fight, and accurate enough to kill your opponents at long range. It's an interesting twist on the healthkit formula.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is the player count versus the map size and spawn points. The maps aren't nearly big enough for the amount of players you commonly find on servers, so people spawn behind people, you get flanked far too often and by far too many people. Smaller groups make the game far more enjoyable, as the spawns are much better when they aren't completely overflowed.\n\n\nProsInteresting health system\nPoint system is interesting and somewhat helps to balance the weapons\nInteresting and not often explored setting\nUnique loadout items and sidearms\n\nConsSpawn points and map size are not made for the average server size\nMain weapons aren't diverse apart from set archtypes\nGraphics are nothing to write home about\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall, it's unique, fun, and not like any other games you'll find. I'd reccomend you play with a small group, preferably friends. The game's not for the Quake or Call of Duty fan, Counter-Strike players should feel right at home, though.\n\nRating (Out of 10):\n7/10\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","May 17","true","5.8"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

You can also pick up bigger and better weapons, such as long-range rifles and bolt-action shotguns. Your secondary weapons come in a range of varying levels of usefulness depending on what you want to achieve.

The late 1800s was a very notable time period for the firearm, being the border of which how firearms were designed and functioned. That giant jump from flintlock rifles to revolvers to machine guns. (I'd love to see a Maxim gun in this, despite how horribly OP that sounds.)\n* This game is VERY immersive, allowing yourself to play out several of those old-western scenarios we all know and love with your imagination.

Why?  Yeehaw.\n\nHere's what this game is, pardner: A mod of the Source Engine that plays out as a medium-paced, close-range arena shooter.  You create a loadout of Wild West-style weaponry and go into battle with a pack of curly wolves not unlike your-rough-cut-self.  The primary combat mode is free-for-all: Indeed, the close-range combat and synchopated flow of action work well with its "battle royale" style.\n\nPony up.\n\nThe game's overall feel is not unlike Quake, with lots of hitscan twitch-aiming and weapon-swapping.  By the time you've made a frag or two, you've gone through your whole loadout twice--and that's great.  Every choice matters and there is no single option that beats the bunch.  The game encourages smart ambushes, with split-second decision-making to augment the coordination needed to score kills.  It's a game of big set-ups, big pay-offs, and big losses.  The winnin'-est cowboy knows when to play to the gallery, and when to skedaddle, to avoid lookin' the blowhard.\n\nDon't put a spoke in the wheel like a thoroughbred just yet, though.  Not everything is in apple pie order, nor is it as fine as cream gravy, buttered grits, or roast Arbuckle's.  Bend an elbow, and read the goods 'ccordin' to Hoyle:\n\nThe gameplay featured in Fistful of Frags can be as repetetive as it is fun.  It's simple, enjoyable, exciting, and--paradoxically--mesmerizingly dull after you've played each map for an hour or two.  A few friends can help liven the game up, for sure.  Being as stool-trippin'-ly roosted as the posse in-game can do wonders too.  You high-falutin' nancy.\n\nShut yer damn bazoo.\n\nDon't take this flannel mouth's gab for nothin', though, lessin' you try the game yerself.  When you're feelin' like a bona fide coffee boiler, saddle up to a server on Fistful of Frags and send some sorry shave-tails to the ol' bone orchard.  Shoot or give up the gun already, Lukey-boy ye damn varmit!  Also, fasten on your best bib and tucker, before you have a hog-killin'-esque alright time of it.

Here are some of my achievements:\n\n- Topping a lobby using only Brass Knuckles, Throwing Knives, Boots, and Handgun Throw\n- Topping many lobbies with Dual Deringers (pre-nerf), Brass Knuckles, and Handgun Throw\n- Throwing said Deringers across a map and getting a few kills with them (you can throw handguns about 3 times farther than Halo grenades... seriously)\n- Going on an 18 Kill-streak with the Sharps Rifle\n- Beating up 5 people with Fists and Boots when I threw my gun out of reach on accident\n- Getting a headshot through another person from across the map and killing both of them in one shot (with the smith rifle). I SWEAR I aimed this one... Lemme tell you what happened. I pulled up to one of the guys' heads and fired just as another guy walked past him going the opposite direction. Perhaps the second guy was only half-way on purpose, but it's still cool ok so leave me alone. ;c\n- Sadly, the most I've achieved from one Dynamite is only a quad, but whatever\n- Kicking COUNTLESS people off cliffs and laughing, and knocking people off cliffs using dynamite blasts and... laughing\n- And the greatest honor any player can have... PEOPLE HAVE ACCUSED ME OF CHEATING WITHOUT ME ACTUALLY DOING IT!!! :D\n\nThis game has HOURS of fun in it and it's seriously worth a shot. The only downside I can think of is the developers. He wrote this long sappy post in the game's news about how developing it wasn't fun anymore and he was discontinuing development, and then he went and messed up the balance of the game (and took out a lot of the fun), making questionable and awkward changes to the layout of some of the maps, and even the nerfing the loadout system itself. This is not to hate on him, but seriously, you tamed a very wild game with these updates. The game was PERFECT after the remastering of the Creek map. There needs to be a version of that game still out there because it was way more wild, fun, and crazy. I have no problem with updates and changes, but you said you would not be developing the game anymore, so it gave me a false sense of security, and that's not cool. Maybe somewhere you said you were continuing again but I recall you saying you might be adding community maps to the official rotation and making "a few tweaks" and that was about it. Sorry, I'm rambling on... JUST DOWNLOAD THE GAME AND JOIN US!\n\nEDIT: I had a run-in with who I think is the lead developer (I forget if he is the only/main dev or not, but if he is, that's...troubling), and he is seriously very rude. I criticized his updates and he whined about me bullying him when I clearly said I wasn't attacking him. You might notice that he also ends up ignoring everyone else who shares opinions with me. He strikes me as immature as he can't seem to take criticizm from anyone, really. He takes it as an attack and, frankly, I think that's childish. You can find the thread here, and I come in on page 4: http://steamcommunity.com/app/265630/discussions/1/357284767248316370/?ctp=4\n\nAnd to the developer, please don't come whining about how I'm "tarnishing your reputation" or committing slander. I don't dislike you or think you're a bad person, I just think that if you're going to continue releasing work publicly, you need to learn to interact with your fans or customers (if the next thing you release is paid) without being snide, arrogant, rude, and nonchalant about any opinion that differs from your own. Also, I hear that you like to change or delete posts, but it's okay because I have screenshots. I think you need someone in charge of PR, and that's not me trying to be a smart-alec, that's legit advice. I still gave the game a positive review because the game is great, but I don't support you personally. Despite that, I still wish you luck in your future projects and I hope you get better at talking to people who make suggestions about your work.

The only fault I have really seen in this game is the damage scaling. Sometimes you feel like you should have landed a hit and it just... doesn't. You could be right behind someone and not be moving and shoot them and it just misses somehow. You can also get killed by a single pistol shot to the knee across the map sometimes. It's just weird.

The wild west setting allows the game to be pretty unique compared to other shooters, guns take forever to reload and accuracy suffers often as a result of older cartridge/ weapon types. There are also some more interesting mechanics like handgun throwing, kicking, and dual wielding. Dual Wielding is something that I found really interesting in Fistful of Frags, it’s a risk vs reward type of choice as both guns will take forever to reload, as well as you lose the ability to “fan” (or shoot rapidly and inaccurately) with just one gun. The gun selection is fantastic, having a plethora of revolvers, long range Sharps Rifles, Coach Guns, Bow and Arrows, Dynamite, etc. Healing is interesting as well, there’s no regenerating health so you are non-stop chugging whiskey which heals you but causes your vision to be blurred and controls to be slurred.\n\nEven though I only started playing this game in the past few years I feel a strange sense of nostalgia while playing it. It may have something to do with the fact that the game is often just simple team deathmatch without anything extraneous attached, or the lack of aiming down the sight (for most guns), or the fact that stronger weapons are re-spawning pickups found throughout the level. There is generic FFA, Team Deathmatch, and an interesting Break Bad mode where you try and trick armed players into firing on you as an unarmed character, or try to ferry packages to locations for money which is then spent on better guns. There’s a decent amount of maps and players for this game and it’s always a satisfying experience if you're looking for some mindless fun.\n\nI highly recommend trying this out if you’re a fan of Wild West shooters, it's probably the best one out on steam right now. It’s free to play, but if it had been something sold on the steam storefront, I’d be willing to shell out money for this hectic but fun wild west experience.","May 4","true","12.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

You shoot people and then try to reload and get destroyed. So, instead of reloading, pick up the shooty shooty device of some loser you just shot in the dong. When you spawn, you can choose a variety of things to start out with, including: A shooty shooty device, (or a bow or an axe but whatever) a secondary thingy (2 sticks o' dynamite, 3 knives, or the ability to throw your gun) and a perk. The perks are either: You wear some boots to kick someone in the privates harder, brass knuckles to punch people in the face a lot of times, or you become a gentlemen. The gentleman perk is the (obviously) the best one, because you must fight like a gentleman! Shoot someone face-to-face, have a fistfight, or other gentlemanly things to get extra notority! (points) If a person shoots at you, but misses like a total scrub, you get the "Self-defence", a purple mark, which gives you extra notoriety points if you shoot them! (yoyoyo danke to gromekk for reminding me of this) If a person shoots you, and hits you, you get "Revenge", a red mark, that gives even more notoriety points if you shoot them. (thanksagain) But, if you aren't gentlemanly and either: Shoot someone in the back like a coward, or use cowardly weapons to kill people such as knives and dynamite, you lose notoriety points. So, after this wall of text, I can say that I enjoy the game and is worth all of your 0 dollars.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lobinbe/recommended/265630/","Lobinbe","Lob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lobinbe/","301 products in account","First thing I will say is this: Fistful of Frags is, at least conventionally speaking, a bad game (or mod depending on your viewpoint). The presentation is dated and crude, the combat too often boils down to "who shoots first wins", the game is naturally laggy, the weapon balance *statisically* is pretty broken, and the game is filled with questionable design decisions such as range-based damage on pistols, which disencourages players to become better at aiming with pistols at medium to long range and encourages them to camp with one-shot sniper rifles. Also, the notion of a game with this many random elements (such as rng in weapon accuracy, random chances to disarm opponments upon punching them and random player spawns in general) being "competitive" is quite laughable.\n\nSo what makes Fistful of Frags one of the best multiplayer shooters on steam? First and foremost would be the unique "notoriety" scoring system. In summary, you earn more notoriety points by getting kills with more underpowered weapons, and further bonuses for shooting off peoples' hats and racking up killstreaks. This system coupled with the varied loadouts allows for a ton of different playstyles and gives players the opportunity to win using even statistically underpowered loadouts which will get them put in unwinnable situations often. You can be a long-range rifleman, an aggressive ambusher with dual-colt navys in hand or even that annoying prick who runs around spamming dynamite and hatchets. All of the loadouts and playstyles are made viable with the brilliant scoring system, and it is basically what makes FoF playable and enjoyable.\n\nThere are other strong points as well: the gunplay for the most part feels satisfying and the game is full of moments which make you feel like a badass because a lot of effort was evidently put into the weapon animations and sound design, the fact that you can also "fan" pistol shots makes for a great alternate mode of fire and is something that is surprisingly scarce in "wild west" shooters. The stronger weapons are locked in chests scattered around the map which require you to reduce your mobility and hold the use key to open the chest and get what's inside, which adds a lot of tactical depth to the game and prevents players from getting too overpowered too quickly. The maps are also varied and greatly-designed for deathmatching with different interlocking paths, smart "health pack" placement (health packs being in the form of the iconic whiskey) and have areas suitable for all playstyles, with the exception of a few questionable design decisions once again. There is an emphasis on melee combat as well as shootouts, which makes things feel fresh. You are able to utilise punches, kicks which knockback and stun your enemy and even the aforementioned annoying hatchets in a pinch.\n\nIn the end you could say FoF is the good, the bad and the ugly all in one. If you can get past the blatant and jarring lack of polish, questionable weapon balance and sometimes infuriating amounts of rng, you'll find a good deathmatching shooter that is hard to not recommend to fans of first person shooters.\n\nIt might just be that I have a soft spot for fps games which let me kick people.","June 21, 2015","true","117.3"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","23","36","9","13"

Here's why.\n\nAnyone remember the massive storm that the original Quake shook up (dat pun dou)? Well, this game is remenicent of that, but in the modern age. Fistful of Frags is an amazing mod of the Source engine, and is one of the best I've seen, rating it far above Team Fortress. It already has it's own meme, "Pass the whiskey", which goes to prove that it is already among the best D2P games on Steam.

Over the summers, Fof used to be my group's go-to game. If we couldn't agree on a game to play or we were still on cooldown from our last long civ campaign, fof it was! There were lots of laughs and yells to be found when one of us got the Colt Walker and went on a 20 man killstreak, or when one of us headshot another of us from across the map with that damned bow and arrow (still the only one with absolutly no idea how to actually get kills with it, truth be told). Or that time where my character had so much whisky that he could only barely see while getting dozens of kills with the Peacemaker in the bank teller window. Or that one time where we were surrounded by a dozen bots armed with hatchets, and we had to eliminate them django-style with our trusty revolvers.\n\nWe pretty much had our own designated classes as we mastered different weapons. Personally, I became rather proficent with the Colt Navy and could be a close (by fanning and moving) to medium range (by standing still and picking off shots) powerhouse, while one of my friends somehow found use out of the sawn-off shotgun. Nine times out of ten that you'd be a goner if you both rounded a corner at the same time. Intended or not, if given a little persistance, the dozen weapons of this game have multitudes more depth than any of the six-dozen weapons found in your triple A multiplayer fps of choice combined.\n\nWhile the game doesn't really appear to have a plethora of maps at first, each map has little neuances and secrets that will make you change your strategies each time to give yourself every edge possible. Just make sure to watch your back on the bank roof while you're picking off targets with the Sharps.\n\nThis game was coming along very, very nicely until the sole dev suddenly stopped development over a heated fued. This is personally very saddening on a level I can't quite comprehend. All those memories of those glorious nights might forever remain memories instead of blossoming into new moments of excitment and adrenaline as the game evolves. It may be forever a pipe-dream, but the potential day where the single dev decides to give us another chance, will be a glorious, bright day. That day would bring smiles and sighs of joy for me, my friends, and all of the fof community.\nWherever the future may bring this game, I know it will be forever forward.\n\nAnd if you haven't picked up the game yet, in that case, pick up the gun you most fancy, grab some whiskey, start shooting, and never look back. You'll thank me much later. Oh, and pass the whiskey.","April 11","true","23.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","8","9","3","0"

It's the Picasso's Dove of free-to-play source games. Simple, elegant, and beautiful in a way that the weak minded may not immediately recognize, but screw the two people who told me otherwise, this game is excellent.\n\nIt was definitely not in a Western shooter that I expected to find one of my favorite systems of close combat.\n\nI enter a building, I go up the staircase. Two Desperados awaited, so I hold down left click to fan my schofield revolver so that I could swiftly shoot both down. Alas, another comes up from behind with a tomahawk, so I kick him ten fet away and chuck a knife in his face, and then walked up to stab him in the gut with my remaining knife. I drink some whiskey and continue on my merry killstreak.\n\nWhat's so great about this game is that every situation has OPTIONS. Kick people away and they're momentarily stunned. Throw a knife if your clip is empty. Fan the revolver if you are facing multiple people and need to be as quick as possible. Light some dynamite if you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnd as a result of both this and the counterstrike-inspired variable accuracy mechanic, gunfights often play out as you imagine they should. Good players navigate the map with calm, deliberate finesse, and even without the presence of Western objects and aesthetics, the gameplay itself too feels appropriate for the theme.","September 7, 2015","true","28.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"

Fair or not that's how it works."\n\nThat's a direct quote from one of the developers, spelling and grammar mistakes left in for posterity.\n\nPlayed with the Dev and ended up getting banned from the entire game simply for getting a headshot on him. Sounds ridiculous right?\n\nHad played for over a hundred hours and the dev, R_yell, comes into the server, plays for 10 minutes (very poorly I might add) and decides I am cheating. Have no way of appealing the ban as he also banned me from the discussion forums. Have never encountered such unprofessionalism in nearly 20 years of online gaming.

Or do you want to run at a man with a shotgun with a axe in your hand, heart thumping in your chest, as you sink the sharp metal into the mans skull, relinquishing him of his weapon and using it as your own?! Or do you want to be a pacifist, only shooting the hats off your opponents, skipping away like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

After it's publishment long long ago, it came out as a mod for Half Life 2. It is a Source mod Wild West first person shooter. Many thought it was dead years ago due to it's inactivity. But then now, It became a standalone game. Not a mod anymore! It was revived from the grave.\n\nJerma helped very much. Thanks to him for showing the most of us this hilariously adorable game. See, how many of the most famous game series out there, started as a mod? Counter-Strike is a mod, TF Classic, DoD, DayZ, those games started as a mod.\n\nThis is not your typical ''hold the fire button military shooter'' game. This is somewhat really unique, just like to that of TF2. That's why I really like them. You know, I've been dreaming alot to Western things. I built a Wild Western place in my Minecraft world. And don't forget, Clint Freakin' Eastwood, the Lone Ranger, The Dollars trilogy, Tuco Ramirez, Col. Douglas Mortimer, Man w/ Harmonica and Angel Eyes! See that how I love the Wild West. I am addicted to the Wild West. I am a big fan of the Wild West, just like that I have with Golden Age Piracy. But now it's here, in my PC. This game, has the Day of Defeat, Gmod, and Red Dead Redemption feels on it. Three games, imagine that, mixed in one game. It will actually turn out very good!\n\nI had the most fun, most charms I find in a game is here. Just like TF2, this one is as well my favorite shooters of all time. See how I only have 5 hours on it, and I am excited to write a review of it, explaining how good this game is. Even though you're only 1 hours throughout the game, you'll like it so much.\n\nSo many impressions at the first place. Though, the game is still on process, let's hope many new  amazingly unique things come down the road. I am going to write down some of the postives and negatives I find in the game.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nThe good:\n+The blistering style it has that of TF2\n+Very unique features\n-Whiskeys\n-Carrying stuuf like that in Gmod\n-Hilarious voicelines especially ''PHESH TEH WHISKEY!"\n-X-4\n-The kicking\n-The knife throwing\n+That really impressingly amazing iconic soundtrack on the Main screen. Gotta wait for it to finish before I play the game\n+The Wild West\n+You can play with your friends\n+Awesome logo\n+Hilariously impressive Scoring (e.g the traditional Wild West Notoriety thing)\n+Impressing voicelines, but I think each group of Cowboys should have different voices\n+Killstreaking\n+Only the badwass ways give you the highest notoriety. (eg. Kicking an opponent to a fire, throwing a barrel at an enemy.)\n+Each characters are badwass or the game itself already is!\n+Hilariously impressing achievements' names\n+The graphics always makes it feel much better\n+OVERALL, AWESOME!\n\nThe Bad: (Though I know the game is still on the beginning of progress, I'll have to write it down.)\n-I want the theme song of ''The good, the bad, and the ugly'' to be back. Especially while in the gameplay. Or atleast any soundtracks to play while in-game, that has the real Wild West feel, and spark.\n-I hope you are able to take Whiskeys more than usual that will lead you to pure and extreme drunkness.\n-OP Bots\n-Can't pass the whiskey. :/\n-Camera shaking that causes dizzyness (e.g Knife throwing, kicking)\n\n''It's an awesome, unusual FPS Western game where you'll have the most fun with the Good Ol' Wild West feel.'' 10/10 Would play the game as far as it can go, as long as it entertains us. It's free, only 2.4 GB as of today, Highly recommended, get this 100%, you'll enjoy the great ride, pardner!\n\n9.7/10","May 13, 2014","true","99.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

Screams of pain echoed from every direction. Blood stained the once-white snow. It was a warzone.\n\nI peeked out from the crate I had been taking cover behind, and fired a couple rounds at another sprinting man. I heard a shriek cry out, and he dropped dead on the spot. I try to roll back behind the crate, but before I knew it, there was an intense stinging pain in my right arm, and I was bleeding heavily. I had to get to better cover.\n\nTo my left, I saw a passage into what might be an underground room of sorts. I didn't even know what was in there, but I probably had higher odds of surviving in there than I did outside.\n\nMy feet stomped and slid as I clumsily ran inside. I made my way to the corner of the room and assessed the wound. A single bullet, pierced through my triceps. I didn't have any medical tools on me, and I was sure as hell that there were none around. I figured I would just have to tough it out, like I had already done countless times.\n\nSuddenly, footsteps. Loud ones. I could hear them, about to round to the same corner I had ran through. I gripped my revolver tightly, preparing to make my final stand.\n\nMy heart was racing. I could feel even more sweat running down my dirt and grime ridden face. This is it. This is where I die.\n\nA man, dressed in what looked like a black and white suit, stormed into the room firing a rifle. I fired what few rounds I had left in my revolver, and none of them hit. Next thing I knew, I jolted forward a little. I was coughing blood. I had been shot directly in the chest. It's over.\n\nMy vision was fading. Everything slowly began to look dimmer, everything was becoming quiet, everything was disappearing...\n\nIn my final moments, I heard a single voice break the silence. He said to me,\n\n"Pass the whiskey."","May 20, 2014","true","6.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","6","7","7","0"

It's a lot of fun and it's free.  Not free like ,"You can play but everyone who pays a subscription has better stuff than you."  No, I mean it's FREE free.  You download it and you get everything.\n\nIt has a few game modes but Deathmatch is the most popular.  If you like DM and TDM, FoF is fantastic for that.\n\nThe gameplay kind of feels like Counter-strike 1.6 if the weapons were limited to knife, deagle, shotgun, and scout with only 1.3x zoom.  It's not an easy game.  When you only have 6 bullets, you have to make your shots count.\n\nFoF has a fantastic balancing mechanic.  You get "renown" for killing enemies.  At the end of the game, the player or team with the most renown is the winner.\nWhat's cool is that the weaker and more difficult weapons yield more renown for kills.  If one player gets 10 kills with the high-damage, super accurate Sharps rifle but another player gets 10 kills with a bow and arrow, the bow and arrow guy will have a lot more points.  Effectively, high-skilled players can challenge themselves by taking a handicap when choosing weapons and be rewarded with more points.\n\nThe community is very friendly by online FPS standards. I've got 20 hours into this game and I don't think I've seen anyone rage or mic spam.\n\nFoF is a solid game and it has a lot of potential to be even better.  I really hope they can switch over to Source2, open a "hat store" like TF2 and Dota2, and get onto the workshop.\n\nI give this a 4/5.  With a few improvements it could easily become a 5/5.","September 8, 2015","true","29.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fullbokko/recommended/265630/","fullbokko","Hecate Sinon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fullbokko/","2 products in account","Fistful of Frags is totally free. No cash shop, no microtransactions, nothing. It's a mod, but it's great as a standalone game.\nThe gameplay's simple, fast paced, and fun. There's no progression system, so you can hop into a game, choose your loadout, and start gunslinging. All of that said, it has a few flaws, such as a few minor balancing issues, community-wide weapons bias, the consistency of weapon box locationsbut these flaws barely matter as this game is incredibly skill-oriented. Veteran players possess no real advantage over new players other than knowledge and experience. Due to the simplicity of the game, it's really not hard to figure everything out after a day or two of playing. At that point, it's entirely dependent on your ability to adapt and your inherent FPS experience.\n\nThis isn't your everyday military shooter. It's obviously a western, but your favorite cheesy machine gun isn't here. Most of the guns are either semi-automatic or single shot, so it forces you to take individual aim between shots. The game inherently demands a good lot of focus, so don't expect to jump into this game anticipating run-and-gun half-asleep arcade shooting like your average game. A strong sense of ingame enemy awareness, reaction time, and individual placement will make you king. Of course, this goes for every decent shooter, but this particular game demands a bit more than its peers.\n\nTo all the chronic campers out there-- for the most part, Fistful of Frags' map design tends to discourage camping, connecting the walkable landscape between hallways, and there're always more than one way to enter a room or a rooftop, so can't turtle your favorite sniping position without constantly watching your left and rights, so be forewarned.\n\nThe guns in Fistful of Frags take a huge hit in accuracy when running to the point of unreliability, forcing you to either walk or stand completely still to hit anything. The weapons themselves are fairly balanced, though the game receives balancing updates every now and then. It may be important to keep up with this, as your favorite gun may not be the same as it was yesterday.\n\nThe most significant disadvantage this game has over other games is its highly autistic, rabid community of mouth-frothing neckbeard monkeys that seem to populate this game. Like all free games, you'll obviously meet people of all kinds-- for better or for worse. If you don't enjoy the occasional ♥♥♥♥-talking exchanges and the art of humoring terrible insults, you can either ignore all of it or pass.\n\nFrom a competitive standpoint, maybe you shouldn't consider taking this game too seriously-- but you could. All in all, it rewards skill-based gameplay and is a highly rewarding shooter. There's always a degree of unpredictability and ♥♥♥♥ luck, but most people don't seem to know that the very concept of gaming uncertainty plays a significant role in the balancing of a game.\n\nAs a last word, don't forget to pass the whiskey. This can be accomplished by occasionally pressing X, and then 4. I hope this review helps, and most of all, have fun.","September 7, 2014","true","48.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Uses counterstrike's accuracy mechanics.

More points are awarded for weapons that are more difficult to kill with (ranging from 6 points for gunshot to 12 or so with fists).

Why didn't I get this before? I was on the edge of whether or not to get this, but then I said: Mmyep. Its free. Get it. Its unbalanced but has those funny moments ya know.\n\nEDIT: OKAY SCRATCH SOME THINGS THERES A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME.\n\nA mere kick can kill a man with one shot (I get there are enhancer boots but still nuclear kick).\n\nThe bots.\n\nSometimes theres this glitch where you can't fire your gun, or reload it either.\n\nIf theres more than one person fighting you, give up, pardner.\n\nThe bots.\n\nIt will take months to memorize which weapon is which unless you look on the wiki.\n\nThe bots.\n\nYou don't really get to know the map until the 20 minute round is over, and by then you're still\nconfused.\n\nThe bots.\n\nThe weapons can be unbalanced (see my dilema with the nuclear high-heels above) and fights always come down to a lot of chances: 1. if theres only one person 2. if you have a better weapon 3. if you even saw the guy coming 4. if you are reloaded 5. if you are in a group with a team (optional, highly recommended) 6. if the person didn't see you coming 7. (MOST IMPORTANT) if the person isnt a bot. yea, a lot of chances taken with these fights, and in a few seconds, its over.\n\nThe bots.\n\nNew players might as well be trying to SWAT A FLY THAT HAS A SUGAR RUSH WHILE DRUNK EQUIPPED WITH A MICROSCOPIC SWATTER IN A ROOM WITH MIRRORS EVERYWHERE LIKE IN BRUCE LEE'S ENTER THE DRAGON SO YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE FLY IS *breathes in for 10 seconds* AND THE FLY ON A SUGAR RUSH ALSO FOUND YOUR SUPPLY OF COCA COLA SO GOOD LUCK WITH THAT AND YOUR ALSO KNEE DEEP IN A POOL OF CREEPY FISH THAT MOVE AROUND AND TICKLE YOUR LEGS ALL THE WHILE AVOIDING EMPTY SODA CANS THAT THE FLY IS THROWIN ATCHA. *sigs*\n\nThe bots.\n\nThe game does center around certain elements I had never seen before: accuracy and weight. Accuracy is the reason you land shots. If it isn't essential you can call the game CENTERED around it. Weight is more minor. There are a lot of weapons, but carry too many and you"ll be about as fast as Ganondorf in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Weight is more minor because usually you'll simply drop a weapon you don't use, or just look around the map for a favorite weapon that got you a good killstreak last game (if you even GOT a killstreak last game)\n\nThe bots.\n\nI wanted to make this review short and funny, but problems need to be expressed. Its free, so get it, and if you don't like it, you don't have to be ashamed. I stated the gameplay elements that make it different from other shooters, and it IS an amazing shooter. I think the creator should fix some bugs, balance some things, and also fix a lingering problem ive been putting off. Here we go...\n\nThe bots. THESE. BOTS. THE BOTS MIGHT AS WELL HAVE THE UPPER HAND AGAINST EVERY OTHER PERSON ON THE SERVER. TRY FIGHTING ONE OF THESE BOTS AND YOU'LL SEE. When you use accuracy thingy, you slow down. BUT THESE BOTS ARE LIKE SONIC THE HEDGEHOG WHEN A SPIDER BITES HIS ARM, HES JUST LIKE, "GETITOFFGETITOFFGETITOFF." YOU CAN TRY AND TRY AGAIN TO LAND A SINGLE HIT ON THESE GUYS AND TRUST ME ITS AN ENTHROLLING EXPERIENCE. Headshots do extra damage? WELL THEY MUST IF THEY ONE SHOT YOU EVERY TIME! That would be understandable damage because I mean, your brains are exploding like that one cool science experiment you always liked when you were little, the volcano baking soda (soda, oh god, that fly is still around drivin me nuts) BUT THE BOTS SEEM TO GET THE HEADSHOT EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. SOMETIMES I'LL SUCCESSFULLY HIT A BOT 3 TIMES WITH A SHOTGUN. SHOULD KILL THEM, RIGHT? HAH, nope. ONE. PISTOL BULLET. TO THE FOOT. I guess the nuclear high-heels are weak against a failed aimbot. Sometimes the bots on the other team will huddle up and form a big mob. Your best bet there is to run to the far side of the map, where they might not find you and aimbot you. And the bots are everywhere, you know? I live in Germany, and people don't make servers in Germany because everyone thinks all germans are bad or something I don't know. So I have NO ESCAPE FROM THESE HORRIBLE BOTS!\n\nWho programmed these bots? WHO? I bet it went like this:\n\nIt's been a long day of programming your new aweaome game, and you're ready to take a rest, and then your computer screen flashes and a skull appears and starts spitting cases at you. All the cases have a disc that goes in your computer and directly installs a Steam game. The game cases all hold I WANNA BE THE GUY. YEAA THAT ONE. SUPER MEAT BOY TIME A THOUSAND. The skull in the screen then spits out a hundred of those flies with sugar rushes, and all of them have high heels and whenever they kick you, your head goes flying and your brain sloshes around like the headshots the bots always seem to get. That and the buzzing sound of mosquitoes because I have a scarring childhood experience with buzzing mosquitoes. All the while you are just trying to play I WANNA BE THE GUY and then your intern comes in and yells,  "WHAT THE HECK'S WITH ALL THA NOIIIIIIISE?!" and instead of killing the flies he gets a cowbell and starts whacking you in the head with it. Then suddenly the skull comes out of the screen and you see his full skeleton body, and you realize it's Gabe Newell, and he posesses you with his banhammer and yells, "SO YA WANNA USE THE HALF LIFE 2 SOURCE, JUST LIKE EEEEVERYBODY ELSE, YEA! I WANNA BE THAT GUY! I WANNA BE THE GUY! I. WANT. TO. BE. THE. GUY. Then he slams a computer on your screen and says, "If you want to use my source engine, you gotta use everything you just experienced.\n\n\n\n\nThe bots.","May 24, 2015","true","7.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","5","6","8","0"

To me I this game is awesome and well made, it really is a mind opener when it comes to that big huge funding games dont need to be all that complex, it all sits with how much care was put into it.","February 20","true","3.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I killed him many times because he often players in same servers as I, and can confirm that's total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The guy who started that is some ♥♥♥♥er who just likes to trash people. He's lying, and I proved him that, and he even blocked me for that. So don't listen to "you get banned if you kill devs" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing lie. And for that ♥♥♥♥er, you deserve what hited you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nThis game is masterpiece and it's free. It was first a mod, and now it is standalone free game. FREE not FREE TO PLAY, there are no microtransactions or any other paid bs!\n\nIn this game you will play with revolvers or axe, depends on your playstyle. Weapons are very well balanced, and game is still getting weekly updates which are not inculde just bug fixes, but also new maps, game modes and more.\n\nGraphics are not the best ever, but gameplay is one of the best. Shooting just feels unique, and idea to replace health packs with whiskey is just awesome.\n\nThere are plenty of game modes like shootout and teamshootout (similar to deathmatch), teamplay (singe life/wave respawn game mode where team needs to complete objective), and more. There are also custom game types like Gun Game.\n\nI highly recommend you to try out this game. After all it's free.","May 21, 2014","true","110.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It won't hurt you. There are no in-game purchases either.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat would a first person shooter be without good gun play? Let me answer that, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one. This game, however, has amazing guns. When one shoots the guns feel weighted, the reload animations are top-notch, and what makes the gun play amazing is the tension. Reloading isn't instantenous when you press a button. Weapons vary, but reloading isn't fast, meaning when you're engaging an opponent in a gunfight every bullet counts. Missing once could very well mean death, and health doesn't regen. The only way to regain health is by drinking whiskey found across the map which temporarily decreases your balance and aim.\n\nExtra cool gun mechanics\nWeapons also have some versatility. Pistols have a secondary mode where one looses their accuracy but it increases the guns firing speed making pistols good in close range by increasing damage per second and good at medium ranges with accuracy. I don't know what this is called, but the animation changes and you use two hands instead of one. However, This secondary mode doesn't work with the dual wielding mechanic, since the secondary button is replaced with your second gun. Anytime somone has a one handed weapon, they can always pick up a second weapon and daul wield them. It could be two of the same pistols, or two different pistols, two sawed off shotguns, or even a pistol and a shotgun.\n\nIssues\nAll these weapons are pretty balanced except for one gun in particular being the sharps rifle. This sniper rifle is a gaurenteded one shot kill. I racked up 30 kills with this thing in one life, when I found a good vantage point. I don't nesicarly think it should be nerfed as it is only found in the golden crate which I mention in the paragraph below. Also it makes finding weapons enjoyable, since some guns are kick ♥♥♥\n\nLoadouts and crates\nOne first spawns in with a loadout of their choice between 9 primary weapons, but there are more guns scattered across the map. To obtain a better gun one must find a crate. Each crate is in a specific location on the map, and they have three tiers. Least to greatest being blue, red, gold. crates can be found and when one opens, it they can choose between a few weapons. Each tier of crates has different set of weapons, and the gold one will have the most powerful weapons of them all. They respawn every few minutes or so, but it's not so short a frequency that people will just camp around the crate location. The best way to score points is to always be on the move.\n\nOther fun weapons\nThis is a game themed as the wildwest, and it has some unique weapons as well. Most notably is the dynamite and throwing knives. The dynamite is a lot of fun, and it is a feasable strategy to hold it lit and run up to opponents blowing you and them up, and let me add that their body and yours will become a ragdoll and fly. However, its not nesicarly encouraged as suicide results in negative points on the leaderboard, but its hellafun. If you're killed while holding it in your hand it will drop on the ground, so it works quite well unless they kick you away. Which brings me to the melee. Fist fights aren't as fun as in say Chivalry Medievial warfare, as there are no types of punchs you can throw, but kicking someone does a lot of damage, and if you kill them that way the ragdolls physics again are satsifying to say the least. Throwing knives are nice as well, epsically since you can pick them back up.\n\nGamemodes\nthere aren't many gamemodes as of the moment. Only team shootout and shootout. I've seen FFA servers, Team Vs Team, and my favorite mode being 4 teams against eachother. I heard they will add more gamemodes but at the momment just expect a lot of deathmatches.\n\nConclusion\nThis is a really enjoyable free FPS. The guns feel great, and gunfights are tense and exciting. If I were to rank this on a scale It'd be pretty high. Don't forget to pass the whiskey.","June 26, 2014","true","10.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

While we had games like Half-Life: Wanted before, this one is much more polished and doesn't have crazy weapons like hand-cannon(literally) nor a portable mini-gun. The combat ranges from melee, which occurs rather frequently, to rapidfiring revolvers to shotguns to breech-loading rifles and even bows and tomahawks. There're no assault or sniper rifles to rule them all as in other FPS games: each has its own drawbacks. It provides quite a different challenge compared to burst/auto-firing guns: you'll have to time your shots and concerve your ammo since rate of fire and reloading is not as fast as in other FPS games. Levels are pretty well detailed, of an apropriate size and provide full range of encounters: from close-quarter ones in buildings to long range outdoor ones; skybox most of the time allows you to climb on the rooves, which doesn't break the gameplay due to intricate enough level-design and guns not allowing a total domination just because someone holds a good vantage point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sarkazmo/recommended/265630/","Sarkazmo","Sarkazmo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sarkazmo/","867 products in account","I'm reviewing the current version (available on 2014-5-17) which includes only two game modes and four maps.  This is a stand alone version on the Source Engine of the 6-7 year old mod (which I never played) for Half Life 2.  The game is in development with more modes and maps to follow.\n\nThis FPS is Old West themed and more of a skill based game than most FPS games.  It requires a bit of time to learn and a has bit of a steep learning curve.  If you're looking for running and gunning and jumping off of walls while regenerating health and shields then this probably isn't for you.  If you like your skill to count for something though then keep reading.\n\nThe game incorporates a dexterity system where you choose which "handedness" you are.  Ambidexterity gives you decent accuracy with two weapons when dual wielding.  Right handedness gives you good accuracy with the right hand weapon and a penalty when dual wielding.  Left handedness gives you max accuracy with a weapon in your left hand but a much bigger penalty for dual wielding.  Weapons can be switched to the opposite hand with the middle mouse button.\n\nMovement penalties for accuracy are very high when running but much more manageable when walking.  Standing still gives max accuracy.  This is important to understand and take into consideration if you want to actually hit anything.\n\nThere are a considerable number of load out options that must be explored for one to find the optimum load out for success.\n\nThe scoring system is not simply a Kill to Death ratio.  One gets points based on how many kills you make in a row, how you killed, assists, ending other player's kill streaks, and more.  Your loadout options also have an effect on gaining these points as well.\n\nThe game modes that are available currently are free-for-all and team deathmatch.  Pretty much self explanatory if you've ever played and online FPS game before.  The big difference here though is the TDM.  It's not just one team vs another team.  There are four teams in TDM!  So instead of having half a server to deal with you have three quarters of a server to watch out for.  This means more targets but it also means there are more players hunting you.  It works well and you quickly learn the distinguish the teams.  Working with your group will greatly increase your survivability and scoring.\n\nThe four maps that are currently available are well balanced, not too big, not too small.  They're appropriately themed with what one would expect to find in a period based shooter.  The maps are, however, somewhat complex and can take many plays before you find all the paths, ladders, and rooms.  Like any game one needs to spend time looking around and figuring it all out.\n\nWeapons can be looted from downed players and from special boxes around the maps in fixed locations.  The three boxes are Red, Blue, and Gold.  Each box, when opened, offers the player a choice of weapons.  The Gold box, offering the highest quality weapons, also heals the player fully.  Learn where the boxes are but don't expect that you'll find them unused.  The cool down period for the boxes is pretty long so camping them usually doesn't help.\n\nThe UI is minimal but what is there is informative.  To see your health one must look straight down.  The health display will only stay onscreen for a short time.  The display also gives you an idea of where you're getting hit from with red flashes along the edges of the screen.\n\nDeath typically comes pretty quickly since health doesn't regenerate.  The only two ways to regain health are opening a Gold box (full heal) or drinking whiskey (partial heal.)  Taking a swig from bottles around the map does improve your health but at the cost of accuracy.  Whiskey gets you drunk so your accuracy goes down as your crosshair wanders about making it more difficult to line up your shots.\n\nThe graphics are not stellar but more than adequate.  The sound design is pretty good and on far with other titles using the Source Engine.  The gameplay is excellent though and that's what is most important!\n\nThere are some balance issues and ping is a major issue (typical for FPS games but seemingly moreso in this one) but this is an early release.  The devs seem dedicated so I believe the issues will be resolved.\n\nAll in all I find this game to be very enjoyable and addictive.  It is free so you're not going to be out any cash for giving it a try.

I thought "All right then, I might just give this a go" and when I first started it I joined a deathmatch server and got a little pistol, a knife and some nice boots. I was shooting, stabbing, kicking and passing the whiskey for a very long time. And that was my first game.\n\nThe guns/weapons were small but unique with their own ways and surprisingly the bow is very good in a gun fight :D. Their are some bugs such as shooting and the bullet shows blood on the enemy but seems to miss but that only bothered me for about a second.\n\nThe maps are fun and unique with secret places to snipe and kill. The physics were pretty good and the graphics were fun and appropriate for this type of game. There are 4 types of teams, the desperados, bandidos, vigilantes and rangers and they all had a different voice but it doesn't have any benefits for which team you join.\n\nThere are a few gamemodes such as Shootout (A deathmatch), 2 team and 4 team Shootout (Shootout with teams), Break Bad (Team shootout with buy menu and more), Teamplay (Team shootout with objectives and buy menu) and many more :D.\n\nThis game is so unique and has attracted me to playing this game all the time! And it's free! If you feel like a fun FPS and don't want to spend any money, get this game.

Probably the best multiplayer source mode I have ever played. I cant believe how fun is playing this game. It is very simple FPS and you get used to it in a few minutes. It is quite similiar to Lead and Gold but Fistful of Frags is free and with the first person view.\n\nYou can choose from 4 teams which doesnt really matter but the important thing is that you can change your loadout where are 8 (not sure about that number) guns to play with so you can make yourself a tough cowboy with a colt, soldier with a carabine rifle or you can take a bow and feel like an indian. But you can find better ones in some bonus boxes on the map while playing. The fact is that the basic weapons you can choose from are quite similiar to each other so it doesnt really matter which one you choose. There are also some "perks" which you can arrange to your character to fit to your playing style.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter continuing playing this game I can surely say that it is a great casual experience. It is that kind of game you can play when you have 20 minutes before leaving the house and want to enjoy some fun. It is no Counter Strike in the level  of seriousness mostly because of the game modes where it doesnt really matter if you die and there is no such a thing like team play cause the team is just the guys you cant shoot when you meet them. Also could have used some better maps and making guns more different from each other.\n\nAfter all... great game with a lot of space to improve\n8/10","May 13, 2014","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

It has four different gamemodes, which are all extremely entertaining.\nThere are a good amount of weapons to choose from, and they are mostly all very different. You could equip anything from a bow-and-arrow, brass knuckles or dynamite.\n\nThis game will definetely make you laugh, even if you are losing a game or dying all the time.\nThe ragdoll effects are great, as are the shouting commands and the ways you can kill other players.\nWhiskey restores your health.\n\n\nI'm very saddened that 'haters' for a lack of a better word, have made the Devs of this game back away from it.

The game consists of a few different maps, lots of different weapons, and four main teams; Banditos, rangers, vigilantes and desperados. The weapons are also correct of that period, the 1861 navy revolver for example; its a real gun! As are all the guns in fistful.(watch all the clint eastwood westerns youre sure to spot a few)\n\nTactics;\n\nNow this is where it gets fun. So youre in this game, in your cowboy outfit shooting your guns, but theres a lot of ways to do that. You can 'run and gun', grab a revolver and shoot at people! Or, you can grab a ranged weapon, and get some distance between you and your targets. However, due to recent game changes, the rifles are exceedingly more difficult to use than the single handed weapons; more on that later.\n\nThe in game scoring system is reffered to as 'notoriety', again fitting the cowboy/western theme. The guns all posess a base notoriety, that increases incrementally with enlarging killstreak. More powerful weapons have lower base notoriety, so the sharps rifle has a base score of 4 points per kill, while the volcanic pistol has a base score of 10 notoriety points. This means that the easiness of killing a person with a powerful gun is offset by a low scoring bonus and vice versa.\n\nDue to the placement of explosive barrels around the map (lol), it is wise to shoot them when enemies are near, this brings a large point bonus. There are also parts of the maps  that you can shoot through with more powerful weapons. Arguably the most powerful weapon in the game is the sharps rifle, which has a large magnifying scope that allows the user to see cross-map and accurately pick off targets. The trade off to all this power, is that there is a large smoke cloud infront of the user after shooting, and ofcourse also the loud crack of a rifle blast; both affecting the visability of the user.\n\nPistols and rifles;\n\nRecently again, there has been a lot of change in fistful. The ranged weapons are the victims of recurring 'nerfs', such as the smith rifle, losing its accuracy and gaining a damage penalty. The schofield revolver however, seems to have as much or more range than the smith rifle. After all the rifle is for sniping, the pistol for medium to short range combat; Is it correct to have it this way?\n\nIm sure that these nerfs are there for a reason, and im not here to question that. Im here to review the game, so now ill start talking a little more that way.\n\nMy personal opinion;\n\nI love this game. Its fun to play for many different people, with many different play styles. Such a simple idea, and simple mechanic come together to make a game as fun as anything else ive played recently. It can make you laugh, and it can make you rage (due to the lack of cheat protection). But thats another reason to love this game, its soo course that you can use it how you want to.\n\nIf you want a good fps with a cowboy theme then this is for you. It will push all your buttons and tickle all your funny spots. However, if youre going to try to dominate, then it wont be so much fun. Ive been there.\n\nTo sum up, i enjoy playing this game a lot, and recommend it to anyone who wants to try it/ loves fps games.\n\nThanks for reading my review, have a nice day.\n\n~CB.","September 9, 2014","true","287.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sprite_/recommended/265630/","sprite_","Sprite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sprite_/","39 products in account","This game is one of the funnest western-based FPS. Theres 4 teams you can choose which are Rangers (Green), Vigilantes (Blue), Desporidos (Yellow), and Bandidos (Red). There are so many choices of weapons to pick. One of my personal favorites is the Sawed Shotgun(Stock weapon) and the Colt Walker(Top Tier weapon). There are Top Tier Chests (Gold), Mid Tier, and Low Tier. The game started of as a half life 2 mod but then devoloped into this amazing western FPS. There are many maps and theres a 4 Team Shootout (4 team deathmatch) and Shootout (Free for All). There are many shouts to the game as well. P-p-p-pass the Whiskey (x-4), and alot more shouts too. This game is really fun. No im not fooing around with you. The best part of this game is that EVERYTHING is FREE. So far there is nothing to buy. Everythings free. So I recommend you to grab some friends and play together in this awesome game. Its just loads and loads of fun with you started playing. Sure the games is a little sloppy, but it is fun. And mean it. There are handguns, shotguns, rifles sniper rifles, and more. You can also have duel pistols or even duel sawed shotguns. The game is really fun to play and the achievements are fun to earn as well. You can kick people, throw knives, and fistfight. I highly recommend Fistful of Frags. Thanks for taking your time to read this!\n9/10","July 22, 2014","true","29.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Originally, it was a mod for Half Life 2 that is consistently being update over and over again. It is a very successful Wild West FPS and in my mind one of the best in years. There are very few games with the same setting. In fact the only other Wild West FPS I can think of is GUN for the Xbox. The game has a few game types with free for all and team deathmatch being the most popular. The weapons are very balanced. One can go for a trusty six shooter with six shots before reloading or a rifle which is more accurate but punishes inaccurate shooters with a long reload time. All of the weapons are balanced so if someone picks up the powerful Sharps Rifle, they can still be felled with an accurate shot. It is a visceral and hard hitting game which really makes you feel each bullet you fire. I cannot reccomend this game enough as it has been a fantastic experience for free! Pass the Whiskey still makes me chuckle every time I hear it in game.","May 15, 2014","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Anything goes in this excellently well-humoured, beautifully-detailed and intense first person shooter set in the Wild West. No matter who you find yourself fighting against or where the action takes you, the goal is the same; be the most notorious of them all and have a grand time. You will certainly do so while akimboing revolvers, slinging dynamite, brawling with your bare fists or chugging down much desired whiskey all the way to victory. Just don't let all the Vigilantes mashing the 'Pass the Whiskey!' button intimidate you; show 'em who is boss!","November 25, 2014","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every time I get online I can find several games full of human players.\nI was skeptical, of a game based on reloading but this game is very fun. If you enjoy mastering challenging weapons, play this. The learning curve wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. I was killing more than I was killed within a day.\n\n\nA vigilante walked into my bar with a pair of derringers and unloaded on me. Wounded, I dove behind the bar and started chugging whiskey, while he reloaded his pistols.  Once I was good and drunk I popped my head up and blew him away with my sawed off shotgun.\n\nThe game also has a great melee system. Brass Knuckles, Knives, Hatchets, and Boots are often as viable as firearms. Lately my favorite loadout is a hatchet and dynamite.\n\nAt another bar I run, on a steamboat, a bunch of yahoos came in looking for trouble. They started shooting and hollering, stabbing and killing, generally raising a ruckus. I lit some dynamite, let the fuse burn down for a few seconds, and then tossed it into the crowd. It killed most of them, and I hacked up the survivors with my hatchet. Like a true hero. No one causes trouble in my bar.","August 5, 2014","true","385.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

From the old western theme, to the old school gun selection, FIstful of Frags has always mannaged to take up a lot of my time. :P I love how the aiming system is skill based. Some people have trouble with this type of shooting however, but for any new players reading this, just make sure you shoot, and let the "bullet" leave your characters gun, for a brief moment. thennnn press the WASD keys. You can NOT Run and shoot in this, if that's important to you.\n\nI also love the TeamPlay game mode. not only are you fighting the other team, or working with others to complete an objective against another team, but everyone loves how it feels to have the most frags/notoriety on your team/ingame as well. Gives it a lot of depth, (Another fun game btw if you like FoF).\n\nI do wish there were more TeamPlay maps, or some maps that were in a more natural setting with less buildings.\n\nHowever, all in all I highly recommend trying this game. It's free, so you should atleast give it a go if your computer can play it. :)","February 4","true","267.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Balanced gameplay plus fun gamemodes.  It plays very fluidly, a little similarly to Counter-Strike (Don't let that fool you though; it's not CS), even if it may seem unusual to new players.  With some experience, you can do some crazy things in the game:  go on a pump-action rampage, roam around with dual Walkers, snipe people with DYNAMITE!  PASS THE WHISKEY!  Or be a Delfy-like troll.  Hey, it's your game.  The mod/game is techincally multiplayer only.  I say technically because you can start up your own server filled with bots if you don't want to or can't play online.  It's free, and isn't intensive at all on CPU, so I would very much at least recommend you try it out.

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of liver cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever drink. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a bottle of passed whiskey. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.","February 20","true","25.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game itself is incredibly fun, but, I can understand what the developer is going through right now. He is sacrificing his money with nothing in return, to give us this great game, yet people seem to hate it because of the simple reason of "It's bad" or "Other players won't pass the whiskey." For people who say things along the lines of the first quote, would you please elaborate? The developer might read it and try to make the game more enjoyable for you. And if you say something like the second quote, that's not a valid reason to not recommend the game, due to the fact that it's the playerbase's fault. So please, turn on your mind next time you review :)\n\nBut here's one suggestion, a bubble of whiskey above the player's head when they call for someone to pass the whiskey.\n\n11/10 great game.","January 23","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From the old western theme, to the old school gun selection, FIstful of Frags has always mannaged to take up a lot of my time. :P I love how the aiming system is skill based. Some people have trouble with this type of shooting however, but for any new players reading this, just make sure you shoot, and let the "bullet" leave your characters gun, for a brief moment. thennnn press the WASD keys. You can NOT Run and shoot in this, if that's important to you.\n\nI also love the TeamPlay game mode. not only are you fighting the other team, or working with others to complete an objective against another team, but everyone loves how it feels to have the most frags/notoriety on your team/ingame as well. Gives it a lot of depth, (Another fun game btw if you like FoF).\n\nI do wish there were more TeamPlay maps, or some maps that were in a more natural setting with less buildings.\n\nHowever, all in all I highly recommend trying this game. It's free, so you should atleast give it a go if your computer can play it. :)","February 4","true","267.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game contains a great deal of strategy, and the weapons are very balanced. There are a few one-hit kill weapons, but they have balanced downsides. The western style lends itself to the gameplay.

It is both an accurate representation of the wild west and a "flawless" fps. However, I seem to have noticed a major problem. There are four teams in the game, one of which being the mexicans or "bandits". Nobody in any server wants to play the mexicans. As stated in my in my thorough skyrim review, I am half black and oppose racism. In order to make the bandits/mexicans more appealing to the players, I suggest they are given a unique weapon. This weapon will be appropriately named Teh Taco. Teh Taco will be an insta-kill melee weapon that instantly heals the user with each kill. With this change I feel Fistful of Frags can be the greatest game ever.\n\nP.S. How you make the moneys on free game? You should change price to $0.01.

Then this may be the game for you. No this isn't a Sergio Leone film but it is a 'western.' Yes, it does involve people shooting each other but you are all outlaws/ cowboys/ marshals/ federales/ banditos. Badasses basically. So shooting each other is fine and you can kick people, which is really dynamic. Also rather badass is the ability to miss someone's head and hit their hat, in which case they lose their hat! How badass is that? Because of these badass features the game feels "fresh and exciting." However if you want to do well in this game, just pick up a Sharps rifle and you've won. Overall I rate this game 45.69 69s out of 69 69s.\n\n\n\n\nGo and play Red Dead Redemption instead.","September 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

They block doorways, try to box you in corners, walk into firefights just so you accidentally shoot/hit them, and the end result is you getting jailed. PLEASE make the disarmed/jailed people no-clip and take no health damage. That would make me so much happier.\n\nBows suck. I've hit people 2-3 times and they still don't die. Hell, just a second ago I lost to a guy with BARE KNUCKLES. I hit him TWICE at point blank range!\n\nThe positive:\nOverall, especially for a free game, this thing kicks ♥♥♥.

So that means if you've played TF2 or HL2 Multiplayer, this is what to expect from the game.\n\nThe Singleplayer game, which is what I'm mostly interested in, has bots of varied skill levels.  They are all excellent shots so even on the easiest setting expect to be shot with an impossible shot at any time.   I really haven't seen much difference between bot hardness levels.\n\nWhat this game needs at this point is more maps!  For a mod that has been around for 7 years, you'd think their Steam release would have more content.  Maybe Workshop content could help this out?\n\nIt would also be nice to have more skins available.\n","November 16, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a lot of variety in both gamemodes and playstyles.

Shoot a man to death for 4 points, beat him to death for 15. There are still dull as paint snipers with the modded weapon packs and maps, but there are many 'vanilla' servers and a lot of the modders got the right idea with fully moddable servers.\n\nOh yeah, and it's free.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dark_raven13/recommended/265630/","dark_raven13","Raven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dark_raven13/","309 products in account","Fistful of Frags is a F2P Source Mod arena-FPS with a Wild West theme game where you'll control a whiskey-drinking, dual-wielding, and literally ♥♥♥-(jump)kicking cowboys kicking each other and protecting their own ♥♥♥ from being kicked.\n\nAnd when I mean free, it's totally free. No premium membership, deluxe pack, and hats, or any kind of micro-transaction. Fistful of Frags is probably the most fun and enjoyable Source MP Mod game on Steam, and one of the most actively developed game.\n\nGameplay (8.5/10)\nFun and simple, its one of those game where you just take out your brain cells and..umm..relax, except if you're a super-competitive one. FoF is like a slower-paced, Wild West-themed Quake. All you do is choose your starting weapon, collect another weapon in the process, drink 4 bottles of whiskey, and be a drunken dual wielding badass, and blast your weapons like a boss. Oh well.. who needs weapons when you have your leg?  The only complaint I have is because of the lack of game modes and maps, but.. you won't probably be bothered by that. Oh yeah, the A.I, its probably one of the better-programmed A.I imo.\n\nGraphic (8.5/10)\nFoF use Source Engine, there's nothing really special about it. It fits the game well, it looks pretty great, but that's it. Not that I dislike it though. Source Engine is still one of the best and most optimized game engine around, and of course light.\n\nSound (8/10)\nCan't really review about it, again.. nothing special, but its still great nevertheless. You won't be bothered by that anyway.\n\nConclusion / Enjoyment (Pass The Whiskey/10)\nA pretty simple and fun F2P game that offer up a solid MP and SP experience. This game is about blasting two sawed-off shotgun right in your enemy's face IN THE SAME TIME, drinking whiskey, (jump)kicking each other ♥♥♥, and being a total badass westerner.","November 21, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Revolvers and Shotguns are the ones meant for near point-blank range-Close-Quarters. The carbines, Bows, and repeaters (lever-actions) are meant for Medium-Long range.

FoF is a western-themed team deathmatch Source Engine mod released on Steam as a standalone game. The main redeeming feature is the awesome gunplay FoF provides. Unlike other FPS which focus on fast firing, less aiming and large magazin sizes, in FoF it's all about accuracy. A single missed shot will most likely decide over life and death since reloading takes a great deal of time. The game rewards cautiousness and patience; easy to learn, hard to master. Whoever's the most accurate usually wins. It's great fun for in between because there's no progression system or anything. Just you, your hat and your revolver shooting up people with different hats and different revolvers. Try it out, you won't regret it, it's free after all.\n\n10/10.","August 27, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Suprisingly enough for a small f2p mod title it really is a great game. Clearly the graphics are a bit dated with it being a HL2 mod and all but the asthetic is pleasent and it's far from unplayable due to the quality. The gameplay is fastpaced, challenging without it being infuriating and exhilerating, the maps are massive and designed in a way that makes some nice unpredictable encounters possible as well as being full of interesting areas and secrets.\n\nThe guns feel powerful, responsive and look sweet as ♥♥♥♥. Not a single gun suffers fro pea shooter syndrome and the melee combat is often entertaining albeit a little basic. There's a suprising variety of weapons available from basic colts to one hit kill sniper. Each is well designed and in fitting with the old western asthetic (which I'm a huge sucker for [I love old-worldy guns of all types]). Another bonus is each update it just seems to get better.

Fistful of Frags is free.\n\nThat's a pretty good compromise.\n\nFoF is a wonderfully chaotic-yet-strategic FPS set in the Wild West. The "cowboy" theme permeates nearly every aspect of the game, from the characters to the weapons to health pickups (PASS THE WHISKEY!!!). The maps are also very consistent with this aesthetic and look great, for a Source mod. Said maps are also very well designed and play well with the game's mechanics. FoF's gameplay has more emphasis on melee combat than most multiplayer shooters. Meleers can choose from hatchets, brass knucles, knives, and even boots that can kick players off ledges and into water (which kills them). Of course, experienced marksmen still have a nice selection of revolvers and shotguns to spawn with (more powerful rifles and shotguns must be found in crates throughout the map) as well as dynamite. Shootouts tend to have 4 teams instead of 2, which gives you more enemies and more fun! Great sounds, great production values overall, very well made Source mod.\n\nYou can't buy happiness.\nYou can't buy Fistful of Frags, either.\nBecause it's free.\n\nSo, by the transitive property of equality, Fistful of Frags is happiness.
