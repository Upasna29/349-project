I played 7 hours to complete the normal game. If u want a really good  challenge you can play hard mode and your game will be longer than 7 hours. Some fight are really hard and others are really easy. Its always full of humor. There is alot of stuff to find and hidden treasures. It will not be easy for most players to reach 100% and find everything because there is alot of maps and alot of stuff to break.\n\nI would give it a 4 out of 5\n\nIf u aren't sure about buying it than try out the Demo version  :)\n\nSorry if my english was bad  and i hope you will enjoy this game\n\nMelovia","July 25, 2014","true","6.8"," 86 of 98 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","86","98","0","4"

[Actual short review]\n\nReviewSTA was a pretty fun short indie game about war except the developer made everything goofy. Its actually pretty fun and the graphics are also quite good along with a funny little story to keep it interesting. They also mixed up the gameplay by adding in another mode to this otherwised short campaign so it doesn't really feel that boring. Its a blend of shooting and lite rpg.\n\nAnyways now that we got that covered, the gameplay is essentially you are a single brave soldier of Greenstar Army out to stop the Blackstar army. To accomplish this in your isometric view of the map you shoot the enemy, throw grenades at them and completing objective given to you by HQ. You can then use the money you acquired to buy meds, new weapons, accessories and armor.\n\nWhile out on the field you can search for hidden stuff and location but for most part the money you get from the normal playthrough is enough to pay for weapon upgrades provided you dont get every single one each time. Helping you bust the enemies are also the random scattering of allies all over the map and your one dedicated Buddy.\n\nPretty much thats it for the gameplay, the graphics are pretty good looking in emulating the retro style without resorting to the low effort 8bit and 16bit style that often saturate the market these days. Sound design is also pretty good.\n\nOption menu is pretty lacking though, You only got options for resoltuion and aspect ratio plus some others and thats it. Controls are a bit strange at first since the character slides around a little bit but I got used to it pretty easily.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game, its goofy, its short, and its pretty fun. It helps that its pretty cheap as well.","October 17, 2015","true","6.6"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","32","37","0","0"

In it, the player goes through a series of maps and dungeons, completing objectives set by his commanding officers in order to win the war.\n\nGameplay is the most important factor in whether a game is enjoyable or not, and thankfully this is the area where Super Trench Attack most shines. I played it, at times, with both controller and KBAM and it played well in both ways - there's a minor quibble where aiming stops when the cursor goes over your map or inventory, but for the most part it wasn't an issue.\n\nThere's RPG factors in terms of equipment, health, and damage. It's mostly bug-free from what I could tell, but I ran into a couple cases where my character was dead but wouldn't actually "die" so I had to reload the game and lose progress, or where the game would cease to allow me to fire and only use the knife despite still having ammunition, which was also solved by quitting and restarting.\n\nIt's relatively short, taking about 5 hours to 100%. Some boss battles are shooting-gallery style, which is a jarring transition and is the one area where I can say twin-stick (as opposed to KBAM) is simply not sufficient to control - I would have preferred these segments were not included. It's mildly amusing, but not hilarious. The artwork is....unique, and fits the aesthetic, but, well, you can see the screenshots.\n\nI had fun, I'd say it's worth the $5 asking price, but not any more. There's worse ways to spend some cash.","February 19, 2015","true","5.2"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","1"

Left-handed people might now feel excluded, but there is no need for alarm, since you can chose a layout especially for left-handed people in mind.\nThere are no resolution options, but you can choose between commonly used aspect ratios. What is really nice is that the tooltip as well as the icon shows you what kind of display device uses that aspect ratio.\nAudiowise you have seperate sliders for sfx and music and you can toggle certain ui elements on or off.\n\nAs we go into the game we start of with cutscenes that introduce us into the story and it shows its humor as well. With that said, if you play the game, take your time, watch the scenes and read the dialogue. It is worth a laugh or two.\nAfter showing you movement and shooting and the different UI elements, the game sets you free into the wilds.\nHaving played until the first boss, I can't think of any line of sight of hitbox issues so far. It only happened one or two times that I had a hard time figuring out whether or not I can walk around freely, because of height differences that weren't completely transparent to me. Other than that I had no troubles at all with the gameplay mechanics of the twitch shooter part or the shooting gallaries, which appear from time to time.\n\nIf you want to go off the beaten path, feel free to do just that as the game gives you a lot of options and sometimes rewards you with collectables.\nNot only can you engage in combat with the enemy, but you can play around back the camp as well.(But watch out for the casino...you might loose all your gold there)\n\nSo far I had a lot of fun, the only complaint I might make is that the game is quite easy, since there are no visible penalties for dying apart from losing a bit of time and having counted one death towards your stats. But since there are leaderboards available there might be some people out there that are competitive enough to try not to die once in a playthrough.\n\nWith that said we come to the tl:dr... Is the game worth it?\nAs I've said in the video, there are way worse investments for 5‚Ç¨ than this game.\nThe only people I cannot recommend this game to are people that can't tolerate 16/32 bit graphics or the 80s-movie humor that is widespread across the game.\nEveryone else though I can recommend this game wholeheartedly.\n","July 25, 2014","true","2.3"," 41 of 60 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","41","60","2","2"

You run around shooting enemies, throwing molotovs, taking tanks head on, and doing more soldiery things. There are also a few boss fights where you have to quickly shoot enemies appearing at random locations on the screen (a la wild gunman).\n\nThe oddness of Super Trench Attack is that at first sight it looks horribly drawn and simplistic, yet it manages to draw you in pretty fast with its odd humor. Your hero gets in several weird situations in the cutscenes where he ends up wearing his heart covered boxers, eating strawberry icecream, or discover his allied infiltrator in hilarious disguises. After the first few minutes I even grew to like how the game looked, as it works well to its advantage in conveying comedy.  Taking in mind that for its duration it is priced fairly, Super Trench Attack is very well recommended.\n\n\n","October 20, 2014","true","5.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","2"

Yep, another one. Thank God, at least there are no zombies in that game, unlike many of her sisters!\n\nPro part:\nGame's short, easy to beat on gold with achievements, the price is not high even without discounts Steam so rich for. If you've seen the video from the store page, you've seen all that that game have for you. Shoot it if you're not up to some bigger hits for a moment, and just want to make some clicks with your mouse and get some achievements for it. Easy breeze of victory, you know?\n\nContra:\nFirst of all, the setting with nemesis in the form of some "blackcross" army, looking that much alike as in the Metal Slug series, and all "retro" and "WW1" stylizations are pretty weak and over-the-top stereotyped. Almost just like as the zombie pattern... But that unattractiveness of visual stylistic might be just mine niggle.\nThat is really troubling is constant crushes of the game - the usual symptom of bad code. While the game is not big, and can be completed in maybe less than 5-7 hours, by that time I have witnessed maybe 10-15 crushes, and each time I was losing some of the game progress, having to start it over and over.\nFinally, the controls. They are simple, yet they are usually make you feel clumsy. Were that game a bullethell of sort, with the need to dodge many bullets at the time, many people would have been irritated with the controls...\n\nBut it is not a bullethell type of game. It is just a short and easy shooter everyone can play and get precious "Gold" with achievements. So yeah, I recommend that game - especially if you see it in some bundle or with big discount - but only to raise your numbers on Steam. As of cultural value... this given game is quite forgetful, nurturing on the soil of other successful projects like Metal Slug. My rating will be 6/10: acceptable, but not giving neither the real challenge, nor the grasp of fresh air that we're expecting from indie projects. A product, not the art piece.","January 29","true","14.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

The closest genre would be one of those old nintendo/sega RPGs like Legend of Zelda with shooting.

The World War I setting / humor is what really separates this from other similar games. I don't think this would've been as enjoyable if it was set elsewhere but I loved it regardless. It's pretty easy to 100% the achievements as well.\n\nMy only gripe is that I wish it went further in terms of scope / variety and I was hoping the sequel that came out recently stayed in this style, but that's turn-based.\n\nIn the end the price of $5 is fully justified and I'm really glad I played this.","November 8, 2015","true","6.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

You will fight against soldiers, tanks, battleships, monkeys, dogs and encounter boss battles that shift the perspective to a Time Crisis-esque FPS sequence. Did I mention you fight monkeys? Monkeys that wear little sailor hats?\n\nThat's the humour throughout the game, some may find it childish as you shoot an enemy in the nether regions only to have his eyes pop out and his trousers fall around his ankles, but that's the slap stick the game so proudly represents, and it doesn't hide it away. The majority of my laughs came from seeing your fellow soldiers hiding in various places, too afraid to fight, or the cutscenes with the spy, the game is worth it alone for those.\n\nThe shooting and leveling up feels natural, it does offers controller support which is great, but I have yet to try it out as Keyboard and Mouse works perfectly fine so I cannot comment on how well it translates.\n\nWhat I can and will say though is that the developer is very active on the forums and is usually rather quick to respond to questions/complaints about the game, so if it was poorly executed I imagine he fixed it rather swiftly.\n\nAll in all, its a game I am glad I own and had a lot of fun out of it, best of all, there is a demo to try before you buy the game so if I haven't sold it to you, the demo certainly will!\n\nMy Steam hours don't reflect how long I have played this game for as I played it on Desura long before it came onto steam (It was the only reason I had Desura installed).","July 28, 2014","true","0.8"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

The humor isn't cringe worthy and I actually got a few chuckles out of it. It plays like an isometric shooter where you move with keyboard and aim/shoot/reload with the mouse. A few levels are made like shooting galleries (like Virtua Cop). They are the trickiest to finish especially the final one where you barely get a chance to reload.\n\nThere are mild RPG elements but they are pretty rudimentary. I upgraded my casual pistol so much that my rifle wasn't useful anymore so I pretty much finished the game with a revolver and this got boring pretty fast. There are only the revolver and rifle weapons plus grenades and booby traps (not useful at all).\n\nThe story is bare-bones and I'm kinda glad it is because I couldn't really see it going far in that territory from the get-go.  Anyway, the game isn't challenging really and the whole challenge comes from some cheap boss fights that take hundreds of hits before finally going down. On the whole, it is a pretty functional game and there are a few distractions here and there to prolonge the 4-5 hours lifespan.\n\nSuper Trench Attack is a practice in patience. It MAY prove mildly enjoyable as a time passer and it PROBABLY is worth getting on a super cheap sale but you can pretty much pass this one up without feeling any kind of gaping void in your life.\n\nThumbs up by a slight margin.","April 2, 2015","true","5.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Has some humor to it; it's always trying to make you grin or smile. Nothing to crack up about, but still definitely a funny game; not a cringey game. To the point: It's very fun, and sometimes can be a bit frustrating though. To sum things up without spoiling, you're a man who enlists into WW1. You're just going to be some average soldier, nothing elite. But as soon as you're assigned your first mission, you begin getting sent on commando-esque operations as though you signed up for special forces. It's a very neat game with some boss battles that might make you slap your computer here and there. Also, as I said at the beginning, it's around 5-6 hours. Very short game, but very good game as well. Overall, it's an outstanding game and definitely worth just five dollars.

(You can easily be moving in one direction, and shoot in another direction on the screen. Click on what you want to shoot, and as long as you had a straight line-of-sight, you would hit it.) This type of aiming seems rare in games, but has a natural feel. (The game also supports a controller, but I have not tried that.) Unlimited grenades can also help at times (but be careful about blowing yourself up; I've jumped on my own grenade accidentally a few times). Early on, you also gain an ally which follows you around to help shoot the enemy. Both you and your ally level up, and you can improve some of your own stats at each level up. Your camp, the safe zone, allows you to buy upgrades such as weapons and armor. Multiple "secret" tunnel entrances allow you to jump to parts of the levels you're already reached in the current or previous play session. I like that there is no real penalty for death (and there are even a few cutscenes you won't see otherwise), except starting from base camp. (But with the previously mentioned tunnels, it usually does not take long to return to your previous location.)\n\nothers' potential dislike\nThe graphics are a low-resolution. If you need good graphics, look elsewhere. The screenshots with the smaller people are the playing graphics. (The large people are cutscenes.)\n\nmy dislikes\nA few things such as game mechanics could use a little more explanation. There are only a few pre-defined key layouts. (However, the default should work for most people: most of the game is just moving WASD, shooting with mouse 1, reloading with mouse 2, and grenade throwing with mouse 3.)\n\ndisclaimer\nI purchased this game normally, but also later received a free copy of this game for helping a bit with a test release. The game author did not ask me explicitly or implicitly for a review. The game author also did not threaten to reveal my heart-covered boxer shorts if I gave a bad review.","August 21, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yeah, well, the truth is a bit different...\n\nThe stills can't reveal the stiff and ugly animations. They can't reveal the annoyingly clunky movement. They don't reveal the utterly inane shooting mechanics. And the humor... don't even get me started! The game is chock-full of "jokes" - only to call them jokes is an insult to comedy. You can't call the game's "humor" as good or bad, because that isn't really humor. The "jokes" are statements, plain and simple, which aren't witty, or funny.\n\nLike:\n\nYour Commander: We have to kill the enemy Admiral.\nYou: (I hope she isn't looking at me!)\n\nor\n\nWeapons Shop Guy: These guns are all great.\nYou: (Yeah, you wish...)\n\nAnd so on, and so on, and so on... those old generic jokes our grandfathers used to tell are funnier than this atrocity with which you'll be constantly bombarded throughout the game. As if that weren't enough, the game is riddled with grammatical errors. There's at least 1 or 2 punctuation marks missing in every text balloon. Perhaps someone will not mind this at all, but the fact that the game was released in such a state really shows the developers are either fairly illiterate, or that they simply don't care. Or both.\n\n"STA!" isn't expensive, but I'd never pay full price for it. Even at a huge 80% discount, I still don't think it was worth the money... So, no, I can't recommend it at all. Perhaps, if someday it's featured in the $1 tier of Humble Bundle, then yeah, otherwise skip it.","November 17, 2015","false","7.5"," 32 of 61 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","32","61","3","5"

For being an indie game this is surprisingly good, and so far i'm enjoying it a lot. I picked the game up out of curiosity, and well.. it was 90% off so i thought why the hell not. Was pleasantly surprised and the game actually delivered.\n\nPros & Cons:\nPros:\nHumour & lots of goofy jokes. great for killing boredom.\n\nSurprisingly enjoyable combat system.\n\nUnique art style, where you can see it's low budget but doesn't ruin the experience.\n\nInteresting characters, you get a companion early on in the game.\n\nIt gets discounts on Steam pretty frequently, so if $4,99 is "too much", you can pick it up on sales for less than a dollar.\n\nEasy to learn, Controller support & clean menu + smooth looking UI.\nCons:\nLike mentioned up there, it's extremely low budget, where there are very similar generated maps, no voice acting & the art style sometimes look disappointing, example: in text boxes where the subtitles are "drawn" by hand.. etc..\n\nThe gameplay gets very repeatedly after a while, where you encounter the same sort of enemies over and over again. The way they "fixed" this was by leaving land mines everywhere & sometimes adding in a tank that you can easilly destroy with hand grenades. -- That being said "boss battles" are also very easilly beaten.\n\nSpeaking of handgrenades, and ammo.. It feels like you have an infinite ammount of ammo, and the nades never run out.\n\nEnemies are way too easy in some areas where you almost feel overpowered.\nDespite being a game i originally only picked up because of the discount, i had a surprisingly good time playing it. It's great for killing time. I suggest you checking it out if it's on a sale, the full price is a bit questionable but like mentioned earlier, it has discounts frequently so why not.\n\nFinal score: 6.5/10 --  Have a copy to give away if someone is interested.","January 19","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

The amount of detail and love put into the worlds is awesome, one of my favorite examples being that in lot's of places you'll see the same cute dog getting into funny little situations. The combat is fun and exploring the world while on missions is cool too. My only real problems with this game are the technical ones, being that you can't change resolution and that whenever I tried to select the "16-bit" or "blurred" options my game would crash, so I played with default settings through and through. It all looked nice and fine, but seeing some diversity would have been interesting. Now besides these technical problems, everything else is very fun.

He accepts feedback really well, and pushes out updates extremely quickly.

You are sent on missions which takes no more than 10 minutes each and shoot your way through each one.  The pace is casual, though you will die and you will restart missions, though because it's casual the enemies will typically remain at the same HP you left them with when you died.  I love the comedy that was added into the war theme.  The game is lighthearted throughout.  Graphics are retro, though nothing outstanding or boring about them.\n\nI was able to finish this game and obtain all achievement in less than 10 hours easy.

The game feels pretty good to play.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/uu_8wT6n5RU\nPersonally I feel a little bit impressed with how much there is to the game. Playing it reminded me a bit of Diablo 2 of all things. Enemies and breakable containers drop loot which you can sell at a vendor so that you can afford better gear and you gain level's which you enables you upgrade your stats. After watching the trailer and screen shot‚Äôs I was expecting running and gunning not an RPG experience, so it was surprising for me. Learning to play the game was quick and easy to pick up. I like the fact that you can actually get shot's and stuff even though it is a 2D game. It also reminds of metal slug, it's sort of like a WW1 isometric version of that. As you can probably see from the trailer screenshot the game is very silly. There were some good bit's, it should at least occasionally get a laugh from you.\n\nOverall the game look's good. But I do think they overdid the silliness sometimes. But it's not really a problem. Some of the stuff was pretty amusing.\n\nSo, yes I recommend checking out this game. I think it might be good though if it had multiplayer. It's the sort of game that I think would be fun to play cooperatively with friends.","July 24, 2014","true","0.8"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

Right off the bat I will tell you that this game‚Äôs strongest point is it‚Äôs historical accuracy and realism, it‚Äôs like Velvet Assassin but you‚Äôre the good guy. Its hyper realistic graphics really set it apart from other games, but we‚Äôll get into that later.\n\nThe plotSTA‚Äôs plot, as stated before, is about a Vietnam veteran who is fighting in Desert Storm. It might as well be a movie with how realistic it is. In the first cut scene, we are welcomed by Winston Churchill talking about how we are going to storm Juno, then we go do it. We lost many lives to the bomber planes (Spoilers!), but in the end my sniper carrying a Barret .50 cal picked off the pilots. What would we do without him. We later learn that Bob Seger is on the payroll from Che Guevara, and quickly must take him down before he conquers the West Nile. Although, even with all the intense story, the final goal is to take down Joseph Stalin before he convinces the American population that gun control is not a bad idea (We can‚Äôt have that kind of hate-mongering in the free world!). So, at least in my run of the game, my squad was me and John Lennon, because a duo is most efficient, and we got the alternate ending by saving the students in Tienanmen Square and arresting Chairman Mao for all his wrongdoings.\n\nThe gameplayIt‚Äôs very cyber-punk. At the start of the game, you are using muskets and flintlocks, but by the end you are rocking Colt .45‚Äôs and Winchesters. You can see history unfold before your own eyes. You have the choice to play as either Pierre Trudeau, Fidel Castro, or Stephan Harper. I, of course, chose to be Roger Waters. I slap-bassed through half the game before getting a decent Flea-bass -- which brings up another great point: there is so much customization. You can dress how you want and pick any weapons you want. Even though I was Roger Waters, I dressed like Micheal Jackson and acted like Kurt Kobain. It was so much fun! I especially love the twist in the bad ending; but I won‚Äôt spoil it.\n\nFinal verdictThis game is really fun and really deep, so here are my final scores.\nPlot: 10/10\nGameplay: 9.5/10 (Too much water)\nSoundtrack: 7/10 (Not enough Nickleback)\nGraphics: 10/10 -- hyper realistic\nOverall: 9/10Buy this game!","February 9","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

There are many secrets and collectibles to find, and there are numerous hidden setpieces that add flavor to the game world.\n\n-In contrast to most shooters these days, the AI partner is actually pretty good. The one drawback is that he has paperdoll endurance most of the time.\n\n-Knife wielding monkeys. What more needs to be said?\n\n-The final boss is surprisingly challenging and satisfying.\n\nCons:\n\n-Kinda short, but for a five dollar game, its a decent length.\n\n-The aiming can be a bit dodgy at times.\n\n-The fact that you have an infinite amount of explosives KINDA ends up trivializing most boss fights.\n\n-In contrast to the satisfying final boss, the final area is a bit of a slog with dense clusters of enemies that can easily mow you down if you're not constantly on the move and spanning explosives.\n\n-The ammo system leaves a lot to be desired. Ammo drops from enemies and containers are extremely rare, and the shop only cares two ammo pickups at a time, and sometimes they're only for one weapon. And based on what I saw, the store only restocks once you've completed a mission.\n\nOverall: 7/10. Not the best war game I've played or the best comedy game I've played, but certainly worth the money and a decent timesink.","August 9, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

It's this missing focus which lets the game suffer a bit.\nThe shooting part is basically reduced to clicking on the enemy and occasionally throwing a grenade or placing a decoy or mine. As simple as that is, it also features limited ammo, reloading, line of fire and hit zones. The later are key to defeat some of the enemies like shield bearers or helmeted machine gunners, which is all the strategy there is.\nThe RPG part features some character stats, level ups and an inventory and item system and loot drops. But none of these really shine. XP gains are mostly hidden and level ups only unlock new stuff at the shops and grant you some points to marginally improve your character, the loot is mainly gold, health/ammo if you're low on either and every so often a piece of equipment which is always outshone by vendor items. New weapons ‚Äì the only way to improve your damage output ‚Äì are even vendor only. There are also some uninspired passive skills like +DMG for your knife attack, +HP gain from health items or -DMG from explosions, but they're all acquired by buying them.\nA peeve of mine are shooting gallery passages which often take place as a boss fight and dumb down the game just this little bit more.\n\nThe art style fits the humour perfectly. The comic look allows for situations like NPCs dressing up as a giant monkey or hanging from the flag pole on their shorts without feeling out of place or awkward. If this level of childish goofiness is not your thing, though, you'll have a hard time making it through the game because it's virtually around every corner. The game is also enticing enough to make you forget the pixelated look, although the stills and cut scenes would benefit from a higher detail and less crudeness.\n\nThe world is rather small and the game fairly short. In 5h you should be through and have seen everything there is, found every hidden place and every collectible. Which is a shame, because even with all its faults the game is very enjoyable. On the other hand this enjoyment might come through the fast pace and its shortness.\nJust like fast food.","January 31, 2015","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Walk around, point and click on the guys, simple enough.\nBut the one thing that makes me cringe, is the absolute child like humor thrown in, and the horrible art style. The game throws in stupid crap like your pants falling down after you complete a mission, or a guy hanging on a pole from his underwear, and you can see his bear ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. As for the artstyle, the game looks like it was made in microsoft paint back in the days of windows xp. The game just looks gross overall, the jokes make me want to just hand this game and my 360 controller to my brother and let him laugh away at the petiful humor the game has.\nThe game actually does have mechanics that other shooters like this don't have. Like a leveling system where you gain xp for killing enemies and completing missions. The need of collecting money to buy supplies when you run out of ammo, because ammo doesn't reset over missions, your ammo carries over the whole game, so it's crucial to stock up before heading into a mission. Also the ability to buy better guns, because shooty game.\nThis one is a hit or miss, if you're a teenager who likes humor that only would appeal to 6 year olds, constantly being shoved in your face. Then buy it, otherwise, you'll just cringe the whole time and pray for a refund.","October 4, 2015","false","55.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

Super Trench Attack tries to be old-school and humorous yet succeeds in neither. You control a soldier that get's missions from the headquarters to clear out bunkers and search for random crap etc. Missions consist of clunky movement where you get stuck in walls when you think you were far enough from those and shooting walls when it's supposed to hit the enemy. The shooting part is the worst, you aim with a croshair but the accuracy feels terrible and you pretty much end up clicking somewhere in the general direction of the enemies. You can also throw grenades and... oh who am I kidding!? This flash-based-looking terrible excuse of paint-art is nowhere near something I could ever recommend to anyone. The whole "program" called game hurts my gamer feelings and I want people to feel awesome and BEST.","January 12, 2015","false","2.0"," 7 of 29 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","7","29","2","0"

What Super Trench Attack is that it's a top-down shooter set in a WW1 era with the mechanics geared towards aiming at specific body parts in order to do damage instead of pointing your cursor in a general direction with a little bit of a shooting gallery thrown into the mix in which I personally thought was a decent enough change to keep me interested. As for the story, it does not take itself seriously at all with straight up wacky humor in which I got a chuckle out of it every once in a while, but nothing that made me laugh hysterically.\n\nOne thing I've noticed is that purchasing weapons from the vendors you visit are basically direct upgrades to your rifle and handgun leaving weapon variety much to be desired. As for dying, there doesn't seem to be very detrimental to your progression since you don't seem to lose any money or really gain any penalty whatsoever other than restarting from the most recent checkpoint in which most of the time happens to be pretty close to the location of where you just died so all you lose is a bit of time and... well... get a death counter on your stats which probably makes you a bit of a sore loser to your friends or something if you happen to die a lot depending on your definition of what is considered to become one. I would say my biggest criticism is that it's pretty short at around 3 hours give or take since it left me looking for more by the time I finished it, but it might as well be one of its greatest strengths since the overall humor does not overstay its welcome.\n\nOverall, Super Trench Attack is a pretty solid top-down shooter with pretty solid mechanics that doesn't really do anything too special, but it does have some fairly interesting humor, although maybe at the level of internet humor with the "lol so random" kind of feel that does not go too far in my opinion. Worth the $5? Hard to say, but there are games that you could purchase that happen to be worse at $5 or even less.","July 26, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
