I feel like the game would be improved a bit if you only played as one cell.\n- Many levels seem a bit too dark, with patches of light. I know you are supposed to be in a body, but I felt like more lighting would have been nice, at least to see the backgrounds.","June 3","true","4.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
