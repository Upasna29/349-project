Usually it's the other way around.\n\nThat said, the game is definitely an early access game.  Content is limited.  But what there is, is good, and in my opinion it's worth investing in this game in the hope for more content.\n\nGraphics style is gritty cartoon and caricature.  Oversized heads, bulging muscles, punches to the face, etc.  There's a lot of humor in this game and pop culture references.\n\nIt's basically a board game with cards.  You and an opponent take turns rolling dice and moving around a board.  When you land on a space there might be a neutral enemy you can either fight to get gold or hire them so that they will fight the opponent.  The battles are just one hit and then they are done, it does not continue until someone dies.  So basically you're trying to whittle down your opponents HP to zero over time.   Each game I've played has been fairly short, so it's not like a long drawn out campaign.\n\nYou can use cards to lay down friendly minions, spells to harm enemies, movement spells to move you where you want to go, and other options.   But those cost action points to use and you only have so many action points per turn.\n\nThere are different characters you can play and they each have their own special abilites and cards.  That makes for a nice variety in playstyle.\n\ntl;dr breakdown:\n\n\nCard game on a square board. (or a board game with cards!)\nEarly Access\nLimited content at this time with promise of more coming\nPlay as different characters, each with own style and cards\nShort games - good for a quick gaming fix\nHumor (the title scroll is hilarous)\nBuy it cheap now before they increase the price!\n","November 24, 2015","true","6.5"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","20","22","2","0"

In the video above we show a short preview of a game on the beginning level.\n\nFakedice provided a review copy of Dicetiny to The Hidden Levels and for that we thank them greatly.\n\nMy first impression was that the UI was very similar to a certain card game I play on occasion. The artwork is very similar in the deckbuilder only however, so we can move past that. The cards are interesitng and the rest of the artwork is highly stylized in a good looking package of minions, creatures, characters, and cards.\n\nThe game mechanics are also interesting albeit not groundbreaking in terms of a board game. You roll dice to move around the board, playing cards and defeating minions until one of the two players is at zero health. The unique aspect seems to be the character abilities such as giving a minion +1 damage, or giving your character +2 attack power. That's it essentially, you roll dice and play cards, attempting to defeat your opponenet or minions. You can alternatively pay to hire some minions which became fun when our hero was able to give them more attack power with his special ability.\n\nThe replay value is relatively high, you can gain more cards and heros, build decks, and play consistently without it being a repetitive experience. The game is stilll in early access so the potential for more additions is more than a certainty. There are also a substantial number of gaming related "easter eggs" or small jokes relating to other games. It took me a bit to realize that "Middle Board" was a play on Lord of the rings. There is a solid mix of humor, strategy, and fun that seems to make this a solid board game experience for the PC.\n\nI'd recommend picking this one up if you have any plans to play it, especially since during Early Acess it appears to be substantially discounted. The price increase will be corrolating to the addition of more content towards release and it appears that it will leave Early Access at the $20 price point. I plan on coming back to it each time they unlock more levels and content.\n\nThanks for reading / watching.

This game is in Early Access, and at the moment it does not have too much content.\n\nWhen I first started playing this, first thought what come to my mind that its a bit looks like Hearthstone, but this not that.\nThis basically a board game with cards. In every turn you and your opponent roll a dice and move around a board, the two characters moving in different way, one start a circle from left, other from right. The game will be end when someone has no more HP. If you arrive for a land with enemy, you fight , but if that enemy is neutral you have a option to hire it.\n\nYou can use a different cards, some cards boost you, some put down friendly minions, etc. If you want play a card, this cost some points what you get in every turn. At the start you have one character to play, other you can unlock when you beat them in the story mode. All heroes have own special abilities and cards as well. Also you can create your own card decks.\n\nThe graphic style is a caricatured carton, and this looks nice. Sounds and music also good.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+complected with humor\n+nice graphics\n+steam cards\n+cheaper in EA than later when got full version\n+fast matches\n\n-at the moment not too much content\n-no multiplayer\n-no steam achievements\n\nIf you like board games you really should try out this one. This game has a good gameplay, nice graphics and humor. However at the moment not have to much content  because game is in early access now, but to compensate this, now game costs less. I think if you are interested in this, it's good to buy it now, as later will cost more.","January 23","true","7.0"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","24","34","2","0"

My understanding is she partnered up with the developers in order to help promote the game, which is neat. So lets get into why I DO reccomend this game...\nThe style is very remincent of Hearthstone. The cards look slightly similar but the style is VERY different. I mean, for starters, its a board game. Games take anywhere between 5-15 minutes for a round, which I think is perfect. There is a fair amount of strategy that goes into a match. For $5, I think it is totally worth giving this game a try and seeing where the developers take it! Now... Here is what I'd like to see from the game...\n-MULTIPLAYER! This game needs to let me play against my friends. That's like 80% of the appeal. I've already beat all the bots. Give me new game modes. This should be the developers first priority.\n-Card variety. Right now the starter deck gets stale after 3-5 hours. There is very little you can do with it at the moment. This game needs 100+ cards to REALLY start to be something special.\n-More characters. This is a given and the developers know this. I'm excited to see what they come up with. The abilities of the NPCs you can play seem neat.\n-Let the text and dialogue move at the player's pace. Create like a "Next" arrow when interactions and stuff are happening. Everything moves so fast right now and I missed a lot of it when I first started.\n-New boards. The board now is cool, but I'd like more stuff to happen on it and in the future even have different boards that aren't as simple as a single square. Maybe something that can accomodate more than two players?\n\nThat's all I have for now. I'll update as the developers do. You should get this game. It is cheap and a lot of fun! I only have 1.4 hours shows while I write this, but played offline for 5ish hours. I'll probably play 5 or so more on this patch then wait for updates. Thank you to Letigress for turning me on to this! :)\nCheers.","October 23, 2015","true","1.4"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","20","27","2","0"

Right now it's early access, so the game is very incomplete, but something to put on your watch list to buy for sure when its ready to go!\n\nThe game is a deck building game, but played on a board where you roll dice to move around, and deal with the challenges on each space through your characters abilities or cards you can play from your deck, all the while fighting the larger threat of the boss you must fight who is also traversing the board.  It has good strategy elements, fun graphics, and a touch of randomness that can make you cheer or cry out in agony when that one die roll does or doesn't go your way.","March 15","true","9.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

The content is pretty minimal, but I expected that from an early access game. The main issue is that the core gameplay is very similar to Culdcept, but it lacks the depth that made those games fun (cards and spaces don't have suits, the decks are much smaller, a card's attack is the same as it's defence, etc.). The only area where it matches Culdcept is in quality of the writing. Which is terrible.\n\nOverall, I'm kinda disappointed. If they add a TON of content it might have some charm, but the gaps in the core game design are almost too big to fill with fluff. I don't hate it, but it left me even more bummed out that no one has made a decent Culdcept port/copy.\n\nSuggestions for the dev team:\n-Add multiplayer support\n-Add a card trading mechanic (I feel like I shouldn't have to say this)\n-Get a native English speaker to do the writing for you\n-Go replay Culdcept and copy it better","February 7","false","1.0"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","17","27","0","1"

It reminds me of magic with a condensed monopoly board, in that the corner spots are special- a shop, a dungeon, and a buffer zone. I can't wait for the full release, so far there is only one area with 4 different characters to battle. Once you win against a character you can create a deck for that character and battle as them. Each character deck has its own strength and weakness.

This game borrows from many other games and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesnt. The thing I like the least is the obvious hearthstone copying of the deeck builder as well as the card backs. Sure it doesn't effect the gameplay but it still makes the game feel a bit cheap.\n\n- I have found myself at a point in the game (the wolf enemy) where I get destroyed against him/her but easily win the prior rounds. Im talking no-hope lose from round 3 destroyed gainst the wolf. At the moment it is hard to tell if it is something I am doing wrong, or whether my class just cant beat the character.

Primarily it's a game of chance though some strategic application will improve your odds. As such I will primiraly being making comparision contrasts to help review this concept.\n\nOne of my complaints is that in tweaking the Monopoly formula Dicetiny replaces purchasing property tiles with placing minions that can be defeated/removed/stolen and the result is a bit underwhelming. It removes the decisions between keeping resources or spending them in hopes of at least a small future or short term benefit but with the possibly of a huge payoff in the long run feel. That very decisions is what makes Monoploy somewhat interesting.  I say somewhat interseting concept because while the decisions set in front of you will change based on the dice roll/RNG/Random element of a particular game of Monopoly the overall strategy of each game is essentially the same (focusing on purchasing properties in a few key areas and not in others). I believe this is a result of having a fixed "permenant" gameboard that the elements are subject to is partially (maybe entirely?) to blame here and Dicetiny forgoes that particular dilema with the ability to randomize the board to  and the last half of each game tends to be a long jog to an inevitable conclusion.\n\nSo in short form for this Monopoly variation the non-permenancy (totally a word I'm sure) spin on purchasing obstacles (properites in Monopoly and Units or Minions in Dicetiny) seems to accomplish the task of making the game less vanilla. Unfortunately it also waters down the spend/invest decision that makes Monopoly anything more than a game of pure chance. It's an intersting problem to face and I will be intersted to see what this group comes up with.\n\nStay Tuned....\n\nGood Start!.....but its basically a demo at the moment sooooooooo.....hold off on purchase until they add some of that content stuff.\n\nAt the moment you can play 4 scenarios on one difficulty setting and choose between four decks with some very light customization options to mix up the cards.\n\nNO LONGER CRASHING ON STARTUP per update.","October 26, 2015","false","3.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","3"

I'd go so far as to call it an open alpha. The game lags consistantly and that's the best that it runs. I'm playing on a fairly new Macbook so it's not hardware and I haven't ruled out formatting issues.\n\nAs far as actual gameplay goes Dicetiny unapologetically rips from Hearthstone, even down to their card designs and abilities. Though I am looking foreward to a collectable card game that is not pay-to-win. I already play Mtg and I don't need to spend the rest of my income on virtual cards...\n\nThe other major source of insperation for gameplay is Monopoly, thats where the board game part of the formula comes in. If you've ever played monopoly just imagine Dicetiny as a hybrid of that and Hearthstone and thats all thats about all thats going on here aside from the... "humor", but I'll get back to that. Calling those two games "influences" is like saying CoD:MW really only laid the ground work for the innovations CoD:MW2,3,6,&11 brought to the table. I feel like theres so much room to do intresting things with this format. Maybe take a few more liberties with card design, or if the creators are only intrested in mashing up existing ip's why not try Mario Party? A board with multiple routes would offer tons of gamplay variation. Or perhaps multiplayer?\n\nAnd then theres the humor... This game had me really excited to see the writing. I thought the tag lines about "popculture" couldn't be sincere and that Dicetiny was mascerading as a shallow experence, but would develop into some kind of subversion of tropes and expectations, and perhaps commenting on the very nature of "pop culture" itself. Damn was I wrong. Watch the trailers and you get a pretty good idea of what your in for. Without spoiling anything(at this point there really isnt much to spoil) the opening starts with a long crawl of text(yes like star wars) that has a lot of words which provided a sentence's worth of story and an obscene amount of jokes/refrences that fell flat at their best, and were irritating at their worst. Dictiny's sense of humor does not go beyond "HEY!!!! Remeber THIS thing??? LOL. OMG SO RANDOM, am I rite???XD". I'm talking Schwarzenegger and LotR. The skimming the surface level of muck from over exposed culture.\n\nSo as it stands with it's current proformance issues, simplistic hybrid gameplay, and obnoxious writing, I'd actually recomend it at its current early access price of 75% off. Who knows, the gameplay may evolve to such a fantastic level that even a horrendous sense of humor wont bring it down. Or, maybe the writing will improve, but that honestly seems much less likely as Dicetiny's identy seems pretty concrete. There's some real potential here and I'd hate to see it go to waste by the Dev's limiting their creativity and adhering only to existing ip's or out dated refrences.","November 4, 2015","true","2.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","2"

I remember stumbling upon a trailer for this game on YouTube and being heavily intrigued by the art style and the game mechanics displayed and as I ventured futher into the video I felt a slight inspiration from Hearthstone and 100% Orange Juice; which caused me to become more interested. With more and more research of the game I slowly started to notice that this game fused the best of trading card games and table top games into one.\n\nWith that being said, you can not go wrong with spending five dollars on a game with such a high level of game play, strategy, humor, and replay value.

So because of this, as I write this review, it's very unfinished.  There's currently only one 'zone' that you can play on.  But what I see is a great start.\n\nThe basic premise is a board game mixed with a card game.  The best way I can describe it is if you took Blizzard's hearthstone card game and combined it with a board game.  You play your minions on the board and travel around the board in opposing directions from your enemy.  When you land on a square you encounter any minions or effects on that square, be they good or bad.\n\nI look forwards to future updates.","October 30, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Your max deck size is 15 and you can have 2 of each card in your deck.\nYour opponents have a wider variety of cards than you but you never get to use them.\nAlso you can aquire different cards from the store during the match but they cant be a part of your core deck when creating a deck.\n\nThe goal is to get your opponents health to 0.\nEach player can purchase a draw on each turn provided they have the gold and use these cards to summon monsters, buff your character/monsters or cast a variety of spells using AP which rises by 1 per turn until a max of 7. AP is also used to use hero abilities, each hero has 2 unique abilities.\nThe way the turns are set up is alot like monopoly, you roll dice and can land on;\nmonsters (chose to fight or hire them to work for you),\ncommunity chest type spaces,\na dungeon (beat the monster and add it too your hand),\na store to buy a card where you can buy a card to add to your hand\nand another square where you can buy upgrades for your heros stats\nalso after each lap you gain 100 gold and you get 50 gold for each monster you kill along the way.\n\nSo in conclusion this is a great game but considering how much content is currently available, this is little more than a demo at this point. I have heard rumors that on full release, this will be a $20 game and honestly if the rest is as good as this, its easily worth the price, assuming they fix some minor bugs\n\nI reccomend it, even if you just let it sit in you library until more content comes out.\n\n\n","October 23, 2015","true","1.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

There's not much to do yet but even so, it's a lot of fun and has so much potential I'm confident it will turn into something great.\n\nSo far you've got a total of 5 playable characters, and 4 scenario battles you can play. You essentially play a hearthstone style minion game with cards and AP, while also using gold to buy resources (and sometimes use abilities) while you move around a twenty space board.\n\nIt is early access and as such has some glitches and issues, but I can definately see this becoming a great pvp game in the future.","November 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

One problem. I have tried installing it on three diferent computers and it only sort of works on one of them. The top of the line gaming PC. From what I have played, the puns are good and the art style silly and engaging.  I also love the sound effects.  This has the potential to be a really nice low budget (for you) indie game. I mean, SUPER AWESOME sound effects music and little bits of voice acting.  I just wouldn't fork out the cash now.  Wait for them to get their code straight. Even on the super cool gaming PC it crashes before I can get to the second stage of story mode.\n\nSo, I will not recomend this now because of technical difficulties. BUT: if they fix them I will happily ammend my review.\n\nOh! And props to whoever was the art director on this project. Nice job.","February 12","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This sounds great and I was really excited however the game is extremely unbalanced, and almost random. My first game I tried playing minions which for the most part just got killed by my opponent with no effect to him, often 2-3 at a time. Which was followed shortly after with me pretty much 1 hitting him for a large chunk of his health. There is also a lot of small problems, for example the opponents turn moves so fast you often can’t read your opponents cards, so you have no idea what’s going on and how your opponent just killed all your stuff with 1 card. There is no description of what abilities do, I had a card with absorb, but have no clue what it does. The Game is Early access so I can excuse the extremely limited Deckbuilding and lack of other features, but just note this if you choose to buy. I have also heard of crash issues but didn’t have any myself. I could mention a lot of other small things, but ultimately the game isn’t really worth your money at this point I might keep an eye on the patch notes for improvements.\n","January 14","false","6.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There's quite a few of these little dice and card games available, but none of them that I have played are nearly as much fun and as well designed as this game.\n\nThis game is just early in development when it launched today on October 22, 2015, but it already plays and runs like a finished game with lots of pizazz and glimmer.  This game is as cleverly designed as it's own name of the game is.. "Dicetiny.. Destiny" - get it? Hehe.\n\nOkay, imagine a board game where you roll dice to move in the opposite direction around the board as your AI opponent, each of you having a goal to knock or see your opponet's health drop to or below 0 health points.  So you take turns rolling the dice to move around, getting more powerful and aquiring more gold every time you pass your starting square on the board (Think Monopoly passing Go rewards).  In the special locations on the board you might land on the temple where you can spend your gold for very nice attack bonuses, health boosts, or action point increases!  Other corners you might land on with your dice roll could be a hand store to buy a very special card to hold in your hand, or a dungeon where you battle an increasingly more difficult monster each time it's defeated, but each also rewarind the winner with more rewards.  There are also trapped locations or occupied spots where you must either fight or hire random creatures to aid you in taking out your opponent.  This game offers a great balance of strategy with all of the choices you make, the gold you spend, when to spend it and what to spend it on, as well as luck with dice rolls and the timing of cards drawn etc.  Think RPG, Magic the gathering, and Monopoly all mixed into a perfect combination with a nice touch of humor and unique artistic style.\n\nTo be honest, this is a brilliant little game that offers a HUGE bang for your dollar.  You can build your decks, customize your decks, choose and win different cards and heroes, and play a game that will vary so much that each game will ever be the same as the one before.\n\nMy score even this early in it's development is a very solid and impressive 87%.  Watch my video to get a better understanding of why and how I came up with my score... or better yet just buy this game now and thank me later!  :-)","October 23, 2015","true","1.5"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","11","25","4","0"

The typeface, it's too fast to read when they (the heroes and villains) 'chat' before battle.\n2. The character animation too fast as well...
