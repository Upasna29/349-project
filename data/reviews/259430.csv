Let me say, I'm so glad I did!  The combat is user-controlled and terrific, the equipment altering interface is very simplified yet is made complex by the innumerable additions and expansions found throughout the game.  And if you like loot, well, this game has a TON of it.  From someone who played Eve Online and found it to be rather droll and nigh impossible to be an effective addition to the world, Zigfrak "scratched that itch" for me in regards to free-roam space exploration games.  I also really appreciate the physics of the game and how they are implemented to provide an engaging starfighter experience.

Its not crippling microfonts like some games but I wish I could bump it up a little.  That being said do not let that discourage you from buying the game--the font is clear and not too tiny.\n\nThis is a game that you will be able to get MANY hours of enjoyment out of and if you don't purchase it you will be missing out on a great experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/irishcream/recommended/259430/","irishcream","Whiskey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/irishcream/","718 products in account","Released in late 2012 and just recently on steam comes Zigfrak. With a name seemingly produced by a name generator, Zigfrak is an action RPG set in space. The game drives the player through a single player story but the player is free to roam off the beaten trail to explore or engage in side-quests.\n\nZigfrak was a game that I wanted to like as I love space exploration action RPGs ever since Escape Velocity. Unfortunately, in my opinion suffers from some key flaws. Playing this game it's fairly obvious that this game borrows alot from MMOs such as World of Warcraft, which is not something I would necessarily want in a single player game. A lot of quests are tedious and uninteresting "go here and click on this" tasks. There's a lot of loot in the game to collect, which might generate some interest and motivation to play, but this mechanic feel a bit cheap. A lot of sidequests are collection questions that just involve collecting a specified amount of items and cashing them in for a reward.\n\nSince this game is inspiried by MMOs I don't think it really respects the player's time; for example at one point the player must battle a spacestation with a friendly fleet. It took me nearly 45 minutes to deplete half of it's health.\n\nAside from this, the action is fairly average. The weapons don't have a particularly notable feel and I didn't get a sense that I was actually hitting a target. Instead I just held down the attack buttons until I saw the enemy's health bar lower.\n\nTo it's merit, when a 'hacking minigame' came up I was given the option to fight enemies instead. I aprpeciated the option to focus on the game's core gameplay instead of getting pulled off into some minigame.\n\nIn terms of production value, the graphics aren't anything to write home about and many things in the game simply don't have any sort of sound effect.\n\nThere is no USB controller support for this game.\n\nIf you like MMOs and space exploration RPGs and you want a single player game you might find this game fun, otherwise there are better options for you.  I played this game a little over 3 hours, giving it a chance to get me interested but it failed to really inspire me to play.\n\nScore: 5/10","December 14, 2013","false","4.8"," 91 of 133 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","91","133","0","3"

Unless you're Maverick.\n\nZigfrak is a pretty awesome game. It's amazingly beautiful, but for reasons I can't begin to fathom it has never overheated my laptop. Not even when I accidentally left it running paused and the temperature in my room was in the mid-80s during the afternoon hours (my room sadly faces west). Even games that are 3D only as window dressing tend to overheat my laptop (RTS games, XCOM Enemy Unknown, and many others). This game I could probably leave running for a week.\n\nThis game is what I'd term a casual space RPG. What I mean by "casual" is that it tends to avoid the micromanagement most RPGs entail. Unlike most casual RPGs it IS pretty and there's a very wide variety of enemies and components you can add to your ship. No really, there's TONS of things you can upgrade your guns, shields, armor, missile launchers, whatever to. Going along with the casual game theme, they're often whimsically named. Inconvenient realism tends to get glossed over in this game. You're only allowed to carry so many of each object. Once you hit that amount, it automatically converts those items into the type of credits you spend at a trade station (there's at least three forms of currency, which makes game economics all kinds of interesting).\n\nThe author loves puns and references. There's an alien weapon type called "strange." So one of the weapons has an effect called "When you're strange." And given that certain of the higher-end weapon names are prepended with "tweaked" they put in one weapon called "Tweaked Morrison." The references vary between movies/sci-fi (obviously) but you can also find weapon types like Larry, Curly and Moe. I want to hope that Moe is the most effective, with Larry being the less-interesting mid-range model.\n\nIt's also a fairly sandboxy game. While there's an arcing storyline, you can freely ignore it if you want, and just go about fighting, looting, crafting or whatever.\n\nThe author is AMAZINGLY responsive and non-dickish (even when folks are being critical). Seems willing to take a look at your saved games in order to track down bugs (or just fix your stuck game for you). It's almost unbelievable how responsive he is given that it's a $5 game. I almost feel guilty mentioning that it's fairly easy to come by coupons for this game...\n\nThe only reason I mention my friend Maverick up top, it's not his type of game. While I wouldn't call the game overly easy, it rather shamelessly lists as one of its selling points that it's a click, kill and loot game. It even describes the things you kill as "loot pinatas." I like the honesty there, it lets you know that this wasn't done by accident or poor design. This game is for people who like getting loot. It's a nice palate-cleanser for my Shadowclan friends *snickers*. Money is easy enough to come by (and if you putter away a few hours in certain areas you'll be absurdly comfortable). You could also avoid doing as I did to get a "more balanced" experience. It shouldn't be TOO hard to get the things you'd want to buy (in the unlikely event they don't drop as loot somewhere).","May 14, 2014","true","98.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","3"

The scripted sequences, while not the most graphically stunning, are still amazing in their own right. The whole game has this subtle humor strewn about it which makes you motivated to actually do the quests layed out for you (there's a part that the dev intended to be serious, but really you can't take it that way). While the quests aren't really reactive and I don't recall any moral choices, some of the encounters you'll run into will make you question your character's morality.  On the downside of the game, some features are really obnoxious (like the ship tractor beams, dear god), and the really slow docking (although automated). Some missions require you to dock with a ship before you obliterate the enclosed crew's only wall between them and the emptiness of space, but the cinematic nature of it makes it quite difficult while 12 of your friendlies are shooting at it.\n\nThat aside, this is an very good game and it is underpriced in my opinion. Buy it now if you haven't already.\nOverall score: 94/100\n\n","April 2, 2014","true","67.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

Its very Space Opera Like.  The story line starts normal and has alot of mysterious things in it.  However everything is presented to you in the old school way of massive text.  Controls for this game are mouse and keyboard.  I suppose you could use xpadder and map some keys to a controller....but you would still have to click on things.  Learning curve for this game isnt too bad but it does take getting used to.  Like not realizing you have to click on things on the right side of the screen and not from your inventory.  They do a fairly good job during the tutorial showing you things.  And you can skip it as it tells you in the text.  Again massive text to read.  Game play wise its ok and takes a bit to get used to.  Other people compare this game to descent or freespace...um no....not even close to that sort of control  This one is more simple and reminds me of games of a few years ago.  In a way this is a very nostalgic game in that way.  Music is not too bad....graphics are not the greatest but they are not too bad either.  You can tell they are hand drawn or hand painted on some.\n\nSo let me review...Good things about this game.\nIts a Hardcore Space opera\nLots of things to get\nNot saddled with stupd things like runing out of fuel or oxygen at least that i have seen.\nSimple control scheme\nAlot of extras including a plethora of weapons and ammo types\nTypical mystery space style\nlots of things to find\n\nNow for the bad things\nWalls of text..yes alot of text...to find out what to do you must read.\nsome things not clearly explained so it might take a bit to find what you have to do.\ncontrol scheme is mouse and keyboard only\nVery nostaligic feel which might not be what gamers want.\nNot all loot goes to your ship no matter how close you are...thus you have to click on alot of stuff.\nCan only tractor in 1 thing at a time at least what i have found so far.\nIts a very long game not going to be completed in 4 or 5 hours so maybe not for the person who wants something mindless\n\nSo in the end I recommned this game to people who like Hard Core Space Opera with mysterious alens and are not afraid to read alot of interesting things.  I dont recommond this game for people with a short attention span or people who dont like to read or people who simply want to blast everything and be spoon fed.  I hate to say this but the negative reviews I think are from some people who wanted some "just blast things and get spoon fed" type game with "no effort required" type game.\nI will say though....you will know if you like the game in the first few hours or not.","January 8, 2014","true","7.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

I'm so glad I did.\n\nThe game is simple, yet has a certain complexity with the controls feeling great and surpisingly reponsive and fluid. Combat feels great, loot flies absolutely everywhere, and it being open world space gives you alot of freedom you don't always tend to see in most ARPG's.\n\nThe story from what I have played so far is pretty good (and humorous at times), there are also dynamic missions and random events which is nice (although fairly limited).The loot is interesting, plentiful and the crafting is also surprisingly well done and thought out.\n\nI only have a few minor gripes. Certain things aren't explained clearly enough (like how ammo works as an item), and why armour and shields are lost permanently once destroyed (especially higher quality ones).\n\nOther then that, well recommened for ARPG fans, and for those that want to shoot stuff and love loot to explode.\n\nI also made a First Impressions video about the game awhile back, if you would like to know more you can find it here :- http://youtu.be/O4cHVpjsy-w","February 5, 2014","true","10.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The 'Overall Quality' part I mentioned is a slider that moves between 3 different presets of Anti-Aliasing and the like. It's not a huge problem, the vast majority of players will be able to fit quite comfortably in one of those 3 presets, but it would still be nice to be able to control those options ourselves.\n\nStill, I'd recommend this game easily. Diablo/Torchlight in space, tons of loot, fairly big map to explore, etc. I'll update this review as time goes on, but I recommend this.","June 25, 2014","true","4.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

And certainly, that's not an Elite. You fly in space, that's for sure. And there could be a lot of shooting and yeah, looting. Problem is, the thing you're flying on, it's like smoothing-iron. A drag.\nAnd space... well, that's a thing where you can easily be lost. In a bad way.\nBeing a fan of indie projects, I admire Zigfrak. I see very much effort a single man put in this game. And being a fan of open-worlds and RPG... I'm scared and depressed. Space. Such a lonely place. I will tell my kids, that being an astronaut is not such a good idea. I'd better encourage them to become firefighters.\n\nPros:\nSpace - check, many of loot - check, crafting - check, shooting - check. In short, that game does everything it promises. And the game is still updating! The developer is adding new stuff now and then, fixing some issues. Cool man!\n\nContra:\nControls are not perfect, but acceptable. But the fact you need to control that Thing which is called spaceship here... makes me wish to return to Darkstar. And to bring flowers on the memorial of Yuri Gagarin.\nAlso, I repeat, space is just a vacuum, there is no life in there. And even with all abilities and challenges that game gives you... You'll probably be bored and distracted very soon.\nWell, maybe not. I'm just not a space sim guy, so I'm pretty biased here.\n\nGive it a shot, if you do not afraid of a slow flight in the emptyness between stars. My score is 6.7/10.","August 24, 2015","true","50.5"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","0"

I was more than a little surpised.  This game is incredible. It managed to interest me in a way that no sci fi game since Star Control 2 has.  At first I was afraid the game was going to be a twitch shooter, which do to slowed reflexes from age, I wouldn't be able to manage, but it turned out that it is more about how you have equipped your ship for each battle.  It's also great that you can continue to play the game after the completion of the campaign.\n\nThe negatives:\nIt could have had more choices.  I wish that you could make decisions that would have effects on the campaign.\nIt wasn't always clear what the information on the weapons were.  How does force affect the amount of damage caused by the different weapons.\nI wish there were mysteries in the game beyond the campaign, something to reward jumping into unknown random systems.\n\n\nIt's not really a complaint about this game, but it would be incredible if it had civilizations on the planets and you could actually get close to the worlds.  Maybe allow you to dock with bases on the planets.\n\n\nPositives:\nEverything.\nThe gameplay is smooth and easy to learn.\nThe graphics are great and the different color combos really make your ships stand out.\nThe wide open exploration is fun.\nThe different entities you meet are actually interesting.\nThe story is great.\n\nThis game is a must play for anyone who loved SC3 or anyone waiting for No Man's Sky.  It fulfills that space exploration itch that not too many games successfully manage.","August 17, 2014","true","17.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I've only sunk about 2 hours into Zigfrak, but I've already had more than enough fun with it to justify it's extremely low 5 dollar price tag. The core gameplay is the real star here; it's an A-RPG that wears its title proudly: enemies explode in crazy piles of loot which are easy enough to collect (thankfully flying by loot auto collects it), the writing is fast paced and witty, and the world is huge. It's got all the point-and-click-y fun that comes from diablo as well as slightly strategic gameplay that one might expect from a space shooter. All of which is to say, it's a great twitch gaming experience.\n\nThe game itself features a crafting system, mining resources, cloaking, hacking mini-games (which are entirely optional, the game will let you just shoot stuff instead if you prefer), and some slight inventory micro-management (you have a shield for your shield, called an overshield which can take a real beating, but once it goes down, you probably want to equip another one).

While the game starts out a bit confusing (there is a lot of information to process in a short time span) it quickly becomes clear that you are a stand-out pilot from the Freerunners faction that is traversing the Nautilus galaxy looking for stuff to blow up and loot.\n\nMixing a fair share of humor and unique sci-fi, Zigfrak offers a stellar RPG experience and plenty of options in the loot department.  While the game lacks the level of ship options that you'd find in other games of the genre, it more than makes up for it in sheer content.\n\nIf I had to rate this game among other space-sims, though - Zigfrak does fall a bit short.  As I said, it lacks customization options, and you never really get the feeling like you're a part of anything.  You are a lone pilot, breaking metal loot pinatas. Contributing to the health of the galaxy is not your concern, neither is its politics (save for who to shoot).\n\nStill, for those interested in breaking into the genre for the first time or folks who are fans of ARPGs, you couldn't beat Zigfrak at this price point or any other.","December 15, 2013","true","7.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Lots of screen flashing!\n\nA very nice space shooter.  The focus of the game is on fighting and looting.  There are mining and exploration elements in the game however these are under developed.\nI had quite good time playing this game.  I often pondered that all that all that is missing is some voice acting (and cut scenes).\n\nThe good:\n1. Many epic space battles.  So much so that it becomes common and boring after a while.\n2. Great variety of equipment.\n\nThe bad:\n3. It can be hard to spot your currently targeted enemy especially if the action becomes hectic or the enemy is far away.  A brighter color rectangle would have helped.\n4. All the areas are basically the same.  The backgrounds are flat and does not change no matter how much you move.\n5. Some background space stuff would have been nice.  This would have assisted in the creating the feeling of a lifelike environment. It almost feels like your space ship stands still while everything else moves.\n\nThe ugly:\n6. Expect to die sometimes.  Especially around the middle of the game when the enemies become tougher and you do not have the top of line equipment yet. But you respawn.  It sort of spoils it a bit.\n7. The epic space battles can be overwhelming to the point of total confusion of what is going on.","June 8, 2014","true","22.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I suggest to grind during the campaign some time outside of the missions to get the level a bit up and shorten in this way the time to the alien stuff (the way seems a bit long, but you need to get the requirement just once and not for every item and stronger weapons in later game shorten the way even more).

The start can get tedious with learning the control scheme, however the game turns out pretty easy, it isnt grind-orientated and you can get ahead of enemies just by doing quests and resource gathering(It isnt tedious or annoying at all!)\n\nThe game takes a turn into a more humouristic play whereas the Judex marks ships as "Terrorists" "Corrupt Commander" and the dialouge behind it creates a pretty funny experiance. Even after the main story, there is still alot of stuff to do such as the easter egg bosses after you beat the game and the lung fu arena.\n\nThe game also has a extremly large sortment of weapons, engines, shields, extra shields, armor, and amazing payloads/cargo such as nuclear devices, Disco stations that work as banks, a donkey that plays "Ride of the Valkyres", Potato and Marshmellow weapons. I still remember when I cashed in my credits for the weapons that gave the game away(In a good way, it shows that it turns humouristic). The sortment of weapons consist of the regular plasma cannons, hard hitting railgun sluggers, fast shooting ballistic weapons, Missiles/Rockets, Laser diode weapons, Flaks that spew out sharp objects and much more in nuclear and alien weaponry!\n\nThis was a great game overall, a great timewaster if your internet decides to cut out, or you if you have some spare time on your hands. The only bad thing was the weapons not dealing a hit effect on enemy ships, but who cares about such detail(Some do), The rest of the game is darn well done for its time and author.","May 8, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Luckily you can board the sods and steal it back if you can disable them without blowing them into spacedust.\n\nThe missions range from basic tutorial fetch quests to humorous shenanigans, all the way up to 'wtf I don't even... what just happened?!'.

The scenarios the game drops you into early on are ample proof of the ability of the game's engine to handle heavy loads, setting it up for some excellent space-brawls later in the game, and while the effects from laser-blasts and explosions are not enormously fancy, the sound-effects and musical backing more than compensate, making for some intense skirmishes, made all the more entertaining by your ship's fragility: take on more than you can handle, and you'll quickly be shredded, costing you in-game currency to respawn, and adding an element of risk to any confrontation.\n\nIn this sense, and also through the game's quest and rewards system, Zigfrak seems to borrow very heavily from the aforementioned EVE MMORPG series, which makes for a welcoming embrace for those who are fans of the series but will perhaps put off those looking for a fast-paced space dogfighter as opposed to EVE's slow, meticulous, cranium-bending micromanagement. I cannot help but return here to the issue of the UI, which, although relatively easy to navigate once the game informs you which panel is for what function, is small, non-draggable, non-resizeable, and written in small, cramped text which overwhelm the player with a great deal of information, which again becomes clear once the game tells you the meaning of every abbreviation and figure, but prior to this is entirely indecipherable. Were this one feature polished slightly, the game would instantly become more useable- a sidebar, perhaps, with each window outlined, would be appropriate.\n\nHowever, this slight incomprehensibility is what lends Zigfrak a great deal of its charm: the game is unpolished in many senses, and has a skill curve which some may find insurmountable, but this sense of jury-rigged chaos is perhaps very fitting with the space-civil-war-freedom-fighter aesthetic. The madness which ensues in several of the early campaigns, and the endless mystery of the different ports, modules, ammunition types and weapon fittings, give Zigfrak a certain edgyness, a winning smile in the face of the recent deluge of cardboard-cutout space dogfighters (I'm looking at you, X:Rebirth). As it is, the game is compulsively playable, and I look forward to seeing the direction that it takes in the future, and with a few small tweaks, it could be instantly enjoyable by any fan of space combat and exploration.\n","December 22, 2013","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I fought with semi-gods, struggled for survival inside the stomach of an ancient beast, played a game of Blackjack with a Mafia boss, discovered beautiful stellar phenomena, lost a good friend, was drugged and brainwashed, and much more.\n\nThe missions are incredibly varied, very well written and fun to play. Not a single one was boring or annoying.\n\nReducing this game to shooting and looting is a vast understatement.

The keys are rebindable, which makes it damn easy to fly with mouse and keyboard, so no issues there.\n\nThe difficulty ranges from glorious romping 'pwn them all' fights to 'dear gods, will they never stop coming?' - but there are powerups randomly dropped by destroyed foes which help keep you alive even in a drawn out dogfight against an entire fleet.\n\nThe AI is decent, for both ally and enemy ships, and sometimes you'll find yourself gritting your teeth and muttering 'That's MY loot, dammit' as you gun down some tractor-beaming scumbag pirate who's trying to zip off with your hard-earned dark matter or rare loot drop. Luckily you can board the sods and steal it back if you can disable them without blowing them into spacedust.\n\nThe missions range from basic tutorial fetch quests to humorous shenanigans, all the way up to 'wtf I don't even... what just happened?!'.  There's even a 'Bear Grylls in Space' parody hidden away in there. There's a LOT of laughter to be found in Zigfrak. Did I mention that you can gun down an entire swarm of Nyancats?

For instance, you start out with a "dusty cannon" and it's got "a colony of bunnies live inside."\n\nI also like the ability to thrust and slide in three dimensional space.\n\nThat said, I do have a problem with the interface.\n\nFor instance, the inventory menu.  I suppose the easiest way to explain it is that It's really compact.  All you have to distinguish the different weapon icons is the border.  Brown/Green/Blue/Purple...etc.  Unlike other rpg games where different items may have different icons, here you find that all cannons look the same.  All pulse cannons look the same.  Etc.  I have to mouse over each item just to see what it is.\n\nThat wouldn't be so bad...except the game sorts everything for you.  I'm a messy guy, so I subscribe to the school of controlled chaos.  I'm the type who would store the useful items on one side of the inventory and the junk go on the other.  That way, when I land, I know what leaves and what stays.\n\nHere...The junk and the good stuff are lumped together by category, and it also looks like by level.  Quite frankly, I'm not going to remember what order the cannons are in...so once I hit level 7 and then open up the inventory to equip that cannon that had a level 7 requirement, I end up having to mouse over each item just to find it.\n\nDid I mention that the inventory menu was compact?  Guess what? The item details end up being in a window like 1/5th the required size.  And that's important why?  It means you have to scroll.  And why do you have to scroll?  Because to equip an item, you have to go to the equip options that come AFTER the description.  Right clicking like in other games doesn't work, it just brought up the descriptions.\n\nThat reminds me...it looks like there's a fuel and ammo system in this game.  After some poking around, it occurred to me that I can pull that information up by accessing my inventory and then checking the engine and each individual weapon.  I think that's how you do it.  Couldn't there have been some sort of HUD for this?\n\nI'll recommend it, because it truly does seem like an interesting game.  But this user interface could've been streamlined.","December 15, 2013","true","20.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It may not be for some as i would say this game does have seizure inducing visuals especially since there is quite a bit of massive battles. The controls are a bit convoluted but my recommendation is that you put your frequent use items in slots 1-5 as the game progresses.\n\nThere is also MANY references to other media in the game, as such examples as a powerup called you become death, which is a reference to the detonation of the first atom bomb, A whole mission dedicated to The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. and there are others in the game. This is underrated at best.\n\nSome of my gripes is the encounter system. even if your in friendly territory you may become a target to a few different enemies that jump in and may have massive fleets in which you Will have to jump out if your not of a sufficient level and have weapons that are weak. The crafting system is a little lack lustre and resource gathering is a pain as well. But thats the most i can say.\n\nOtherwise this game has flaws that may turn people off which is a given but if you like loot, space and have enough patience to learn the controls you may enjoy it or you may not.

With the way loot drops, the variety of loot, and the humor in the references (albeit sans speech), it is a lot like Borderlands 2 in space.

Yes, but generally they are minor and do not effect gameplay.  Such as accidentally moving a toolbar icon and not knowing where it is stored (there is no ability to lock the toolbar), the huge but unsortable inventory, or flying through another ship.  These minor problems are overshadowed by:\n\n- the sheer joy of blowing enemies to bits using one of the hundreds of weapons,\n- watching enemies explode - as the game description says - like loot piñatas,\n- a not uninteresting story mode,\n- very cool original music\n- an RPG element including crafting and gathering (skill trees are coming in a future update),\n- a large and easy to use DB on the Zigfrak.com site that lists ALL THE THINGS,\n- and an awesome price (IT'S ONLY $5 USD!).\n\nAny major problems are often quickly and directly addressed by the developers (as evidenced on their forums), and the forums - both here and on the Zigfrak site - are full of people that are knowledgeable, and information that is helpful.\n\nMy only hope is that one day we get co-op. ;)\n\nIn short, if you like flight sims or space, and FPS, then this is going to be a fun investment for you.

I may change this later but I really don't feel like playing it any more for now.  So far it feels like I'm being led by the nose from starbase to starbase.  I feel like I'm trying to get through these "tutorial" type missions to get to the real game, but now I'm afraid this is all there is.\n\nCombat seems a bit unskillful at the moment.  Press TAB, press T, press Space until enemy dies.  Repeat.  Perhaps theres more skill later on but this is how it's playing out so far.\n\nLoot - yup there's a ton of it.  You blow up an enemy ship and a bunch of stuff flys out and gets sucked up into your ship.  Wait, what did I just loot?  Spend next couple of minutes reading the combat log in the bottom left to try and work out what I picked up.  Okay I think there might be some useful stuff in there.  I go into inventory to check it out.  There's no popup comparrison to what I have already equipped so it's hard to tell.  Doesn't matter too much anyway because the game seems to automatically equip the best stuff for you.  Guess that's one less thing I have to worry about.\n\nI find an item that looks pretty decent and wonder why it didn't get equipped.  Hrmm it says I need to be level 5... what level am I?  This piece of information seems rather difficult to find.  There doesn't seem to be an XP bar either now that I think about it.\n\nThat's about it for my thoughts so far.  I'll endeavor to update this if I change my mind.  Maybe I'm not playing it right.  Maybe I'm just supposed to go forth and explore, rather than following the missions laid before me.  It just seems over automated.  There seems to be not really much choice or decision making involved.\n\nBottom line.  I'd rather play Drox Operative than this game... but I'll give it another shot some time and post my updated thoughts.","December 24, 2013","false","9.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","1"

I even paid for it twice; 5 bucks for this much fun is just a steal.\n\nWhat is Zigfrak? Pure unadulterated hilarity in the shape of a space shooter. I mean, it's got "loot piñatas" right in the description.\nTo say it's got a quirky humour doesn't do it justice; battles are a flashy, dopamine-torrent-inducing show of lights and loot. There is a joke to be found absolutely everywhere, from the purposefully shameless stereotyping (often with a twist!) on some of the characters, missions, and dialogue, to the very names and flavour text of the majority of the equipment you can find: when you get your hands on a nuclear missile launcher called The Freshmaker (with "plutonium cores enhanced with minty flavour crystals") you know this game's a keeper.\n\nIt's not a "hard" or "challenging" game by any means. While you are certainly able to roam in-between missions and find yourself in the middle of a bigger badder fleet than you can manage, once you get the hang of the mechanics and controls the answer is most often just getting a few more levels and better gear. The game is pretty streamlined for the sake of fun; and it succeeds, because the humour, the story constantly switching mood from dark to kickass to zany, and the flashy battles WILL keep you entertained for dozens upon dozens of hours.\n\nFrom a technical aspect, the graphics are not the most realistic hi-poly thing you'll find but it's nevertheless got a unique and beautiful style. The soundtrack is great, and the game is extremely stable and bug-free.\n\nWhat doesn't it have? Multiplayer, or a truly unforgiving challenge. If you don't really need either of these, then Zigfrak is your game.","January 26, 2015","true","34.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/259430/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Zigfrak is basically Elite/Privateer had a baby with DND/Rogue-like partner. Yes, you read that right. This is NOT your typical space game, but is in fact, an RPG set in space. And that's a good thing.\n\nThe fact that the game uses WASD to move should tell you this is NOT a turn-and-burn game like Elite/ Privateer / X-series.  Yes, you play this game like a FPS: WASD to strafe. And you can map weapons groups, or just hit "fire wall" (and hold it down if you like) to fire every weapon as soon as they cycle. And the bigger your ship, the more weapon slots it would have. (Reaper-class, the largest ship you can build, has 2P+4S+2D slots)  You have four categories of weapons: primary, secondary, tertiary, and drone. Primary are the rapid-hitting weapons, like energy bolts, or ballistic cannons. Secondary are slower firing like missiles, railguns, and even "flak". Tertiary so far are beam weapons. And drones are basically attack robots that act like little fighters that fight alongside you (almost like pets!)\n\nJust like RPG, you will find bazillion different variations of the same weapon, as well as various secondary effects. A electro weapon can have kinetic secondary effect. In fact, you can find "modifiers" that can be added to some plain weapons to add the secondary effect. (i.e. gems/charms for your weapons!)   And weapons have cycle speed (attack speed!), damage, multi-strike (fires more than one shot per attack), and even reliability (heavy use and damage can destroy the item!)   You have shield, then armor or overshield. Each of which can be generic, or specialized against a particular type of damage (kinetic, thermal, nuclear, electro, strange, etc.)\n\nYou jump from sector to sector, and you can do the boring stuff like mine asteroids and whatnot for minerals and energy and such in most places. However, most of the time you'll be fighting. Some enemies can be invading your sector, or you can go to an unfriendly sector. Expect to see a lot of enemies, as there's plenty of humans to fight against, AND there are more than one faction of aliens you will have to contend with.\n\nFighting is a lot of side-strafing, but also with touch of afterburner to get away from the enemies and retrograde. What's fun about the game is a ton of loot... you'll nab ammo, weapons, other components, as well as powerups that will restore shield, restore health, triples your base damage, and so on. When you blow up a ship, stuff scatter like confetti. If you don't like the mess, disable the other ship, then dock with it to loot it.\n\nSo far, this sounds simple, but then you get into templates (blueprints) for building your components, weapons, even ships, and the game makes a different turn, as you realize you can't buy the ship you want... You'll have to build them.\n\nRemember to do all the early missions so you don't miss out a lot of upgrades and such. You'll need the various upgrades.\n\nThere are a lot of little features, like trading some special loot for "chests" that can contain surprise goodies, needing some special research to buy super-exotic weapons, finding the stations where such weapons or tempaltes are sold, and so on is a part of the fun. And the galaxy is quite big.\n\nGraphics are surprisingly good, but then drawing "space" and making it look good isn't that difficult During combat the screen can get extremely busy with all your weapons firing with different effects (and other specials like shield-breakers, decoys, holodecoys, and so on all firing off). Add to the flashes caused by weapon hits, and this may be almost epilepsy inducing. Beware.\n\nSound isn't anything remarkable. There are no voiced dialogs, just text boxes. Music is sort techno-futuro beat electronica.\n\nAll in all, this is a fun little game that encourages a lot of replay just for exploration, even if you manage to max out the ship.

Why not bring the loot-filled fun of "Torchlight" or "Borderlands" to the space-sim genre? The notion is brilliant, because it can, in theory, speed up the "go on missions, upgrade your ride" loop to a lightning pace. (And it can also create some very zany ship loadouts.)\n\nThe problem here is not the lack of a novel idea. No, the problem is the execution of the flying and fighting. Zigfrak delivers a disappointing experience on those fronts, with strange ship handling and uninspired "dogfight" mechanics. There's also the problem of all the HUD displays that pop onto the screen, covering a huge amount of visual real-estate with what amounts to database entries. These elements, as drivers of the wider loot mechanic, have to be a lot of fun...but they aren't yet. They feel like they didn't get very much attention.\n\nWhat I would love to see Entheogen do would be to mod a game that already has fun combat and flight mechanics. A specialized loot installation, modification, and crafting mechanic could be built for stations and planets, making that part of the game a focused experience all on its own.\n\nThe problem with a negative critique is that you're essentially shooting down somebody's hard work. I especially hate to do that with something like this, which tries to go in a bold direction. The developers have come up with an underlying concept that I really want to play - it's just that the actual playing isn't engaging.","March 13","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The interface is cumbersome, there are a lot of text to read that are weakly presented, there are many unfathomable icons which are difficult to recognize nor remember, and a very rigid & simplistic combat are the hurdles you'll encounter if you wish to play this game. All of these made it a chore for me to play Zigfrak. It conveyed a very unpolished and incomplete game which felt like it is still an "early" Early Access. Even if I got this at a low sale price, I just had to refund it.  If there was a controller/gamepad support, combat might feel a lot better. But then again without a complete overhaul of the interface and then some, it might not do so much good. I suggest the developer to also look at improving small details like how your ship responds when the forward thrusters are on. Similar games makes the ship react (and maybe even shake) and advance a little when the keypad is pressed to move forward. This, I think, adds so much to the feel of navigating a ship.\n\nEven though I said a lot of negatives, I can see potential. Maybe part 2 can be released in the future with a much better executed interface design and overall feel. Try lessening generic and unrecognizable elements in the game.

The screen throws so much information at you before you can even handle the basics and so needless to say, the tutorial (if there even is one, I can't quite remember), was obviously lacking.\n\nI expected some pretty enjoyable space action combat but was somehow met instead with a 'stare at your target and press space for 20 minutes' type of combat. Your ship didn't handle like a ship would, it was simply a 3D model in the shape of a ship moving in a 3D environment. Nothing you did in the game felt immersive. The massive and convoluted user interface that took up 40% of your entire screen space also didn't help.\n\nMultiple times have I thought about going back into this game and giving it a second chance but those attempts have always ended up with the game making me feel bored and uninterested.\n\nWho knows, maybe this game just isn't for me but as for my final judgment, I simply think I won't be going back for this game anymore as I have better ways to spend my time and find entertainment.","June 23, 2014","false","0.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Most of all, without going into too much depth, it lacks space combat. (there's your TL;DNR)\n\nYes it says up front it isnt a space sim however the game seems to only include flying about space to get somewhat close (like 50-80k meters) to interact with items a-la MMO style gather quests. The combat seems to require minimal strafing and flying as far as any tactical thought goes.\nIts about as visually siezure inducing as Beat Hazard and unlike a lot of discussions on the game I find the sound fx one of the strong suits. The muted sounds and faded ringing of a nearby explosion with the music seamlessly playing in the background is really great. Also the fact you and other ships get "pinched" by nuclear warheads EMP blasts going off as larger battlecruisers duke it out is a nice touch.\n\nOverall I think there is a need to dogfight in small fighters and slug it out in capital ships so being presented with those things and then not really getting it throws you off. (to the games defense Im not sure how big of a ship you might eventually pilot, so if this game shines flying capital ships later on please forgive my quick judgement). But for now it wont satisfy anyones urge to feel like they out-piloted the enemy. No, it mostly makes you feel like your loot and spacebar holding skills are just slightly above par.\n\nI feel like a 'do a barrel roll' comment is needed, I will amend as the game develops and possibly fine tunes its combat.","April 8, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Well, you pilot something, you point it vaguely at something which is trying to kill you, there's a lot of flashy graphical effects, things explode. There's loot everywhere. You scramble to collect the loot, it comes in a rainbow of colours and flavours, there's guns, oh dear god there's so many guns. You're spoilt for choice, it's practically like Borderlands all over again.\n\nZigfrak is a space.. game... sortof.. you fly around and shoot things, lots of things, and collect a lot of loot of various sorts to pimp out your ship with, as you level up and gain experience, the things you can pimp out your ship with get ever more ridiculous until eventually you're shooting drones armed with minature nuclear warheads (which will cause all kinds of hilarious screen glitches, no, do not adjust your monitor, the designer MEANT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN!), and your shield can withstand you being in close proximity to said explosions, mostly...\n\nOver the course of the game you'll obtain a dubstep satellite that explodes with the power of nuclear wubs, an inflatable mini party station that you can dock with and resupply at (which will also pump out some most excellent dance music), you will be exposed to cerulean blue and become addicted to this gorgeous colour. You will hack satellites via minigames. You will encounter Bear Grylls in a worm, and have to construct shoelace traps. You may end up eating shoes as a result. You will work for the space equivalent of the mafia, and for the pirates, and for the police, you will do all these things and yet somehow you'll still be managing to stick to some kind of overarching story which takes place on a very interwoven backdrop.\n\nThis game is the product of the mind of one man, and if this game says anything about his mind, it's that this guy probably should be in a room with nice soft padded walls, and his keyboard, monitor, and PC should be securely fastened to solid surfaces, and also coated with drool and chew resistant materials. Insanity does not even come close, yet for all the insanity, there's genius here, a rare diamond of genius that you really ought to try out for yourself.\n\nBeware the refreshing drinks though, I'm pretty sure he laced them with something dangerous.

For example you keep targeting ships even when they are dead and the only way to know they are dead is a new word is added listing them as disabled. This makes for a real problem when you have 5 or 6 dead ships and several live ones. You keep trying to target the ones killing you but the more you kill the worse the odds of targeting a live ship.\n\nWhat the hell?
