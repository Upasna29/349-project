"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Studentloans/recommended/24740/","Studentloans","Studentloans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Studentloans/","213 products in account","Burnout Paradise is an open world, survival horror game developed by Criterion Games, who are most known for making popular racing titles. The game is set in a horrific post-apocalyptic city, ironically called Paradise City. I can assure you however, there is no paradise to be seen in this hellish landscape.\n\nYou play as an unnamed, sentient car. The game revolves around completing the same missions over and over in order to upgrade your licence, to prove that you are king of the cars. The missions mostly involve destroying other cars, however, there are some racing elements involved here and there. As a working class peasant who cannot afford a luxury sports car, this appeals to my deep seated resentment of people who have more money than me.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT] The story is fantastic. Towards the end of the game, you discover that you are not the protagionist at all. In fact, you are the villian. The real hero of the game is a DJ driven to madness named Atomica. Who has been broadcasting Paradise City's only radio station the entire game. His true motives are to get all of the cars in the city to destroy eachother, so that he can free humanity from its chains and rebuild society. Many games have tried to copy Burnout Paradise's clever plot twist, and have failed miserably. Ken Levine, eat your heart out. You can never hope to recreate this masterful storytelling.\n\nIn summary, Burnout Paradise is a masterpiece. There isn't a single game in existence that can match its artistic calibre. So I award this game ten out of ten cars. You will never get TYRED of this game.\n\n(A lot of people are leaving comments pointing out the similarities to Yahtzees review. Fine, but Yahtzee wasn't the only person to think of this. This was meant to be a small joke amongst friends that just happened to get popular. Whining won't make me take it down.)","November 27, 2013","true","11.0"," 1,056 of 1,299 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","056","1","10","41"

Yeah, just another EA racing game released in the 7th generation, but it's a very special EA racing game released in the 7th generation. The best EA racing game released in the 7th generation. Hell, probably the best EA racing game of all time in my book (NFSMW, B3, NFSU2 are all extremely close).\n\nPROS:\n-Beautiful detail. Every crash and car looks spectacular, and some views are simply jaw-dropping.\n-Hours upon hours of replayability. And when you do get 100%, you have a nice feeling inside.\n-Some of the best licensed and original music. Also, incredible classical music.\n-An awesome city known as Paradise City. Pretty big, and has a personality of it's own, in a way.\n-Very unique things you can do in the game: Ever wanted to barrel roll an F1 car into a quarry while being stalked by Black Armored Cars?\n\nCONS:\n-Of course, with such a large world, there will be very tedious and annoying moments at times.\n-Depending on the person, this will be a glaring flaw: the only real character, DJ Atomika, is a bit of a jerk.\n\nReally good game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeevFactor/recommended/24740/","DeevFactor","DeevFactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeevFactor/","749 products in account","This is a great racing game that's all about driving in the open world of people-free Paradise City, of which the title song claims has green grass and pretty girls.  Along the way, you'll be bombarded with advertising billboards for such things like Burger King, EVGA motherboards, Crash FM, and this very game.  Sadly, you can only demolish one of these billboards, which keep reappearing continuously.  Somehow, I feel real sorry for the cleanup crews having to fix up the damage caused by driverless cars.  It's like Twilight Zone stuff, man!\n\nWhile you repeat the events that you've already cleared with each new license, you get to hear a selection of licensed songs that usually repeat a pretty good deal.  Or you can listen to past Burnout songs from a time Acclaim published those games.  Maybe you just feel like listening to that Avril Lavinge song over and over.  Did you know that song was also in Burnout Dominator AND in multiple languages?  There are also classical songs in the game, but nobody listens to those. ;)\n\nThe damage model is quite glorious, parts flying off, cars flipping about, and [my favorite /s] the game going into super slow motion because you were too slow in reacting to a barrier right in front of you.  It's like you know you're going to be taunted mercilessly, especially if you crash mere seconds before the time trial expires.  But if you feel like crashing into things and causing mass destruction, there is a Showtime mode.  It's not quite like the crash modes in previous games, but it counts for something.\n\nEven with the minor flaws like the lack of a certain bit of DLC that the potato consoles got to enjoy, super slow motion crashes that test your patience, and the general grind with each new license, this is still a very enjoyable racing game that people continue to play to this day.","September 28, 2014","true","18.3"," 67 of 72 people (93%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","93","67","72","16","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/24740/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account","A case of paradise found, or paradise lost?\n\nI've played all Burnout games since Point of Impact, except Dominator. Paradise seemed just as exciting as previous titles in the series to begin with, but by the end it became an exercise in anger management. Having completed it on the PS3 I thought coming back to it on PC was going to be a cakewalk. If only.\n\nEnjoying Paradise depends on a lot of ifs. Where you are at in the game, how much you intend to play, and how easily things annoy you, for starters.\n\nThe game dumps you on a map and basically says 'Enjoy!', leaving you to discover everything it offers for yourself. Perhaps the first and biggest wonder you'll notice is the miraculous lack of people - even the random cars you see on the road are all empty. Even your own car. Compared to games like GTA this is a bit of a sore point for me - having someone to run over and some voice-acting to laugh at would have been a nice addition. The only voice there is to listen to (besides the soundtrack / music) is DJ Atomica, who never ceases to bring you down with some disparaging remark when you lose an event. Sometimes he's ok, but the game would have been better off without his five pence of 'try harder' and 'the route you choose' bull.\n\nIf driving around in Robot City isn't a problem for you then you might like this title. There is a big garage of awesome looking cars to unlock, and the freedom of having a huge map fully unlocked already means you can pick and choose which roads to use in races and events. Occasionally it can get confusing, but the option is there to check an event's route before you start it, so you can take your time deciding how best to navigate the roads to get to where you need to as fast and effortlessly as possible.\n\nCollectibles include challenges (both offline and online - online lists challenges for each of 2 players through to 8 players); smashes (which are construction fences that often fence off short-cuts); billboards (for smashing through as well); and super jumps. Just finding all of these can be a chore.\n\nIn addition, each road has a fastest lap record to beat, and a crash mode record to beat. Some roads are little, others are huge. Crash mode isn't quite the same as previous games though, where you get a specific set-up and have a bunch of buses all packed together in the distance. Instead, while driving you can start crash mode at the touch of a button (but careful not to start it in the middle of a race). The goal here is to rack up a big $$$ of carnage, hitting traffic, buses, signs, anything with a $$$ painted over it. The event stops when your boost bar empties, but is filled regularly as long as you keep hitting things. This is one of the more fun aspects of the game, but it can be frustrating too, as all too often the crash traffic will spawn on roads you can never possibly reach, sometimes you'll see traffic spawn in the distance only to de-spawn before it reaches you (possibly because too much traffic is spawning on other roads), and traffic has an awful habit of avoiding your bouncing wreck trying to aim for them. Overall it's fun, but I get the feeling it needs a patch or something.\n\nEvent types are colour-coded on the map, thankfully, as there are over a hundred and finding what you want can be problematic. They are broken down into races, burning routes (car-specific race against the clock), stunt runs, road rages (using your car to take out other cars within a time limit), and marked man (which is the biggest pile of doo-doo since Jurassic Park).\n\nThe goal of the game is to keep unlocking new licences, ending with the Burnout Elite licence, requiring you to complete everything. Up until this last licence it is possible to avoid most events you don't like, but this last licence forces you into events you may hate. For me it was Marked Man - an event that is akin to a bull in a china shop, with you playing as the china. It seems to me too heavily reliant on dumb luck just to survive the longer distances - repair drive-thrus often being too few or too far away to be of any use. I see it as utterly preposterous and totally unnecessary. Sometimes all you can do is sit and watch in sheer disbelief as attack cars rain down on your humble car from every possible angle, sometimes t-boning you mere seconds after respawning, leaving you no room to escape at all. And to top it all off DJ Atomica will whine at you afterwards, saying you have no skill.\n\nApologies to my brother, Grunner, and my family for all the foul language and violence when I started doing Marked Man.\n\nIt's a shame but I believe Marked Man events will be a game breaker for perfectionists looking to get 100%. It can be done, but you may find items around you will get broken in your rage. Lots of excessive cinematics in the menu and waiting for cars to drop in before you can choose them to drive make the game unnecessarily longer. The menu is messed up to begin with - you use F1 and F2 to navigate various menus and a web page - not to mention the fail webpage that still tries to load every time you start the game.\n\nBut the visuals are pretty good considering the game's age, and the soundtrack is pretty beast. If you're a racing fan, need more cars to play with and there's nothing better out there, then you'll get this despite the menu problems or stupid Marked Man. Due to all the enjoyment I've had I can't recommend against it, but it's pretty close. 50/50. Racing probably isn't for me.","December 3, 2015","true","35.0"," 52 of 61 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","52","61","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/24740/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nWelcome to Paradise island, the island where you can run over almost everything, jump over everything else, and crash with little to no consequences. Burnout Paradise is an Open World racing game developed by Criterion Games and released in 2009.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You start the game with a quick introduction to Paradise Island, after your introduction you try to accumulate “marks on your licenses” to progress to the next licenses and unlock new vehicles.\nYou earn Marks on your license by completing the various challenges, there is always a challenge at every intersection.... leaving you plenty of races, bumper cars, stunt drives, and chases to keep people entertained.\nThe primary vehicles you'll play as are Cars, but they do have some motorcycles in the game and some “toy vehicles”. In general this has a lot of vehicles which are very much wasted on me, because I just crash into the other vehicles because I'm childish and want to play bumper cars.\n\nGameplay: There are three car “classes”, and different stats with each car. Stunt class cars will get you boosts by preforming tricks, Aggression class cars get you boosts by being a jerk (I really like playing Aggression cars and cackling evilly as I push an NPC into the wall), and lastly Speed class cars, which you fill by near misses, upon filling the boost you can preform “burnouts” which let you boost after your boost meter runs out, so in a way you could just keep boosting... as long as you don't crash in between boosts.\nLike most car games, there are also specific stats on the various vehicles, some cars have high Speed, others have high boost, and still others have high Strength. Speed = you go faster. Boost = you have more boost you can charge up. Strength = your car can take a bigger beating from the competition.\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements for this game, at this time. However there are plenty of in-game unlockables that you can obtain. It's important to note someday there might be steam achievements, because on the Xbox there are 60 achievements on the core game, + 10 with the various DLC expansions.\n\nPrice: Burnout Paradise is priced at $19.99, you can easily spend an hour for every dollar spent playing this game, there's a lot to do. That is the theme of Open world games. As I commonly do in my reviews, I suggest you wait for a sale to purchase this game, if you purchase it... I got my copy of the game on a Humblebundle.\n\nBefore you buy, one final note: There are a number of reviews out there on this game saying that this game has been falsely advertised. I cannot speak from experience because I never played this game anywhere else. You're only getting the core game with the Purchase of “Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box”, in other words if you look up DLC for this game, all of that is unavailable. You cannot even purchase the DLC on steam. For die-hard-Burnout Paradise fans, that's a tough knock. So it's worth noting that you're not getting “the Ultimate Box”, you're just getting the core game.\n\nConclusion: To quickly recap: Story – not really a selling point. Gameplay – fun, even if you're not very big on car and/or racing games. Very forgiving when you crash early in the game. Achievements – Nonexistent. Price – Fair, I suggest waiting for a sale. Remember – you're only getting the core game.\nAll in all, this is a fun car game which can be appreciated regardless of how obsessed (or couldn't care less) about cars. I recommend this game for people who enjoy racing games, or want to give a driving game a shot, keep in mind the open world aspect is a big appeal to certain gamers rather then others. (Open world is my favorite)\nAs always, thanks for reading my review.","July 29, 2015","true","9.0"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","22","27","5","0"

Then this might just be the game for you! Burnout Paradise isn't your usual racing game, but will still supply you with hours of fun!\n\nThe racing genre has many subcategories, and the burnout franchise might just be an entire subgenre on it's own. You still have the basics like racing of course, but EA has a different look at racing. You can crash into things, crash other racers, make stunts while still aiming for the first place.\n\nGameplay\nThe main concept is still the same. You are in a car, dropped in Paradise city, have fun. The physics aren't too different from other games, but I felt that drifting has been kept to a minimum. Which isn't necessarely a bad thing, especially not in a city full of buildings and other cars.\n\nLike I said before, you are able to crash into everything, breakable or unbreakable. Remember however, that it doesn't mean your invincible. At least, not in most events. Fortunately, there are several repair stations around Paradise City so that shouldn't be the biggest of your problems.\n\nYou start off with a basic car at a junkyard, and the game will teach you several things before you start the journey. However, it does barely to not teach about the controls, which is something you have to find out yourself unfortunately. If you're familiar with racing games, then this won't be any problem for you, but it may be annoying for new players.\n\nEach car has 3 stats, being Speed, Boost and Strength. It is up to you to seek the best combination which both fits your driving style and is the most useful in events. Events are scattered all around Paradise City, of which I have a few examples below:\n\nRaces - I can't make it more obvious. The great thing about Burnout however, is that you decide your own route. That's right, you are not stuck on a set route where you just have to show your skills and prove your the best. Shortcuts and ramps are your best friends in Paradise City.\nRoad Rages - Personally my favorite of the bunch. Your goal is to take out a set amount of cars in a set amount of time.\nTake overs - This has nothing to do with racing whatsoever, but it is still fun. Think of it as a minigame, where your car is like a ball, trying to hit as many objects as possible to get crash dollars, which are mandatory for completing the event. I will admit that this event gets boring after a while, and you have to do this event a lot if you're seeking completion.\nWhen you complete an event, it sometimes occurs that there's a new car racing through the city. You can take it out and add it to your own collection! Also, you get a new car every time you upgrade your license. Your license gets upgraded every time after you have completed a set amount of events.\n\nPresentation\nThe game is still part of the racing genre, but still does many things different from other games in the same genre. Instead of selecting events, you are racing through Burnout Paradise, which is the overworld itself!\n\nI won't touch the graphics however. Graphics is something strictly personal to people, so I can't give my opinion on that. For me however, the graphics are pretty good and fitting of the game. You can see far ahead of you and I haven't experienced any lagg or framedrops during my playthroughs of the game.\n\nWe now have Steam music, but I still want to mention that the music selection in Burnout is pretty good. There is music for everybody, from metal to opera to classic. Of course, there is also the narrator, being the dj of this radio station, who will give you advice during the game.\n\nThere are a few things I have to mention, that may not be appealing to several people. For example, cars aren't customizable. The only things you can change to your car are the colours. I personally don't mind this but I can understand that other people do.\n\nTo go online, you are also required to have or creat an EA account. It's not too big of an issue, unless you are strictly against it of course.\n\nThe final steps\nBeating the game isn't too hard. It only requires you to complete events until you got the final license. I would recommend trying to take on as many different events as possible, because otherwise it might become boring/repetitive over time.\n\nCompleting the game however, turns out to be a more difficult journey. The game does not have Steam Achievements, but there are in-game achievements called Paradise Awards. They are technically the same as Achievements, only that they won't show up on your Steam profile.\n\nI myself am not a completionist, but it does bother me that the game handles collectables rather poorly. There are Super Jumps, Billboards to destroy and Fences to drive though. Unfortunately, When you achieve a colletable, it does not show up anywhere on the map for example. You will most likely have find them all by the end of the game, but it's still a nitpick which I can't overlook.\n\nConclusion\nBurnout is a really fun game that I would recommend to anyone looking for a new fresh experience. People familiar to the racing genre might find a few nitpicks, but may still find a lot of fun here. And while this may be different from most racing games, this may still be a good starting point for newcomers to the genre.\n\nWhile not necessary, it is recommended to play this game with a controller/","October 25, 2014","true","5.1"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

It forces you to log-in via EA's log-in system, which is frustrating to no end before you even begin the game. Then it forces you to sit through an unskippable cutscene telling you how to drive a car, and how wonderful this great city you'll spend your time driving around in. Followed by a tutorial to teach you which button is the gas pedal. Followed by unskippable cutscenes explaining every single race. It's like they knew this would be a horrible game, so they make you sit through as many cutscenes as possible so you can't actually play.\n\nWhat was the biggest deal-breaker, besides the boring gameplay, the constant cutscenes, and the didactic edification? You can't quit the game without being froced to pass through EA's "Burnout Store" so they can panhandle you to make in-game purchases. Speaking as a lover of the Burnout series, this is a sleazy and nasty puddle of bile on top of a poorly made game. There are infinitely better racing/driving games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/24740/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This was one of the original break-em and smash them racing games. My first introduction to the burnout series was Burnout : Revenge for the original xbox. Revenge was action packed and had very smooth game play. This game compared to it's predecessor is good but lacks fluidity and solid core mechanics. I would recommend Flatout Ultimate Carnage over this as it has more mini games, is less of a grind and for me was more engaging. Unlike Flatout, Burnout Paradise let's you explore the open world with some new vehicle types.\n\nParadise city is an open world crash-em-up racer. The gameplay is pretty sound but can have some hiccups here and there regarding fluidity. You may drive around town freely and look and participate any event that is currently available to you. To start events, simply drive up to the event circle and press the gas and brake at the same time. These events come in the forms of Burnout Route/Burnout Ride (specifically for motorcycles) in which you race the clock for modified parts for your car, marked man which you race to a specific point while dodging enemy AI players trying to crash you, road rage mode where players are required to take out a certain amount of cars to proceed, stunt mode where air time, rolls and spins earn you points and finally Road Rules. There are two "modes" to road rules : time and showtime rules. Time is like a time attack whereas showtime requires the player to cause as much havoc to traffic as possible. The main sell point of this game is to do "take-downs", meaning taking out an opposing car. Hitting cars with a good momentum will send them on their way with a nice cinematic crash video effect.\n\nNaturally, as you progress through the game, you are able to choose different cars in your garage given you've completed different events and tasks. There will be random race cars sometimes cruising through the streets waiting for you to take them down. There is no real set agenda regarding which car comes first or which car you see. Upon catching up to them taking these newly found cars out, these cars will be added to your garage. If you don't manage to take the car down or don't feel like it, chances are it will appear again (so don't panic)! There are quite a few car frames to choose from such as cars, vans, police cruisers, roadsters, classics, SUV's, F1, motorcycles and supercars. Cars have three criteria/ratings in regards to their performance. The three criterion's are speed, boost rating and strength. Different cars prefer different ways to acquire boost. Some vehicles rely on speed, others rely on aggressiveness to fill their meters while another category relies on stuns. There are other specific boost types but are very particular to a small amount of cars. Some cars have such good performance (I'm talking the special cars you acquire way after) that they do not have boost.\n\nThe graphics are actually quite good and some of the crash effects and visuals are really nice to watch. Although be it easy to knock some players out, it is still satisfying to see everything break apart. The sounds are pretty good and do a decent job immersing the player. Car sounds and crashes have a pretty good range and don't sound all the same.\n\nThe game like I said is nice to play (with different vehicles such as motorcycles) but in my personal opinion is missing that umph factor when hitting opponents. The damage scheme is great, however the impact engine doesn't let you feel how hard you are hitting another car. For that reason I would have to recommend Flatout Ultimate Carnage over this game. If you like what you see then I recommend it, if you want a racing game with a bit more depth and challenges I'd go for Flatout. It's an average game in my opinion.\n\n\n\nRATING : 7/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story/Campaign	B+	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	B-	Overall	B-","January 5, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

It's okay, a little slow, and just generally "yep, that's a car". You can unlock more cars by encountering them in the large, open-world map, and then RAMMING THEM INTO ♥♥♥♥. Then, go get your new car, and go nuts. There are many kinds of activities to loudly persue while breaking all known rules of the road. Races, "Marked Man" challenges, Stunt Runs, and Burning Routes (which unlock an upgraded version of the vehicle they're associated with).\n\nNow, zipping around in singleplayer is fun, and lets you get acclimated with the gorgeous (even this long after release) world of Burnout Paradise. It also lets you get new rides, and so on and so forth.\n\nBut then you log into Multiplayer, and holy ♥♥♥♥.\nMassive, sprawling, high-speed BRAWLS of ten, twenty, however many cars just roaring along, causing destruction and mayhem wherever they go. Custom challenges, grudge-match crashing, and just general shenanigans are the norm. Think it was hard to nail the landing on a super-jump in singleplayer? Try doing it in multiplayer while four players in large, angry-looking SUVs try to ram you out of the air.\n\nIn summary: Good for fun, not so good for realism. Great multiplayer potential, but solid Singleplayer. Good price, good graphics, small size on Hard Drive. GREAT soundtrack, excellent open-world map, extreme replayability.","February 25","true","56.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","2"

"Boring", it makes it beautifully and generously amazing.\n\nafter a few hours of gameplay you can already feel yourself getting better, see yourself getting better, you can gradually see each new car going faster than the previous one which slowly but surely improves your driving skill, guaranteed no matter how bad you are/used to be in racing games.\n\nall in all, this game is a 10/10 would recommend to anyone, fan or not of the Racing Genre.\n\nAlso, DLC Related:\nIf you own the game on Origin, you can buy the DLC for a $1,70 or something... and this will instantly link it through origin to your EA account in Paradise City.\nAfterwards, when you run Paradise City through steam and log in to your EA account.. the DLC will be on your game, even on Steam.\nSo if you ever bought the Humble Origin Bundle, use that Origin key because it's still working! I just tried mine 1-6-2016.\nOtherwise you should buy the game on Origin as well, sorry :(\n\nPros:\n-Amazing music, loved it.\n-Rodeo flipped a big ♥♥♥ tanky Van sprayed with the Burnout logo, 10/10\n-Beautiful graphics.\n-Camera Angles on crashes/takedowns are great.\n-Remember DJ Atomika from your childhood PS2 game SSX3? he's back.\n-Perfect controller support, no flaws whatsoever.\n-Free roam map, player gets to choose where he/she wants to go, whenever.\n-70+ vehicles to unlock and choose from.\n\nCons:\n-You will crash, a lot.\n-^Deal with it, you scrub.\n-Just kidding.\n\nActual Cons:\n-Honestly, I can't say I found any cons, except for the DLC thing (In-game shop has been offline since the dinosaurs went extinct).\\n\nAny kind of rating for my review would be kindly appreciated!","January 7","true","54.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

So much fun, it still holds up today.  The game itself is great, but "Ultimate"... not so much.  There was more DLC available, but not all of it actually comes with this game, and you can no longer obtain it. :(  Still worth the purchase, though.\n\nUPDATE: More of the DLC is now available: the Bonus Vehicle Pack, which includes 4 separate add-ons previously available only on consoles.  You can buy a key for it on Amazon for $10, but as of just recently, you can purchase it straight from Origin for $1.49.  You'll need to register your activation key with Origin first (if you bought the original game here), and then you can get the DLC. Once it's registered on your Origin account, the content should show up in-game, even if you play it from here, as long as you're signed into that Origin account in the game.\n\nIt's still missing "Cops and Robbers" and "Big Surf Island", the latter of which is a huge disappointment, as it would have added a ton more content.  It's never been officially released for PC, but there is a (perfectly legal) mod out there (still in development) that actually adds most of the content that would have been included in these 2 additions.

Awesome game? I'm surprised to hear myself saying this but... no. Are the graphics sweet? Definitely yes and the damage to the cars as you drive really add to it. But no matter how banged up the ride, it doesn't seem to affect performance. Good thing too because the cars are not hard to bang up at all and it's a challenge to finish a race without a scratch. So what's this game missing that makes it miss it's mark with me? Surprisingly it directions. Nothing like being in a race and missing a turn and going from first to last because suddenly you have to back track or find a longer alternate way which by the way you can miss another turn on also. I'm sorry but in a high speed race I can't glance at a map and it's hard enough to notice my own race car's turn signal telling me a turn is coming up. Impossible if the rear fender takes damage. Memorize the streets? Sorry but I can't comment that kind work to a whole digital city. It's just hard to stay in a race if you don't memorize the turns and this city has hundreds of them. But on the plus side the city also has hundreds of short-cuts. Same problem for me again... memorization (Yea I know... misspell.) And some of those short-cuts don't let you off right away so if you take a wrong one, you are definitely out of the race. But the city in this game is beautiful and the cars are works of art and they all have dozens of variations of themselves. When you are racing you definitely feel the speed and as the cars get faster the speed becomes insane. This game falls just short of awesome but I'd recommend it just the same. Even with the headacks of getting lost in a race, it's still fun to play.","July 19, 2015","true","1.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

After that (and after you get used to the incredibly cheeky way that they swap the 'okay' and 'visit store' buttons all the time), you're confronted with an unskippable cutscene introducing you to Paradise City by the one female presence in the game; speaking in (what is supposed to be) a seductive voice whilst saying stuff like "here's the observatory".  It's ridiculous and cringe-worthy, and pretty much sums up EA's attitude towards women here.\n\nOnce you finally start playing, it's pretty much all good fun.  You can free drive around until you're in the mood to start a race by stopping at the traffic lights, and then you're dropped into either a A->B sprint, a 'takedown' contest where you've got to smash up as many cars as possible, the 'wanted man' event where two cars are trying to take you down whilst you try to get from A->B (my favourite), and finally the 'stunt' mission where you've got to jump and spin and do stuff to hit your target score.  After an ever-increasing number of these events, you unlock a new car - until there's no more missions left - at which point, I guess, you just free roam.\n\nIt's fun, but very repetitive, and I found myself having the most fun just by seeing how long I could go without crashing, and believe me- it's harder than it sounds.  This isn't a game that will entertain you for all that long; you'll have to make your own entertainment, so buy at the correct price-point accordingly.\n\nDefinitely not a wholehearted recommendation, but it's okay.

I want to start this review with pros & cons, but these are just my opinions.\n\nPros:\nVisuals -- The game is Beautiful --\nOpen world -- I played with a few NFS titles and Street Racing Syndicate, and i dont remember that any of them had a real open world racing, and I mean racing, not freeroam. Yeah, I was waiting for that open world racing, but i must admit, that sometimes its very confusing, when you dont know where the finish line is. --\nCar Damage -- Yeah!!! I like the slowmo car wrecking :) --\nAnd I think thats all of the pros in my opinion. Lets check the cons.\n\nCons:\nUI -- Dafuq!!! No speedometer, no tachometer... Is this a racing game or what? But atleast it has a Nitro bar... excuse me, a Boost bar --\nInvisible man -- I know that this is nothing, but this is not Knight Rider... I want a Driver in the driver seat --\nManufacturers -- Just avoid this if you wish, but the car and manufacturer names are irritating me --\nCar customizing -- Correct me if im wrong, but the car customization in this game is equal to zero... or almost zero... you can choose from a few colors and paint your car. Maybe I played a bit too much with NFSU 1-2, NFSMW and NFSC, but in a STREET racing game the lack of car customization makes the game rly boring rly fast. And for me the customization, new parts, etc. count as motivation... so yeah i lost my motivation --\nStory  -- I know, I know... if I want a story, then I should go and play Skyrim. But even in the NFS titles I mentioned before there were events and there was a main storyline, not so detailed as in an RPG game, but atleast I was motivated, but here... i lost my motivation twice. --\nPublisher -- EA... do I have to say more? --\nIngame Store -- Abandoned --\nConcluson:\n\nI really enjoyed the first few hours in this game, its an eye candy and sadly its only an eye candy, nothing more. Its the second day I play with this game, and its boring as hell. I know that my most pros and cons that I wrote are small things, but  small things can make the game good or bad. In this case in my opinion the game failed to be a Good game. Its beautiful, but not even close to be good.\nTo be honest, if u have the chance to win this game on a giveaway, or get it free, then give it a shot, but dont waste any money on it.","July 24, 2014","false","4.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The PC port works and plays wonderfully, albeit with a slightly broken store now (you don't get the Toys, Legends cars etc and they're unavailable permanently).\n\nBut the game hasn't aged a bit in seven years. It's got tight, fantastic driving controls, the missions are fun, and the free-form world, while it takes a bit of getting used to, is fun to explore and crafted incredibly with beautiful attention to detail on shortcuts, different areas etc. As a fan of collecting stuff in games as well, this game totally appeals to me - forget the events when I can go around smashing through all the shortcut gates, billboards, and jumps in the world while taking in the sights.\n\nFor five quid, this is a steal.

You have to know the map like the back of your hand, or constantly open the map menu to draw an imaginary track for your competition, which can get absurdly annoying while you are flying against the oncoming traffic.\n\nAs I mentioned traffic- this game has somehow too much of it. I know it is a racing game, but regarding the fact that tracks are not scripted, you can crash your car each 4 seconds of a race because of a missed turn or because of too much traffic.\n\nAt the beginning it is all ok, because the cars that you own are not so fast- you can predict your turns more easily and pass by the traffic, but later on it gets absurdly hard to get to the first place because of the high speeds.\n\n\nOverall a good racing game that is not so hardware-demanding, brings a lot of fun, but in order to "feel" that fun, you need to invest in a lot of time studying the city, the shortcuts, jumps etc.\n\nI highly recommend it.","August 27, 2014","true","13.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfodonnell/recommended/24740/","wolfodonnell","Bruno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfodonnell/","118 products in account","Okay so Burnout Paradise is really fun but I feel like it has lots of missed potential. Hear me out.\n- The open world concept is a really good idea, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to then focus all the attention in 8 points of the world map. You're basically making every other place look uninteresting.\n- You can pick up events all over the map... Or the city should I say, since the areas outside the city almost have none. That makes the areas outside the city uninteresting. After driving through the roads a couple of times I wouldn't have many reasons to return.\n- Having everything taking place in the city makes the map feel cramped and hard to navigate through. Burnout is not a game in which I want to go slowly so I don't miss anything.\n- Good luck exploring a whole city without turn by turn navigation. Nobody wants to open a world map while driving. No, the road signs are not enough.\n- The events in the city make you leave the city almost all of the time. Which means that if you want to play another event you'll probably need to return to the city, and that feels like a loss of time for the player. You should never make the player feel like their time doesn't matter, especially after rewarding them for clearing an event.\n- The events start to feel repetitive after a while. Even if there are many types of events, if you are always racing to the same place, it gets kind of boring.\n- It doesn't matter how high you score in an event since the only thing the game acknowledges is if you passed or not. A rank system would have made the experience a lot more interesting.\n- The menus don't feel natural at all, especially the d-pad menu. This menu demands your attention while driving (or even while an event takes place), and unless you stop the vehicle there's no way to drive and navigate through the menu without crashing. It doesn't make sense to put the "Restart last event" option in a place like that.\n- There's no explicit way to exit an event. You have to stop the car. I had to Google this. That is not good design.\n- The way to start an event leads to many accidental starts. You can't expect me not to push accelerate + brake in a turning point for any other reason than starting an event.\n- The classical music feels like a bad joke that was funny only the very first time. It doesn't fit in the mood of the rest of the game.\n- The idea of including different types of cars and adding motorbikes was nice, but poorly executed. It takes way too much time to find a junkyard and then change the vehicle for a certain event, not that it matters anyway because at least for now every vehicle seems to be fit for every kind of event. It makes me wonder why make different types of cars in the first place and not make just one kind. If you are going to make different profiles of playable entities at least give me a reason to use them. Choices should have a meaning in the mechanics, apart from the way the vehicle earns boost.\n- The respawn algorithm is just awful. Don't respawn me in front of a wall. Don't respawn me in front of a jump.\n- Takedowns don't feel as rewarding as they used to in other games of the series. Where is Impact Time? Why can't you do multiple takedowns at the same time?\n- No windowed mode?\n\nDon't get me wrong, as I stated earlier this game is really fun. But it could be a lot better and that bothers me.","December 16, 2014","false","12.9"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","25","46","0","1"

But EA shut the shop down only a few months after release. So despite those bits of DLC being in the game, you can never unlock them (through any legitimate means) because EA won't even sell them to you anymore.\n\nI still recommend it, with reservations, but I recommend the console versions even more if they're an option. Or you can just stay away and not encourage EA to behave like this, but they're not going to notice or care anyway, so... your call there.","July 20, 2012","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

EA being the scumbags they are, have shut down the PC store long time ago. So in short at start we don't have the DLC cars and bikes, plus the Big Surf Island update. But worry not, since on PC there is always a way, being the free platform. By googling Vanity pack and "Unlocking Burnout Paradise DLC" once can obtain them. Worry not it will not void anything, plus I think it is fair way of dealing with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from EA.\nAnyway onto the game.\nSet in Paradise City, BP is open world carmageddon with various vehicles all of them which resemble well known brands from "our" world. This way Criterion have carte blanche to do whatever they want to the cars, including showing you the most twisted and masochist way of wrecking them. Being car in BP ain't easy.\nWe have open world here and nods with different types of races, the usual stuff any Burnout veteran knows: Race, Road Rage and few new like Stunt Run, where you need to jump trough hoops, ramps, edges to bring up the score. The more stylish stunts the more points. Of course the more you play the more you unlock so exploration is rewarded, especially when you can find the various gas stations(boost refill), paint garages (so you can unlock all colors of the car) etc. helpful points of interest.\nTo be hones I was hoping to be something like Revenge and Takedown since I love the track designs there. I've seen all of Paradise and I already miss the alps from Takedown or the Autumn Peak from Revenge.\nStill Paradise is fun place to be with various stuff and conveniently placed jumping ramps. You have half decent soundtrack but you can always start your trusty mp3 application and spin some tunes if you want.\nNavigation trough Paradise city is stupid and annoying. You have compass over your head, who most of the times points the right way and god awful mini map which is static and I looked trough the menus and didn't find where I can turn rotation on, since when you are in dynamic races you can mistake your way fairly easy. Yeah sure, the incoming street names blink when you have to make a turn, but try doing that when you jet trough with over 250 km/h(♥♥♥♥ Imperial) trying to do 90 degrees turn. Sometimes it works, sometimes a big ♥♥♥ crash occurs with all of the racers.\nIn the end I bough the game for 1.50 euro so no big complains but I sure wouldn't buy it at retail price, especially with EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery ways pack behind it.\nA solid 7.5/10, fun game, oh and multiplayer is still alive.\n\nTL;DR:\n+ Same old fast paced mad racing speed\n+ Awesome car designs\n+ Nice looking graphics\n+ Not locked on 30fps\n\n- EA's doucebagging ways: no way to obtain DLC trough the official store, since it's shut down\n- Big Surf Island is not in this, so nothing that "Ultimate" about it\n- No crashbreaker, the good old slow - mo where you can control your wrecked car, and score "Aftertouch", instead we have some half - ♥♥♥♥♥ crash mode you can start at any point when you wreck... No that awesome as in Burnout 3 and Revenge\n- No really breath taking tracks like Alpines form B3 or Autumn Peak in Revenge\n- So - so soundtrack\n- Dumb and annoying navigation\n- No Crash Events","May 4, 2014","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

It's a few years old but it holds up well and has decent graphics. You can have fun no matter what style you prefer: road racing, stunt runs, crashing other cars and avoiding other cars crashing into you are all options. You will have to do at least a few races that are different from your favourite to progress in the game. There are also a bunch of discoverable things and jumps to keep you busy. Sadly the expansion packs aren't available because the Criterion store closed fairly soon after the game was released, although I understand Amazon has it for US customers only. It's a pity because I would really like to try out some of the cars in the expansions. All in all a good and fun game but don't expect any patches or bug fixes in the future.","January 30, 2014","true","19.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Need for Speed can step aside, this game is insanely playable and has fantastic replay value. The different types of available cars are well-designed and sync so well with how the game is laid out, allowing you to use a car that suits each race. The multiple types of races are normally very fun and hectic due to the open-world layout, allowing you to get an advantage through alternate or secret routes, keeping the gameplay fresh for hours and hours, never getting boring or tiring.

It's nice to see a game released where you can drive around exploring an open area, some games have that but they're not as fun to explore as Burnout Paradise. if you've played Burnout Revenge, and you remembered all 8 of the maps, this game combines all 8 of those maps from Burnout Revenge into one huge area you can explore. there's only one thing that makes it a little disappointing: there's orchestra music. I'm a huge fan of the burnout series and this is the first burnout game that has orchestra music. That's not burnout, Burnout's music is mainly techno, dance, or rock music. It's not all orchestra music, there is some techno, dance, and rock music in this game,  so it's not all that bad.\n\nGraphics: beautiful, this game runs great on my PC, no lag at all, graphics at high-resolution look great, better than on the console.[my PC specs are in my showcase box description]\n\nGameplay: smooth driving mechanic, very fun to drift around curve's and earn points in stunt events. It's nice to see interest points, like a repair shop where you can repair your car, a gas station where you can refill your boost, and places to paint your car even though the paint is selected for you at random. Also, some goals set out in the open world, like short cuts, Burnout Paradise bild boards you can break, and ramps where you can get high air jumps. which is a very cool idea if you're just exploring paradise city you can complete those tasks while your doing it. One thing it does need for the mechanic is a spedometer, that's about it.\n\nI'm going to score this game a 9/10, Best open-world racing game I've played yet. I'm a huge fan of the burnout series and I'm very happy that this game to be in the burnout series.","May 11, 2014","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like racing games, you'll like this one. It's non-stop addictive. One of EA's last good games.\n\nAfter picking it up with the EA Humble Bundle last year, I couldn't stop. There was just so much to do. You start smashing fences for a while and suddenly, a billboard comes into your vision. That billboard's going down. Get some air, bam, full boost, billboard down. So you boost around the city, smashing more fences, looking for those sick blue cone jumps, and soon you unlock some sort of trophy-award type thing. What is this? Searching through the arguably worst menu in history, I find the list of awards. The award you just got is about smashing something like 200 or 300 fences, and you discover that there are more awards! Some for jumps, some for takedowns, some for online things which EA really sucks at, and BILLBOARDS. You look around the map for billboards. Some you can't reach, and you have to figure a way to get to it. After defeating the evil red billboards, beat up all the yellow fences, you come home victorious to the junk yard.\n\nThen you start your first race.","October 11, 2014","true","22.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Of course, the gamepad works a bit better, but it's one of the few PC racing games i can say i'd actually play with the keyboard.\n\nSecondly, the open world is fantastic. It's really large, open to exploration, and just damn fun to drive around in.\n\nAnd finally, all the cars feel unique. Even the clones of the same car, such as the Customs, still feel really good, even different compared to the regular version.\n\nBut it does have some problems.\n\nNot gonna complain about the dlc, but what i will complain about, is the CRASHING. I don't mean Car Crashing, i mean the Game Crashing. It happens randomly, and there are no signs it is going to happen, just one second you're happily driving along, the next, the game crashes. And it happens ALL THE DAMN TIME.\n\nSecondly, while it looks great, there are some texture quality problems at times. That's all i'll say about it.\n\nI personally can say that i have enjoyed this game quite a good bit, but it's not without faults.

Nobody knew what was is in it, nobody was ever able to open it. It had strange letters etched into it, letters which kept the mystery surrounding this box, nicknamed the "Ultimate Box", going for years. What are these letters, you may ask? DLC.\n\nIn February 5th of 2009, humanity discovered a way to open this box. Simply by inserting money from your wallet or credit card into it's keyhole, for the first time people were able to do something nobody could ever do before; Play Burnout Paradise on the PC. With motorcycles.\n\nFollowing these events, video game megacorporation Electronic Arts claimed ownership of the Ultimate Box and began monopolizing it. However, if you are content with giving your money to the military industrial complex, take out your credit card and get ready to do something absolutely mind-bending.

(It's the hub world) It's awsome! Now do whatever you want and have fun!\n\nAfter that you are dropped into the garage or rather the wrecking yard and given a blue trashed looking muscle. Turns out your new half broken car works as good as new. While all this is happening you are being told, or rather hinted at, what to do by DJ Atomica. He's the guy who was the radio anouncer in SSX3.\n\nIf you have no idea who the guy is, he is basically your average cheesy amrican dj who, unlike in SSX3 (really good snow boarding game), is a jerk to you in this game.\n\nAnd although I can see where the game designers were coming from, they tried too hard in making him the 'tough love get backup on your feet guy' and made him a jerk instead.\n\nThe good news is, he is just there to give you hints and tips that you don't need, so just turn the speech volume to zero as no one else ever talks.\n\nNow back to the game play. (Note, this only covers the single player, as multiplayer needs an EA acount to work and I know what that means to some people, cough cough.) And it's some good game play, allright. For starters every single car in the game has boost (AKA nitros) and even the first one can get some serious speed going.\n\nThere are also 3 types of cars: stunt, race and takedown. Stunt, first off, is the basic one. Do crazy stuff like driving on the wrong side of the road, near misses, slamming civilans ect,  to get boost and use boost to go fast... realy fast!\n\nThen there's racers. Racers can't use their boost bar unless it's full. But using the boost until its empty is called a burnout. Burnouts fill at least half (usally more) of the boost bar, meaning that when combined together with reckless driving will let you do burnout after burnout, making you go much faster and further then a stunt car could ever go.\n\nOnly downsides are: 1# as explained before, the boost bar MUST be full to be used. #2 racers usally have worse turning than stunt, so you may end up crashing into something ( CURSE YOU BUSSES!) and losing all your boost. And 3# racers are weaker than the  other 2 types of cars, so it's harder to get take-downs with them.(Take-downs will be explained just about now.)\n\nLastly are take-down cars: they are the slowest but the strongest of the lot. With take-down cars you have a smaller boost bar to start off with than stunt cars, but the bar can be made up to 3 as big by getting take-downs.\nCausing your opponent to crash in any way, is called a take down. There are many ways you can take someone down, so heres a sample list: slamming them into a wall, landing on top of the poor fool, ramming into the back of them so the foe crashes into a  bus/other foe/brickwall, scraping the foe against a wall for so long that the in-game physics says "that's it, I'm outa here!" and the foe flips over the side railing and gets turned into scrapyard modern art. And so on...\n\nThen there's  the physics system which decides that you are awsome and that your foes suck. So them grinding you against a wall or ramming your behind will not kill you, but you will kill them when it's the other way around. This makes you feel like an awsome badass that cannot be stopped.\n\nThen there's the game types. 1# races. Races are the most simple. Get from point A to point B, only you can get take-downs the whole way. The early races are easy-ish but get harder and harder as time goes on until they get a tad frustrating. Just make sure you bring the map up(can be found in key bindings) and plot your course before you race.\n\nAlso, forget the piece of crud gps that's in the game. But when you start playing you may say or be thinking "Huh? What gps?" That's my point, the stupid thing is too small to see!\n\nNext up are time trials. However, unlike most racing games the time trials in this one give you a set time right from the beginning without any check points. Also, they each can only be done with one car. But winning with the said car gives you a slightly better version of that car with slightly more boost.\nBut if you're like me, you do it for the fun as well as a new paint job.\n\nAfter that there's take-down events. This is basically darby racing where all you have to do is take down a certain number of other cars and you win. But one thing I have to point out about this mode was how well it was done. In this mode, if you get too far away from the other drivers they spawn behind you. Allthough you can sort of tell when this happens, it means that there is no going the wrong way.\n\nUp next is 'marked man'. It's like a game of tip, only the other drivers are out to wreck your car and you have to get across the finish line. It's really as simple as that, exept dying too much causes you to lose but you can repair your car along the way  by using the auto repair shops.(More about them later.)\n\nLastly for the events there's stunt driver or something.(I forget what it's called) where you try and rack up enough points by doing stunts before the time runs out.\n\nThen there's shops. Auto repair makes your car as good as new, as well as giving you lives back in events. Paint stations give your car a random paint job.(Although choosing your own from the junk yard is better.) And finally the junk yard. It lets you change cars and paint jobs as well as use new cars that you unlocked.\n\nAs for the soundtrack, it might not be for everyone as the song 'Girlfriend' may be the worst thing ever for you. And the bunch of classical music they put in there is a bit weird at the time when you just rammed some car's wheel off and sent them to their doom.\nAlso, the songs stop whenever you crash, as a way of punishing you. But you can just avoid all of this by playing your own songs as from what I've experienced. The game alt tabs fine.\n\nI also recommend playing this with a controller as you can fine-tune your stearing more.\n\nJust a tip: If you're sick of the annyoning "tick-tick-tick" noise as well as the timers just press the D pad up until the street signs at the top of the screen turn green. Although I don't know which button to use on the  keyboard to change this, I'm sure it's somewhere in the key-bindings.\n\nSo all in all this is simply one of the best racing games I have ever played. So I'm giving it a 9/10 as it's just that good! Also, if you want to check out some of the other' Burnout Games' then avoid 'Burnout 3', but give 'Revenge' a try. As for  'Burnout 1 and 2', no idea as I don't have them.","April 7, 2014","true","78.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

This type of experience is not unique to just racing; in Football games you have NFL Blitz, and Basketball has NBA JAM. As with the others, Burnout Paradise offers over-the-top speed, jumps and crashes. This entire experience is similar enough to it's predecessors, but offers players the newer concept of exploration in an Open World environment. The updated game design, graphics and expanded multiplayer makes this a game that needs to be played.\n\nThe overall experience of Burnout Paradise is somewhat discounted from the other games in the series. Luckily this was neither a good or bad move on an already fun game, but a choice to try and update for the future of the franchise. Although there are changes like the Open World exploration, a majority of events made there way to to Paradise. Players can stop at many traffic singles and hold LT and RT to begin events like Racing, Wanted Man and Takedown. Additionally, there are events specific to each vehicle, which are acquired by taking down cars after major races. The final addition to Paradise was the introduction of Motorcycles. While not as simple as cars to maneuver through the city; they create a unique challenge for even the most seasoned Burnout racer.\n\nBurnout Paradise release on January 22nd, 2008 for the Xbox 360 and PS3. A little over a year later EA brought it to PC on February 8th, 2009. At full price of $59.99 many people would have snatched it up immediately. This also lends to the Metacritic score of 87 making it a very well received game. In my experience, which is being familiar with the franchise and game mechanic, I would give it a solid 8. In today's market, you can probably pick up the Consolehttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box Edition for $15-$20, and depending on the PC key sale, you can pick up the Ultimate Box edition for less than $10.  Well worth the money, the introduction of Open  World exploration, and the quick and painless way to find a new race event, made this a better experience.\n\n\n\nFoG\n\n#HistoryWillBePlayed\n\nThumbs Up!\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/fansofgames/b/585478673","November 5, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only does Burnout give players an open world, but uses a great way to unlock cars. There are many ways to unlock cars. From performing the same old race to driving down the highway to smash a rival that is in pursuit, Paradise is very edgy and also easy for players to level up and climb the ranks. Along with the open world and unlockable items, Burnout allows players to experience driving in a whole new level with a Slow-Motion camera designed to see crashes or takedowns in a whole new way. This feature actually makes crashing a little more rewarding (as weird as it sounds) than that of just completing a race.

No matter how many years have passed since it launched, I still come back to it to have fun racing and crashing cars.\n\nHOWEVER, beware many people, including myself, are having problems starting up the game. I believe the game servers shutdown, and ever since it's been a pain to get it working.\n\nStartup game homepage (there is an ingame browser that starts everytime you start the game, before opening the actual game) is broken, so working around this to get the game working is a painful process, unless criterion releases a game patch.\n\nIn the mean time, go to the file burnoutparadise.exe location (right click in steam game, properties, browse file location), and then in windows explorer right click the burnoutparadise.exe file, set it in compatibility with windows xp sp3, and that will do it. It did it for me, after a research on the web on how to make it work.\n\nIf you have the option to get this game on console, is a different story. The consoles work with no problem (ps3 and xbox 360), but the game will not be as beautiful as it is on PC.

But still, online/offline there is plenty to do in this game. There are three event types (race, stunt run, and road rage [online has challenges outside of these]) and 50+ cars consisting of three types (boost, rage, and stunt) that change how you play to fill up your boost. Your car selection is limited in online events (race, stunt, and rage), but has no restriction in Freeburn (online no event) and while doing online challenges. Offline play usu. requires specific vehicles to complete progress (i.e. dependent on event type). Regardless of online or offline play the entire map is completely open. Online you work with others to complete achievements or participate in events and offline you work to unlock cars.\n\nThe only issue is that the game will disconnect players from host (no dedicated servers) at times when the hosts start events, most regularly during races. Challenges do not seem to be effected by this issue. And there is no in-game chat ability other than a mic, which, thankfully, you have the ability to mute players if their mic has feedback or they are trolling.","February 25, 2014","true","161.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I saw this was up for grabs on a  Steam sale I jumped at the chance.\n\nThe game is not quite what I was expecting. It's very different to what I thought it would be. That's not to say some of the changes are not for the better, but on the other hand, some aren't.\n\nGraphics look brilliant, and the cars still have that same Burnout "feel" to them. The game modes all make a return too - but this time in an open world map. Think NFSU 2 and you will be on the right tracks. This is great, but you seem to spent a lot of time driving around for no reason. I would much prefer to just race and perform the stages without this unnecessary addition. The races themselves also suffer from the same problem of being given too much freedom - you will accidentally go the wrong way because you are concentrating on driving and not constantly looking at the map.\n\nO yes, and no 2 player split screen? Not good :-(\n\nBar the problems I have with it though, it's still a good game. Burnout fans will find something to their liking here.\n\nJimbo Rating: 5/10","March 5, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you just like the racing aspect, you got it. Do you just like showcasing cars in action? there's the stunt mode so you can take snapshots of your card in mid-air. Or you're like me and like crashing into ♥♥♥♥ and watching it tumble around, that's what road rage mode is for. Also, you can just activate this mode where your car suddenly starts flipping and the objective is to cause as much damage to other cars before you loose momentum.\n\nThis game still plays as good as when it came out and hasn't felt any older. The world is so big, some people can still get lost in the middle of a heated race in multiplayer. The variety of cars is there and each one drives really differently.\n\nI would buy it now since it still has people playing it.","December 20, 2010","true","59.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Still my favorite game of all time.  Open world racing, spectacular crashes, awesome soundtrack.\n\nVehicles: Cars handling is very arcade-y, but very fun.  There are a number of cars with twitchy handling that require more than just throttle mashing to win the races.  A Burning Route time trial event for each car unlocks a slightly upgraded version of that car.  The addition of motorcycles is a nice change of pace with their offline time trial events.\n\nStunt Runs, Road Rages, Marked Man and Race events can be played online or offline.  In addition, there are hundreds of online challenges for 2-8 players.  When you find a good group of online players, it is a lot of fun.\n\nShowtime: Crash your way down the road racking up as many points as possible.  Destruction has never been more fun.\nRoad Rules: Set a fast time for every road on the map.  You'll be cursing the traffic but that clean run is so sweet.\n\nCriterion, please take a break from Need for Speed and make another Burnout already.\n\nSidenote:  I played this game all the way through to 102% on the PS3 in 2009 and just recently bought it for the PC.  It looks SO much better on the PC.","December 26, 2013","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You collect these as you win races and challenges, both as rewards and as target which you have to take down in order to collect them.\n\nYou can play offline with challenges from simple races, not-so-simple races, stunt challenges and races where you are the target for other cars who are trying to destroy your vehicle.\n\nYou can also play online with friends and strangers, setting up races, simple ones or with multiple check points, car limits, boost limits or a free-for all. You will need a free EA/Origin account to play online and to add friends to your friends list requires installing Origin.\n\nThere are some annoying quirks (the UI navigation involves ESC, F1, F2 and Backspace!) and the theme song that plays every time you launch the game (To stop it: Go to Steam\steamapps\common\Burnout(TM) Paradise The Ultimate Box\SOUND\STREAMS and replace the file GUNS_AND_ROSES.SNS with a blank text file of the same name (including extension)) and there's this blank page that pops up requiring you to hit "Return to Game" every so often in the menu (The fix to that is to add  127.0.0.1 portal.burnoutweb.ea.com to your hosts file). I guess that's some hangover they forgot to fix when they stopped supporting whatever was on that page, but once you've done that, it's plain sailing.\n\nIt's a good little game!","March 14, 2015","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This DOES NOT include any DLC despite what the title says.\n\nI have been a huge fan of the entire Burnout series from day one it is an amazing arcade style game with a ton of different races and modes.\nBurnout Paradise is by far the most different of them all, think of it as Need for Speed (Carbon/Most wanted) and Burnout had a baby this is that baby unlike other Burnout games when you finish a race the game doesnt go back to any menus or anything it puts ou back into an open world where you can drive around doing whatever you want until you decide to race again which i always loved in the Need for Speed games that had it.\nBut like I said this is not the ultimate box so if you are buying it expecting DLC then just stay away but it is the base Burnout Paradise game which is an amazing game by itself idk if the online modes work or not I dont mess with those but the party play is fun if you have friends over and want to play each other.\nThe soundtrack like all other burnout games is awesome and the world and cars are beautiful this one really shows the damage done to your car better than ever before and the slow motion crash cam is great.\nI recomend it if you are ok with not having the DLC I suggest getting it on sale though but thats a given with any and all games to me.","June 18, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You do crazy stunts, crash your car into others for points, run from other racers chasing you, and just flat out race.\n\nAlso, the little mini challenges are nice.  Trying to beat the best time on a certain street really keeps the game interesting.

The fake city they use is very big and colorful. The cars look great and the damage model is very good indeed. I have not tried online play.\n\nThe biggest knock against this game besides the lack of a true gps system was that you could not restart an event if you failed it. Sure you could drive back to the event but that may be very far away and take a while. However that has been fixed and now you can restart a failed race removing a lot of the frustration I had with the game. The cars handle well and the racing is somewhat varied.

This DOES NOT include any DLC despite what the title says.\n\nI have been a huge fan of the entire Burnout series from day one it is an amazing arcade style game with a ton of different races and modes.\nBurnout Paradise is by far the most different of them all, think of it as Need for Speed (Carbon/Most wanted) and Burnout had a baby this is that baby unlike other Burnout games when you finish a race the game doesnt go back to any menus or anything it puts ou back into an open world where you can drive around doing whatever you want until you decide to race again which i always loved in the Need for Speed games that had it.\nBut like I said this is not the ultimate box so if you are buying it expecting DLC then just stay away but it is the base Burnout Paradise game which is an amazing game by itself idk if the online modes work or not I dont mess with those but the party play is fun if you have friends over and want to play each other.\nThe soundtrack like all other burnout games is awesome and the world and cars are beautiful this one really shows the damage done to your car better than ever before and the slow motion crash cam is great.\nI recomend it if you are ok with not having the DLC I suggest getting it on sale though but thats a given with any and all games to me.","June 18, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There aren't that many games where I'm thinking "Oooh ♥♥♥♥, I can't believe I'm moving this fast and haven't crashed", and just feeling in the zone while driving. The game has a few annoyances, like in-game billboards for real products (which feels extremely tacky and ♥♥♥♥♥y every single time and never wears off), and having to sit through tedious slow motion crashes over and over again, often crashing through no fault of your own. But overall it's a game I've come back to again and again.\nController support is excellent with the xbox360 pad (though there is a one-time bug where it doesn't get detected if you've already lauched the game without the controller installed, but deleting the .ini forces redetection).

Mostly from one of the games core mechanics getting a new car. To get a new vehicle you most 1st unlock it into roaming mode, from their you must find this vehicle some-where in your world (which isn't to hard since its always the guy going 1 million MPH in the corner of your eye) and run the car off the road killing the drive. From there to get the car you go back to the junkyard where you keep all your cars to find it how you left it (totally totaled) and switch and go to repair it. Also there a Type of Car in this game that promotes driving your fellow competition off the road to gain Nitro for a speed boat (which isn’t that troubling but I had to mention anyway)\n\nRemember those little "This is a game, Drive safely and wear a seat belt" notices whenever you start up a “Need for Speed” game (disregarding the 1st games of the series). Well like “Need for Speed” this game is also publish by EA but HERE THE KICKER, “Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box” lacks this safety message completely (in anyway shape or form).\n\nAll that time the public was worrying that “Need for Speed” will make their kids into driving lunatics (that’s why EA included that safety message in the 1st place), they were wrong\n“Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box” was the true monster, promoting players to murder other drivers by running them off the road to their deaths to claim there car latter in the junkyard\n\nAlso If your wondering about how good the game is in general. Its really fun, especially with friends.

You can't buy anything from the store, this is real $$$ by the way. That really let me down, this is just a game, not an 'Ultimate Box'. The game should come bundled with all the DLC for the game, not just have it installed and not be able to use it.\nSo just letting you guys know, this is a great game that was made ages ago but disapointing without being able to purchase the DLC cars.\nSo if your like me, and want the DLC cars, maybe buy a code before getting this, but if you just want the game, then by all means get it, it's worth it.\nAt least Steam Refunds are a thing so I can get a refund if I can't get the Delorean and if I lose interest in this game, which I doubt.","November 30, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is a classic and is really the best Burnout game in the series, I love this game personally and can play it for hours with its multiple missions and many different cars. The cars in this game... Well I love them really, starting the cars driving them at high speeds through the city and the hills. There are many DLCs ,which you know I hate, but there is a definate way to bypass that. The cars are all interesting and really fun to drive, the handling is very easy and you can definatley feel the freedom when you're driving.\n\nFirstly the cars in this are awesome! You can get many styles of cars such as: Rage, stunt, street and that wierd turbo thing that only lets you recharge... The entire car system has many different styles of driving, the cars can be stock or the upgraded unlocked version of the original car. You can get mini cars, police cars and many more random types of new cars which can only be found on the origin store. The DLC for paradise island is only avalible for the console versions of this game but you can mod it into the game which adds buggys and a whole new island. The entire games map is massive compared to new games and its nicley detailed, the whole thing has events placed "at every intersection" as explained in the first part of the game which is true! Events on every intersection which can be played again but only to beat your score.\n\nThe map concludes of beaches, mountains and city scapes with loads of driving to do. I had some technical problems with the game trying to set up multiplayer, EA actually sent me a copy onto my Origin account which then worked. The games multiplayer consists of free drive, races, stunt runs and free races (which is where you set up your own races for your friends). I like playing with my friends because you can have a lot of fun seeing who can get the biggest air alltogether in a certain place or just driving for fun. Multiplayer does have a negative side to it though, its very anoying to setup with multiple game platforms Steam/Origin but I was the only one with this problem.\n\nThe game does have DLC but noone wants to pay for that so some nice modding community have recreated Paradise Island from the Xbox and Playstation games, the mod also allows you to change cars at random points and adds all of the DLC without EA coming to rip your wallet apart. The DLC is quite fun and you can have lots of random moments with your friends. The mod also allows you to change to any citizen car with any paint scheme which is a nice feature.\n\nOnly problems that I had. On a Windows 7 Computer it worked fine for a series of time, it would crash ocasionally but that might of been because of my older setup. The game works well with old and new Windows but I had some problems with a Win10 machine, but my friends computer (WIN8) worked fine. I was trying to get the game running with two monitors but then I realised I my older setup was screen center to left which for some reason broke burnout completley but when I disconnected it, the game ran smoothly.\n\nYou can have hours of fun on any burnout game but especially this one with its free world and ability to choose to do missions when you want to. So I recommend buying this, but remember to play it with friends because it is extremely fun messing around with some areas!","December 3, 2015","true","39.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arubarius/recommended/24740/","Arubarius","Arubarius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arubarius/","145 products in account","The game is immense and easily my favorite car game of all time.\n\n75 cars in the basic pack, each with a basic "Type" which is how it accumulates boost. You'll be doing a lot of boosting. And they all feel a little different than one another. They have since added several different packs of cars, so many that I honestly can't count, with their own challenges. Every stoplight in the game is a different mission.\n\nThe game itself is pretty straightforward, there's a location at each compass point of the city at which all the challenges end, and they come in a few different flavors loosely coinciding with the car types.\n\nBeyond that, drive around a big-♥♥♥ city at enormous speed, creating breathtaking car crashes and listening to classic rock and trying to get your next car unlock.\n\nCons: Not gameplay related, but rather EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port programming. You will probably need to configure your own controls, although the game makes it pretty painless. I also had a problem caused by the game's attempt to take my picture for my driver's license (don't bother, it's VERY glitchy, but a cool idea)--every time I tried to open the menu it would crash. Fixed it by turning off the webcam driver (I don't have a webcam) in my control panel and it's been running smoothly ever since.\n\nAnyway, technical problems aside, this is the Skyrim of car games and you should get it if you have even a passing interest. I don't like racing games but I love this damn game. For 5$ in a sale, it's a no-brainer.\n\nEdit: in case you were concerned that my playtime is too low to be this positive, I have at least 30-40 hours on the XBox version. I was very happy to return it to my library on steam by buying it a second time.","January 6","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There aren't that many games where I'm thinking "Oooh ♥♥♥♥, I can't believe I'm moving this fast and haven't crashed", and just feeling in the zone while driving. The game has a few annoyances, like in-game billboards for real products (which feels extremely tacky and ♥♥♥♥♥y every single time and never wears off), and having to sit through tedious slow motion crashes over and over again, often crashing through no fault of your own. But overall it's a game I've come back to again and again.\nController support is excellent with the xbox360 pad (though there is a one-time bug where it doesn't get detected if you've already lauched the game without the controller installed, but deleting the .ini forces redetection). The graphics hold up well, while still delivering a rock solid 60fps on my (by now) mid-range PC.\nFor what it is - it executes very well.","September 23, 2015","true","46.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sutgon/recommended/24740/","sutgon","Sutgon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sutgon/","783 products in account","The game that's on top of my racing game list. This is just so brilliant game where you have an open world even during races! That's something that I like quite a lot. There are bunch of different events, all of them fun. I like Road Rage the most though. It's so enjoyable to just smash into other racer's cars to get a neat takedown. Everything in this game is just so enjoyable and fun.\n\nCars you unlock with amount of wins you have and via completing a car's Burning Route, which is basically a race alone with a time limit. The cars are different. Not just the looks and speed, but also boost "strength" and car durability. Last one is quite important for Marked Man (event where you got to race to the finish without other "racers" totaling your car too many times) and Road Rage. The cars all handle differently too.\n\nAll in all, if you like racing games even a tiny bit, you'll most likely like this one quite a lot. Did I say that the music is great, too?\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfnTB7bOplk","July 30, 2015","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is a classic and is really the best Burnout game in the series, I love this game personally and can play it for hours with its multiple missions and many different cars. The cars in this game... Well I love them really, starting the cars driving them at high speeds through the city and the hills. There are many DLCs ,which you know I hate, but there is a definate way to bypass that. The cars are all interesting and really fun to drive, the handling is very easy and you can definatley feel the freedom when you're driving.\n\nFirstly the cars in this are awesome! You can get many styles of cars such as: Rage, stunt, street and that wierd turbo thing that only lets you recharge... The entire car system has many different styles of driving, the cars can be stock or the upgraded unlocked version of the original car. You can get mini cars, police cars and many more random types of new cars which can only be found on the origin store. The DLC for paradise island is only avalible for the console versions of this game but you can mod it into the game which adds buggys and a whole new island. The entire games map is massive compared to new games and its nicley detailed, the whole thing has events placed "at every intersection" as explained in the first part of the game which is true! Events on every intersection which can be played again but only to beat your score.\n\nThe map concludes of beaches, mountains and city scapes with loads of driving to do. I had some technical problems with the game trying to set up multiplayer, EA actually sent me a copy onto my Origin account which then worked. The games multiplayer consists of free drive, races, stunt runs and free races (which is where you set up your own races for your friends). I like playing with my friends because you can have a lot of fun seeing who can get the biggest air alltogether in a certain place or just driving for fun. Multiplayer does have a negative side to it though, its very anoying to setup with multiple game platforms Steam/Origin but I was the only one with this problem.\n\nThe game does have DLC but noone wants to pay for that so some nice modding community have recreated Paradise Island from the Xbox and Playstation games, the mod also allows you to change cars at random points and adds all of the DLC without EA coming to rip your wallet apart. The DLC is quite fun and you can have lots of random moments with your friends. The mod also allows you to change to any citizen car with any paint scheme which is a nice feature.\n\nOnly problems that I had. On a Windows 7 Computer it worked fine for a series of time, it would crash ocasionally but that might of been because of my older setup. The game works well with old and new Windows but I had some problems with a Win10 machine, but my friends computer (WIN8) worked fine. I was trying to get the game running with two monitors but then I realised I my older setup was screen center to left which for some reason broke burnout completley but when I disconnected it, the game ran smoothly.\n\nYou can have hours of fun on any burnout game but especially this one with its free world and ability to choose to do missions when you want to. So I recommend buying this, but remember to play it with friends because it is extremely fun messing around with some areas!","December 3, 2015","true","39.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlancnOut/recommended/24740/","BlancnOut","BlancnOut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlancnOut/","109 products in account","Burnout is my favorite racing franchise of all time, I've played the previous titles and loved them to bits. Quite literally. I was always astounded at how beautiful (ironically) crashes in the game can be. The crash physics are wonderful and smashing into cars in road rage is a very pleasant feeling to me. The cars in the game are for the most part, unique and handle differently. Some cars cannot turn fast, forcing you to use the handbrake at sharp corners, and there are some cars that slip and slide everywhere, making it easy to swerve into oncoming traffic, but can drift without issues at sharp turns. The drifting in this game feels amazing; especially when you're driving real fast in a race late in the game when you get the really fast cars.\n\nThere are 5 different race types in this game: Race, Road Rage, Stunt Run, Marked Man, and Burning Route all of which are special in their own way.\n\nRaces (AKA: Point A to Point B) always make you feel like you're going fast, and doing multiple burnout chains is satisfying. Stunt runs are what they are implied to be, just jump off ramps, boost, and drift to rack up points (these are my least favorite). Road Rage is basically a timed, fast paced demolition derby, and holy crap, it is awesome! Just wreck other drivers and reach the takedown score to win. Marked Man is a bit of a spin on Races and Road Rage. In Marked Man you have to race from point A to point B. The catch is there are drivers trying to prevent you from reaching your target by smashing your car, survive till the finish and you win. Burning Routes are probably the simplest to grasp, just make it to the finish in time and win an upgraded version of the car you're using.\n\nThe core game is fantastic in and of itself, however I think it would be best for everyone if I mention how well the online portion of the game is. Freeburn online is a very enjoyable experience if the host actually makes the experience fun for everybody. What I mean is when you're playing online the host can make events that everyone can participate in, and these while limited are very enjoyable when alot of players partcipate. Marked man online is so much more thrilling than offline in my opinion, especially when there are 7 players trying their best to take you down. There are loads of challenges that the players can particpate in, and the challenges change with the amount of players, so there's always something to do.\n\n(As far as I know, you can't join a friend's server via steam, you have to it from in game, via the search option.)\n\nThe thing to watch out for is that this game does NOT come with all the DLC. "The Ultimate Box" just gives you access to two online only cars, that don't even have boost. It also gives you party mode, which is useless to anyone, unless they share the computer with a friend; it's kind of like pass the controller. A mode with bikes, which is completely seperated than the cars, they have their own races.\n\nI heartily recommend Burnout Paradise to anyone who loves a good racing game, with great crash physics and a fun online mode.\n","March 11, 2014","true","20.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've seen what Criterion have done to the NFS franchise, which wasn't exactly stellar but it was fun, and figured they'd done more of the same with the Burnout series. But I am really enjoying this so far. The driving is direct and responsive, taking down an aggro car with a speed car is super satisfying too, that slow mo crash gives you that much loved moment of smugness. Graphically it's quite pretty for its year and it runs really well even on low end machines. So in summation, it's a damn fun game, the shelf life to cost ratio is damn high too. I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys racing games and those that enjoy a good hit and run, arcade style racer too.","July 4, 2014","true","14.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trial_effects/recommended/24740/","trial_effects","AnnoyingCoder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trial_effects/","154 products in account","Graphics\nWell detailed game. You can read (albeit dangerous) the license plates on other cars. The lighting from the sun shines off high gloss paint jobs like in real life. The small detail damages are realistic; if you broke a headlamp it stays broken and doesn’t light up. The back ground is realistic enough to tell distance. I’ve played this at both regular television and hi definition 1080p while it is still good at the lowest setting I highly recommend the playing at the highest possible detail.\n\nSound and Music\nYou can tell from just driving around what types of cars are around you with even having to look at that area. The screeching of the tires to the roar of an engine is clear with any vehicle you use. Now the music, quantity or quality wise you will not be disappointed. There are a lot of songs that play while driving around so chances are if you play for an hour or two, you will not hear the same song twice. And you don’t like a particular song you can always take if off the play list. One should note that a good portion of songs are the same songs from older Burnout Games.\n\nGame Play\nAs you win events you upgrade your license. The higher the license, the larger amount of vehicles you will be able to use. These events are littered all thought Paradise City. To start the event simple pull up to a light to start it.\n\nHere is the events.\n\nRaces: Standard Race. From one to seven other opponents you drive to a specific end point.\nRoad Rage: Timed Event. You use your vehicle as a battering ram to smash other vehicles into traffic, walls or other hard objects. Target amount is usually displayed. Event ends when either you take to much damage or time ends.\n\nMarked Man: Almost like a race. You goal is to reach one destination while four other computer cars try to inflict enough damage to keep you from reaching your destination.\n\nStunts: Use your vehicle like a little acrobat, jumping off ramps, crashing bill boards and doing spins. The more you do in a sequence the more points you get. There is a target score to get per event.\n\nBurning Route: One route per vehicle. It’s a timed race where you just have to get to the finish line by a certain time using a certain vehicle. Every route you finish unlocks a upgraded version of the vehicle used.\nAll these events get a bit more difficult as the game wears on but not that much more. I would say once you get used to the way the game plays you find that most of these events range from easy (one or two attempts) to medium (fifteen minutes maximum).\n\nNow there are a few side events or tasks that are fun to do. Running certain billboards, barriers, and super jumps. They are littered everywhere, cant be avoided just driving around. There are few hidden but find to fun all of them and as a reward for finding all it unlocks more vehicles. There are also two events per street, one is time trails and the other is showtime. Showtime is just you bouncing around hitting vehicles for points.\n\nOnline play is quite fun with tasks and races, connections are usually stable. One thing I like is with Xbox Live Vision take a photo of you when you get taken out by another drive and sent to the aggressor. The online experience is a whole new game in itself and worth playing.\n\nNegatives\nAlthough it’s a very good game here is a few of the things I didn’t like. Showtime is very repetitive in the sense you have to do it to all 64 streets of Paradise City. Also Showtime replaced Crash from previous games. The on line challenges are very repetitive where if 2 players you have to do it for 7 players. And some of them are very very basic like driving in oncoming traffic. Also while doing online challenges if one person get disconnected, the challenges are cancelled. The difficulty level is somewhat misleading as the more cars you unlock the easier the game is when trying to do the events.\nOne last thing that kind of surprised me is the amount of advertising in the game, from billboards to vans there is way too much advertising in this game. To show how much advertising there are four unlockable cars, all of them are plastered with the names.","February 21, 2014","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's typical Burnout: silly, crazy fun with lots of different race modes in a gorgeous open-world.  Unlock better cars at junkyards, learn bigger and better stunts, beat the fastest record for a myriad set of roads or survive brutal races where you must smash a given number of cars out of the race.  For those who find bikes more fun, this is two games in one!  You can start the game in car or motorbike mode instead, with just as many stunts and unlocks to achieve.\n\nThis game is also fun for people who don't generally enjoy racing sims.  It's very much arcade-style yet car handling is great with a variety of camera modes to choose from.  The AI is really well made (no rubber-banding or artificial 'cheating' that AI opponents in other games can display).  The difficulty level increases gradually and at the right pace.  It's all enormous fun, light-hearted yet challenging in all the right places.\n\nThe only problem I've experienced with the game is getting my G27 Logitech Wheel working nicely with it.  People can and do have success, but my wheel has a continuous, strong pull to the left in this game which I cannot resolve.  Your success might vary, and this article[solidlystated.com] (http://solidlystated.com/software/logitech-g27-burnout-paradise/) is essential reading to get your wheel recognised and configured correctly.  Alas, my wheel pull was too much so I stick to a very old and loved Microsoft Sidewinder stick or my XB360 gamepad - still great fun!","March 13, 2015","true","47.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Oh and, after a few tries it's not a bad thing), takes too long to get into my destination and I don't even know where to go and I screw up (but then I realized there's "Easydrive"), I can't hear a such THING when I have every sound level the highest of my game (I don't want to have more than 10% volume, because then I would be ear-♥♥♥♥♥ by a Microphone beep/voices or Steam message/online sounds. But then it's normal...) and no crashbreaker on Showtime or it's not like a Crash mode anyways.\n\nThe showtime is like the recent game "Burnout CRASH!" with infinite Aftertouch function instead of Crashbreaker and it ends only when you run out of boost and your car stops. Also why are the records so impressive (minimum a million dollars) on this mode?\n\nAnother problem is that unfortunately Electronic Arts has abandoned the in-game Burnout Store, which makes it impossible to buy the rest of this game's DLC (Cops and Robbers, Toys, etc.) unless someone knows how to use Amazon. They are still purchasable on Xbox 360 however.\n\nThere's also a DJ guy that talks random ♥♥♥♥ between music tracks and tells the objective of many races/events, just like in Burnout 3, except this is totally not our beloved Stryker but that ♥♥♥♥er named "DJ Atomika" from the SSX series. Didn't you know that Stryker already has a job as a DJ for KROQ-FM and he was sent to EA Studios as a guest for just one time? It's not like he's gonna be a Crash FM DJ for every single game for the Burnout series, but still, he was the best in my opinion.\n\nDon't know about you, but it personally looks like Rockstar Games' Midnight Club with a few of Need for Speed's functions slapped on. Overall 6.4/10. Although earlier I was like a "♥♥♥ ZOMFG DIS GAEM IZ ♥♥♥♥♥ -1/10 MAEK BORNOWT TREE ON STIM!!11" guy, but then it was my first time playing...","May 3, 2014","true","33.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

I've seen what Criterion have done to the NFS franchise, which wasn't exactly stellar but it was fun, and figured they'd done more of the same with the Burnout series. But I am really enjoying this so far. The driving is direct and responsive, taking down an aggro car with a speed car is super satisfying too, that slow mo crash gives you that much loved moment of smugness. Graphically it's quite pretty for its year and it runs really well even on low end machines. So in summation, it's a damn fun game, the shelf life to cost ratio is damn high too. I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys racing games and those that enjoy a good hit and run, arcade style racer too.","July 4, 2014","true","14.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This product automatically comes with the Motorbike DLC from the Burnout Store, so that's an added plus for additional content. I just wish this game was integrated into Steam more, such as mirroring the in-game achievements with Steam Achievements, making the DLCs puchasable though the Steam Store, and adding Steam Trading Cards.

If you want to retry a race YOU MUST DRIVE BACK TO THE STARTING LINE.\n- Repairing your car or switching cars between races requires driving to a repair shop or junkyard, which is extremely tedious.\n- The menus are incredibly unintuitive (I had to google search to figure out how to quit the game and how to quit an event)\n\nPros:\n- Exploration and finding secrets is really rewarding\n- The stunts are just awesome\n- Car handling is good\n- It is fun, despite the cons.","August 18, 2013","true","27.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It's nothing like other racing games. It's really fun cruising around with your buddy around Paradise city but other than that the game didn't really hold on to me. I guess some people may enjoy it but I think that it isn't actually an amazing game. It's more of a game you play when you don't have nothing better to do and you've got time to waste. If you like arcady driving controls then this is a must get, if you are a fan of need for speed or forza or grand turismo first try this game before buying it. It's not really for everyone. And if you decide to play it don't judge it rashly, because the driving is really diffrent then in other games, you gotta let it sink in. Oh and graphicly this game being that it's from 2009 is bloody amazing.\nTL;DR: If you don't like arcade racing games don't get it but try it, if you like arcade racing games get it.

It's not challenging.\n\n"Here's a race, just drive down this straight road. Oh, great, you've done it! Here's a new car!" Seriously? Even with a B-licence greatest challenge is not to miss a road during a race, which happens way too easy, because the mini-map doesn't rotate in your driving-direction. But even when you take the wrong exit you can still win the race, because your opponents are pretty slow. So just drive on, if you get totally lost, there's a way to restart the race anyway. Even though you can't win anymore (2nd place doesn't count), you have to finish. Then drive back and start again.\n\nThe open-world-A-to-B-races just make you take the easiest (straight) road again and again. Because they work. Looking for a cool shortcut? Trying another route? Way to risky. Trying to break through a wooden fence may be succesfull... or end in a boring, unskippable slow-mo-crash-sequence. And not every crossing on the map is really one, because the road-height-levels aren't displayed.\n\nThere are good things about this game. The world is nice, many things to "collect", great soundtrack. But for me there was nothing motivating.\n\nI tried several times to find something. Something challenging. Mostly I left the game after about 30 minutes, because I couldn't find it. I guess I'll go back to NFS Most Wanted (2005) again...","April 30, 2015","false","3.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","3"

My three year old absolutely adores this game, and consequently we've played it quite a lot. This is his first experience with the series, it may well be my last. He has no concept of how many aspects of the series were sacrificed in the insane pursuit of an 'open-world' approach to racing games. He will perhaps never grasp how hollow every aspect of the game now appears in the light of a proceedurally-based sunrise, from the crashes, to the super jumps, to the minor variations on 3 routes that win all the races, to the billboards the game begs you to smash, defiling it's own logo OVER and OVER and OVER, as if the developers were working through some emotional issues. If the obvious cover-up done on the Van's paintjob is any indication, it was a cukolding experience for them. Oh, Criterion, remember when you were making Burnout 2 and Black? What led you to blue barrels and yellow construction signs acting as surrogate blues clues for toddlers?\n\nIn any case, by 'Ultimate Box' what EA meant to say was "Box full of DLC for you to pay for", as this content isn't even Downloaded, it came with the game, you just have to pay to use it. That's right, there are several packages of cars just waiting to be unlocked for extra money, including the hovercraft delorean which makes every other car in the game seem lame. Oh wait, it's not actually a delorean, because EA had to slavishly rip off a bunch of brands without accrediting them. The car that looks like a Bel-Air has freakish air-time, making it the only candidate for completion of several achievements/unlocks.\n\nAnd they put motorcycles in this game, probably to taunt you with how much you can taste an awesome Road Rash remake, but rest assured it's completely neutered, uninspired, and honestly looks like they just walked away before they got anywhere with that particular aspect of the game.","August 19, 2014","false","327.5"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

You should know, however, that it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world in which the human race has been utterly eradicated by a race of sentient vehicles who now freely roam the streets and occasionally rally terrifying black-clad death squads to murder each other for no apparent reason. They also have inexplicably created an awkward computer program (robot?) responsible for maintaining a lurid facade of human culture through insipid daily radio broadcasts to nobody in particular--perhaps to subconsciously placate the few remaining humans they have trapped in stasis for unanticipated future exploitation? The developers have sold themselves short by failing to highlight these key plot points in the game's summary.\n\nI challenge anybody to observe the complete lack of pedestrians, the fact that none of the cars have drivers, and the radio announcer's bizarre sense of humor and delivery style, and come to any other conclusion about this game's backstory. Driving through this environment is subtly unnerving after a while, evoking a sensation similar to observing desiccated corpses on Miranda and trying to figure out what the hell happened here. 11/10, would play again.","March 12, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And you don't have to do the challenges until you want to (completing challenges unlocks more vehicles). Although the game does have some MAJOR flaws (some of which are just plain stupid and should have been changed/fixed). There is no speedometer at all. You can't listen to your own music files on your computer while playing the game unless you run your own media player in the background. If you're playing online and your framerate gets too low, the game automatically kicks you from the server (even if it's your own server that you're hosting). Yes, you can get kicked from your own server if your framerate gets too low. There is no in game text chatting. You have to use a mic to communicate with other players on a server. As you upgrade your license, the races get MUCH harder because the AI will very often put cars right in front of you which are almost guaranteed to make you crash over and over. If you go too fast, you are very likely to crash over and over. If you take your time, it can be hard to get to first place. So it's a pretty good game, but with some MAJOR flaws. This game has given me an idea as to why EA was voted the world's worst video game company multiple times.

Much better than Need for Speed.\n\nBurnout Paradise takes from previous Burnout titles the insane speed, and emphasis on wreck or be wrecked style of racing that has been cloned now in several other arcade racing titles. But nobody can do it better than Burnout. What Paradise adds over previous Burnout titles is an open world hub to race around in be it on 4 wheels, or now on 2 wheels with the addition of motorcycles. Open world gameplay adds a new spin on progression, as expected, and also opens up point to point races in a whole new way. No more barriers. The other cars go left? You go right. Right to the finish line. Or right into a brick wall.\n\nGranted, this is still an EA title, so there are some annoyances. Lack of DLC over on the steam version being one. Also, poor update support. And on top of that, EA's signature annoying announcer, unskippable cutscenes, and a soundtrack that can not make it's mind up. Guns N Roses, Faith No More, Soundgarden? Nice! Avril Lavigne.....WHAT? Okay. Nitpicking the last few parts. But anyway, the ultimate box is quite nice for the price!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toad004/recommended/24740/","toad004","toad_004","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toad004/","199 products in account","I was a major fan of Burnout, especially Burnout revenge (this game's predecessor). But this game completely changed the Burnout formula - it's NOTHING like the previous titles.\n\nThe first problem - and the biggest by far - is the extremely poor menus. How many racing games since 1996 have lacked a 'restart' feature? If there's no way you're going to win the race, there's no way to stop. Then, when you do finish, you need to manually drive back to the event's starting point if you want another chance. Why can't you restart the event like every other Burnout title - or indeed, every other racing game?\n\nIn fact, EVERYTHING is done by manually driving to it. Want to use another car? Drive to the junkyard. Want to race? Drive to the starting line. I understand the upsides to this feature - driving through a gas station fills your boost meter, and  driving through a repair center fixes your car, and this awesome feature can completely turn a race around. But why do you need to do this when you're NOT racing? And why do you need to repair your car BETWEEN events - it's just tedious busywork. In fact, you'll spend more time with this busywork than actually racing. In every race, marked man, and time trial event, the finish line is always one of 9 locations on the edge of the map. Since all the starting locations are at intersections and most of the intersections are near the center of the map, you'll always finish an event as far away as possible from starting your next event.\n\nThis could all be forgiven if the actual gameplay was fun. The problem with the gameplay is two-fold. First - your AI opponents are far too easy for most of the game. You'll finish every race event at least 10 seconds ahead. The Destruction Derby event usually requires you to takedown 3 or 4 cars when you can easily takedown 15 (these events also force you to keep playing AFTER YOU ALREADY WON until the time runs out). Marked Man - the anti-destruction derby where your goal is to survive constant takedown attempts against you - has opponents that can barely turn and get lost easily.\n\nNot that I can blame them - the player can get lost easily as well. You see, the whole idea of Paradise city is that there are no 'tracks', just a starting line and a finish line, and you decide your route yourself. Not a bad idea in concept, but it doesn't work in practice. The obvious problem is the player can and will make wrong turns - one wrong turn can cost you the race. The game tries to guide you... with street names. When you're racing through the city at 200 MPH, you can't tell which of those 5 turns you're about to pass is Hamilton Ave. Even worse, your AI opponents completely ignore this premise, they almost always all follow the same route.\n\nThere's a reason they stopped making Burnout after this.","November 28, 2013","false","1.7"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","2"

Around the fictional setting of Paradise City cars are meant to be smashed, shortcuts and super jumps discovered, and multiple routes toward the same finish line exploited. Winning challenges nets you new rides and better licenses to take on more difficult challenges. The city itself isn't a metropolis teeming with life--you won't see pedestrians wandering around or anything like that--but there's plenty of traffic on the roads and shortcuts to discover as you freely drive around. While in the confines of your car you can pull up at stoplights to trigger events of different types, like stunt challenges, races, marked man (reach a finish line while other drivers try to smash you to bits) and road rage (destroy a set number of cars within a time limit) events, as well as timed runs. The soundtrack is really nice because it suits the atmosphere of the game. What could possibly be better than speeding down the highway through the thick traffic while being chased by 3 heavily armored vehicles and listening to some classic music. The game has a pretty big and nice collection of classic tracks that I enjoy most. Anyway, if you're not really into racing games, but you do want to play something like that - Burnout it is.\n\n\n\n10/10","August 24, 2013","true","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Much better than Need for Speed.\n\nBurnout Paradise takes from previous Burnout titles the insane speed, and emphasis on wreck or be wrecked style of racing that has been cloned now in several other arcade racing titles. But nobody can do it better than Burnout. What Paradise adds over previous Burnout titles is an open world hub to race around in be it on 4 wheels, or now on 2 wheels with the addition of motorcycles. Open world gameplay adds a new spin on progression, as expected, and also opens up point to point races in a whole new way. No more barriers. The other cars go left? You go right. Right to the finish line. Or right into a brick wall.\n\nGranted, this is still an EA title, so there are some annoyances. Lack of DLC over on the steam version being one. Also, poor update support. And on top of that, EA's signature annoying announcer, unskippable cutscenes, and a soundtrack that can not make it's mind up. Guns N Roses, Faith No More, Soundgarden? Nice! Avril Lavigne.....WHAT?

They essentially destroyed the burnout series with this game, and removed a lot of what the made the other Burnout games enjoyable and original. However, the game is still a lot of fun, and there's a lot of enjoyment to be had driving around the city and country smashing things up. If you go in, not expecting a burnout racing game, it can be rather fun.","October 24, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's not about shortcuts, crashes and take down anymore. It's about pausing the game every 10 sec to look at the map. Plus the minimap doesn't rotate so you end up going the wrong way and losing the race. Then you have to drive back to the start of the race because it's an open world game and you can't just hit restart to restart the race. Same thing when you want to change car. You have to drive to one of the junkyard. I wish there was a "fast travel" thing.\n\nDriving and jumping around in the city is fun thought. And the music is great.\n\nIt's a shame they went the open world way. Burnout 3 was so much fun.\n\nIf you you're looking for something like Burnout 3, I suggest you pick up Need For Speed Hot Pursuit. It's made by Criterion and it kinda feels like burnout 3 (minus the crashes).","October 4, 2014","false","2.2"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","1"

When I picked this game up I thought great it's just going to be another burnout like always... but I was so wrong. This game to put it lightly was the start of a new era in the racing genre and at the time it may have just been a little ahead of it's time.\n\nThis has everything you would crave for in a burnout game, it has road rage, stunt runs, races, marked man and showtime just to name a few. The biggest and most amazing-est addition was free-roam and oh my god it is fun, with that comes a bunch of things like road rules, exploration, smashing fences and billboards, stunt jumps, hidden car parks, secret locations. Car unlocks are great you progress through and once you unlock one you go out into the open world and smash it down to collect it in your garage or you can collect some through collectibles and by completing a burning route race. Junkyards are your garages for cars, bikes etc there's also paint shops (gas stations). If your not the biggest fan of cars the ultimate box comes with bikes with there own set of races. It has online and there you can roam, race and explore with friends or strangers. Did I mention the soundtrack? OH THE SOUNDTRACK is something to admire because it's the kind of playlist you won't hear nowadays. The keyboard and mouse work fine fully rebind-able keys and the same goes for a controller straight out of the box. Navigation in this game is simple yet so good it doesn't hold your hand, you have to remember paths and sometimes rely on tail lights. The crash cams are still as good as they use to be if not better, with all the head on collisions and metal scrapping and crunching. The greatest thing about this game is the fact that the game revolves around what you progress through, there's no story just freedom.\n\nI would love to say this game has nothing wrong with it I really really really do want to say it's perfect but it's not and why is that? Firstly the big issue is the false advertising since I've been around from the early days the ultimate box feels like a scam, I mean all you get is free DLC "FREE" everything else you have to buy which would be fine if the store didn't shut down, if you want the awesome content you have to go through a bunch of loopholes. Secondly they left out content which are "Cop and Robbers" and "Big Surf Island" huge content missing from a near perfect game. Also a minor issue is the game doesn't have windowed mode so for all you lovers out there sorry but it just straight up isn't here.\n\nI would still say the game is worth buying because the single player is still fun and the community is some what still active, BUT if you do have the option to purchase a console copy go straight ahead because at least there you'll get a more updated version.","August 14, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Now it's Burnout's turn. Does causing automobile mayhem in a free roaming genre work well?\n\nThe graphics in the game can be pretty impressive if you have the computer setup that's powerful enough to run, say, any Crysis game. You'll start to wonder if it's even possible to walk the streets of Paradise City without freaking out over the passing traffic and catch a glimpse of the rowdy, wreckless cars smashing each other up. Beautiful scratches and traded paints between every crash and takedown marked on each car!\n\nThe library of music for the game is a mix of top past rock, metal and remix hits for shredding through the streets, along with some orchestral classics for when you need to wind down and soak in the view of the city. However, if you had to classify them separately, then there's not a lot for the soundtrack. And depending on how many times you wanted to re-launch the game, you'll start to wonder if Guns N' Roses' "Paradise City" is worth having in your head for ages to come.\n\nThe controls leave a little to be desired, while some features in variety, such as the way boosts are used in different classes of vehicles (bringing back the classic or using it if desired for stunt-specific purposes), others can get a more Need for Speed feel with the controls. At the very least, you can still get some air and maintain a drift well enough to keep up with the competition. And of course, there's no limits to how rowdy you can get with other opponents.\n\nBecause the game now goes free-roam, you'll have to navigate yourself to each point in the city. There are no invisible walls or navigational lines on your radar to aid you to the finish line, apart from your vehicle signaling and the street signs blinking on the screen telling you where to turn next.\n\nWhen playing online, the system requirements stretch beyond further than what is recommended because of multiple players racing everywhere across the city. So your computer will need a boost in hardware or reduction in graphics settings in that area.\n\nTo all the Crash enthusiasts, you'll find no such tradition in this free-roaming pot-stirrer. Instead, all realism and logic gets thrown out the window and you can now throw your vehicle around everywhere, wrecking the poor victims driving across the streets of Paradise City in Showtime Mode.\n\nIf you need a more real-time competitive edge by mixing together Need for Speed and Burnout, you've definitely found your game here. But abandoning the roots that the franchise has once made itself famous for can be a big, risky trade-off not only for its stapled name, but also for its player-base.","February 8","true","66.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At just about every stoplight in the game there is some kind of event, wether it be a race, demolition derby, etc. they are always well made and well executed. The way you progress through the game is by getting wins and upgrading you "license" this unlocks new cars/bikes and your "licence" looks pretty too!

Now it's another drop in the bucket of overwhelming garbage where you can't just play the game without being bombarded with ranks and incessant social account reminders. But also the game is vague in a lot of ways and the camera was pretty irritating. If this were a physical copy, I would snap the disc in half and go play the first Burnout on ps2. At least it was fun the moment you booted it up without having to sit through half an hour of disembodied dialogue telling you all about how awesome it is.\n\nPros: I got this game in an ultra cheap Humble Bundle\nCons: I got this game in an ultra cheap Humble Bundle\nOverall: The very first song it played to me was Paradise City by Guns n Roses.

This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and here's why:\n\n\n-The bull♥♥♥♥ navigation system.\n\nA small road sign flashes for 1,5 seconds on the top of the screen to indicate which turn at each intersection you need to take, and this is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  You can have no idea what kind of turn to expect without taking your eyes off the road and looking at the map, and you crash when you do this.\n\n-The bull♥♥♥♥ shortcuts.\n\nAre you winning? Are you in first place? Have you taken a shortcut in the last three seconds? Well then say hello to last place my friend! Enjoy your time in the last place while the game gives you very helpful directions like "Exit" and "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Avenue", all the while everyone else finishes the race and you drive around the map for fifteen minutes, unable to restart the race.\n\n\n-The bull♥♥♥♥ EA & Origin account system.\n\nWant to play online? You need to get an account. But wait, there's already an account with that e-mail. Got your e-mail but you forgot your Origin ID? You need to go f**k yourself. You miraculously have a functioning Origin ID? Here, enjoy the nonfunctional Burnout servers that we forced you to set up an account for!\n\n\n-The bull♥♥♥♥ damage system.\n\nRemember when Burnout had a decent damage system on the PS2? The days when a damaged car handled differently? It's like that, only this time damage has absolutley no effect on gameplay, and is purely estethic.\n\n\n-The bull♥♥♥♥ music.\n\nIf you expect good, mood-setting, "road trip" songs, well you can go f**k yourself. Enjoy generic, boring music. The game has ONE song, and that is Paradise City by Guns'n Roses.\n\n2/10 would not recommend","December 24, 2014","false","0.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","5"

Usually when a game has a subtitle like "The Ultimate Box" you expect it to come with all the DLC, yeah EA doesn't think so. After the store going down with no sign of any support whatsoever you literally have to mod your way to the "ultimate box content" thanks EA! Don't like the music? tough ♥♥♥♥, you don't get the custom music playlist like consoles do either, even though it could be settled with a simple patch. if you don't want to play music in the background on an external app and would rather have your music dynamic to the ingame effects the only thing you can do is change the song files in the most ridiculous way I've ever seen and done, also the only possible way, which didn't matter because after 2 hours of doing this it only rendered my game into an unplayable mess(simple audio files did this), thanks again EA! Lets not forget the obnoxious popup menus that you'll be greeted with every single time you launch the game begging you to use it's unnecessary social account, because that sure doesn't get tiring after the umpteenth time of launching to play.\nSo as good as this game actually is as you'll see from the more positive reviews, I can't recomend it because EA got their ♥♥♥♥ing hands on it.\n"Becuase remember; at EA we don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about what the gamers want, we've already choked this game dry of every penny and moved on.\n♥♥♥♥ the developer\nAnd ♥♥♥♥ you" <3\n\nWant my advice, save yourself the trouble and go buy Burnout 3 or Revenge","January 5, 2015","false","1.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KewaG/recommended/24740/","KewaG","KewaG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KewaG/","360 products in account","If you're looking for a classic Burnout game this is NOT it! My overall critique for those that don't want to read the whole Review is, Buy it on sale! The price, at date of review, of $19.99 CAD is too much for what this game is. There are better racing games for the price and I suggest you look at some of them first!\n\nThis is an Open World racing game with Burnout-like mechanics. Road Rage is still one of the funnest game types you can play, with Marked Man following a close second, but becomes progressively harder the more you do it. This wouldn't be a bad thing if it allowed you hit as hard or defend as well as the NPC cars. It goes from NPC cars wondering into walls, basically taking themselves down, to almost god-like AI that knows exactly when you plan to boost and/or ram and reacts to you. I fine with a challenge but this is a pathetic substitution for skill/balance.\n\nNavigation in Paradise City is Hit or Miss, mostly miss as in oops I missed my turn! There's a compass/navigator that tells you when to turn but sometimes it doesn't activate until your on top of your turn. It's like driving with that one cousin that points out the side window as you pass your turn to say, "that's the street we were supposed to turn onto!" which blows a substantial lead as you end up in a close 2nd. About as annoying/frustrating as it gets! Also, the races are bland and feel forced. You race because you have to in order to progress and don't get me started on the "Stunt Runs". They are the worst part of this game. There is so much they could have done but didn't do. It's sad really!\n\nI didn't play much of the online portion of the game, as I just don't care for that sort of thing, but from what I could see there was no Party Games which I remember fondly from previous Burnout games. The lack of game modes like Eliminator or Party Crash was a big let down and what is in game for online multiplayer is lack luster at best.\n\nOne annoying feature I found is the fact that your car looks half destroyed all the time. After you repair the car it looks nice for about 10 seconds and one bump later it looks like crap again. All this with no penalty outside of Marked Man or Road Rage. Your car never reaches critical and never blows up outside of those two game modes. Also, miraculously, your car seems to auto repair on the fly. How? Why?\n\nThat's just one in a long list of annoying features that I won't list. There is one other that I can't ignore and is by far the most annoying thing about this game. As time goes on, and you start progressing your licence, you come across cars in the Open World that you can take down to add to your collection. They get sent to your Junk Yard and can be switched there. This is a cool idea that I like, in fact, I wish there were more cars and that they were harder to take down. Now for the annoying part. During one playthrough I was able to collect 5 unique cars before, progressing to the next level of my licence, and was required to go to the junk yard to switch cars. A crane drops your newly collected car and begins to pan around it to showcase it in all its wrecked glory. Cool I think. Then it does it again for another car, and again for another. All this is unskippable for about 10 seconds each. I want to get back to racing not watch the same cinematic play for 5 different cars.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're still reading this, this game is good with some annoying features. It just doesn't feel like a burnout game in many ways. The Overall Racing is bland and the Stunt Run is just not worth mentioning, in fact I wish I could forget it even exists. Road Rage and Marked Man are the most fun and most challenging game modes. The lack of party games, which I fondly remember from previous Burnout tittles, hurts my rating of this game severely! Your car looks like trash all the time and sometimes repairs without reason which is beyond weird. Little annoying features pile up to make a real love/hate feeling.\n\nThis game is fun in many ways but because of the little annoyances present in the game plus the lack of other Burnout features make it too hard for me to recommend. The current price of $19.99 CAD is just too much. I suggest waiting for it to go on Sale, until then this game should be avoided.","January 13","false","13.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gaveroid/recommended/24740/","gaveroid","Gaveroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gaveroid/","207 products in account","I bought this game a few minutes ago, and I regret my purchase. I'm having tons of issues, and I'm quite upset about this. If I cannot get the game working, I will ask Steam Support for a refund. ;(\n\n\nEDIT (2 Days Later): I have gotten the game working. Bugs (mostly) aside, here's my ACTUAL review below.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor years, I'd heard little blurbs about this racing game called Burnout Paradise here and there. I'd seen it used at GameStop back when I was primarily a console gamer, but I never really paid it any attention. After seeing a popular YouTuber named NerdCubed do a video on it with his dad, I was sale hunting for this game.\n\nThe Steam Summer Sale came, and the game was $9.99 USD. A few of my close friends had the game, and loved it to death. I thought I'd pick it up, but it didn't just come with the game, nor just the DLC. I got an unwelcomed bonus - A NONFUNCTIONAL GAME. Multiple reinstalls, a lot of Googling, and hours of tinkering came before I got to properly experience this game. One problem after another bit me in the ♥♥♥♥; the infamous DMV screen, crashing at the loading screen right when you start up the game... yada, yada. I got the game to open occasionally; sometimes, rarely, the game would launch flawlessly, and let me play just fine. The other 8 out of 10 times, it crashed. Until I fixed it, I'd only successfully launched the game three times in two days. I probably made 30+ attempts to launch the game. I tried every fix I could find on the internet, and none worked. I eventually thought to try Windows 95 Compatibility Mode "again," or so I thought. I thought I'd tried it already, but I must not have! After applying that fix (some people can only get it to work on certain compatibility modes; some XP SP3, some Vista only, some Win2000 only, etc.), the game launches flawlessly. Now, the only bug I get is the game freezes when I try to quit. Saves fine, just I have to manually kill the process on exit.\n\nSteam claims I've played 8 hours of this game. I don't know how many hours of that (probably about 2) are just me trying to get it to launch properly. The game is phenomenal! The world is pretty large, with about 400 gates to smash (which lead you to backroads and alternate routes), and about 200 (I think, I'm not exactly sure) billboards to smash. Many of these billboards require you to do jumps on ramps to get to them, many of these jumps being at the end of the alternate routes that lie past those gates I told you about. I usually overlook elements like that in games, but in Paradise, I like going around and smashing them! Every intersection with a spotlight is a new race. You simply do a burnout (hold both triggers) to start one of these events; you have events where you must takedown other cars, races, events where you have to get somewhere without getting taken down, and more. There's plenty to do in Burnout Paradise!\n\nThere are over 75+ cars to choose from, as well as four bikes (which I think are more fun than the cars) added by the Burnout Bikes update included in The Ultimate Box. Allow me to note that TUB was a collection of all DLCs released up to that point; Criterion had no intention to keep making more expansions when they released TUB, but they did, The Burnout Store is down, so you can't buy the other DLCs if you don't go onto either Amazon or GreenManGaming and buy a code. The racing style is very arcadey, but you can also do barrel rolls and stuff when you do jumps, which feels very good and solid. On the cars (and cars ONLY, not bikes) you can boost your vehicle. You have different types of cars like Aggression (for takedowns and strength for when you crash) and Stunt (which are faster and more for doing stunts, but crash and are wrecked very easily). The driving in this game is great, and feels amazing.\n\nThe graphics in this game are pretty good, as well as the overall feel. My 650m cannot run it at maximum settings, but my buddy's dual Titans smoke it. It is a pretty good-looking game, especially when you crank it up. The visuals department is top-notch!\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing, although there's only one song I really pay attention to - "Paradise City" by Guns 'n' Roses. That song alone makes the soundtrack AWESOME....!\n\nOverall, Burnout Paradise is a great game. Bugs aside, I give it a 8.5 out of 10. However, with the bugs in the mix, I give it a 2.5 out of 10. I would not recommend it; it may or may not work for you. I don't think it's worth the risk unless you get it off Origin, so you can return it within 24 hours with their Great Game Guarantee.","June 19, 2014","false","13.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Cool, right? Well, move on, because you won't find any of those good feelings here on this game. The city is kinda boring, no story - I don't remember any plot in any other Burnout game, but still -  Driving the car is not so good as it was when you drive any car in Burnout 3, the drivability it's pretty close to recent any Need for Speed. No fast travel and you can't set any navigation point on the map, so when you wanna change your car, you need to check the map and drive to the garage on this boring city. This game doesn't have any achievements, so I won't even waste my time with it. I'm happy I got this game in a bundle, because I would not buy this game.

When take downs came into play that hampered the thrill of street racing, and pulled the focus off the racing.\n\nThis game has really good graphics, phyisics, a wonderful feeling of speed in game, addictive play, good varity of roads and conditions, the feel and response of every vehicle is different and requires you to learn each one.\n\nThis game pays awesome tribute to the look and feel of what made Brunout Great, the open world is fun to race non stop throughout, the selections of challenges is large, but this game has a few features that Really get in the way of My enjoyment.\n\nSo much time is wasted in Cinematic moments, at jumps, at crashes, at take downs, at race beginings, at race endings, at paint shops, at repair shops, at gas stations, each time taking control of Your car away from You. All the time this causes me car to crash, or go down the wrong street... Changing the frequency, or turning that off would have helped so much...\nI can't change the zoom on the minimap to actually use it, and moving through all the menus just to get to a useable map took a long time because even menu screens have a cinimatic effect, choosing a car has a cinimatic effect, and nothing could be skipped.\n\nOpen world also meant no restart buttons if you failed an event, so you have to back track to the starting point by yourself, and this ate a Lot of time.\n\nIf you can handle a world where the car never stops, and cinimatics leave  you without control of your vehicle often, the rest of this game is awesome. I still hope to learn some patience with it, and I have yet to test online play so I'm hoping that may help.  I LOVE open world racing games, but this one may not be the one for me.","November 25, 2015","false","13.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbobw/recommended/24740/","jbobw","Bob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbobw/","247 products in account","Back in the all too distant past at university a guy on my corridor had one of the burnout games which featured an amazingly fun looking mode where you had you cause as much damage as possible by crashing into an intersection and that is why I bought this game. Much to my disappointment the equivalent mode in this game just wasn't that great. You just start a crash on any stretch of road with limited degree of control and all the cars swerve towards you until you reach a required target. The older version was more like a puzzle to solve with a fixed arrangement of traffic.\n\nThat was only the start of the disappointment, the biggest problem is with the phrase “Ultimate Box”. When a game proclaims to be a superlative edition my expectation is that it is the base game combined with all the available DLC but no this is the base game with the free updates only. When you try and access the DLC it takes you to a store front that no longer works and they are not available on Steam either. There are apparently ways to buy the DLC but I didn't like the core game enough to want to investigate this option.\n\nThe actual game continued to disappoint me. The game has an open world environment however the actual races all end in a small number of locations making all the races seem unnecessarily similar. The races do not follow any fixed route but the navigation system is terrible, you have a compass that shows you the overall direction to the finish but the only clue about which road to take  is a little road sign that pops up too late to make the turn in the faster cars. There is also a mini map but looking at that is a sure fire way to crash into something so effectively you just have to learn the map. The game progression is too unfocused for me, you just complete an arbitrary number of races to unlock the next licence. Also there is no option to quit or restart and event you have to complete the event and then drive all the way back to the start point.\n\nThe other annoyance is all the collectables. I do love a nice set of collectable items in a game but this just has too many for it to work. There are 400 gates to smash through, there is no way you can collect all these while still having fun, you must just be driven by the desire for completion. You are bound to miss a few and then end up painstakingly going through a walktrhough revisiting all the locations till you find the ones you missed. And there is not just the gates there are jumps and best times on every road and biggest crashes on every road.\n\nOne of the items of DLC that did come with the ultimate box was the multiplayer party DLC which was again (I keep coming back to this word) disappointing. It had no split screen options, the events are repetitive and the load times are just that bit too long so it starts getting aggravating as you are passing the controller between players.\n\nAll of these problems are a real shame as the core game engine is excellent with great driving, spectacular crashing, a decent range of cars, a good map and variety of events. And in the sale this cost less than the price of a bus ticket. Given all the annoyances in the game I can't bring myself to recommend this game.","July 18, 2015","false","10.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

Not because of the game itself, tragically. No, the game is one I consider to be possibly my favorite arcade racing game of all time. I end up comparing most new racing games to this game, and nothing has come close to the amount of fun solo and with friends as this game.\n\nI cannot recommend this game simply because its broken. It's up to you whether or not you wish to try your luck, because I'm aware that quite a few people can just download the game and play with minimal effort. Apparently the online mode still works, too!\n\nI'm one of the ones on Windows 10. "Did you try disabling/uninstalling your webcam drivers?" "Did you try running in fullscreen or windowless border?" "Did you try enabling/disabling your microphone? Webcam? Both or alternating?" "Did you try running in compatibility mode?" "Did you try running in Administrator mode?"\n\nThese are all questions being asked amongst users on Windows 7, 8, and 10 in the forums. None of the troubleshooting or tweaks made the game get past the main menu for me and many others. It's a shame that EA doesn't want to support these games with post-mortem patches. Say what you will about newer versions of Windows, change is inevitable. And it's sad that gems like these might be the things that are lost.\n\nIf you can somehow play this, enjoy it. You may not be able to enjoy it for much longer. I fear games like the new Star Wars Battlefront, Need for Speed, or anything by EA will eventually fall to the same fate.","December 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When take downs came into play that hampered the thrill of street racing, and pulled the focus off the racing.\n\nThis game has really good graphics, phyisics, a wonderful feeling of speed in game, addictive play, good varity of roads and conditions, the feel and response of every vehicle is different and requires you to learn each one.\n\nThis game pays awesome tribute to the look and feel of what made Brunout Great, the open world is fun to race non stop throughout, the selections of challenges is large, but this game has a few features that Really get in the way of My enjoyment.\n\nSo much time is wasted in Cinematic moments, at jumps, at crashes, at take downs, at race beginings, at race endings, at paint shops, at repair shops, at gas stations, each time taking control of Your car away from You. All the time this causes me car to crash, or go down the wrong street... Changing the frequency, or turning that off would have helped so much...\nI can't change the zoom on the minimap to actually use it, and moving through all the menus just to get to a useable map took a long time because even menu screens have a cinimatic effect, choosing a car has a cinimatic effect, and nothing could be skipped.\n\nOpen world also meant no restart buttons if you failed an event, so you have to back track to the starting point by yourself, and this ate a Lot of time.\n\nIf you can handle a world where the car never stops, and cinimatics leave  you without control of your vehicle often, the rest of this game is awesome. I still hope to learn some patience with it, and I have yet to test online play so I'm hoping that may help.  I LOVE open world racing games, but this one may not be the one for me.","November 25, 2015","false","13.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Much to my disappointment the equivalent mode in this game just wasn't that great. You just start a crash on any stretch of road with limited degree of control and all the cars swerve towards you until you reach a required target. The older version was more like a puzzle to solve with a fixed arrangement of traffic.\n\nThat was only the start of the disappointment, the biggest problem is with the phrase “Ultimate Box”. When a game proclaims to be a superlative edition my expectation is that it is the base game combined with all the available DLC but no this is the base game with the free updates only. When you try and access the DLC it takes you to a store front that no longer works and they are not available on Steam either. There are apparently ways to buy the DLC but I didn't like the core game enough to want to investigate this option.\n\nThe actual game continued to disappoint me. The game has an open world environment however the actual races all end in a small number of locations making all the races seem unnecessarily similar. The races do not follow any fixed route but the navigation system is terrible, you have a compass that shows you the overall direction to the finish but the only clue about which road to take  is a little road sign that pops up too late to make the turn in the faster cars. There is also a mini map but looking at that is a sure fire way to crash into something so effectively you just have to learn the map. The game progression is too unfocused for me, you just complete an arbitrary number of races to unlock the next licence. Also there is no option to quit or restart and event you have to complete the event and then drive all the way back to the start point.\n\nThe other annoyance is all the collectables. I do love a nice set of collectable items in a game but this just has too many for it to work. There are 400 gates to smash through, there is no way you can collect all these while still having fun, you must just be driven by the desire for completion. You are bound to miss a few and then end up painstakingly going through a walktrhough revisiting all the locations till you find the ones you missed. And there is not just the gates there are jumps and best times on every road and biggest crashes on every road.\n\nOne of the items of DLC that did come with the ultimate box was the multiplayer party DLC which was again (I keep coming back to this word) disappointing. It had no split screen options, the events are repetitive and the load times are just that bit too long so it starts getting aggravating as you are passing the controller between players.\n\nAll of these problems are a real shame as the core game engine is excellent with great driving, spectacular crashing, a decent range of cars, a good map and variety of events. And in the sale this cost less than the price of a bus ticket.

Go to the music settings and disable all the tedious modern music that EA insists on cramming in the game. Then enable the classical tracks that are also included for some reason. Then go drive like a madman and crash while listening to Ave Maria.\n\nParadise is a pretty good game, but it's main draw is that it supports a rather wide range of behaviour. In some ways it's a platform game. In others it's a racing game. In some it's a exploration game.\n\nI could argue that it's some sort of post apocalyptic game where humans are dead and cars are now sentient. It's a bit eerie at times, to drive around in the barren world.\nSlap on some Mozart though, and it's golden!\n\nIf you can snag it for cheap I recommend this game.","September 25, 2011","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But the extras they promised\nwith the Ultimate Box edition aren't available.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FzMonst/recommended/24740/","FzMonst","FzMOnsta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FzMonst/","338 products in account","It's a pretty decent racing game. You will play it and find little things that tick you off after a while and uninstall the game. Months to years later you will reinstall it not remembering what was so bad, then within seconds of playing it all comes back to you. The decent part about it is that the driving is very fun and very fluid, 2 qualities that make or break racing games. SO, what ticks me off you ask? The narator that wont shut the ♥♥♥♥ up stating the obvious after you have been playing for hours and know everything already. The fact that you can just bearly scrape against an object and it goes into a slomo action cam as you reen off course in a metal ball of scrap signifying your loss of 1st place (this will happen every single race more than once). Don't get me wrong, going over 140mph is really fun and satisfying, but when your only 5 activity options include smashing billboards, racing, jumping off ramps, and finding shortcuts all for collection's sake you will get bored quickly. The driving and racing part of this game are flawless and make the game, the ♥♥♥♥ of everything else breaks the fun part.","February 13, 2015","false","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fast cars, crazy stunts, big crashes, Burnout Paradise has it all. Even now after it's aged a little it's still a fantastically fun game to play, great for a quick blast or in multiplayer. With lots of DLC available now it's really fleshed out the game. It's very playable with loads of stunt jumps to do, events to race and all kinds of stuff to keep you entertained.","February 28, 2011","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
