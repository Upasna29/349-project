I always hoped for a new edition but it will probably never happen. However we can play LBA2 now through steam. Excellent!\n\nThe original came out in 1997. It was one of the best games on PC. I had great times running around and enjoying the world of Twinsen. It came with mysteries and opportunities, puzzles and action. The music was enjoyable and suited the game well. The cut scenes added an extra dimension and the social interaction was also nice.\nAs you can hear, no real cons.\nThe only things with this version is that it is running in dosbox, which runs as 640x480 in a window. I don't see any options to change that. Also, it is not running smooth yet, however back in the days I remember my PC not running it smooth either. Not a real problem for me since it is still a great game.\n\nSry for possible failures in language, I'm not a native speaker ;).","October 20, 2015","true","0.6"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","58","63","0","3"

This one will entrance you, it will charm you, it will fascinate you, you will feel like a child again; it will pull you into an imaginative adventure unlike any other.\n\nIf there is any game that is a winner - this is it.

It runs on DOSBOX and so far I haven't encountered any issues.

Still, if you have never played it before and like old-school games, definitely give this a chance!\n\nThe world and setting are amazing and the music is SO good, easily one of the best OSTs I've ever listened.

This is pretty much my favourite PC game of all time.\nThe graphics may seem outdated to some but I still think they're appealing. The characters are quirky and fun and the story is great: You play Twinsen, the hero of the planetoid Twinsun (which has two suns - clever, huh?) who defeated the evil Dr. FunFrock in the first game. Everything seems fine and dandy until the weather suddenly gets worse, your friend gets badly injured and even aliens land on your homeworld, so you better go grab your magic ball and tunic and prepare yourself for some more adventures.\nYou don't necessarily have to play the first game to completely understand this one - you'll get everything important by interacting with books, signs and busts - but it certainly helps to get into the right mood.\nYou may find the controls a little awkward at first, since it doesn't control like recent games. Forget about WASD. Anyway, I don't think this should be a problem, since it's pretty easy to get the hang onto the controls.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","October 23, 2015","true","18.6"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

I played it before the first one (which you shouldn't get on Steam by the way, since it's a horrible port of a mobile version of the game with keyboard controls literally cut out), but I now find the first one way too hard and frustrating to play. It seems like LBA2 addressed the problems of the first one, adding a save-anytime system, variable camera, and enemies that don't constantly stunlock you. The music is great, the graphics are great, the animations adorable. Figuring out what you're supposed to do and where to go is needlessly difficult at times, but it doesn't bring the game down.","November 23, 2015","true","11.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I could tell you about the amazing things I saw when I just started this game, after I finished Little Big Adventure 1 and I defeated FunFrock back in 1993. This is going to be a very long review.\n\nA game originally produced by Adeline Software in 1997, with help of Frédérick Raynal and Phil Vacey. Sadly, Adeline Software didn't make it further then 2004, where their company had to close. Luckily for us Frédérick Raynal has gained control over the rights of Little Bid Adventure, so... maybe there is a third one coming up? For more reviews from professional people I have copied wikipedia and posted it here;\n\n" Robert Coffey of Computer Gaming World said, "With its unparalleled sense of marvel and imagination, engaging story, and deft mix of action and adventure, Twinsen's Odyssey is a true delight and simply the most charming game I've ever played". GameSpot's Ron Dulin gave the game 8.1 out of 10, stating "Fans of adventure games will not want to pass this one up". José Dias of Adventure Classic Gaming said "Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure is among the most original and intriguing adventure games ever released." and gave it a 4 out of 5. "\n\nBut let me tell you. Do you remember the first time you launched a game that you were so excited about? Like many of us we played black and white games like Castle Adventure ( 1984 ), Pac Man ( 1980 ) or one of the best-sellers from Apogee like the Duke Nukem, Cosmo, Crystal Caves and I could continue for hours! And suddenly you find this game with a UFO on the cover, a blue coated man with a S-pendant around his neck and this beautiful woman next to him. You flip the big carton box and you see these amazing 3D pictures. You are thinking " Is this real gameplay or just a short clip? " Remember, back in the days we didn't had any source of information about videogames like we have today. I bought the game and decided to give it a try.\n\nThat, my friends, is where my adventure began. I never seen anything so well detailed in 3D graphics. I could turn 360 degrees and see my character from all sides. I saw all these funny, but not terryfing creatures that I never seen before. There are bunny-people, fox-like creatures, walking sausages and evil citicens from Esmer who are trying to invade your world. The magic is in the storyline, where Twinsen needs to save a terrified group of schoolchildren who were abducted by an evil villian ( no spoilers! ). One of the best parts of this game is the humor that Frédérick Raynal and his designers put into this game. Trashcans and catuses have villians in them, funny conversation lines, pun-intended puns and an amazingly well formed story. Where Link would raise the item above his head, Twinsen is happily waving his arms up and down! Don't forget about Joë, the clumsy but joyfull elf that always seems to get Twinsen and himself into trouble! And what about Dinofly? You ever played a game when you were young where you ride a dinosaur?\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nCombat 10/10 --> Combat you never seen before. There are many magical spells that can help you fight enemies, but there are obstructions in this game that you need to overcome. Your magic ball is standard level 1 and can only hit certain enemies. You need to find ways to upgrade your magic ball to hit tougher enemies. The magic ball bounces which means you can kill enemies from afar bouncing the ball against the wall. The allout powerfull Ring of Lightning will make all those juicy sausages feel like they just came of the barbecue! And don't forget about throwing pointy darts, spit seeds with your Blowgun or simply fight of your enemies with your Emperor's Sword. Your behavior is a big part of this game that is relevant to how you throw your ball, how you wield your sword or how you preform certain actions with items.\n\nAdventure 10/10 --> You travel from Twinsun, the planet of our hero Twinsen, to the Moon together with Baldino, you go to the casino on Zeelich and you are trying to follow a robot-chicken to find a key. Biddi Biddi! Biddi Biddi! And don't forget Island CX, that is the most deadly island in this world. For those who are willing to explore the whole game there are special items and spells you can collect that can help you later in the game. " What is Island CX you say... I... I don't know. I been there before but now I am all burned selling souvenirs next to this giant statue... I advise you to not go to Island CX... "\n\nMusic 10/10 --> The biggest part of what made this game for me was the amazing music that Phil Vachey made. The Temple of Bû from Little Big Adventure 1 and Emerald Moon from Little Big Adventure 2 are amazing classic masterpieces. What is that you say? Voice acting? Yes ofcourse there is voice-acting! VOICE-ACTING IS SO 1994!\n\nGameplay 10/10 --> Twinsen has different behavior he can adept to. Normal behavior is used to interact with people, to find hidden objects or to flip switches. Sporty behavior is used for jumping and running, while Aggressive mode is.. well, for beeing aggressive. Please don't beat up Zoë, she is pregnant with your child! On the other hand, you are ALLOWED to beat LITTLE BRATS on top of a ROOF that shoots at you with his SLINGSHOT ( Please, go punch him! )  Discreet mode is the opossite of aggressive, in certain cases you want to align yourself a little bit better, or you want to throw your magic ball higher in the air over a wall to kill an enemy, or if you want to sneak past enemies to avoid confrontation. Each behavior corresponds differently with each weapon, which makes killing enemies a lot more fun.\n\nGraphics 10/10 --> For that time, 1994/1997, the graphics were astounding and amazingly well. Comparable to what Half Life 1 and Unreal or Quake did amazingly well for their time, Little Big Adventure 1 and 2 did that for their time. We could almost say that Little Big Adventure is the start of the 3D adventures which we see today, like Wolfenstein was that for the future of shooters. I gave a 10/10 because your game will come supported with INGAME VIDEOS when something magical has happened.\n\nOveral 10/10 For new and younger players, don't expect to be blown away by the usual standard of a good game according to today, the graphics are not what you seem to be used to ( even for Minecraft standards ) but be prepared to see what we all find a masterpiece in it's full glory! I got this game on CD-rom and I'm just buying it again! It brings a tear to my eye everytime I play this game. I love you Adeline Software\n\nSupport this game developer and let's all cross our fingers for Little Big Adventure 3!","October 30, 2015","true","3.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"
