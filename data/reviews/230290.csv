It’s really more of a toy :O – the virtual equivalent of a configurable orrery, except hugely more complex than any mechanical system.\n\nThat complexity is one of the key attractions that Universe Sandbox possesses. Using the vast range of variables and tools at your disposal you can create some enormously convoluted displays of physics, bending cosmic laws to your will out of nothing more than a desire to see pretty patterns form on your screen :). You can move galaxies around so that they tear themselves apart beautifully, casting off clouds of stars into the abyss as part of their death throes.","August 26, 2015","true","589.0"," 135 of 139 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","135","139","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xolvir/recommended/230290/","Xolvir","Xolvir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xolvir/","32 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have privately and publicly alpha tested this game since Alpha 8.3.  I bought the original US in 2009.  The pace of development on US2 is amazing.  I personally have a fascination in space, astrophysics and any science that governs the workings of the universe from particles to galaxies... and the original US was one of the most amazing things I had ever seen...  Even in its now-considered retro theme, it was an opportunity to see all my knowledge, applied, in the universe, for the very first time, in a free sandbox.  Now we have US2, and I cant explain how great this program is.\n\nThis is one of those games that cannot be matched by anything else.  I have run US2 on several computers, 4 to be precise, and it has run exceptionally on all of them, ranging from potatoes to near 6GHz monsters.  I would say 90% of US2's features have been implemented in this year alone.  This game always make me wonder, "Imagine US2 next month!  It will be TEN times better!".  US2 devs are open to suggestions and are quick to respond to your questions on the US2 forums.  The US2 community is like that of nowhere else.\n\nIt really is amazing how many features are in this game...  I mean, most of them you will rarely use because you are too busy wrecking the universe and smashing stuff together!  The main reason I think people hesitate to buy this game (if they hesitate at all), is because it is in alpha...  Sure, there are a few bugs.  They are not game-breaking though, and the game runs flawlessly on default settings.  Thats why we alpha tested it waaaay before it came out on steam, to get the diamond of US2 as perfect as we could.\n\nThis really is my lifetime favourite game.  Even in Alpha 8.3, when the devs accepted my alpha testing form, it was one of, if not the most, exciting thing ever.  I was one of just a handful of people around the world with US2.  Now in Alpha 16, you can experience that, but nearly 2x more jaw-dropping excitement and wow-factoryness! (according to the version numbers!).  Every single update they improve the game so much, I sit there, universe sandboxing, jaw dropped.  It is a truly amazing experience to play a game like this, this totally unique game, like nothing I had seen before.\n\nA really important thing I would like to mention... If you dont know, US2 developers are working hard on (at some point, soon) adding SPH.  That stands for (S)omething i forgot, (P)article (H)ydrodynamics.  Go have a look on youtube, it is a simulation of the planet in many different particles.  This means it can break up when under tidal stress, and deform awesomely in collisions!  They are going to implement this into the 3-D already complex simulation of US2.  And you thought the game was already amazing!","September 3, 2015","true","191.1"," 130 of 136 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","130","136","12","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/230290/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroduction\nUniverse Sandbox ² is a physics-based simulator from eight person team, Giant Army. Universe Sandbox ² is, as you’d expect, a sandbox simulation and therefore you can do pretty much whatever you want within the game’s limitations. Would you like to see what happens to our Solar System when the force of gravity is doubled? You can do that! Want to know what Earth would look like after the moon collided with it? You can find out!\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nPresentation\nUniverse Sandbox ² is a good looking simulator. While the textures aren’t great if you zoom in right up to them they do generally look good. The models are all high quality and the visual effects in the game are absolutely brilliant. The developers have done a good job at making the game look as realistic as possible without making it too PC power hungry. As well as looking pretty the game’s appearance is functional. The UI is fairly basic and it doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb but it manages to give the user all the information and options needed to enjoy the simulator. You’ve also got the option to have visible orbits, trails, labels etc. which when on give the user a lot of information but when off allow for some great screenshots to be taken.\n\nGameplay\nI’m not sure gameplay is really the right word for Universe Sandbox ² but I’ll run with it anyway. It’s quite difficult to talk about Universe Sandbox ²’s gameplay as it’s very much what you make of it. For example, if you spend all of your time creating functioning solar systems you’re going to have a rather different experience to someone who mindlessly smashes planets into each other. Those two cover one of the main ways to enjoy the simulation, creating your own scenarios. You’re given access to all of the objects in the game and you can manipulate them however you want to. As well as choosing where to place them relative to other celestial bodies you’re also given a great deal of customisation options for each celestial body such as what materials make up most of its mass or how much mass the celestial body actually has. You can also change what kind of climate planets have through the same menu as the other options or by simply moving the celestial bodies closer or further away from other bodies which have an influence on them.\n\nThe other way to enjoy Universe Sandbox ² is to simply run the scenarios which the simulator comes with such as an accurate model of our solar system or a collision between two versions of Jupiter! This is really for those, like myself, who just enjoy watching that kind of thing and of course like watching planets smash into each other. I mean, who wouldn’t enjoy watching two planets smashing into each other? There are already loads of scenarios available in the game and more are being added. Like you can when creating your own scenarios, you’re able to do whatever you want with these scenarios too such as add more planets to your scenario or edit the materials a celestial body is made of.\n\nMiscellaneous You have complete control over how fast the simulation is, you can have each real second represent anything from a millisecond to billions of years.\nUniverse Sandbox ² has a nice, relaxing soundtrack which fits nicely with calm simulations and contrasts perfectly with huge collisions.\nThe celestial bodies in the game range from small asteroids to supergiant stars and black holes. There are even some human sized objects in the game including the Monolith from 2001.\nThe eight person team consists of a numerical physicist, a climate scientist and an astrophysicist as well as ‘regular’ game developers.\nWhile Universe Sandbox ² isn’t too taxing on your GPU you are going to need a pretty beefy CPU to get a good frame rate on some of the more complex simulations.Verdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nUniverse Sandbox ² is a realistic and interesting physics-based sandbox from Giant Army with good graphics and a lot to do. It may not offer much to your average gamer but for those with a real fascination with space it’s a real treat. It may be a bit pricey so for those average gamers I’d suggest holding off for some kind of discount but if you’re a space nut like myself then it’s worth it.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","December 2, 2015","true","3.6"," 152 of 165 people (92%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","92","152","165","13","3"

Tormented as you are, you finally reach the conclusion that only the most total, complete revenge will sate you: the total destruction of the earth itself. Life. Pah. If the end product of life are apes that cannot appreciate your brilliance, clearly the whole thing was a mistake. A mistake that you are more than happy to correct.\n\nYour newly found nihilistic passions drive you towards this most ultimate solution: to what fraction of the speed of light must you accelerate a common tiny celestial body -- a comet perhaps -- so as to totally liquify the earth's crust? It seems easy enough to calculate. Ah, but how to check your calculations? Brilliant though you are, you have been known to misplace a decimal place here and there, in your excitement. And your lone companion Igor, capable manservant though he may be, and very handy with a pickaxe in a graveyard, is hardly equal to this more intellectual task.\n\nEnter Universe Sandbox. Place celestial bodies where you like. Send them where you like. Check your calculations through simulation. Get your revenge. Because wouldn't it be embarrassing if you meant to liquify the earth, but wound up causing only yet another mass extinction?\n\nSeriously, this is lots of fun. If you wind up using this program for anything other than destroying the earth over and over and over in new and exciting ways, you are made of sterner stuff than I.\n\nIt's also great for teaching young kids, at least at an intuitive level, orbital mechanics, the concept of kinetic energy, and why two planetary mass objects, when they bump into each other, behave slightly differently than two small balls rolling across the living room floor.\n\nPro tip: if, upon witnessing the total, irretrievable extinction of all life on earth, your five-year-old daughter asks, "could this ever happen in real life," answer with something a bit more reassuring than "probably not, but you never know." That is, unless you like getting up at 2 AM every night for the better part of a month.

Which I can tell would appeal to most people.\n\nI'll go over my favourite aspect of the game now, but to save me rambling on about every little feature I enjoy, I'll make a list after this. The thing I love most about this game, is the creativity and curiosity this game brings. As I mentioned before; but who could imagine that you can make a football our solar systems apocalypse?! One things this game does  indeed do very well, is catching the interest and curiosity of people, but also allowing quite a fair bit of creativity.\n\nAs I said before I will now make a quick list of all the other things I enjoy a lot about this game:\n-Black Holes (you'll spend a lot of your time, if not most of it messing around with black holes).\n-Watching what happens when our sun evolves.\n-Blowing up every item in the game.\n-What happens if's (with the earth especially).\n-Trying to make another earth from scratch.\n-Turning a teapot into a sun.\n-Creating a Solar System.\n-Creating a very small galaxy.\n-Messing around with the milkyway.\n-Making a potential universe descructing object.\n-Watching the beautiful simulations, with the beautiful music playing.\n\nThose pretty much cover what I'll be doing and you'll most likely be doing in this game, but the things is, I know there are some more things in the game I haven't started to look at yet, which I will do very soon; they also keep updating this game, so I am always on the look out for any interesting additions they put in.\n\nAlright, so like with every game, it has a few downsides. Here are a few.\nAfter about three hours of playing and testing things out, I started to feel a bit bored and I felt as if I had tried everything that is worth doing (blowing up the earth a million times, and putting a black hole at the centre of our solar system). So what I would say the developers is this, perhaps for a future game, or to just make a big update for this one, think about what more content could you add into this game, or how much more detail can you go into with what happens in space, just to add those extra few hours of interesting gameplay; that being said, I could probably play this for a maximum of two amazing hours, creating my own universe, and creating several apocalyptic situations, then a minimum of a week and a bit, of a break before wanting to play and do that all again. A small suggestion for what you could add; add or make a load more options of what if situations, and perhaps more interesting or ambitious what ifs, like what if aliens were real and invaded our solar system, or what if earth advanced space travel so much they were travelling around our solar system as easy as people can get on a bus now. Maybe too ambitious but you start to see my point.\n\nA final thing, only small, and not the most important downside, but something I certainly picked up upon, and thought, hmm, would have been better with this; is the whole black holes being the most destructive force situation. In this game, all they are, are huge slingshots. Now, I know black holes do something to do with shooting objects out at incredibly high speeds, but I'm no expert. However I also know, or at least have heard from people who are meant to be experts, that under the great force of the gravity a black hole has, objects that are pulled towards it are torn to pieces by the strength of the gravitational pull; and for a lot of people interested in black holes, this is one main thing they focus on; the destructive power it brings wherever it goes. In this game, as I said before, I only see a slingshot, a bunjee jump, to me, a black hole in this game is far from being as deadly and chaotic as they are said to be by experts. I'm almost sure this is to do with the design of the game, that limits this feature, or to do with the time it might have taken to make these extra small details added in; but considering the large majority who will spend most of their time playing around with black holes; I STRONGLY suggest to the developers, that again, either in a very future version of this game, or a large update later on, that there is some sort of design that let's us all see that truly great power a black hole holds, and how merciless it can be.\n\nThose are the two main downsides in this game for me. Although, in conclusion, I certainly recommend this game, it is still fairly new, and having regular updates, (mainly the little fixtures us gamers don't notice very much), but it can give a lot, answer a lot of your curious questions about space, and it is still extremely fun to play. Definitely worth it, and quite frankly, you can never get bored of tossing the moon at earth. Oh, and Developers, if any of you read this, of course, great game, very well done, so congratulations, but also take into account what improvements that I have said could be there in the future.\n\nThanks!","January 9","true","7.3"," 85 of 90 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","85","90","12","4"

It show this in the craters that forms after you collide an object into another, in the elevation as seen by adding water onto the surface of the object, and also in the accuracy on the simulation of gravitational pulls of bodies.\n\n- Universe Sandbox 2 contains a simple, efficient design as compared to the original Universe Sandbox. "Home" dispays system-included simulations under "Open" and also displays templates under "Create". You also have a "Learn" section where you learn different interesting facts of some interesting or bizzare objects in the Universe. The Properties Menu show the basic information of an object, climate information of the object, and the materials that made up the object.\n\n- Universe Sandbox 2 controls the timestep in lagging times. If the game thinks that the frame rate is too high, it automatically controls the timestep slower in order to make your experience with the game better.\n\n- The Giant Army is a friendly group that helps your solve your technical issues in Universe Sandbox 2. If you have any problems with your experience in Universe Sandbox 2, the developers are there to help. Just make sure that you post your problem on to either the Steam discussion group or the Universe Sandbox forums and they will (usually) give you a reply within 15 hours.","February 15","true","80.3"," 77 of 88 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","77","88","4","0"

All 65.5 Hours (and counting) i've spent on this game have been spent doing the same exact ♥♥♥♥ over and over again. That's how good this game is. You can spend a few days straight doing the same thing, and never get tired or bored of it. Want to smash a planet into Earth? SURE! Go ahead! Jupiter's just waiting to gobble up that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. Want to smash another planet into Earth? WHY NOT? Neptune's getting pretty hungry too! Hell, why not restart the simulation and throw Uranus at Earth too.\nScrew it. Double tap that baby and throw The Sun at Uranus just to make sure anything on Earth AND Uranus is erased.\n\nThe amount of fun that can be had playing this game is endless.\nThis game has amazing visuals and (With some of the more recent updates) a beautiful, dynamic soundtrack that really accompanies the scale and feel of space. Perhaps not on a lonely or empty sense, but on an epic and awe-inspiring sense. But i'm sure you could care less about both. Just what can you do on this game, exactly?\n\nWell.\n\nYou can, as i said, smash planets together with astoundingly awesome collision physics.\nWatch Galaxies collide.\nAdmire the gravitational lensing effects of blackholes\nTerraform entire planets. (Then crash them into another planet)\nDisrupt the rings around Saturn with a larger celestial body\nHell, you can even spawn in the New Horizons Space craft and throw it at pluto, if you're so inclined.\n. . .\n\nThat only barely scratches the SURFACE of the amount of features this game provides.\nI'll leave the rest for you to discover when you play this gorgeous game yourself!\n\nIf you like space, or physics, this game is a great way to learn a little something too. Some of the detailed and functioning laws and physics in this simulation are not only good to look at, but also surprisingly accurate and can teach you a little basics.\n\nIt's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.\nBuy it.\nIt's worth your money.","November 29, 2015","true","76.7"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","92","56","61","15","1"

In addition to what was already in the first game, there is a more user-friendly UI, the possibility to modify the materials and climate of the different planets and many more to be added in the future. But you have to remember that this is not really a game, so you set your own goals: maybe you want to destroy the entire galaxy with a giant black hole, maybe you want Mars to transform into a supernova that burns other planets. The possibilities are endless.\n\nSOUNDThey have just added a soundtrack to the game, which is beautiful: it makes all the science and experiments more enjoyable and helps deliver a relaxing experience.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe possibilities are truly endless, and as soon as you get the hang of it, you will start modifying all the different planets just to see what happens. Lovers of space simulators will play this for many years to come, also because the developers are constantly updating the game.\n\nI like to think that this is more of an actual software, than it is a game. If you like everything that is related to space, than this is a must-buy.

And I've got to say, having played for 3 hours, my first impression is that this is absolutely incredible. The sheer joy of creating my own planets and putting them in to our Solar System, or putting a sun-sized football as a replacement for the Sun. The amount you learn in this game is mind-blowing, and makes you realise the size of the universe. It's almost scary. And of course, who doesn't love a bit of destruction? It's hilarious throwing moon-sized teapots at Earth and throwing one planet at another. If you're not sure about this game, get it. There's nothing like experiencing it for yourself, watching videos has nowhere near as much excitement and thrill as it is to do it yourself. You may think "oh god I'm spending £18.99", and so did I. But just think of the incredible detail and the amount of possibilities in this sim. It's in Alpha! The game isn't even finished yet and it's already better than any game I've spent £20 on, by the time it's finished I reckon the possibilities will be endless and the experience will be like no other.\nFor the people complaining about boredom after 30 minutes, remember - it is in Alpha.

Despite being fairly easy on graphics and the CPU (unless you go nuts with the amount of simulated objects, time scale, or try to zoom in on a supernova), this will accurately simulate the size, position, movment, mass rotation, general appearance, temperature, magnetic fields, basic composition, and gravitational fields of known stars, planets, planetoids, asteroids, black holes etc. In addition to being packed with pre-made simulations of the Solar System (major planets only, planets and major moons, all moons, or even every known object in the solar system - there is a surprising amount of them) you can change everything that is simulated at will. Alter the positions, rotations, from the size and mass down to the composition and temperature, everthing is adjustable. You can remove and place objects at whim, either standing still or with a predetermined vector. You can even mess with their mass and composition by manually adding material to them - add enough hydrogen to the sun and it will turn into a blue star! The game also simulates collisions between all the objects to a limited degree, considering the scale of the collisions.

It made me comprehend how fragile life really is and how special we are for being able to say that life as we know it, is precious.\n\n\nThus, It has personnally enhanced my current understanding of a lot of fundemental phenomenons that I simply couldn't picture properly solely by reading texts explaining them seperately.

Simple enough but the vastness of the scale is overwhelming. While quite the fantastic computer program alone, I strongly urge that one would enjoy it with the HTC Vive.  One may spend a moment above the Solar system and marvel at the orrery precision of the paths taken by the planets revolving in the middle of your room, and then fly in on your favorite planet to scrutinize at a naturalistic scale as a true behemoth careens by at a dwarfing 1:1 perspective.  Fire a few asteroids here and there to examine the unwavering momentum of whatever hapless body pulled it out of a straight trajectory, but you will find yourself depositing stars nearby such as Rigel which consider the entire Solar System to be a mere morsel.  There are things out there that are truly and terrifyingly massive.\n\nI have always had a passion for astronomy so this game is quite the treat.  My 60-year-old father has also taken to the game with an astonishing fervor so I bought him his very own Vive so he would stop bumming around my place hogging my video games. Alas, I have shown many friends and family members this game, often as an induction into VR as I set up a gorgeous scene and put them game on pause to then have them put the headset on to blow their minds.  My favorite scenario is a few planets being vaporized as they rotate perilously close to a violent neutron star.  I find myself teaching others about "what the ♥♥♥♥ am I looking at?" and "why is it doing that thing?" and "this stuff really exists!?" and "why is space so damn beautiful?".  Dispensing moments of pure astonishment has become a past time. I've become the Carl Sagan of my living room as I take people on my Ship of the Imagination to show them what vast ocean teems beyond their small island of which they know.\n\nIf you hold the beauty of the cosmos in reverence, I suggest you try this game out on VR. Nothing quite compares to having lunch in orbit around the Earth and then releasing a generous salvo of Moons at it and reveling in your wanton destruction. Then you add hydrogen gas until the Earth becomes a gas giant, then a brown dwarf, full star, neutron star, black hole, then grow that black hole until its more massive than the observable universe and then you win the game! Mwuahahaha!!  Who wants to be Space God when you can be Space Devil?

The customer may not know about inclination or Kepler's laws of planetary motion but it still somehow gets through as a sandbox to the customer and that has to be an acheivement. We all have to agree, this is a magestic simulator. Dynamics are taken into account at every opportunity and the way the simulator delivers, its breathtaking. It's not even done yet. How simple parameters can change properties from the orbital period to the planetary climate, changing as the orbit progresses or viewing Phobos orbiting Io which is orbiting Earth from the view point of Io.\n\nWould recommend this simulator if you want to spend time learning and having fun at the same time.

Not a game, more an experience, and a galactic sized one at that. There is just too much to mention, so let's simplify it : You are God, and the universe is your playground. Play.\n\nNow because this is jam packed with new amazing simulation features I do seem to be getting a big performance hit, but I am soon to upgrade my pretty old rig so I will ignore this for the moment. But beware, it's a heavy simulation with a lot going on at the same time and will tax your comp.\n\nAn example of something you might do : Create a simple Earth and Moon in their usual orbit, and then tell the Moon to explode. And then watch about 50 molten moon fragments as they plummet headlong towards Earth. Watch as some form new moons in oribit around Earth, and some that get pulled in for a spell of Dinosaur shagging sky death.\n\nAmazing. 10/10.","August 25, 2015","true","13.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","14","17","12","0"

You can crash Mars into the earth and watch as the planet melts! So, if you like hurting people, there are suddenly much more catostrophic ways to do it, and for most people, this is just a fun way to screw with physics and see what will happen. Or watch galxies collide in real time, or see what happens when you make mercury out of nothing but hydrogen, or if you add a ton of CO2 to the earth, or when the sun goes supernova, and plenty of other odd things.

And I've got to say, having played for only 1 hour, my first impression is that this is absolutely incredible. The sheer joy of creating my own planets and putting them in to our Solar System, or putting a sun-sized football as a replacement for the Sun. The amount you learn in this game is mind-blowing, and makes you realise the size of the universe. It's almost scary. And of course, who doesn't love a bit of destruction? It's hilarious throwing moon-sized teapots at Earth and throwing one planet at another. If you're not sure about this game, get it. There's nothing like experiencing it for yourself, watching videos has nowhere near as much excitement and thrill as it is to do it yourself. You may think "oh god I'm spending $19.99", and so did I. But just think of the incredible detail and the amount of possibilities in this sim. It's in Alpha! The game isn't even finished yet and it's already better than any game I've spent $20 on, by the time it's finished I reckon the possibilities will be endless and the experience will be like no other.\nFor the people complaining about boredom after 30 minutes, remember - it is in Alpha.

Do you like space? Do you like smashing two planets together in a fiery explosion? If you answered yes to anything of these questions, then this game is for you! Universe Sandbox 2 is a simulator that lets you experiment on an astronomical level, spawning stars, moons, planets, and pulsars. Create solar sytems (or destroy them), explode stars and watch them go supernova. Its like a star gazing book, except much more fun and interactive. Plus, its real science-y, with accurate data to simulate our own solar system, or a random one... or anything, really. This is a gravity simulator at heart. Orbits, eccentricity, Inclination, velocity, etc. It comes with dozens of pre-made simulations. However, make no mistake, the rest is icing on the cake.\n\nOkay, so now its time for more specificity. Features of the game include stellar evolution, climate simulation, full body fragmentation, light pulses, saving/loading sims, bodies, galaxies (galaxies are WIP for right now), and objects. First is stellar evolution, which is the process of stars aging until they die. You could sit there and watch a star for a billion years in real-time until it dies, or just take the easy route and speed it up.\n\nNext is climate simulation, this works the best with earth for right now. When climate is enabled for a body in the simulation, the polar ice caps (specifically for earth), you can visaully see snow expand and recede as it obits the sun. At some point in the future, climate should become more fleshed out, but for the most part, the climate feature is a nice touch.\n\nI won't go over the whole list, as some are self-explanatory (and there's just too much to list anyway), but the stellar evolution, climate, and light pulses are the main ones, the rest just ties it together, and nicely, I may add. Anyway, light pulses can be "pinged" off any object you want in a simulation. Emitting a light pulse from an object will then travel through space. Watching a light pulse in real-time is probably the most amazing. It lets you visualize the speed at which light travels through space. And as far as I know, it is supposed to be accurately simulated, traveling at the speed of light. For light to travel in the "Our Solar System" simulation, from the sun to Neptune took 4 hours, just like in real life.  Same with sun-to-earth, 8 minutes. That's awesome!\n\nTo sum up, if you're a fan of simulator games, and have an appreciation for astronomy, you'll probably enjoy this game/sim. There is no other simulator that does it quite like US2. The size and scale at which Universe Sanbox 2 simulates is in a league all its own. The game recieves regular updates (I was in the closed alpha before it hit steam), and the devs are actively engaged in making it better. They take time to make sure its right. Each update to the game only continues to add to an already amazing simulator! :D\n\nNow, only one last order of business:\n\nI deleted earth. Why are we still here?\n\n- 10/10 would delete earth again -","August 27, 2015","true","79.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

This program feels more like sophisticated simulation software than an actual game in functionality, but it's incredibly user-friendly and easy to use; I use this game as a very effective visual aid for tutoring, as well as a time killer. The developers certainly don't skimp on their research, as frequent updates reflect some of the most current events in astronomy: there was a simulation of the New Horizons encounter with Pluto as the real deal was making headlines! Explorative tutorials are informative without spewing a bunch of numbers and facts all at once; yet they provide links for further enrichment, as well as pure number-crunching horsepower for those who are curious and want to tweak the gritty details and properties that bind the universe together. It's Early Access right now, but their bugs at this point are few and very far between. Updates are very frequent, and more often than not they include newly added features and simulations.\n\nThe dynamic graphics for complex events such as climate patterns and planetary collisions are getting better and more refined with each update. This program offers an incredible amount of functionality, is visually appealing, and accompanied with a beautifully ambiant soundtrack. I've never been so relaxed breaking gravity and then playing billiards with all of the planets!\n\nThis title completely blows its predecessor out of the water! I would highly reccommend for all those casual gamers and science fans out there. More people need to get this title - it has limitless potential for a Steam Workshop feature. For what you get, the game is set at a remarkably reasonable price - definitely worth scooping this one up!","March 6","true","14.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The sufficiently accurate simulation is appealing and teaches about our universe in a way that is simple yet physically and astronomically correct. You'll find out what happens when stars collide with others, how black holes act (as far as we are able to predict it) and also how magnificent the scale of the astronomical objects is. This is a good simulator to mess around with and simutaneously teach yourself the basics of the cosmos. In addition, the climate simulation gives this game an interesting aspect; you'll be able to manipulate your home planet, for instance, and experience how the continents act under your own circumstances.

It's that simple. After playing over a hundred hours of the original, I could not wait to play this game and it did not disappoint. While I have not played this game for as long as the original (still add a few offline hour to the hours steam said I played) I can tell it's great.\n\nCreating your own personal solar system and watching your planets orbit with an amazing score in the background feels awesome.

While many Youtubers will throw moons at planets and call that fun, going much deeper takes a higher level of education. You can build your own solar system from the ground up, drop black holes into anywhere, throw random items into orbit or at planets as well as try to see what happens when you increase the mass of the earth by a couple of suns.  There are no campaigns as this is more of a purely scientific and enjoyable simulation.\n\nThe control are simple to learn but the characteristics of the universe contents are vast.  Gravity, mass, density, oribtal configurations, rotational periods, atmosphere, core composition, luminosity, atmosphereic pressure, greenhouse gases, and about 500 other options exist that can be modified.  You can turn on or off realism for each individual object and there are about 50 scenarios you can fire up and watch and/or interact with.\n\nI really enjoy this game..I mean simulation program.  It's relaxing, the sound track makes it easy to study things outside of the game if you are trying to get something done i.e. learn another language, study a new topic in your spare time, etc.  I'm running on a 27" iMac with a 3.4 Ghz i5 with 16 GB of RAM and a 780m Nvidia.  I have no issues playing this game and doing anything I want.  No slowdown, no glitches that I can find, nothing.  I'd also like to add I am on a Solid State so that also helps push things along.\n\nI highly recommend this for those that are interested in the universe, learning some things along the way, or just want something relaxing to do that doesn't involve hearing a 14 year old rage over a mic or throw his keyboard against the wall due to poor parenting and lack of social skill sets.  Remember, it isn't a game, it's a simulation, and one that is awfully fun too!  Do yourself a favor and give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.","November 27, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I will be about 65 years old when Halley's Comet makes a pass.

Features would include adding or taking away certain materials from a planet or adding too much mass to a planet to make it a gas giant then allowing it to create its own nuclear fusion to become a star.\n\nThe possibilities are endless with this simluation/game.\n\nIf you are by a faction interested in space and planetary systems then this is the simulation for you.\n\n10/10 - Watching two galaxies collide over 1 frame to 1 million years has never been so satisfying.","August 25, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can do everything to mess around with universe within the realm where the game engine allows.\n\nGraviting, orbiting, colliding, creating/changing something...mass, radious, temperature, orbit, course, velocity, atmosphere, climate, magnetic, materials and so on. Make a pair of earths neutron stars and let them be a binary system and after taking a screenshot just put them into wherever habitable zone of whatever stars and just watch what will happen. If you satisfied, just take a draw a human face or 'lol' in space with anything, who cares?\n\nNo gun, no killing, no car but no magic and no god as well(but the devs allowed you to be able to spot a teapot somewhere in the universe if you want). It's just a fun counterpart to the real life physics.\n\nSomeone may not know what to do in this open field at first and need to take some time to get used to but you know that is the beauty of sandbox game.

A must buy if you loved the first one.\n\nBut, this game being Early Access, it has some rough edges that I hope will be corrected in the future, such as the still very incomplete planet surface composition and climate simulation. The simulator also still can't correctly simulate things such as tidal forces tearing satellites apart when they cross the Roche Limit, which was something I missed from the first version and I hoped would be implemented in this one.\n\nBut overall the experience has been very good so far.","March 28","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love how you can hop between planets and learn about their composition and mass. I also love how you can change their properties and see the effects (to a certain extent. hope to see this improve soon). Good job!\n\nDelve more into the depths of terraforming planets; effects of global warming, core composition and introduction of organics. It would also be brilliant if storms were to be seen on planets and moons with the correct atmospheres and surface composition. As well as this it would be interesting to see Earth change as the years move on, such as seeing the cities grow and seeing man made satellites around the planet - maybe you could introduce the eventual colonisation on other planets as time progresses, as a small, automatic event. Hey, maybe you could even include nuclear war occuring in some intances or ships disappearing as they enter lightspeed travel - that would be a brilliant little touch!\n\nOverall, I love this game, and will be seeing myself spending hundreds of hours with it in the future!","February 21","true","1.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Who knows?\n\nYou might have noticed I put the word game in quotation marks, that is because the word "game" is very misleading, this is a simulator and a serious one at that.\n\nSo if you want a simulator of space, then buy this game.

I LOVE the dynamic sound track, to me that made this game. Also, I suggest to anyone playing to go to the largest scale, set two rocky bodies on a collision course, zoom in to one of the planets surfaces, and in the final aproach, set the time to scale. Watching worlds collide from a first person perspective is awe inspiring.\n\nThere are something things that could be improved or added. Like the ability to snap to objects and name or lable them. I had a hard time trying to set up a star/ planet combination. I'd ran into a couple of glitches that sent me across the universe, never to see my planet again. Also, it would be nice to be able to reverse time.\n\nAlso this game would probably consume ALL of my free time if there was a way to set up or follow an ecosystem. Or have the ability to create life and watch it evolve maybe had a stats bar with the type of life and its progress or something to that effect.\n\nOverall; As is, the game is fun.

The mass of the star, 'M', was calculated above using the mass-luminosity relationship of stars. Finally, the mass of the exoplanet, 'm', in the equation can be ignored, since it is much smaller than the mass of the parent star. As an example, since the Sun is about three hundred thousand times heavier than the Earth, ignoring the mass of the Earth in this calculation woud introduce an error of less than 0.001%. The equation can be solved for the only remaining variable which is the orbital radius, 'a'. Once the orbital radius has been determined, the mass of the planet can be calculated using Newton's Law of Gravitation shown below. Here, 'G' is once again the Gravitational constant, 'm1' is the mass of the parent star, 'r' is the orbital radius (this was 'a' in the equation above), and 'Fg' is the force of gravity betwe-\n\nOh, the game?

A game like this has been my dream for years, and now it's actually happening! You can just screw around with planets' climates and gravity and throw them at stars and whatever - and the graphics are fluid, there's virtually no bugs or glitches, absolutely amazing.\n\nHopefully there will be even more new features in future, like the addition of extra materials like uranium to simulate the heat from an internal core, and methane, magnesium, and other chemicals and compounds to simulate chemical reactions and impact the colour of planets and behaviour of their surfaces.\n\nThe game is already amazing as it is though, it's a gravity and a climate and a massive epic explosion simulator!

You can set up your own simulation and see what happens or just use one of the many pre made situations.

There is a great amount of suns, planets, moons, etc to spawn in in to your virtual universe. For those who can afford more(not me), there is also a virtual reality mode (HTC VIVE specifically).

Huge plus for me, Does not require a powerful computer to run. This is not a game but rather more of a toy.

Defy all laws/rules of the Universe and completely obliterate all tons of stuff, including Earth. In other words; Why are you fondling planets in a safe way when you can literally collide them and cause lots and lots of explosions?\n\nBut, back onto the main topic of this review; Create tons of solar systems with random generated planets/moons/stars/etc, I would take this as a way to allow us to speculate what would the Universe be like if it was this, or that, or anything that could possibly happen. Remember; The sky is the limit, but in this simulator, the space has no limits, only your computer/laptop/etc. Other than the neat gadgets and gizmos, it could have some good ol' tools in the future that could enhance our "ways" of destroying, creating, and observing such objects as time progresses.\n\nIn addition to that note, its not just a game or simulator, its a way to allow us to comprehend how our universe works and how gravity affects such objects like our Moon with the Earth's mass and tidal locking and what not. Its a tool to allow us to best understand how systems are made, how planets reach inhabitable statuses in which life could exist, and how we Humans got here and there. There is just so much more you can go in depth with the ways you can use this simulation/sandbox.\n\nFurthermore, I would greatly suggest/recommend playing/using this simulator/sandbox just to fiddle with logic and gravity. And its a possible great tool to teach the youth how the Sun came to be, or how the Universe began and so forth, as well being a fun tool to show them how cool but yet "scary" if you take that in a deep perspective view of how a large asteroid could impact the entire inhabitable world within minutes of impact. Other than that, its very amazing and worth it.\n\nHave fun exploding planets and understanding how it works, go on, give it a try I would guarantee that you would enjoy this. But take this note in further advances; It will be confusing and hard to follow if you dont know how simple gravity works and how the basic core mechanics work as well. I strongly suggest doing the tutorial for best enjoyment later on.","November 23, 2015","true","57.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said. It is just epic, and it is very good at showing how minuscule us humans are in relation to the universe.\n\nThere are a LOT of pre-made simulations for you to try out. Each planet, star, asteriod, etc, etc, can be clicked on and further information can be obtained. Sometimes it is just in the form of data... but sometimes you are presented with boxes of text, and the text even contains links to web pages to allow you to go and perform further reading.\n\nThere are also a LOT of tutorials to show you how to go about making your own simulations.\n\nThis is a game, teaching tool, curiosity-satisfier, and a research tool... all rolled into one. Whatever reason you have for purchasing this product, your money will be VERY well spent.\n\nI have only encountered one glitch so far (not a bug, per se)... the music that plays seems to "crackle" sometimes. I don't have the issue with any other games. However, this does not detract from how amazing this application is.\n\nAs a developer myself, I can relate to the amount of research and effort; blood and sweat; time that has gone into making this application so that we may all enjoy it.\n\nThank you Giant Army! And thanks again for restoring my faith in Early Access. For me, you are up there with Grim Dawn and Dirt Rally for quality Early Access releases. :)\n\nThe icing on the cake for me........

And I firmly believe that the developers will give their best so one day, we will be able to play god and create our own universe where real and conscious human beens will live in. So invest in new hardware cuz you are gonna need it+directx 12. If you do that, then you will be able to do anything you want, just like the ♥♥♥♥ers who simulate our own universe. Imagine, 2 or 3 year from now you can watch the virtual muslims praise you as some kind of almighty being while in real life you are just some fat ♥♥♥♥ who gets off watching simulated people acting the same way as us. And when we finally get our based vr from oculust rift, we will be able to create our own harem within our simualted universe and don't even have to buy those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Japanese dating sims anymore.\n10/10","September 16, 2015","true","20.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

It mainly focuses on solar systems and you can make your own and such using random presets. The game is in early access and hopefully the devs will work on it over the next several months. Should you buy this game?\n\nI loved to watch videos of this game but was put off it by one particular comment. "The game gets boring quickly." I got the game 4 months later as one of my family members said I could buy something as long as it is either educational or physical.\n\nThe game was not boring. It was incredibly fun and time flies when I play it. The only issue I have is it's a game you play before you go to work/bed. Game sessions are usually over 1 hour for me but that is due to me owning the game for a small time. So it all comes down to this...\n\nBuy this game if you love space, explosions, astronomy or just science in general. Avoid if you are looking for a big game with lots of content you can binge on. Do pick this game up sometime though as it is a huge improvement from the first game (which I hated).\n\nI don't like to give anything a score as scores are translated differently. I will however give this game one word that I think it deserves. Success.","March 8","true","13.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I LOVE science; especially space. In fact I want to be an astronomer. This game is realy cool, and I love sandboxes, but I think there's TOO much freedom. I'm not the kind of person who screams in terror or excitment when two celestial bodies collide together. The game is good in the fact of realism. For example, I learned about a star that's 11.5 km across from playing this game. That is very interesting to me, to learn that a star can be that small, but honestly, I could've learned that anyway, without paying $25 for it.

However, the simulations are (relatively) small scale, as in, you can't navigate our known universe. For example, I expected to be able to zoom out from the solar system and see celestial bodies which surround ours in the Milky Way, then zoom out even further to see what's around the Milky Way. As of now, this isn't possible, though it may be added since the game is in open alpha.\n\nUnfortunately, in its present state, this isn't much of a "universe" sandbox as it is just a space sandbox.

It is a toy, something for you to sit down with for a few hours and just see what it is like to destroy Earth, or the Sun, or the Milky Way.\n\nThis is not something that would appeal to many people.  You have to be extremely interested in astrophysics to even want to buy this title, and those that are educated in astrophysics, you start to notice some issues with this right away such as the lack of space-time distortion near massive objects such as black holes or super-massive stars.  This game is very rhudementary at the simulation of basic physics and does not apply any theorethical rules that we have found to be true in the past decade which is disappointing.\n\nOrbits are innacurate, showing loss of velocity on each revolution just by having an abnormal or eliptical orbit.  While unstable orbits can maraculiously become stable (there is a reason they're called unstable, because there is a collision trajectory). This is not true to life and violates the laws of thermal dynamics.\n\nThe show stopper, was having objects that can move as fast as the speed of light.  The current school of thought says that the more massive an object is, the expodentially harder it is to achieve speeds remotely close to the speed of light.  In essence, the fatter you are, the harder it is to run fast.  The universe has the same laws, which are violated in this "toy".\n\nAgain, this is a TOY, not even a simulator, if this was listed on steam as such I would have gave it a glowing recommendation.  However, this is no game, and is decietful to market it as such because there is no playing field, no objective, no goal.  It is a sandbox with sand -- which is a toy, again, not a game.","March 15","false","4.2"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","9","0","2"

Don't deny this has way less things to do than in space engine c'mon.

I fully expect to change my review to positive when it releases.**\n\nRight now, its fairly limited. Setting up your own systems is much harder than it should be -for me at least- and usually ends in lots of explosions, getting objects where you want them just isn't very intuitive.\n\nI wouldn't say the game runs poorly, but it could run a lot better. However, After playing it again recently, I definitely noticed improvement, so I imagine the game will run quite smoothly by release.\n\nThe number of objects you get to play around with feels a bit lackluster, but that should also be improved. They are also planning to add Steam Workshop integration, which would be more than enough.\n\nThe game does let you edit a metric ton of attributes for every object in real time, as well as gravity and other such things, which is pretty sweet. If you want to run a simulation with 1,000x normal gravity and an Earth the size of 1,000,000,000 suns, you can do that.\n\nIn its current state, I wouldn't recommend this unless you're really into astronomy, or just have a thing for blowing up planets. But it definitely has potential to be great later on. I definitely expect to come back to this one later on.\n\n(If you like my reviews, I'm posting them all on this hideous Wordpress site now! https://probablysanny.wordpress.com/)","January 5","false","4.4"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

Seems to me that the main focus is for ramming planets into other planets (or stars, moons, asteroids, etc.) I watched the Jupiter/Jupiter collision. One is stationary one comes in from the left and rams into the other. Nice graphics. The final object is the same size and for some reason is moving to the left. (???) That doesn't seem right.\n\nI don't see any way to set up a solar system with custom orbits. Sure, I made one system, but all orbits were round and in the same plane. That's not very natural. I don't see how to customize that. I went right through all the tutorials.\n\nI can make a pulsar! Ooh. big deal. I see a computer graphic of a magnetized white dwarf. Is that what they really look like? Maybe a bit.\n\nI'm quite an astronomy fanatic, but I don't feel I got $30 worth. Of course, it is an early access release and so it could still get better yet.

But it's severely lacking as is.  Here are my gripes:\n#1- Each simulation type is independent of the other.  I was expecting all worlds to have environmental simulations enabled, but they don't.  Only specially designed prefabs (earth and mars I think are only ones?) have the environmental simulation enabled.  There are other simulation setups, but they seem too pigeonholed to really allow for true sandbox tinkering.\n#2- It seems like the only interesting things I do are collisions and design some cool orbits I guess.  The level of simulation detail in other areas is far too little to make it fun to me.\n#3- Why doesn't the matter projectile thingy add to a planet's makeup and mass?  Atmosphere mechanics are awful.  I was expecting to be able to add gasses or water to a planet and have it establish an atmosphere, or maybe it wasn't big enough to hold an atmosphere?  All cloud cover looks the same as earths, there is no attempt to model a planets atmosphere, and there is absolutely no detail paid to the amazing amount of atmospheric complexity of gas giants.\n(these two below are minor gripes)\n#4- The simulation including all moons (or even our own moon) is a bit hidden, and I can't find a pre-built simulation including all the defined solar system objects.\n#5- Can't you come up with some way to model multiple star systems realistically?  Would be cool if I can hurl one star system at another and see the results  Maybe pause and group multiple stable(ish) objects together as one mass data point at very far zoom distances so that you can actually build a few systems.\n#6- The interface needs lots of work.  If I have hundreds of objects on screen, why not (by default) just display the most important trails and orbits at extreme zooms?  Like if I'm looking at the solar system, only the major planets should be shown at max zoom, as I zoom in more, show me smaller and smaller objects or something?  Things get extremely cluttered.  Also, the pause on impact needs a threshold or something and maybe detect an impact a few minutes before it happens so that I can watch or intervene on the things I'm actually interested in.\n\nIf you like to watch planets collide for hours with predictable identical results every time, you might get enjoyment out of this.  The only reason I personally didn't ask for return from the dev is that it's a very cool project and I'm hoping I can come back to it in another couple years and it is more the fully featured simulation I was hoping for originally.  Also, the devs care deeply for this game which is great news!","August 25, 2015","false","4.9"," 117 of 307 people (38%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","38","117","307","12","21"

A great example of how well everything works is to drop the timescale to realtime, place a still moon in the path of the earth, and watch as the atmosphere burns away, followed by the seas, followed by the earth becoming a molten ball.

I can't begin to share how good this game is and it isn't even completed. It took about 5 minutes to get the basic hang of it and once I did, I was facinated. The attention to detail is the icing on the cake. In one of my sims, I raised the mass of the sun to 10. The result was rather interesting. In another, I gave the Earth another moon closer to the present one and then decided to explode it. this resulted in what looked like an ice age as most of the northern hemesphire was covered in snow/ice. There are so many parameters that can be changed with each one creating a different effect. Such a deep and wonderful game should not be missed. My 10 year old son was watching me and was facinated with what was going on. This is just after 49 minutes!

You can adjust anything and I even made huge basketball ball(Larger than earth) to see what's happening if it collides Earth.\n\nIt's a great way to get your spirit up and your imagination a great deal of fun.\n\nYou have so many planets, collison courses and so on you can do. It's a great way to learn about the universe. You can really adjust almost important things about planets & physics engine not bad at all.\n\nThe turtorial is really simple, very fluid and easy to comprehend.\n\nThe downsize of the game that sometimes it doesn't look as it's in real life. Especially the explosions & how planets/stars really look in life. I think many properties are missing when it comes to this. The Sun's explosion is fantastic, close to be real and also BEAUTIFUL thing ever!\n\nThere is so many things they should add, even from Star Wars(Death Star) that would really make it awesome.\n\nLast thing on my mind, the 3D graphic is quite simple, nothing special. It's a good thing if you have bad computer. You'll have problems only with too many objects or explosions at once(Getting close to them too).\n\nAll in all - I LOVE SPACE - AWESOME!","August 27, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being able to mess around with the universe or simply create a solar system and see how it turns out in millions of years is great fun and also a learning experience.\n\nI'll be especially excited when the possible simulation of life is added, and I hope that when it happens there will be more options for the planets meant to carry it. I have more to experiment with of course, but I definitely am going to follow this game's development.\n\nI don't dislike much about this game, and for still being in development it's a fantastic start. Anything I could critique about creativity limits will undoubtedly be addressed in the future (Like the creation of life on planets).\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who is curious about the universe and how it works. Also for anyone just interested in messing around in space. It is definitely worth getting, and few people aren't interested in outer space, so it seems like a good fit for most.\n\nAll in all, it's worth finding out about and looking at.

Not just visually, they seem to also have tweaked the code to calculate for much more accurate orbit predictions; especially when it comes to unstable systems or running custom systems at a higher time rate.\n\nThe interface is not too complicated to learn, however the learning curve is higher than other video games in general.

Yes, because it's fun and funny.\nYou want to know what I did after that?\nI changed the orbit of Saturn's moons to draw them in closer, causing their orbit trails become bright, colorful rings as they mixed into the debris of Saturn's rings. For good measure I threw Russell's teapot into orbit too\nI created a binary solar system from two Sirius B's, with Iapetus and Venus in orbit around one, and Mars and Dione in orbit around the other. I watched a simulated span of 27 days cause Iapetus and Dione to disintegrated and spiral outward into the blackness. I saw emptiness fill up with sparkling lights from the remnants of those moons. I watched Venus begin to heat up till it glowed brighter than the star it was orbiting, and Mars fill with fire leaving glowing streamers in the wake of it's orbit.\n\nThere is so much you can do with this game, so many ways to create and destroy, infinite possibilities in the vastness of space, only bound by the limits of your imagination.","December 19, 2015","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh I know the game is a very fun space based simulator as the title suggests. Some things I really like about this game is well.. It has a very realistic engine and very fun stuff to do. What I mean by that is: it doesn't have limitations that you hate, it has a very free feeling nature to it. For example if you want to launch the moon into earth, Go ahead! No one cares destory the earth all you want. Also I like how you can create your own simulations..\n\nThe only problem I see with this game is that, There is no workshop.. What I mean is it would be awesome if you could create your own simulation then upload it to the community for others to download, modify and enjoy!\n\nAny way Those are some of the reasons I would recommend this game to you.","January 29","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has massive potential and it is already magnificent to play around with! The graphics levels and overall physics of the game are second to none, and it has not crashed on me since I bought the game. Very proud to own this game and learn more about how our vast universe works - even if it is launching a planet to collide with another ;)\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone, just make sure you have a decent computer to run this so it doesn't overheat. The physics are very realistic which is why I mention this. If you don't have a powerful computer you can reduce the physics to fit your computers benchmarks, but my computer runs fine on all of the settings on max.

Best of all, it is incredibly accurate. All of which are attributes make it more realistic, as well as the choice of engene and the simulated physics. There are absolutely no improvements possible, other than engine updates. You should definitely buy it.

I absolutely love the terarforming aspect; trying to make a life-sustaining moon or planet is quite tough.  The music (ambient) fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly, it's very relaxing.","December 24, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chilled out backing music makes this a deceptively chilled experience, relaxing while worlds are destroyed, engulfed in flame, or flung deep into the cold depths of an empty universe.\nThere are a number of premade simulations of intricate historical or simply theoretically interesting senarios to keep your attention if you don't feel like making your own little solar system and chucking a black hole at it.","December 24, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I will admit that when I first got it I was bored of it after a couple hours or so of playing. As they continue to bring out updates, they are adding more and more interesting things to do in the game. Before purchasing, you need to realize that this is a simulation, not a story driven game, also it is in early access, it is not meant to be the game of the year. It is a little bit more expensive for what it's worth, but it is easy to see that time was put in to making this game and the developers want to deliver an amazing simulation experience of our universe, and I appreciate that. The graphics are beautiful and the physics of the game are astonishing. It is safe to say this game is out of this world ;).

You can do these things are more in Universe Sandbox^2.\n\nI found out about this quite game quite accidentally. I had played Space Engine before, and someone mentioned that I should try US^2 if I liked SE. While SE is more of a space-exploration game, US^2 is a sandbox - you can twiddle with settings to see how things change. I guess it's kind of like playing God.\n\nIf you had that sense of wonder when you played Space Engine, you can get that here too. You can see how planets change over the scale of centuries and millenia when you mess with their climates. You can change Mars' climate so that it has water. The possibilities are endless.\n\nThis is a great learning tool too, especially for children who are interested in astronomy.\n\nEven though it is only in alpha, US^2 is still amazing.

I spawned a random rocky planet, then spammed in about 50 different small moons, all of the same orbital path. They, of course, exploded catastrophically, causing a large shower of fragments to be sent off into space, and eventually left the one true moon- Orde, as well as a somewhat dense field of fragments. Then I turned to terraforming. I had finally got the planet to look good, but then a fair amount of the fragments of the satellite field crashed into both the host planet and Orde, leaving large craters in both. Eventually, the Planet cooled down, leaving Orde (3.3x Moon) entirely bathed in fire. Couldn't figure out how to put it out, so I thought making it bigger might help. Nope. Orde crashed into the Planet, causing another large explosion and a shower of fragments. Eventualy settled into what I called the Orde Pseudo Star, hurdling through the void. Set it to 0 Velocity, and started over. Things progressed, and I had a nice system going. Then Orde began to move. didn't notice, but then it ate the closest planet, and so I was like, what the heck, might as well blow everything up. Turned all the mass into hydrogen, which turned Orde into a star, and it ate everything. Turns out solar systems are a lot bigger than I thought. This is why I don't have nice things. I turn them into stars and then they consume everything else in existence. Gr8 m8 r8 8/8 Would consume universe accidentally again.","February 14","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
