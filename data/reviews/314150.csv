These games are almost flawlessly ported on the PC. The video filter just makes things blurry, so you're best just leaving it off. You may want to set the scanlines to about 20 for that old CRT TV look and feel. If you were into the Double Dragon games back in the day, buy this. If you're too young to remember how awesome the Double Dragon games were back in the day, buy this.

Difficulty selection, remixed (and original) soundtrack, video filter options, and online (and local) multiplayer are all nice additions here.  They only downside is that these are ports of classic arcade games, and do you know what that means?  It means clunky controls, crazy-hard AI opponents, and cheap deaths o'plenty.  All of which kept the quarters dropping into the arcade machine (that's how they got your money before DLC).\n\nSo if you're too young to remember playing these in the arcade, here's the caveat:  You're playing an 80's arcade game.  You're going to die...  a lot.  (to quote Lordkat)\n\nIn summary, these games are classics and should be played for the historical value alone, but can still be tons of fun (especially with a buddy).

Play DD Neon. You'll get more fun out of that than this, seriously.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice when you start up the game is the interface. The menus look impeccable, and work nicely without many hiccups, although I did have to restart the game after changing resolution. (It crashed.)\n\nThe second thing you'll notice is probably the music. For the record, Double Dragon's OST has some of my all-time favorite tunes. Unfortunately, the remixes don't quite live up to the originals. One such remix contains the groans and moans of the various characters... used as if they were instruments. Needless to say, I switched to 8-bit soon after, but even still, the music doesn't loop properly-- it fades out, then plays another song that wasn't connected to that level in the original version. It can, naturally, be very disconcerting.\n\nAs for the HUD, the health bar is quite the looker, but the plain text for time and points in DD I and II you see in the screenshots... that's what you'll get in the game. It's ugly and doesn't fit with the rest of the game. Really, I wouldn't have minded using the original HUD at all, especially if they were not intending to "finish" the rest of it.\n\nSomething that irks me as well... "Story Mode" isn't exactly a story mode as advertised. No cutscenes, no dialogue or the like. You kind of have to already know the story to understand what's going on, although fans of the series won't have an issue. Basically: "Story Mode" is a level select menu without continues after you lose your five lives, despite the fact "Arcade Mode" gives you infinite quarters.\n\nFew things to the game's credit: it does have a difficulty setting, and gamepad support works great. This will allow me to introduce Double Dragon to my friends without them becoming discouraged by the learning curve. The buttons were even mapped just about where I would want them automatically-- the jump button in between punch and kick, allowing for easy execution of the jump kick and elbow.\n\nIf you can look past those things, the games are playable, and just as intense as they've ever been, but my grievances listed above really break the immersion and don't allow me to fully enjoy this game. If those things are fixed in a future update, I will happily recommend this game and rewrite my review.","January 15, 2015","false","1.1"," 216 of 336 people (64%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","64","216","336","26","13"

Double Dragon Trilogy is a perfect emulation of the arcade games. I don´t know how much money I spent for playing this game back when I was  a kid but this brings back memories. To get the real arcade feeling I recommend to playing with the 8-bit music instead of the remixes. The remixes are quite decend but the stage boss music is a little bit odd in my humble opinion.\n\nThe graphic options have all a true arcade fan needs e.g. scanlines to enable :) but you can also play in higher resolutions. The easy difficulty is really easy maybe too easy as each enemy only needs one punch or kick to be killed. The GUI is also a bit strange and I am not sure why they didn´t leave the original one from the arcade. The time counter and the energy bars don´t really fit into the game because they look like ripped out of "Double Dragon Neon"\n\nWhen it comes to multiplayer this is game becomes really time consuming as it makes a lot of fun to play. When I played with  a friend we discovered a minor bug since at the end when you have to fight against the other player the energy bar becomes yellow but you don´t die. So one of the players have to commit suicide to end the game.\n\nAll in all a great revival of the classic but they should add the old time counter and energy bars instead these new polished ones.\n\nThank you for taking your time and I hope this review helped you  a bit\n\nI give this game 4 of 5 foxes","January 18, 2015","true","6.5"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","0"

Instead of using the score and time indicators of the original first two games, text is overlaid on the emulation and it doesn't really suit the games.\n\nThere is a dearth of extras - arranged soundtracks are welcome, but they are implemented poorly; where is a sound test option, or artwork used to promote the games? No in-game manual? This is a bare bones release.\n\n"Story mode" is just a level/mission select with no narrative, despite the name.  There are a number of filters, resolution and scanline options, which is welcome.  I have played a couple of games online.  The first seemed to be laggy for the host (or the host just didn't know how to play the game) whilst the second was fine.\n\nAs for the games, Double Dragon is a classic beat-'em-up and still holds up today despite some annoying aspects.  The sequel is a remix of sorts and is playable and has some interesting ideas.  Double Dragon III is a jerky, terrible mess.  Whilst the initial characters are pleasingly acrobatic and have a wide range of moves, the game itself is mediocre and - in the arcade - the only way to unlock more characters and moves was to insert more coins.  This proto-DLC is still here, but you seem to be limited to just one "coin" so choose wisely.  This does mean that you will not get to play as all of the extra characters (I would love to be proved wrong here).\n\n\nTo sum up, only buy if it is really cheap or you really, really want to play the games but bear in mind that the games have been tinkered with.","January 16, 2015","false","2.6"," 50 of 73 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","50","73","3","0"

While Double Dragon Neon has a lot more gameplay and features better graphics, I believe $6 is a fair price to ask for what you're getting here.  I blew through DD1 on easy mode (there are three settings) in about 10-12 minutes.  Assuming the other two take just as long (on easy), you're looking at about 30-45 minutes of gameplay for your first playthru.  There's also a story mode in addition to an arcade mode, so there's more play time right there.  There's also the ability to continue where you left off when you run out of lives, which is (in my opinion) an added bonus.  All in all, this is an easy recommend for you retro-gamers out there.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKcSEUf6SxU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTgZzyI1Pk","January 15, 2015","true","0.6"," 44 of 65 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","44","65","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/314150/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Double Dragon Trilogy is a collection of the first three arcade versions of the series, in which we take control of Billy or Jimmy Lee as we punch our way through a multitude of levels to save our girlfriend. None of the games except the third really have any more story than that and is all about nonstop action. You can have a friend along for the ride on all three games either locally or through online coop. I have been unable to test online so can't comment on it's performance. It does make the game easier, though be careful where you attack as there is friendly fire and more often than not you end up accidentally stabbing a friend instead of helping take down the enemy. All three games feature three difficulty modes which are Easy, Original and Expert. On Easy achievements are turned off, though like the other difficulty modes you still can not use a continues. It is very odd playing an arcade game (notorious for cheap difficulty) without being able to plop another quarter to keep going from where you met your end meaning that the lives you are given is all you get throughout the whole game. Luckily none are terribly long and they do feature a “story” mode where you can start from any level you have previously beaten. You will also be able to choose either the 8bit or remastered soundtrack which is nice.\n\nDouble Dragon 1 is the first game in the list and starts off with your girlfriend getting punched in the stomach and kidnapped by a group of thugs. You immediately set off after them either alone or if you are playing coop with your brother Jimmy. Soon after you will meet your first enemy and be introduced to the games combat which is a simple three button scheme to pull off punches, kicks and throws. There is also a rather handy jump button which allows you to jump kick enemies from a good distance and platform over certain areas. In this game environments are a far greater threat to you than any enemy, as missing a jump or being knocked down a ledge will automatically kill you. Those felt pretty out of place and the controls are not suited for any kind of platforming at all but fortunately they are used sparingly.  Enemies are very good at judging the length of your attacks so button mashing is not very effective and it is better to time your punches accordingly. It's not all fists though, enemies will occasionally use weapons such as knives, whips and bats but on the flip side wrestling one away from the enemy will allow you to use it for yourself throughout the whole level.\n\nThere are only four very short levels for you to play through and should take you about half an hour or less to complete the game. That very much depends on your skill level though. Since there are no continues you will have to play with a very limited number of lives and it wouldn't be surprising if you get a game over on the very first level. One cool aspect of the levels is how naturally they flow into one another. If it wasn't for a small jingle to notify that you have beat a level, it would be very easy to think of the game only had one giant level. Completing a level is the only way to refill your health but it can be a very hard thing to do since the end of the levels feature a boss. Bosses don't have unique fighting styles or patterns and just look visually different than regular enemies. They do have a lot more health though but that is pretty much it, only the last boss is truly unique. Still cool to fight Ice T though, even if he fights the same as anyone else. Not all is well though, there are a lot of technical glitches such as sound effects not playing making the fights lose their sense of impact, a lot of flickering and frame rate drops as well as the game randomly becoming much faster or slower causing enemies to move unpredictably. The last level also is one of the most annoying levels I have ever played due to the pillars that kill you in two hits. The ending is amazing in coop though, just be prepared to hate your friend afterwards.\n\nDouble Dragon 2 is the next game on the list and starts off with your girlfriend being shot dead for humiliating the boss of the last game. No clue why your girlfriend kept hanging around the front of the garage by herself, probably had Princess Peach syndrome. Anyways, it won't be long before you meet your first opponent and it will become immediately clear that the enemies in this game are a lot faster and more aggressive this time around.  That means the game is much harder but it felt a lot more fun since they also cutback on the amount of environmental hazards making the enemies the main threat instead. Added to your arsenal of moves is a new spinning jump kick that causes a huge amount of damage and will become your go to move, making your character look like the world's deadliest ballerina. Enemies have also gained some more variety like a fat man in a gimp costume, a nun-chuck wielding kung fu fighter and Arnold Schwarzenegger. That last one is not a joke and he will occasionally show up to slap you into next Tuesday. He starts off as the boss as the first stage but ends up being an occasional enemy. There are four levels like in the original and are a bit longer but not by much. They should take you about half an hour to beat them all. Beating a level no longer refills all your health instead only filling two bars which is pretty much useless. Once again the last level features pillars that pop out of the background to damage you and drove me insane though it is a much shorter section than the first game. This is by far the most polished game in this trilogy and have experience no problems.\n\nDouble Dragon 3 The Rosetta Stone is the next and final game in this trilogy and starts you off right into the action as you take down three enemies. As you dispatch these foes you will notice a weapon shop with a giant blinking arrow telling you to go inside. Once you are inside the game will ask you if you want to buy “tricks” “energy”or a “power up”. These were purchased  by entering money into the arcade machines back in the day and there is no way to buy them in this port. At least they didn't add micro-transactions in this port, but some way to earn the coins instead of having useless weapon shops laying around would have been a smarter move. Really shows you where the devs had their hearts at when the very first screen of the game is already trying to gauge more money out of you. This time around instead of a personal tale of revenge you will be traveling the world in search of  magic stones for some reason. I really couldn't tell you since the dialogue skips as soon as it is displayed so you can't read any of it. There is a lot more story in this game than the previous two and quite frankly you are not missing out on anything by not being able to read it. It would be forgivable of the gameplay was any good but that is not the case. You are given the ability to jump on downed enemies and are now able to kick projectiles out of the air like arrows. That is all rendered a lot less fun by the animations as they are terrible. Whenever they walk or move they kind of teleport around making it feel like a Gamecom game or for people that don't know what that is, imagine the early Ultima games where you  press the arrow key and the sprite teleports to where it is supposed to go. It is a very strange game featuring enemies like mummies, trees and Greek warriors and does not feel like Double Dragon at all. You can no longer use weapons either though it is a bit longer than the other two as it features 5 stages instead of 4.\n\nOverall it is a collection of two great games and a painfully mediocre third one, heavily let down by a plethora of glitches and crashes. As such I can not recommend this game to anyone and fans of the series should look elsewhere for a better version of these games.","August 11, 2015","false","5.8"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","27","43","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/314150/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","The series that ushered in the golden age of the brawler genre, Double Dragon came far before the likes of games such as Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, and Final Fight. The first installment went straight to the arcades in 1987, and it was an absolute hit with audiences. So much so that the game found itself later ported to nearly every home console available at the time. Not to mention, the arcade version was ported to Xbox Live Arcade in 2007, while the NES version found its way to the Wii Virtual Console in 2008. There's no doubt that Double Dragon is a series that will not fall into the abyss of time without a fight.\n\nThis trilogy collection includes the first three Double Dragon titles, in their original arcade format; do not expect any NES ports here. The main menu layout is much akin to that of the Golden Axe and Streets of Rage collections, although not as spiffy, where you move your left thumbstick either left or right to select the game that you want to play. Each of the three games have both their respective story and arcade modes, and you can choose between three difficulties; easy, original, and expert. DotEmu have also included both the original 8-bit soundtrack and a new remastered soundtrack for each title.\n\nThe differences between each difficulty mode is that the enemies hit you harder, and also take more hits themselves to kill. The original difficulty of Double Dragon is no laughing matter, the game is deemed as one of the hardest of all time; expert mode does prove to be a real challenge, especially under the constraints of the ever lingering time limit. While all of these demands that put our gaming skills to the test are welcomed, there are far too many flaws holding back the Double Dragon Trilogy that end up causing it to be a tiring and unpleasant experience.\n\nFirst, let's start off with the hit detection; it's utterly abhorrent. Combine the poor hit detection with a nasty input delay, and you have yourself an old school, hard ♥♥♥ beat 'em up that is no longer challenging to ones skills, but downright unfair.  Now before I get comments jumping all over me for these complaints, trust me... they're completely valid. When taking a look at the Streets of Rage collection that hit the Xbox Live marketplace in 2012, it did extremely well; there was no input lag, or poor hit detection. It functioned amazingly, and it didn't even feel like a conglomeration of ports at all. Double Dragon Trilogy on the other hand, is just a dwarfed brutalization of three epic arcade releases.\n\nThe next major flaw here is that once you've expended your lives, it really is game over for you. There's absolutely no way to continue, other than to restart entirely. Even in the arcade you were able to dump in quarters to pick up where you died at, so why is there no free play implemented here? This is the first arcade-to-PC port that I've played that has left out continued free play; whether it be a limited amount of continues, or infinite. So what we've got is some of the hardest brawler games of all time, with staggering input lag, shoddy hit detection, and no way of continuing once you've expended your lives. It really sounds like a great time, don't you think?\n\nSimply put, due to its flaws Double Dragon Trilogy just isn't fun at all. It comes off as more of a chore than anything else. Sure, the price is great at $6.49 CAD, that's just over two bucks a game. Not to mention these are the arcade releases, and not the NES ones; this is also the first time all three Double Dragon arcade games are available together. I scooped this up at launch due to sheer nostalgic excitement, I spent some time here and there with it, but just recently got around to sitting down and sinking my teeth in to it. What I was left with was a bad taste in my mouth, and no will to even finish Double Dragon II and III due to the aforementioned down points. You're better off keeping your nostalgic memories untarnished.\n\nRating: 1.0/5.0 - It's bad.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 26","false","1.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

This game somewhat faithfully follows these ports but the original arcade GUI is missing from the original counterparts. Double Dragon 3 only gives you so many credits to spend in the weapon shop the first time around and every shop you go into the game from there on keeps saying insert the coin. If you have played the game Sonic CD on Steam you will know that this particular game was built from the ground up. This is the emulation that seems to take place in this game. Tile for Tile. Using the original sound track as digitized BGM (sound track) and not arcade native. I've seen that there have been updates to this collection to fix bugs, etc, but it's not enough to bring this collection at arcade perfection. A great game if you want to play 2 players locally on the same computer but I think this game is for die hard fans only as opposed to someone who is looking for something else to play. Grabbed this during the sale. Not a bad game but I feel kind of left hanging expecting more from this game.","April 26, 2015","true","1.1"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","18","27","0","0"

They're recreated games using the sprites, backgrounds, and music ripped from the arcade game. If you have played the original arcade versions of these games you will know where all the enemies are placed, how many hits (elbows) it takes to take out the enemies, and also including button layouts.\n\nDouble Dragon 2 is the prime example of exactly the reason these games are recreated and not even emulated. The control scheme for Double Dragon 2 is Left Attack, Jump, and Right Attack. On Double Dragon Trilogy there exactly like Double Dragon 1 control scheme (Punch, Jump, and Kick) only switching out the kick to always do a back kick no matter which side your facing instead of meaning if your facing right you would press the left attack to back kick and vice verse. Also they don't even have the original hud of the game and instead made a "modern" hud with a generic font.\n\nI guess for nostalgia purposes these games serve their purpose. and for $5.99 you do get pretty good recreated games (including the awful controls of Double Dragon 3). Also note that they have it set to a certain number of continues for each difficulty as well as how many lives you start of with. And they don't even show you how many credits you have either. So don't expect to be able to insert coins or even have infinite credits.\n\nFinal verdict is if you like a classic beat-em-up style game then this game can satisfy for the price. But in all honesty nothing beats the original arecade games (although this does come kinda close).","January 22, 2015","false","7.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

My main problem is that it is only the first three games that got a re-release, as I would have loved for a port of 4 & 5, Double Dragon 5 was one of my favorites hands down, but I take what I can get, & I can see why it was only these games that got this treatment.

I won't even discuss Double Dragon 3 since this game is widely regarded as the worst of the three, and in my opinion maintains its reputation.\n\nI've tried the multiplayer with a friend and it was enjoyable but when you die the game goes out of sync.

TBH, I was more into the NES versions of Double Dragon with limited time on Double Dragon arcade games. (I just didnt have enough quarters as a kid to beat the first level)\n\nSo here it is, broken down short and sweet by the game this being a trilogy.\n\nDouble Dragon - This is by far the better one of the bunch. You can expect a lot of cheap hits, cheap deaths and jumps that you will die over and over again on. Bridge on level 2, Im looking at you. The movment is a little clunky but thats to be expected. You will die, a lot and most of the time by bad luck or an over zealous 'camping' opponent.\n\nDouble Dragon II - So much like the first one I swear they didn't change anything except confuse the balls off of you by making you kick backwards. It seemed to work better in the NES version along with the spin kick. I know how to do it, Im not sure if the game does. It's pretty inconsistant at best. Again, it's virtually the same game as DD with even a lot of the resoruces and source material being reused. meh.\n\nDouble Dragon III - Haha. This is the weird friend you had that pooped his pants at the fair. I really dont know what to make of it. If you want to plunk down $5 out of sheer morbid curiosity, go for it.\n\nSo there it is. The port itself isnt bad, almost no one is playing multiplayer. Its fun for a laugh when you're playing with a friend but my advice is just boot up you NES emulator and replay DD 1 and DD2. This is one of the only times that the console version is better than the arcade.\n\nGG Bimmy Lee\n\nAlso:\nhttp://youtu.be/zxTLi37jFIE","January 26, 2015","false","2.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

No. Is the remixed soundtrack worth it? No. Granted the game isn't very expensive, but they could have made it a bit more expensive and ironed out some of the gameplay issues. It also bugged out twice during a bit over an hour session.\n\nNot the worst emulated arcade game(s), but not really worth your time if you know how to use MAME.","January 16, 2015","false","3.2"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","18","38","2","0"

This is a side-scrolling beat-em-up in it's purest and simplest form.  You can punch, kick, jump, jump kick, and do a scant few other moves.  The enemies you'll face all have personality, but it's of the behavior-based variety.  The game is challenging, particularly on the Original and Expert difficulties, but can be finished in a short amount of time... even shorter if you become particularly skilled at the game and the nuances in it's play.\n\nDespite the inclusion of a "Story" mode, you're not getting a contemporary story here.  Double Dragon Trilogy hearkens back to a simpler time when games either didn't have a fleshed out story or if they did, it was typically comprised of a few static screens at the onset.  Back in 1987, Willy belting Marian in the gut and dragging her off into the unknown spoke volumes and provided all the inspiration needed to get her back.\n\nYou're also not getting deep backstories to any of the characters... the protagnoist(s), enemies, or otherwise.  All of the characters in the game have distinct personalities certainly, but there won't be any flashy character introductions or drawn out narratives to tell you what they are.  Working with what little is there and utilizing some imagination would likely be your best bet.\n\nSo with all of those limitations, why do I recommend this game?  As others have said, much of it is about nostalgia.  While I can certainly appreciate where the state of gaming is at today, I have an equally large appreciation for the games of my youth that effectively paved the way.  Double Dragon was not the first side-scrolling brawler, but it was the first to capture gamers imaginations in a way that it's predecessors and other titles of the era couldn't.  Whether it can still do that today depends on the individual.  In a generation rife with 1080p visuals, multi-channel surround sound, and multi-million dollar budgets, it's admittedly no easy task.\n\nStill, if you're looking for a game that can still retain it's charm despite almost 30 years of wear, Double Dragon Trilogy is it.","January 19, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

For those looking for the genuine experience starring their beloved super-deformed characters and pick-up-and-play controls, Trilogy is the way to go, even if the platforming has aged beyond rationality by today's standards.\n\nhttp://zbronpsn.blogspot.com/2015/02/a-return-to-golden-age.html","February 11, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I noticed already in the beginning of the first mission that the animation quality was poor (comparing to original game).I mean, you have to wait til one animation is done, which means its quite hard to pull of combos and  it makes the gameplay quite numb. There is no knee kick which is performed in the air, as it used to be on NES version. I expected it to have quite similar screenery ( not even close)and art style but nope.

All the attacking and moving animations have been delayied horrible which means that its hard to navigate on the map because it feels like you are clipping or having a lag that is equal to 400 ping.\nYes, in the original game there was somekinda delay between animations, but that didnt make the game bad.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/314150/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","The Double Dragon series has a spotty history. The original games set the standard for side-scrolling beat 'em ups during their 1980s heyday, but since then the series has been incredibly hit-or-miss, with acclaimed titles like Double Dragon Neon sharing the spotlight with rubbish like the Wander of the Dragons remake. Double Dragon Trilogy ($5.99), a PC game that arrives courtesy of Steam, gives gamers a taste of the iconic street-brawling arcade action. The games are just as enjoyable as they were back in the day, and publisher DotEmu has enhanced the trilogy to take advantage of the Steam platform. At the same time, however, odd emulation oversights and changes create holes in Double Dragon Trilogy's armor, devaluing what could have been a more-impressive package.\n\nA New Coat of Paint\n\nThe Double Dragon Trilogy comes with all the bells and whistles one would expect from a Steam release, including leaderboards, achievements, and online multiplayer mode. Unfortunately, the online multiplayer is a dead zone; I had little luck finding others to play online with. On the upside, Double Dragon Trilogy supports local co-op play, making it ideal for thug-slugging desktop shenanigans among friends.\n\nThe Double Dragon Trilogy gives players several resolution options to choose from, ranging from 800 by 600 to 1920 by 1080. The game doesn't benefit much from the increased pixel count, however, because the original arcade titles didn't sport high-resolution graphics. It's a nice option, nonetheless. Alongside the resolution selection is the full-screen option, which does little more than stretch the image, as well as video filtering, which smooths the edges in the game. Like Metal Slug 3, Double Dragon Trilogy lets you add scan-lines for a more classic arcade look.\n\nAfter spending some time with Double Dragon Trilogy, it became clear that the games are not a faithful emulation of the arcade originals, but rather subtly enhanced versions. DotEmu tweaked the game engine in such a way that the Double Dragon games run at an increased (and much more consistent) speed than their arcade counterparts. The original Double Dragon games were hardly paragons of performance, as it took just a few energetic enemies to appear on-screen at once to slow the gameplay to a crawl. The enhanced and more consistent speed is a welcome improvement, though the change may turn off those players hoping for a more-faithful emulation of the original games.\n\nPros\nFast gameplay. Good controller support. Local co-op and higher-difficulty modes add longevity to the trilogy.\n\nCons\nNo free-play mode. Awkward changes to soundtrack and UI. Some story scenes and intros botched or outright removed.\n\nBottom Line\nThe Double Dragon Trilogy is an enjoyable nod to the nostalgic action games of old. Publisher DotEmu has made subtle changes to the classic gameplay, however, with mixed results.\n\n8/10","January 17, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","3","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/niddospalace/recommended/314150/","niddospalace","Niddo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/niddospalace/","171 products in account","My Terrible, Terrible Review of Doctor Dre'gon Trilogy: BlackWarriors Wit Attitude\ntl;dr softcore 6/10. [/i]games play fine, interface nice, but too basic. gaben i want my money back.[/i]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Double Dragon games are pretty good (except DD3 which is okay at its absolute best). This is a port of the arcade games. This review focuses more on the port than the games.\n\nQuick Anecdote: There's this thing called MAME, which stands for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator. I played and beat the Double Dragon games on this MAME doohickey. Despite knowing this fact, when this trilogy port hit Steam I bought it immediately. I thought, "Hey, maybe this port has some cool features and other settings like those boys at Iron Galaxy like to do with their arcade ports. Maybe it has cool cards that I can score a neat background/badge from."\n\nNope. You get a single video filter, "On," which is French for "Blurry," and three scanline settings: off, 50%, and 100%. The scanline effects are nice at least, though it'd be great if you could use a slider or it had more increments. There are some achievements and plenty of cards. Most of the cards, however, look like screenshots and cropped sprites ripped from said screenshots What? No trademark laughably bad promotional art or marquee mockups at least? That's pretty much a Double Dragon staple.\n\nOh and there are resolution settings too, but cough what kind of cough emulated port on pc cough past the year of 1999 cough wouldn't have this option. cough. There's an option for arranged versions of BGM available as well, but to me, they're not as solid as the original songs and in no way possible could top Neon's arrangments.\n\nHey, the menu's pretty nice to look at and the HUD is radical barring the Lucida Sans TIME font, but that's just trivial. There's a difficulty select, which I assume is based on the dipswitch settings from the original arcade boards. At least they had the option. The Story Mode is just an overglorified level select. You have to beat the game on one continue and for each level you beat you can return to playing it in that level. I was expecting cutscenes or still images like the NES ports had, but I guess not.\n\nAs for the multiplayer.. If you have a good connection with your partner, it's fine, but if you're like me, and your modem is a Texas Instruments calculator jury-rigged to a car battery and a mobile phone SIM chip, it's hard not to lag in games. From my experience, DD1 runs the best, DD2 doesn't lag that much, but DD3.. It's not as great. Couch co-op is fine but it seemed like the controls were even jumpier than usual.\n\nThe controls are responsive, though a bit jumpy (with a gamepad at least). I'm not entirely sure, but a lot of other reviewers are mentioning that hit detection in this game is wonky and unlike the arcade versions, but I remember the arcade versions were kinda poppycock too at times. I CAN, however, tell you that there are frame drops in all games. Not always and completely noticeable in the first two games and DD3 had slowdown issues to begin with, but an FPS counter and/or v-sync option of some form would've been nice.\n\nTo be fair, it doesn't seem like DotEmu churned this out for a quick cash grab, because it already has a patch. And I assume they're making or will make more patches in the future. That's always nice of a developer to do, at least. It shows that they pay attention.\n\nI rate this port a softcore 6/10. The games are good and make up 5.9999 of the 6 points I gave it, but it's too bare-minimum and unrefined of a port to be giving it the time of day. Just go play it on MAME and wait until DotEmu (hopefully) polishes this jewel a bit, they're not even asking for much, too. And hey, if you feel bad about emulating these games, don't. The rights to Double Dragon games have been a mystery since the first game was made, and I'm sort of doubting DotEmu had the license to do this, so in a way, you're just about doing the same thing but paying for it.\n\n~ "King" Niddo D.

Worse and worse the longer and/or more often you play. The problem is not that the games haven't aged well -- they are what they are; it's that this is a profoundly lazy and faulty port.\n\nAs should be expected of a simple port, games themselves are faithful to the original. Except for the horrible, unnecesary HD vitality, score, and time displays over the arcade-resolution original games. Oh, and the finite continues. In arcade ports. From 1987-1990. Which there is no option to modify in settings. Also, finite credits, also with no option to modify, which is a problem in Double Dragon 3, whose money-grubbing arcade incarnation exchanged power-ups, weapons, and "extra guys" for real-world money. Now, you just can't use those options more than a handful of times.\n\nStory mode isn't so much "story" mode as level-select mode with zero continues.\n\nLeaderboards remember some, but not all, of the player's high scores. I got a game over screen congratulating me on a 70k score, but the leaderboard still only shows a 60k score for the same game and difficulty.\n\nSome achievements ("50000," for me) don't unlock when player meets criteria.\n\nKey configuration doesn't recognize major controllers like, for instance, the Xbox controller. Bindings display cryptic "BUTTON:0," "BUTTON:1," and so on.\n\nMenus are inconsistent; some start with top item highlighted, some with bottom. This is a bigger deal than it sounds like with nested menus.\n\nDisplay settings are godawful and broken. Selecting fullscreen aspect ratio in display settings merely horizontally stretches the 4:3 display. The "video filtering" option looks like you need to adjust the sharpness on an old CRT TV, or put on your reading glasses. User *can* change resolution, but it can cause critical problems. I'm using a 1920 x 1080 HDTV display, and the 1920 x 1080 resolution setting is larger than my screen and offset to the right so I only see about the left third and vertically central three-fifths of what I should be seeing. 720 resolution fills my 1080 display properly. It's as though the game filters display settings through a 720 resolution emulator, but still offers higher resolutions for some unknowable reason. Default settings are completely visible, but boxed on all sides by more black space than display space.","January 17, 2015","false","3.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

But, DD2 and 3 suck. DD2 is almost the same game, not only the combat, but stages, as DD1 and DD3 is awkward and just not fun. The only playable and barely enjoyable game is DD1, but you'll beat it too quickly and the whole experience leaves you very unsatisfied.\n\nI don't suggest buying DD Trilogy, I'd rather play Double Dragon on the NES.","January 15, 2015","false","1.2"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

However, even I can admit that the original arcade games have not aged very well over the years. This collection only serves to prove that point. Compared to what is available today, the gameplay found in these classics has grown quite stale.\n\nAs for the collection itself, DotEmu has done a serviceable job with the overall emulation. It's not perfect (some graphic overlays and music cues are missing), but it will do. However, other than featuring tracks from the remastered soundtracks that were released in the 80s (which are quite good), there are hardly any extras to speak of.\n\nIf you are a super hardcore fan of the Double Dragon series that must own every release out there, then the $5 you'll spend here is worth it. Everyone else, however, would do better to spend their money elsewhere. I'd suggest tracking down a copy of Double Dragon Advance for the Game Boy Advance, as I feel that this game is the 'superlative' version of Double Dragon.","January 15, 2015","false","5.8"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","7","23","0","3"

But alas, DotEmu are infamous for their ♥♥♥♥♥♥, buggy porting and they did their worst. Some people also experience heavy lags in multiplayer (including me, I even had lags in singleplayer, had to switch to windowed mode to fix it.), so it's unplayable for 2 reasons already. Well, maybe "unplayable" is not the word. But it's hard to enjoy the game in such condition. Not really worth the price and i don't recommend this port. Maybe if you want to play online SO MUCH, you can buy it, beware though.\n\nJust in addition: This is Arcade version of the games, not the classic Double Dragon. Oldfarts from the 80s, If you feel like tickling your "nostalgia" then try free emulators instead.","January 15, 2015","false","3.4"," 11 of 36 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","11","36","2","0"
