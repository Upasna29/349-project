I played the game for almost two hours and got to an ending (there are more), and I'm quite disappointed, here's why:\n\nNOTE: I'm posting this in the forums in case someone wants to discuss it.\n\nExpectations\n\nI wanted to play the game but I wasn't hyped. All I was hoping for was a nice exploration game with great art, something like FEZ or Proteus where I could wander and lose myself.\n\nArt and Music\n\nThe art is gorgeous and the soundtrack is great too. Seriously, that part is great and very enjoyable.\n\nNarrative (SPOILER FREE)\n\nThe narrative is nice, feels like a collection of tiny stories told with just a bit of text.\n\nI won't spoil the ending, but it was the only part about the narrative that I didn't like at all, in my opinion it doesn't fit the style of the game and it ruins the mood (at least it did ruin the mood for me).\n\nGameplay\n\nThere's no real gameplay in "Qora", it's just following a path and watching some cutscenes. I was expecting some real exploration but it's an extremely linear game, there are some secrets or things you can find but those lack depth.\n\nThere are some obstacles in the path(pits or rocks) but to overcome them you just have to press a key and watch an animation. First I thought it was clever, as these elements made you stop and enjoy the art, but once you have gone trough tons of them you just don't see the point in it anymore. It's highly repetitive and it's no challenge at all.\n\nI didn't feel like I had a significant impact in the world/story and I wasn't challenged in any way. This is not an issue in games like Proteus or Gone Home, where you can go wherever you want and explore, but as I said earlier I wouldn't say this game is about exploration due to how limited you are.\n\nReplay Value\n\nI wouldn't replay the game, there's no challenge at all, I wouldn't spend another two hours going through the same stages, bored to death, just to look for a tiny secret.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe art and the music are amazing, and the game run flawless, but it feels like an animated art gallery where you have to press a button to watch the next piece of art. I've enjoyed Proteus, Gone Home and similar titles, but I had to make an effort to finish this one. Consulting a game designer would have been great. I really wanted to like "Qora", but in the end, it just didn't happen :(\n","October 2, 2014","false","1.7"," 141 of 166 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","141","166","0","2"

While I will not say anything about the story, I rather enjoyed it anyway. The little guy does not run fast so it can be rather slow and tedious getting through some scenes, but I enjoyed the art mostly and the colours aswell :)\n\nOnly downfall is to get your 100% achievements you will need to play the game twice, which did not worry me. But I did leave the game running for a while as I left to do other things away from the game, and many of us do this, which is fine. There should not be set time limits to completing a game, so this game could well take 6 hours or less to complete and plenty patients.\n\nPrice wise I'd say maybe wait for a good sale if you are curious about this game and wish to give it a go.

Running around a cool, strange world, interacting with fantastic characters and seeing a developer's vision of another universe is one of the most enjoyable parts of gaming. Having read Rock Paper Shotgun's review of Qora, I was excited - maybe I have another Knytt or Journey on my hands! Then I played it.\n\nQora is absolutely and unequivolcally complete and utter dog ♥♥♥♥. This is an exploration game with no "game". You do nothing but move to the right and press the action button to watch a series of painfully slow animations, dozens of times in a row. It's completely mind boggling how a developer can design a level consisting of nothing more than an enormously long hallway littered with 20 identical short pits that the player must do nothing but hold right and press action to traverse.\n\nThis takes upwards of a full minute. For each of the game's 100+ screens.\n\nEvery one of the levels are exactly that - whether the obstacle is a pile of grass, a rock, a pit, a ladder, it doesn't matter. You never make any choices, you never wander around. You move to the right. You remove a small obstacle in a mind-numbingly boring way. You move to the right some more. It's all functionally identical, and it's the least fun I've ever  had in a game.\n\nIt's inexcusable. There is no way in hell the developer played his own game, because it's tears-streaming-down-your-face boring. Again, please let me reiterate that I love this genre - but Qora is garbage. 0/5 stars. Do not purchase no matter how much you like the aesthetic or world. It's simply not worth the time.","August 15, 2015","false","1.9"," 56 of 77 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","56","77","6","1"

Right off the bat I am in love with the soundtrack. After being introduced to the magnificently well-made pixel art by the jolly men building my house, I become immersed in the life of this new town in which I now live, it lacks nothing, and every resident has his own personality and their own problems and fortunes. The town is as active as any I’ve ever seen. The geography of the town is beautifully realized.\n\nThe story captivates you once you start the actual plot, with a lore ever so mysterious that keeps you playing in order to find out everything about it. You are a special person, and you didn’t know it until a statue told you so. I have the power to be a link between two worlds, our world and the world of our ancestors. It is my job to find out the truth about our world through their world. Temple-older-than-ancestors-themselves here I come. Will I actually learn anything? Maybe.\n\nAs I venture off in the outskirts of this beautiful world’s town, I realize I wouldn’t be able to progress without the help of some of the residents. I acquired a sweater a machete a pickaxe among other things. A fellow traveller is on the same journey as I am, though he lacks the ‘sight’ and therefore finds it emptier than I do. He wants ghosts, but only I can see them. However, he finds what he was looking for, while I endlessly keep on searching…\n\nThe smoothness of the gameplay is simply satisfying, and the sceneries never fail to impress, dropping my jaw each time I enter a new map. It is beginning to feel like a true love letter to classic RPG-Explorers, even if the linearity is strong. The feeling this game conveys is a complex one and difficult to understand, the link between present and past, between descendant and ancestor, it is a beautiful one, and I am beginning to think this is the initiation of an epic adventure.\n\nThe deeper I go, the more I fall in love. This is a place of wonder, a place of magic, a place of emotion, a place of companionship, a place of solitude, a place of war, and a place of peace.\nStories about love, stories about hate, stories about misfortunes, stories about silliness, stories about sacrifice, and stories about freedom. This game, is extremely human.\n\nThe soundtrack is what manages to complete the conveyance of whatever sentiment the developers are trying to achieve, and it does so extraordinarily. I personally loved every single minute of this game, and do not regret putting in 3 hours into it whatsoever.","October 6, 2014","true","3.0"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","31","42","2","1"

Who thought that would make for interesting gameplay?).\n\nIf you're going to make a serious, atmospheric game that draws people in, then cut the humour down as you go along. If you want to make a game that throws jokes around with every NPC you speak to, then at least have some sort of goal or satirical message to make the experience worthwhile.

But boy did this game deliver. The best I can describe this game as is a interactive movie. Basically you travel into this absolutely stunning journey, and go forth to learn about the secrets the world in this game is hiding from you. What this game makes up for in slow movement is: Eargasmic Music, Gorgeous Pixel Graphics, and a Storyline that makes you want to keep playing. Although some people might dislike the slow movement, whilst your character is ever so carefully travelling throught the level, you cant help yourself but to start admiring the beautiful things happening around you.

You move left, right, you climb, you jump and drop off of obstacles. Additionally you at times you need to hack some grass or crush a rock. Maybe even light an altar. A one button sort of affair. But it all has this sense of not being real.\n\nYes, this is probably not new. An Indie developed pixel art game that lends itself to an “artsy-fartsy”(if you’ll excuse the term) sense of being. However this one pokes fun at itself. The writing seems aware of the players doubt that this is totally pretentious and gives them a nod from time to time.\n\nDespite the overwhelming knowledge that I was pretty sure I could not die and that every time I pressed space or down to perform the canned animation of jumping over a hole or dropping down from a ledge. I found myself staring at it. As if the tiny little maybe 8 pixel character was both struggling and simultaneously gallivanting through the world without a care. I was transfixed. Even though I had zero doubt that he would not be able to make the jump. Each time I pressed the button, I said to myself; What if he doesn't make it?\n\nIt takes around 1 hour and 45 minutes to complete. I recommend playing it in one sitting.

I also got the strongest impression that what mechanics exist (i.e. machete a few bits of brush / rock out of the way) were there to deliberatly slow play down and force the player to drink in each scene.

The aforementioned lack of interaction makes this game struggle to define itself as a game as opposed to a movie, with most input from the player boiling down to walking in the appropriate direction and pressing Space to activate cutscenes.

The environments are varied and fascinating and beautiful, but again, I think their portrayal could be better.\n\nThe pacing is slow; within my tolerance, but too slow for most players.  There are neither puzzles nor platforming sequences nor even the most rudimentary combat; the "interactivity" is almost exclusively limited to pressing a single button and moving forward.\n\nWhat really kills the game for me, though, is the nigh-schizophrenic weirdness of the story elements.  The strongest narrative thread runs through the whole game, but we never see its resolution.  Mixed with this are ghosts of past civilizations and events (which add to the experience) and... alien abductions, string quartets, and bashful invisible creatures (which really strained my suspension of disbelief).  The whole thing ends with what would feel like a deus ex machina if it actually resolved any of the confusion preceding it, but instead just feels like getting hit in the face with a hallucinogenic frying pan.\n\nI came into this game with high hopes, expecting it to live up to the standard set by Sword & Sworcery.

The story reveals a plot of serious themes around cult, believe and religion (worship, progress, nature, rock art, burning of whitches, native Americans, Greek myths etc.) peppered with some kind of humour (sometimes too childish).\nSome words to the endings (there are 2): For me, the "bad" one was the better ending, a return to the daily routine - the good ending is partly funny partly dumb and I can understand why people are not content with it.\nTo sum things up: I had an atmospheric time playing the game two times (to get 100% achievements), for one run you need about 2-3 hours.

You feel the urge to push the story but after 20 to 30 minutes you get going. After that bumpy start it's a lot of nostalgia that sucks you right in.\n\nQORA (formely known as SPIRIT) is a combination of interactive storytelling and a reminiscence to old Atari or C64 gameplay. If you like games like Emily's Away or Gone Home this is another one for you. QORA catches the spirit of LOOM or Another World without giving you the riddles and jump 'n run. It's odd at times and doesn't always take itself serious but then again rocks (in a way like watching the first Ghostbusters movie).

This game looked neat, and different than anything I had ever seen before, and it was. The first thing I hear upon opening the game is the beautiful title music. I start to play enjoying the simplicity of the game. Throughout the game only five buttons are actually used, and despite the absence of any dynamic player controls I found this game entertaining.  It only took a couple hours (about 3) but I strongly advise everyone to take their time. Whether it is worth the $10 is completely up to you. (completely worth it if it goes on sale).\n\nMost of the game (exept for parts in the begining where you go left) involves constantly holding D (right arrow default) to walk endlessly to the right (perhaps a little slowly for my taste but this can be overlooked). All actions in the game including the few player interaction moves (jumping, climbing, etc.) are all executed using the spacebar (default) and can only be used when prompted by the game.\n\nThere is no doubt that if you get this game it will not be for the direct gameplay which is virtually nonexistant. It will be for:\n1. the soundtrack, which is quite good especially that opening theme and comparable to the FEZ soundtrack\n2. the scenery, in which some cases you may sit on onescreen for a few minutes just looking at it\n3. the plot, the feeling this game causes is impossible to accurately explain\n\nThe Plot - (NO spoilers here keep reading)\nThe plot over all was great. The journey that your charcter embarks on will fill you a sence of awe. It goes at a relatively slow pace but that is how this game is. It keeps you wondering building up with more mystery untill the end, and it turns out it is the single worst ending I have ever seen in a game with such a great ... well everything else. The ending had a ruinous effect on the feeling the rest of the game created. You play through such a mysterious, deep, moving plot and then it is ruined by a very trivial ending in which a very serious game is turned into a big joke.\n\nSo here is what I recomend. I would encourage you to get the game as it is truely a great game, but i would actually advise you not to view the ending thereby maintaining that sense of wonder this game will surely cause you to feel.","October 10, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Talked to random people in town and they handed me weaponry, incense, and tacky clothing- and I'm not above being swayed by bribery!\n\nIn all seriousness though, the game mostly involves walking, talking, and experiencing the world. There's very little in the way of gameplay, as you generally spend most of your time moving from place to place interacting with other characters, or the environment. So if you like more passive gameplay/storytelling, this one will be worth a shot.\n\nThe writing is amazing, for while the plot hasn't sucked me in, the various things characters say more than make up for it, especially early-on. The dude that gave me the machete might've been using me to hide evidence, as he'd recently used it to murder a bunch of kids to feed to his pigs. It's delivered well though, as it's the kind of line you can easily skip over, misinterpret, or miss entirely because you were reading too fast.\n\nThe art/music/sound effects fit everything perfectly. It's gorgeous, has great atmosphere, and while it's minimalistic, it's very imaginative.\n\nMy only complaint is you use the dpad to walk, and you walk slowly. It helps push the atmospheric nature of everything, but it gets a bit frustrating after a while. Also, interacting with objects is obnoxious (ladders are hard to climb, which is nonsense).\n\nOverall, if you like calm, story driven games, with little to no real gameplay- this one's probably worth picking up. It's fairly short though, and while it has multiple endings- it's probably better on sale.\n\nHere's my first impressions of the game:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/picO9MmBRWY","October 3, 2014","true","3.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you're looking for a game with combat, puzzle-platforming and action, this is not the game for you. Qora is meant to be played slowly, methodically and calmly. After about 30 minutes, I developed a warm, cozy feeling in my stomach and started getting pretty deep introspective thoughts. A game that actually makes you  think , not just blindly do, is a real rarity.\nFor a pretentious ♥♥♥♥ hole like me, Qora is about giving in to a longing to travel, adventure and explore; it's about letting go of apprehension and just going on a journey and finding some sort of peace and satisfaction from getting to the end. Less conceited players may think this to be bull ♥♥♥♥.\nQora has some of the most stunning pixel art I've ever seen in a game, which is accompanied by a lovely soundtrack. Some parts of the game were genuinely heart-warming thanks to a combination of the two. The story is brilliant and manages to weave seriousness and witty, unexpected and sometimes pretty grim humour very well. Unfortunately, it can be finished in under 2 hours and the gameplay itself is pretty shallow.\nQora isn't as much a game as an interactive animated film. If you are willing to get lost in it and take in the beautiful visuals and music, Qora will leave you with some interesting ideas and a pleasant, lasting impression. If you think this sounds like your cup of tea, you should absolutely buy it.","October 6, 2014","true","9.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

So I would, in theory, enjoy a slow paced visually arsty exploration game with minimal player involvement for the experience of it all. However, Qora was a real disappointment for me.\n\nFirst on the visual elements—I found the art style underwhelming. There are some gorgeous 8-bit style games out there. This, in my opinion, wasn’t one of them. I don’t know, the advertised screenshots were pretty, but I quickly found the visuals monotonous. Same with the music, there were some pretty themes, but the repetition quickly irritated me. One random positive note for me though was that I found the jumping, stair climbing, and pickaxe swinging animations strangely satisfying. Maybe because it was something new to look at.\n\nThe story—Oh god the writing in this. I think its trying really hard to be edgy and funny, but it just fails so badly that I felt like I was cringing every time I had to read dialogue, and you have to read a fair bit (you have to talk to basically everyone in town in order to get the items you need to continue). Jokes about decapitation, suicide, bestiality, and homophobia were casually tossed about, and I wasn’t bothered so much as confused—I thought this was more a meditation on the meaning of life, not South Park, and they weren’t even remotely funny, just stupid, which would have been their own redeeming value.\n\nAlso, the plotting was weird in my mind, I felt shoehorned into a story I didn’t particularly care about, with a (mostly) silent protagonist (who won’t comment on things like the gods talking to him or boulders crashing down and nearly killing him but will note that its kinda odd that there’s a ghost) and a mystery that not even the other characters in the game seem to care that much about. There seems to be no investment in trying to get the player to care about what’s happening and why, just assuming that if we continue playing we obviously care about what’s going to happen next.\n\nMechanics—and this is where I basically found my feeling for this game going from frustration to rage. After twenty minutes of playtime, I decided to save and quit and maybe see if I wanted to try it again some other time. Or at least I tried to; the game helpfully informed me that if I left now all my progress on level would be lost. I resigned myself to playing some more, sure that eventually I’d get to the end of the level and be able to save. Nope. I played over an hour, with every time I tried to quit getting the same message, and no indications of whether or not I had gotten to a new level or if the game had saved. I eventually just gave up and left.\n\nMaybe someday I’ll try again and find out if the game actually saved anywhere or if I’ll have to start over again from the beginning. Maybe. Probably not.","January 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","3"

The path ahead is almost entirely linear, brought to life with beautiful vistas crafted through pixel art and supported by a tranquil soundtrack. But there's very little to actually interact with, so what is there ends up feeling very perfunctory. Every tool, save one, is collected before the adventure starts; there's not even any mystery or problem solving there (though I can't imagine the backtracking involved if you did not take your time and speak to everyone). You're encouraged from the beginning to play slowly, but it's difficult to miss an opportunity permanently and it's impossible to die. There's no stress or tension here. It's all replaced with a soothing calm that permeates the whole experience. With as little input or risk as it requires from the player, Qora could have easily been made as a film, but it'd be a film worth watching. Should you feel inclined to spend the time and money on it, you'll likely walk away happier than you were when you started, as brief and straightforward as the game is.","March 24","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music and visuals are perfect. It's less of a game and more of an interactive story, but it really immerses you in its surreal world and is well worth playing.\n\nThe movement of your character is very slow and cannot be sped up. In each screen, you are faced with obstacles which will take not skill or imagination, but time and patience to overcome. At times it can feel eternal, and even get a bit frustrating, but you are driven forward by curiosity – what strange and interesting thing will you encounter on the next screen? - as well as a desire to overcome the obstacles and prove your determination. There are countless games out there that test our reflexes or critical thinking skill, but it's rare for a game to test our patience - and to do it well. This game felt like a rare exception.\n\nMy only complaint lies with the achievements: in order to get them all, you must play the entire game through twice. I think this was a huge mistake on the part of the developer. This game has no real replay value. There are two endings, but the differences in gameplay between getting one ending and getting the other are minute. Most people will probably get the “good” ending first, then, noticing they are missing an achievement, realize they have to go back and do the whole thing over again while making mistakes. The second playthrough has all the joy and wonder sucked out of it as you race for the finish to get your final Steam achievement. The game would have been much improved without this.\n\nDespite this one criticism, I still recommend getting the game. It's an experience which you will not regret. The visuals and music alone make it worth your time and money, and the ending will make you think differently about how we view certain aspects of our culture.","August 4, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The music is enjoyable and the story is decent, even if the ending is a bit weird (I got the "good" ending). Some of the dialogue makes it unclear when the game is meant to be taking place, since some of the "ancient" characters talk about (for example) a kitchen sink or a nude beach. The character walks relatively slow and there isn't really a lot of "puzzle" in terms of interaction. The tags call this a platformer, but you can only jump when the context cue is available and there are only a few locations where you actually have to figure out where to go. Your little guy walks along through these pretty locations and you get told a story. If you're okay with that, I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nMy only real negative with the game is that after getting the "good" ending, you can't see the "bad" ending without completely replaying a two-hour game.

Take any lounge music track and slow it down to half speed. Done.\n\nGameplay\nThis is what lets the game down and sapped all my incentive to play. In the absence of a jump key or the ability to run, you’re left slowly scrolling from left to right along a completely linear path. In fact, even when moving up and down objects, the animations are painfully unhurried. Thankfully, in aside from the walking simulator elements, there are opportunities to interact with the environment. Unfortunately, these are primarily limited to two functions: chopping down grass that blocks your path, and breaking rocks that block your path.\n\nThe pace of the game is slow, and if that’s your bag, you’ll probably enjoy it. For me, I’d much prefer to run quickly by areas in which zero new gameplay is occurring, especially if backtracking previously explored areas.\n\nNarrative\nUnfortunately, the leisurely, repetitive and unengaging nature of the gameplay was such that I became bored and impatient before I had the opportunity to experience much of the narrative.\n\nOf the sections I did persevere with and play through, it looks as though the central storyline could progress somewhere interesting, pursuing the ability to connect with a spirit world.\n\nAside from the main narrative of the game, the dialogue with NPCs left much to be desired. The writers consciously attempted to write the NPC dialogue as humorous, but failed rather miserably and came across as trying far too hard in this respect. In fact, the strained ‘zany’ nature of the dialogue was such that I soon gave up bothering to talk to NPCs.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/hh2F0PVmnbA","October 3, 2014","false","0.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

You hold a button to move from left to right, pressing the context-sensitive action button whenever you hit an obstacle (jump, cut grass, break stone, etc.).

Half of these telepathy sequences have no bearing on the story whatsoever, and show you random animations that will just make you scratch your head. The other half of these sequences are story-related, showing you snippets from the journey of an ancient empress whose footsteps you are following.\n\nSometimes I am in the mood for a lazy experience where I do not have to do much, but it is hard to recommend Qora because I found the story (and ending) very underwhelming.","July 5, 2015","false","6.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Options themselves are very basic - full screen, controls, volume and resolution - which only actually means the size of window when you play in windowed mode.\n\nAgain, the worst is the coding. UNLESS I leave the whole PC only for this game then the game loads slooooooooooooooooow. And I see "Loading" for few minutes before it starts up.\nSo by comparison I can launch Skyrim or Dead Space faster than Qora - that's right... that's how badly it's optimized.\nIn fact since I'm currently copying a lot of files between my external HDDs - playing these small steam games is a way for me to kill time. But THIS game just slows down to a crawl - at times even freezes when I alt-tab.\n\nI mean this is a game on the level of windows games like solitare. Let's be real. My PC has 12GB RAM and i7 CPU. AAA games can all launch faster than this little "snail".\n\nSo yeah. Not just I'm not impressed by the game itself - but how badly it's optimized.\nOn top of that, this is one of those games where Steam detects the time only on exit (or so it seems) and if I play them in windowed - it take muuuuch longer than comparable games to get the cards dropped. I had the same problem with the terrible game called "Retention" which didn't even have full screen mode (had to get 10h on a 10min game just to get cards). But here even with the full screen - it still refuses to drop cards for me and I'm already past 2h, so I think this is related to the full screen thing again. It's always those small, indie games that prefer to work in windowed mode that have issues with card drops for me.\n\nPS. And just as I finished this review and alt tabbed back into the game (at this point my HDD copying finished, so now the game has the whole floor for itself) - and guess what... that's right, the game froze, again. What a turd.","January 8","false","9.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","4"

I kind of forgot about but a couple of months ago I received a message telling me the game was ready. It was now called Qora, but apart from that the creators of the game don't seemed to have strayed from what they showed in the early footage.\n\nAn artsy pixelated indy "game" with great sound and music and somehow out of space atmosphere. And that is exactly what qora is, I wrote "game" because the gameplay is at best very simple. Mostly you move around with the arrow keys on a 2- dimensional plan, the action keys give some interactivity in some places. Some people would argue it's not really a game, I personally disagree, the game controlls are very basic and geared mostly toward discovery and contemplation on the rather beautiful screens the game has to offer,  but there are still some room for interaction.\n\nThe strong side of the game are the rather beautiful landscape it offers and great music , those changed as the game progressed toward your goal. The game has a few dark themes but mostly it's a very relaxing experience and I rather enjoyed playing. My critic is that apart from the obvious artsy settings and pretty screens the game somehow failed to inspire me the way it obviously was intended to.\n\nI understand what the developers wanted to do, somehow convey an almost spiritual experience, but to be honest the game lacked depths for that, maybe because it was too obvious from the start. I also had a problem with the story as it felt fragmented and sometime illogical. Monsters you meet would tell you about their stove (huh?) and although your character is blessed with some kind of sight to see vision from the past, at one point you see a futuristic city , interesting but I felt it didn't really fit with the already disjointed story.\n\nYou get toward the end of the game a rather cool revelation, but it's a bit too little too late and many will have guessed the outcome a long time before. I still liked the game for it's nice and quite atmosphere and great tunes and don't regret sponsoring it. The minimalistic approach is an exciting concept, but everything has to be really right to frame it, for Qora I just felt it could have been done better, still a good try.","December 1, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I did have a couple of problems with the game though. My biggest issue was that it was far too short. This game would have been in my top 10 favourite games if it weren't for its brevity. I also found it disappointing the fact that you can't come back to explore more without starting a new game. That would be greatly appreciated in an update.\nPersonally, I think this game should be ported to the app store as an ios game, so you can quickly pull out your phone and quickly immerse yourself in this fantastic world.\n\nI absolutely loved it.\n","February 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Qora is mainly driven by it's brilliant narrative and fantastic art styling, and this helps the player to appreciate what it offers within the core dynamics of the game. The only con I have with the game is the animation of movement when walking up stairs, it looks very irregular (but it's a very minor issue).  Another feature in which I love is the character dialogue at the start and throughout the game itself; it's clever, it's intuitive and also funny at parts. Another point i'd like to make is that I loved the use of Enigma to elude the player when they realised something had been spoiled to them earlier within the narrative, this made me ecstatitc when I had realised.\n\nI thoroughly recommend this game to a player who appreciates such beautiful art styling and soundtrack, but however; if you're the sort of gamer who enjoys action then this probably isn't the game for you unfortunately.","October 2, 2014","true","12.1"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

But first I just want to say that the dialouge is fresh as I said for the most part. The sound track and visuals too are just beautiful, the atmosphere is calming and just on that alone this game does it for me. However as much as I love this game, there are faults to be had here and I shall name a few. I shall try to not spoil anything of course in this review\n\nProblem        Description                Drawn out content:        Though playing this was fun at times especially at certain sections it seems the level deisng inherinetly is made to only waste your time. For example there's grass and rocks you absolutely have to mine to go further into the game. However they are used almost too often in the game and without significant breaks in between, not only that but it takes time, even a small amount fo time, to clear them out. Now this isnt a proiblem if it was only a few sections and you didnt have to waste so much time per cutting/mining them out. But I feel the balance of this is offset a lot to jsut draw out the gameplay                Repatitive content        Now this isnt neccasarily as big as the drawn out content because this sorta plays into that problem a bit more but I beleive its a point worth bringing up. Firstly the doors, whilst I eventually saw them as a summery for what I had previously done I found them initially and even when I saw them as summeries, a bit repatitive. The same basic thing was being said over and over and as much as the door opening initially was awe-inspiring, the 6th+ time? Not so much                Cliched        Now this could potentually be a problem but it depends on person to person, it could also be because of the simple fact this game usually likes to have a decent amount of references in this game. I cant go into specifics without spoiling the game but there are cliche'd stuff here but it could be excused as just mere references to classics, etc. Depends on your veiw really but I would prefer the references to other works not take on such a main role, it should be reserved for more background stuff I believe.\nOverall I dont think this is a bad game by a long shot, but its not a masterpiece either, it has areas which needs to be improved on. I believe the dev's should focus on giving the player more to do from dialouge section to dialouge section. Apart from the story theres nothing for the player to do other then go right, press space occasionally for rocks, grass, etc. A puzzle element that is entrenched into the story would be a mechanic that I would of enjoyed a little bit more myself. Anyway I reccomend this game if you are a fan of stuff like this or are on the fence about it however if you do not like this type of genre I cant see you liking anything much about this game. If you want to see my inital reactions to this game I have a lets play about it, feel free to check it out yourself and decide from there if this review isnt enough to wet your whistle!\nYou can find it here!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c32qRh1OA4U","November 11, 2014","true","1.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","8"

I'll keep it simple. This is a simple, beautiful side scroller. The story is interesting, the music is lovely, and the graphics are incredible. At least, I think they're stunning. This is one that's worth adding to your library - perhaps when it's on sale ($10 is a bit high, and it doesn't even include the soundtrack which is totally worth owning).\n\nI gladly sunk hours into this one.

Sometimes birds fly past and you're forced to stand still until they've flown off-screen again, I have no idea why unless it was implemented to artificially increase playtime?\n\nI haven't finished playing this game, but so far the story doesn't seem to be all that special. Some glimpses into the ghost world/past and some villagers that appear to have been written by someone who thought they were above such characters themselves. Not to mention the jokes seem to fall flat so far.\n\nThe price also seems a bit too steep since replayability is limited and the average playthrough is apparently about 3hrs. I'm glad I got this in a bundle.\n\nThe positive note: it looks nice and is very relaxing, the music is nice.\n\nTL;DR: unless you're looking for something that looks pretty and isn't challenging but has a story, I recommend you buy something else.

It's linear, it's relaxing, and it has an awesome soundtrack.\n\nSo, I don't exactly know how to compress my feelings about qora at all. I guess I'll start by the graphics. The graphics design was extremely beautiful. Same goes for the designs, the areas are all extremely well made. Most of them are surreal and unique, and even the plain ones still feel really good. It had a good storyline, I was not expecting the ending at all. Seeing that the ghost was the empress and the empress was qora were both suprising. The soundtrack was pretty good. The music really went well with each location. When it was a dark situation, there was silent eerie soundtrack. When you were in a beautiful area, there was calm or upbeat music. I think you get what I mean.\nIt has a good athmosphere, there are some very creepy scenes, especially the scene with the hidden bunker. It also has two endings, and multiple ends are always nice! It does leave some questions in your head though. What are the white masked guys? Aliens? Did the deities give anyone else gifts when they moved in, and did they have to go through all that too?\n\nNow, I don't recommend it for everyone. There isn't really much to do in it. There is a lot of exploration, but no puzzles, action sequences or deaths in this case. It's linear, and most of the time you are just heading right. There are some scenes where you have to wake up beasts, break rocks or do a little platforming, but most of the time it's just a game about exploring scenery. If you don't like games like that, then you should probably not buy this. Other than that, it's a pretty great game.\n\nAlso, love the credits theme. The quotes people wrote are pretty silly, you guys all make me laugh :3\n\nSorry for the short review, but like I said, there isn't much to say about qora other than the things I have mentioned.\n\nHere's my playlist!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbBjoGTz_G4qjS6Ak3MpjHUBucF62J7mI","December 31, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Traveler, the Empress, the Villagers, the Deities, and more.

Maybe not an epic one, but a journey none the less in a stranger and stranger land. I think that works because of the pacing, the mundane, a certain sense of wonder and the quantity of content. I mean when I first thought 'I sure travelled a long way' I was maybe half way through the game.\n\nSadly, it feels the creator was not very confident in the 'contemplative initiatic quest' quality of his game and decided to spice it up with a humorous tone that feels out of place. Worse, the grand finale is a meta humor fest that feels like a kick in the nuts. A bit as if the 'proper' ending of Silent Hill 2 was the dog ending...\n\nI am all for humor and meta, but not when they feel like the creator used them as escape plan.

Do not get this game if you are out for a game with any deep mechanics. Then what about the audience that enjoys games like the Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide? As someone who can accept a sacrifice in mechanical complexity for a casual but engaging world and story, to me Qora was an enjoyable experience. The aesthetic and chiptune music fit my tastes but if they don't fit yours then this game is probably not the game for you.\n\nQora started off actually pretty boring until about 5-10 minutes in (this is a short game, max 1-2 hours for 1 playthrough)  when the happenings within the game actually started to become interesting. The bulk of the game has you exploring extremely varied and nicely put together locations as you try to piece together the past of the land. Depending on your actions there are actually multiple endings for some replaybility.\n\nOverall I can safely say that I did infact enjoy my time with Qora but for the usual asking price of 10 USD I cannot recommend it. On sale however, if you are the person who doesn't mind casual failure state free experiences which are essentially more movie than game, then yes this game is worth checking out.\n\nLastly it has cards and very easy to obtain achievements :P","December 23, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
