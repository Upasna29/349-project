"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrkhal/recommended/306670/","Arrkhal","♥Countess Heartcall™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrkhal/","967 products in account","Imagine everything that was fun about the original Overlord games. Puzzles, combat, crazy ♥♥♥♥, humor, watching your minions do tons of crap. This game has none of that.\n\nImagine everything that's fun about top-down real-time hack and slash RPGs, like Diablo and Torchlight. Varied character classes, build variety, metric buttloads of loot, tons of different enemies with different attacks and resistances. This game has none of that.\n\nImagine everything that's fun about button-mashing combat games, like Devil May Cry. Crazy build possibilities, insane combos, really varied enemies that have to be fought different ways. Guess what, this game has none of that.\n\nInstead, it's a combination of the above three, with absolutely everything fun taken out.\n\nThere's 4 player classes, which are barely different at all. 2 melee, 2 ranged. Each one has a fixed progression and a token number of weapons that either give you more minion cubes, or have a chance of minor elemental damage. Basically cosmetic differences, other than the minion ones.\n\nYou get 3 attacks, a special attack, a chargeable heavy attack, and a light attack. And you're basically doing all the fighting, since your minions, especially reds and greens, basically do jack ♥♥♥♥. Even worse, despite the dumbed-down button mashing gameplay, there's absolutely no combo system at all. In fact, it has the opposite of a combo system. The special attack and heavy attack both ragdoll enemies, making them glitch out, bounce around, and twitch, and more importantly, making them immune to further attacks until they get back up. So you can either hold and release B about every 4 seconds (hurts your thumb less), or just mash A (kills most enemies faster). There's absolutely no point in using both attacks.\n\nSpeaking of ragdolls, the last time I saw ragdolls this glitchy was in Colonial Marines. Except Overlord: FoE is actually worse. Every single ragdoll twitches like it's having a seizure and glitches through terrain, every single time. The AI is worse, too. It's essentially the norm for minions to endlessly run away from you, teleport back, and run away again,  trying to smash some scenery. The greens and reds are essentially completely useless. They almost never attack unless you specifically order them to attack an enemy. If you just press X to summon everyone, they go running in a straight line, nowhere near any enemies, then commit suicide without doing any damage.\n\nThe minions aren't even fun to watch or listen to anymore. The animation is utter crap, even in cut scenes. Each minion has about 5 lines, and that's it. "I'm here! Sheepies! I like evil! Fight!" You now know everything the browns will ever say. There's no more looting or other interacting with buildings or terrain. All they do is smash stuff into generic looking rubble (while glitching and teleporting constantly, because their AI can't handle navigating anything, even a wide open square room), and grab stupid treasures that the "treasure goblin" apparently delivers after every encounter.\n\nAnd the enemies? Elf with sword, big elf with big sword, big elf with sword and shield. A couple bosses, and some flavor enemies that are basically identical to one of the elves (i.e., the big slugs are identical to the big elf with big sword, and the fluffies are identical to the regular elves except weaker). That's all there is. Even the bosses are completely lacking in personality or gameplay interest. They're just a variant on one of the standard enemies, with more HP and maybe a special attack or 2.\n\nOverall, a huge letdown. This game really DOES deserve all the negative reviews. It's neither a worthy successor to the Overlord series, nor is it even a decent game in its own right. It's just plain simplistic, repetitive, boring, and not fun. At least it wasn't priced like an A-lister. $19 isn't bad, but it should be more like $5.","October 22, 2015","false","3.7"," 460 of 491 people (94%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","94","460","491","45","11"

Most certainly, it would be an entertaining quest to dig through the mud and find one or two that list something truly good about this game. There are a few things noteworthy that you have to consider before going through this :\n1) This is not going to be an usual "hurr durr, its not Overlord III, it therefore sucks" Review. This game IS NOT A SEQUEL to Overlord II, and therefore shouldn't be looked upon as one. IT'S A SPINOFF, and I'm gonna judge it as such.\n2) You will find out that most of the guys writing reviews for this game have hardly played two hours. I played THROUGH the entire game. That I ended up with hardly 10 hours nonetheless is a shame, but i will get to that later.\n3) I really liked the first two games of the franchise, and was really looking foreward to this game. I really hoped it would be good, and even during playing it, I was really trying to see the good stuff.\n\n4) To the guys that only came here to read about 10 lines, I'm gonna spare you this whole essay and come right out and say it : DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Not full price, not on discount, not even for -90%. When a friend gifts you this, you should ask yourself if he really is your friend, and/or what he is trying to tell you (JK on that part, he probably wants you to join in, so you can suffer together ;). Even if you are a diehard fan of the franchise, and REALLY want to know how the story continues, watch a Let's Play, im sure there are gonna be a few out there.\n\nWith that outta the way, let's get started, shall we ? (oof..)\n\nI decided to go with the good stuff first, because it deserves a fair chance.\nThe game has kept it's humor, the minions are funny little compagnions, always hungry for mayhem, carnage and anarchy. The actor of Gnarl is back, and does a fantastic job. The voice acting is on point, jokes actually make you laugh (from time to time, depends on your humor I guess). The game is witty, humorous and doesnt take itself too serious, just like what we are used to from previous titels of the franchise. They do a good job getting you (kind of) immersed into the story, which is, sadly, nothing new. Not going to spoil anything, but its the usual "bring evil back onto the stage and slaughter all the good guys" deal. Entertaining to some extend, and at least conclusive.\nThe four different heros really provide different playstyles, and are suited for various situations, which makes mixing them up viable.\n\nThis is sadly where the good stuff ends. Usually you will find the Review becoming some guy ♥♥♥♥♥ing about his wasted money now, I'm gonna try to keep that to a minimum. To make it REALLY short : its a bad game concept, really badly put into action. Halfway through the game I felt like someone actually went through all previous Overlord titels and noted down what was good, to make exactly that terrible. Let's get into the detail :\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is obviously the combat. Let's be honest here, the combat system in the franchise never really was a gem, but it worked out, because your minions did most of the work anyways. In Overlord II you had to deploy different combat styles, and even tactics to some extend, to get through the game. The Fellowship of Evil changes this completely : combat = button A. That's the formula the game is based on. Sure, fighting on your own wasnt much different from button-mashing in previous titels as well, but since you are nearly ALWAYS fighting on your own in this game, it gets painfully noticeable. There is no diversity in combat, and dont get me wrong here, I mean NONE. AT ALL. The first enemy gets killed the exact same way as the last. You just hold or press A untill whatever you want to die dies. Some enemys are just "bulletsponges", that take way more hits, but they add no diversity. Bossfights run on the same sheme every time. Sure, its not as dissapointing as the final boss being a quicktime-event, but even the "best fighter for the damned Goodness" battles out the same way some low-end semi-boss from the first chapter did, really ?\nMost people will describe the combat as repetitive, it is not. It's anesthetic.\n\nThe next big deal are the minions. These little buggers were always a selling point for the previous games, they made a huge part of the overall fun. Someone decided thay have to go a new way with them. A disastrous decision, I may add.\nIn previous titels you felt a bit like a general, commandig your devoted minions into battle, or setting them up with wait-point to use their unique abilities for maximum carnage. You deployed tactics, cunning, and yes, mostly, brute force to smite your enemies. Your fingerpoint sealed fate, and you truly felt like the mighty Overlord, COMMANDING the forces of pure evil. Guess what, they ruined it. There are no more minion controls. None. Minions are completely controlled by AI. An AI so outstanding, it could a bad example for every other AI. Minions only move in an assigned area around you, making their own decision on which enemy to attack, or which object to destroy. For this, they even overcome basic logic itself. The object they desire to destroy is unreachable ? These minions wont let something as minor as impossibility stop them ! They just keep on running at the map-border or bashing at a floating bottle they can never reach. If you move too far from your minions, they get teleported back to you. Dont let this decieve you, they will just keep running back to whatever they were bashing before. This adds up to some funny occasions, when they constantly run at a table or chair and get ported back to you, just like they are badly lagging. I can really appreciate that kind of humor, it makes you laugh when you should rather cry....\nNot only they way YOU handly your minions got idiotised, but the minions themselves as well. Can you recall their abilities from Overlord II ? Greens, as assassins, mighty backstab, extremely powerfull when placed cunningly ? And Reds, giving you the ability to fight enemies from afar ? The kind of minions that promoted tactics, provided diversity ? Well, they are gone as well. Reds are now suicide bombers, Greens strike once and dissapear right after. Sure you could upgrade your Greens, to stay a bit longer in combat. "How?" do i hear you ask ? Through combat experience ? No, that would be way too good, wouldn't it ? You spend some currency on them, to make them somewhat less useless. Oh, and did i mention that all minions die after a set time ? Besides the fact that they nearly borderline no damage at all, this is Your options for combat summed up : hold A till it dies. Done.\n\nPlayer Progression....ah well. (usually i would go on about you you just grind our currency to get useless upgrades, or the bugs in this game, or the performance issues, or how pathetically short it is, but Steam says I ran out of space, so im gonna end it here >:[. It's buggy, its bad, dont buy it. DIdi i mention they hint a sequel in the end ? Sounds great, doesn't it? )\n\nI hope this was a bit more detailed, therefore more helpfull that the usual "its not what i wanted to i hate it" Review.\nHave a nice day lads, and DO NOT BUY this game.","October 24, 2015","false","11.4"," 339 of 363 people (93%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","93","339","363","49","3"

It shouldn't have been released yet.\nWhich is a shame, the Overlord games are fantastic. Go buy those instead.\nThis game is also nothing like Castle Crashers or Baulder's Gate: Dark Alliance despite resembling it at first glance.\n\nCons (Because this list is longer, it gets to go first.):\n\n-Lots of effects are really bad looking, or feel like they're not working right.\n-The movement feels clunky and slow to react, and attacks are slow to fire, triggering on mouse press, AND release.\n-The parts of the game that reference past games feel slapped on, and do more damage than good for the game, because they're only references. They serve no purpose.\n-The voice acting is horrid at times, this excludes Gnarl, who is and will always be played well.\n-While the game makes use of visuals from past titles, many are out of place lore-wise, such as abyss plants or relics being... not in the abyss.\n-Hakon is completely unsatisfying to play, and feels broken and nonfunctional.\n-Malady's right-click attack is a one shot kill to many enemies. And it pierces. Oh boy, let me just point and win.\n-Instakill spikes as hazards exist.\n-Menus are unresponsive at the best of times.\n-The camera is absolutely awful. You can't move it, it has to encompass all players.\n-The players are stuck together because of the camera. Players are force teleported seemingly at random if you wander too far.\n-Linear, uninteresting upgrades.\n-Minion control is literally nonexistant and world/enemy based.\n-No text chat.\n-Pop up signs that announce to your already aware self the it's time to fight, or run, or pick up loot. Picking up loot should not be a chore.\n\nThe Pros:\n\n-Gnarl\n-The characters and world look really good.\n-Animations look fluid excluding the fact that you slide to turn.\n-Music and atmosphere is good.\n-Still has moments of originality.\n\nAll in all, sweet unholy hell art team, fantastic job, the game looks great.\nPlease patch some of the wonky controls and minion and enemy related bugs.\nThis is currently not worth the money. The game is just not good as a game.\n\n","October 20, 2015","false","20.2"," 95 of 104 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","95","104","0","0"

Minions are basicly window dressing in the game, as you can hardly summon enough to do much damage to your enemies. 95% of the fighting is on you. The second major drawback is the inflexible camera. It is set  to just one direction, so you very well can find yourself running blind down an alley, as opposed to seeing where you are going.\n\nI thought the player was supposed to be an Overlord, just like the previous games. Considering the small amount of minions you get to summon, the player is more of a Corporal than an Overlord.\n\nSadly an epic fail on the part of Codemasters.

I had so much excitement when this game was released, That disappeared within a few hours of Gameplay. I spent around five hours on the game and  I am somewhat pleased and disappointed at the same time. The story was good as ever, but it felt weaker than the previous games. I loved the nods to the other games and the references to culture, but overall it doesn't save the game.\nIf I had to sum up what the game feels like, here is an example. It is like playing Sim City starting with such high hopes for your playthrough. An hour later and you are crawling into debt and you just want to keep playing to finish what you started. That is what the  game feels like to me.\nI loved this series for the story and the dark humor, yes that was there, but it wasn't incredibly good. While I would love to say it is a good purchase, it is not, unless you are an absolute die hard fan. I only keep playing because I love the story. Otherwise if I didn't love the story, I would have demanded a refund, and have the same opinion of this game as I would Fish Tycoon.\nThe main problems for me was the over buggy nature of the game. At times it was completely hilarious and reminded me of Team Fortress 2, but that isn't always the case with the bugs. And the problems with the menus, I had spent so much on upgrades I didn't want to buy because it was so buggy. Do I feel it was worth 18.99? No, I feel it is worth less than $10.\nMy reconmendation for the company is take a look at Darkspore. Darkspore is a spin off of the game, Spore. Overall it was pretty fun and in some cases better than the original, you had so much customization with bases. And it took nearly the same exact aspects that this game is trying to achieve. But this is only merely trying.\nTl;Dr\nGame is only fun if die hard fan\nDevs should do stuff to try to make the game more compatible and less irritating\nIf you loved the previous games for anything but the story, or even like the genre this game is attempting, I reconmend to not buy it.\nAnd if you want to really see some shinning examples of this series play the other games.","October 22, 2015","false","6.4"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","54","63","4","0"

And as an overlord game it was extremely disappointing.  Every other overlord game has been based around using your minions therefore making your minions quite important.  In overlord fellowship of evil, I played almost the entire game without using a single minion.  The only need for the minions were to press certain pads and to attack the bosses, who were quite easy.  To defeat the bosses you only needed to run around and not be hit by their attacks and be ready to send your minions in when their shield was down.\nIn the other overlord games the minions themselves had their own personalities though their hats and the cut scenes, which caused you to be more attached to the game.  I personally liked overlord 2 were each minion had a name, could aquire special hats for certain eneimies being defeated, and could be brought back to life.\nThe weapons were quite limited, meaning, there was nothing to increase a weapons ablitiy, no upgrades after initially being able to obtain weapons, and the abilities of the weapons themselves were very weak.  I was surprised to see a lack of armor to buy or upgrade.  Again every other overlord games involes armor and the option of getting better armor through out the game.\nThe game, overlord: fellowship of evil, I believe to be a compete failure, but all is not lost.  Because the other overlord games were well liked can easily bounce back.  Some ideas that might help for the next overlord game to be more accepted.  1) in the first overlord game there were lots of collectables and having to figure out how to get them.  2)the minions should be your life blood, meaning you absolutely need the minions to do everything from collect items, fight for you, stand on pressure pads, heal you, destroy breakable items.  You as the overlord need to direct them where to go.  3)your tower or fortress of evil should be able to expand and upgrade as you proceed through the game opening up new rooms or giving you new abilites.  4)you need a treasure room to show off all your items you have collected.  5)i believe you should make the game open  world.","November 3, 2015","false","8.5"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","56","67","0","0"

Even for being a spin off, it just feels lazy compared to the other Overlord games. A developer with no real name in the industry or fanbase yet could get away with releasing this, and if that were the case it might actually have been enjoyable, but I, as well as many other people I'm sure, expected far better from Codemasters. This game is content baren, the maps are poorly planned out, and half the time you don't even end up using your minions because if you do, they'll just die instantly in one of the death traps that are *everywhere* (thanks to the aforementioned poorly planned out maps). Someone please tell me, what is the point of an Overlord game where you barely use your minions? I mean I know the protagonist isn't actually an Overlord themself, but still!\n\nWith all of that said, I should add that the same brand of humour, and a similar enough atmosphere to the other Overlord games is definitely there, but how bad the rest of the game is takes away from that. And it's a shame too, because if they'd put a bit more effort into refining the rest of the product, namely the combat system (the minions need to be more useful darn it) and map layouts, this game could be quite a lot of fun.\n\n-sigh- Nevertheless I am not going to ask for a refund, because I get the feeling that this was, at least in part, an attempt by Codemasters to make some money, hopefully so they can get the backing to fund a new project, but I am doing so under protest. I've been looking forward to a new Overlord game for years, and you give me.. this. I'm not disappointed because it's something different, I'm disappointed because it's just bad.","October 20, 2015","false","5.1"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","50","61","0","1"

I beat the game, it is rather short and has a cliffhanger ending.

They have reduced the minions to be some minor sidekicks and "focused" on ARPG combat for this game. Well focused might be the wrong word as the combat system essentialy contains 2 attacks and a special attack which needs some time to recharge. I mean if that was the intention they should have published the game on a mobile platform as this kind of combat system gets pretty boring on pc after a few hours. The so called puzzles are no challenge at all and the "races" are simply passages where you have to straight run to a goal while dodging some stuff. The Character progression is also pretty boring as it was designed without any option and the given path is super lame.\n\nCharacter Progression:\nGimmick\nHealth adn Damage increase\nGimmick\nHealth adn Damage increase\nGimmick\nHealth adn Damage increase\nGimmick\nHealth adn Damage increase\nGimmick\n\nThese Gimmicks are changes to yoru spells which are not that impactfully and that way the progression is not satisfying at all.\n\nPros:\n\n- Overlord setting\n- Typical Humor as in Overlord 1 & 2\n- Coop - Multiplayer\n\nCons:\n\n- Flat Combat System\n- Minions are a just Fire and forget feature without any depth\n- Puzzles are way to easy\n- Race challanges are boring and not challanging\n- The Whole game feels like a Console Port as the controls and Camera are not good at all\n\nTL;DR:\n\nDon't buy this game if you expect a Overlord 3.

This one, though...  What were the developers thinking?  They took all that was good and great about this series and tossed them out.  What is left is basically a sad attempt at a MOBA.  Not to mention this game is still buggy.  The game likes to get you to walk into an area and then shuts a door or gate behind you.  Most of the time that works.  Some of the times you are trapped behind the gate and unable to walk through it unless you return to the HUB (the lair in the older games).  Doing this FORCES you to play through the ENTIRE AREA AGAIN where you still have that chance of getting stuck behind the door/gate.  There are also some really stupid "time trials".  This is where the game makes you walk through a heavily trapped area picking up crystals to increase your time while taking damage, losing minions so you can make it to a finish line.  You can opt out of those "time trials" but you still have to walk through those heavily trapped areas, taking damage and losing minions.  Minions now can only be summoned when you get "cubes".  There are sparse "Cube Shrines" where you can spend minutes slashing and hacking into them to get the cubes.  But, when you are out, you are out until you luck out and kill a random enemy and get a cube.  You will never have the large happy hoardes of minions like in the previous games.  Some of the enemies are scaled up in difficulty and they come at you in small waves.  Considering how hard they are the lack of minions within the game is really a head scratcher.  I understand they want this to be multi-player but what made the Overlord games great was they were SINGLE PLAYER.  Now, onto the HUB.  In the HUB you have a statue you can upgrade so your character gets stronger.  After a couple of upgrades the statue appears no different.  Throughout the game, getting stronger and progressing the HUB basically remains the same.  Why did the developers do this?  In the previous games you could upgrade your lair and it gave you a sense of progression.  The HUB is just....the HUB...nothing special...it looks the same and doesn't change.  Enemies...  The series used to have different areas where there were different enemies.  Now...  In this game...  They are all pretty much the same.  Look, bottom line...  The developers took a great series and castrated it.  If you are new to this series feel free to get this game.  You might even enjoy it.  But if you ever played and enjoyed any of the older games...DO NOT GET THIS GAME.","November 6, 2015","false","6.8"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

On my first attempt the switch was not there and I had to leave and rejoin the level, forcing me to play the tutorial from the bginning.\n\nNo way to control minions, this was a staple of the previous titles and this is taken away for no reason. Its especially frustrating when there are so many traps that instantly kill minions around levels and your minions happily run into them.\n\nNo way to de-spawn minions once summoned, Even if you wanted to unsummon your minions while your run through a puzzle, you can't un-summon minions once summoned but this doesn't really matter that much beacuase...\n\nMinions are useless. Browns can Tank, Blues heal your hero, Reds explode on enemies (Not ranged anymore, why? Who knows.), and every time I summoned greens they randomly dissapeared within a few moments. I'm not sure if this was a technical issue, or by design. Since reds are basically useless since they explode as soon as they see an enemy, and greens seem to unspawn moments after being summoned I used only browns and blues, and honestly you can just drop browns as they die far too quickly to be effective tanks.\n\nFinal Comments\nThis game is bad. This is basically a reskinned gauntlet with minions. Codemasters clearly ♥♥♥♥ out a title that had the overlord name in hopes of cashing in on the previous games popularity.

Minions will stop attacking, randomly die, sometimes not spawn with the [shift+#] and runoff in any other direction than the one you're going. Bosses become impossible due to this. Bosses will sometimes just not fight you. Attacking doesn't feel good.  There have been times where the hitboxes fail and i cant hit anything, even right in front of me.\n\nThe fight sections also feel awful. They're drawn out and when this is combined with tons of enemies with little hitboxes, minions not fighting or randomly dieing, it makes these sections worse. Switches will sometimes fail to activate or constantly activate. Most of the time, I just run through obstacles to get them over with. It is not fun.\n\nWhen the game DID work, however, it was an enjoyable experience and it was fun to hit things. Unfortunately, this was a somewhat rare occurrence.\n\nIt hasn't crashed and the music is really good, the netherghul's designs were nice, ricket is a good addition to the game and some of the dialogue was hilarious. I have had a fun time with trying to climb the invisible walls set around and have even been able to get out of bounds and completely avoid fights. I gather joy from trying to get out of bounds and often games that are somewhat buggy are good to me, but more often than not, the bugs were bad.\n\nI really wish they had spent more time fixing the bugs and telling us more on the characters in game as this caused a disconnect in scenes. There was a whle slew of problems, a lot I didn't cover in here. If the various bugs were fixed, I would happily recommend this game to people but as stated, this game isn't all that swell of a time at this point. I really hope Codemasters gets some kind of patch or update that addresses these and many other problems so the game can be an enjoyable one.","November 8, 2015","false","55.2"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","1"

I really did, on two different occasions.\nI'm not a huge Overlord/Overlord 2 fan, but I do enjoy those titles just due to the uniqueness of the genres they are associated with.\n\nWhen I first saw this game in the shop. I was so psyched to finally play a new Overlord game, after looking at the screenshots and trailer videos. I was a little confused, however.\n\nIt looked more like a Diablo/Dungeon Siege-esque game where you controll an army of minions. I didn't mind it much though, as I figured it might be a nice way for the franchise to branch out into different genres, it's good to experiment.\nBut it wasn't executed well at all. My first try lasted about 15 minutes. The graphics were sub-par to the previous installments, and the gameplay was gastly. It just felt so clunky.\nI picked the caster class. As I've always loved spellcasters in fantasy games. But even if I had my cursor ontop of the enemy, my main ability still missed half the time. It was really frustrating that everytime I decided to attack an enemy, it was a gamble, since everytime you attack, your character freezes for about a second, leaving you open for attacks.\n\nThe controlls were my biggest issue with this game though, As I honestly had no idea how to do what most of the time. I always had to go back into the options menu to figure out how to get things done. And the fact that I couldn't find how to "unsummon" minions was a drag for me.\n\nI haven't played this game for long, about 40 minutes. So you should really read through other reviews of people who managed to bear through this game for at least a few hours. Unfortunately, I couldn't. I couldn't really stick with this title for more than 20 minutes at a time, because I can't have fun playing this. It's just not possible for me.\n\nI would advice everyone to not purchase this game, it's just not worth it, even if it's re-released for free. It's just... Not worth the space it takes up in your Steam library.\n\nI'm not really used to writing reviews, but I honestly hope someone out there found this helpful.","April 20","false","0.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaads/recommended/306670/","Kaads","Jim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaads/","668 products in account","This one is a deep deep discount game. It plays kind of like a janky greenlight game with good enviromental art.\n\nPositives:\nMinions loot things. And they they occasionally say, 'For youuuuu' as they run back to give you your loot.\nArt of the caves generally very good. The golden is very well done as well.\nMinions smash things like small picket fences automatically.\nPuzzles are not really puzzles, since this a combat game. But the puzzles and races do a good job of breaking up the tedious combat.\n\nNegatives:\nCombat:\nWaves of enemies that teleport in from nowhere.\n\nPlayed Malady first. Very boring. Basic strategy was use charged heavy attack over and over again. No reason to play an entire game holding and releasing the heavy attack button until the waves of enemies are dead.\nThe amazing decision of players not being able to hold down the quick attack button to shoot continuously. You have to press it every single time.\nTeleport has no visible cooldown, you just have to guess. There is a noticeable cooldown as well, probably to prevent a huge speed advantage in the race sections vs warriors.\n\nTried Fire warrior. Looked lukewarm in the lobby. Lethargic sword swings with weak visual effects and animations (except for their ultimate).\nIn general, enemies, minions and you don't look like you are fighting. More like you are brushing up against each other and one person falls down when their hp runs out.\n\nWords to summarise combat: Floaty, Weak, Slow, Repetitive\n\nMinions:\nThere is no way to track how many minions you have, or what the maximum amount of summoned minions is. You can only see how many minions in reserve you have.\n\nMinions are very stupid. Especially around the 'golden', an instant death field. Minion AI do not perceive the golden and will walk right into it at the drop of a hat.\nAlso, since enemies are not effected by the golden, minions will try to attack enemies in there and die immediately.\nThis is an issue, since you can't easily restore your minions.\n\nMinions need colour coordinated 'power cubes' to summon. This makes no sense. It makes you slow down and waste time, since the primary method of acquiring cubes is to attack a cube fountain. Which usually spits out random colour cubes, so you hit it and hit it until the correct colours have come out, then you run around collecting the cubes. A better method would have players attack it once and it fills up all the colours it can distribute. Then put some in combat limiter on it if the fountain exists in a combat area.\nThe only boon to the cube system is enemies can drop them, bolstering your supply mid combat. But maybe a different system of restoring minion charges over time if they are under a specific quantity might have worked better. You could have even added more upgrades around maintaining a minimum supply of minions.\n\nRed minions are suicide bombers, so they are less desirable to upgrade as they only work once. Also, you have to aim them, since apparently they do not have eyes. They damage explosion is weak looking and weak in terms of damage.\nGreen minions are the same, except single target.\nThis leaves the bread and butter of all fantasy combat. The brown minions who are the tanks and blue minions who are the healers (you are the damage of the holy trinity).\nRed minions should at least attack normally, and then explode when they die. They should probably attract enemies to attack them as well, since they are so brightly coloured.\nI don't know what role greens have. There is an upgrade to make them stick around after one attack, but I already have brown minions who do that without upgrading.\n\nUpgrades are very bare bones:\nThere are 10 minion upgrade levels per colour. However only 2 or 3 stray from + 1 minion cube or increased damage/healing.\nI guess at least there are multiple colour minions you get to choose to spend points on, so your character will have a different balance of minion strengths.\nIt is a small relief that you can switch between the different minion hives by only visiting one. Both sets of hives are sort of out of the way.\n\nThere are many (8?) hero upgrades. But they are all minor. And every second level is the ever boring "more health and damage" upgrade.\nSince there isn't any point in splitting your resources between heros, because you can only play one at a time, you should not have to spend resources to upgrade. There is game mechanic called an xp bar. And when you pick up crystals, it can fill that bar and you can level up automatically.\nXP would be superior to you running to an out of the way shrine in the lobby area to spend crystals on a linear underwhelming upgrades track and then finding out you don't have enough crystals when you get to the shrine.\n\nWeapons upgrades are more interesting, since they all appear to be sidegrades. Everything except one or two costs 50 [weapon currency].\nThere is an issue of choice though. There are 10 or so different weapons with apparently equal power. Do you get the one that sets people on fire or the one that poisons? Who knows? Is there any point? Both will do damage right?\n\nLobby:\nThe lobby is basically a menu system. So why wasn't it a menu system?\nYou can't sit in any of the seats, customise the look of the lair (that I have seen) or interact with anything other than popping up menus.\nAs an example. The game Warframe has your personal spaceship act as a menu system, but each 'menu' is only a few steps away. You can go from the pilot seat to the loadout console in 3 seconds. And EVEN THEN, you can use the main menu to teleport from console to console.\n\nBugs:\nMinions get stuck behind fight doors after you enter. You have to move away from the door to teleport them to you.\nEnemies get stuck outside the fight door (only happened once, possibly a goldened minion?). You can still kill them though, just hard to find them.\nMinor bugs such as enemies floating up into the sky beyond the camera. With minions following them up to attack. Quite funny.\nAfter playing single player, the continue option does not appear on the main menu until you restart the game. Made me think I lost all progress.\nAfter loading my save, picked a different character. Story progress carried over between characters but there are no statues to upgrade my new character from.\n","October 20, 2015","false","1.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Unfrotunately I actually did crap my pants when I started playing it.\nThey did't take a single good aspect from the first overlord games, The story, controlls, combat & minions have all been nerfed and dumbed down. Seriously, if you love Overlord, don't play this. You can oonly have I think it is 12 minions out and that assumes you can ever collect enough of them (which you cant).\n\nThe controls are basic and bad, can't even scrollwheel select minions, a controller is definitely better for this than a Kb/M\nMost of the systems in the game are either broken or they just didn't care enough to finish them, like some enemies going into defensive mode and basically becoming invincible whilst still attacking.\nThe only good thing I can say is that the graphics are not too shabby, although included in the list of broken stuff.\n\nIt takes at least 2 playthroughs to get all power ups and probably more for minion powerups.\n\nPS - I recommend using a trainer to keep infinite minions or else they are basically useless aside from using blues to heal.","November 11, 2015","false","7.9"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

I am however a big ARPG fan.  This games is missing alot for it to be a true ARPG.\n\nFirst there is no real "looting"  you get stuff that says "LOOT" when you pick it up but it is more along the lines of currency rather than true loot.  There is no real level system either, you gather Gems to gain access to more powers and more powerful minions.\n\nFinally for me at least, the game uses WASD control set which for I hate for ARPG's, I like the Diablo style of mouse movement especially since the WASD movement in this game is really clunky, you can't even use the mouse to turn the direction your facing or anything.  Needless to say I didn't enjoy the very short time I put into this game.","October 19, 2015","false","0.8"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","24","38","0","0"

This game however....its a complete disappointment.   The "multiplayer" concept is an interesting one, but it should in no way be as forced down our throats as it is in this one.  Unlike the first two there is no tower customization, the minions do not find armor and weapons and thus walk around hitting things with their fists, oh and the “control” you barely have over the minions is just frankly sad.  You are able to release them, then they pretty much do whatever they want, except the green and reds, which are one shot ponies.  The reds have become suicide bombers instead of being ranged attackers, and the greens disappear to do a pretty neat backstab move.  That being said, the green’s attack, if the target of their attack moves at all they miss and then stand there dancing, celebrating stabbing thin air in the back.  This of course brings me to the massive amount of unfortunate glitches that can be found throughout the game, from un killable enemies, to minions stuck in place, to random damage inflicted whilst standing still not in combat.  While these are all fixable, the main gameplay and control scheme is something which will probably not be able to be changed, leaving the game rather disappointing.  You find yourself thinking halfway through the second mission in the first act…..”huh well I’m bored now”  the plot and comedy completely fail to make up for this games major failings.  I wish to reiterate my main points here, at the end of my rant.  Glitches, no minion control, stupid hat customization for minions instead of being able to actually arm them with anything significant, no real customization of the overlord except picking out of 5 or so pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons.   OH and no way to increase your squad cap, a distinctly pathetic limit to the amount of minions you can summon.  No evil or good points, no control vs destruction, just a confusing set of resources that by the third act no longer matter.  I hope beyond hope to come back to this game in a couple months to see some of these complaints rectified, and the death of hope is a terrible thing…..","October 21, 2015","false","6.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

This game removes core mechanics of the overlord series, reduces texture quality and model detail for all characters and terrain, which seems unfinished, while adding the bare bones of an RPG system, with no meat on those bones.\n\nIn the levels, they are now linear, no metroidvania hidden unlocks as were present in previous overlord games.  Complete levels once and never look back.  Nothing more is to be had playing through a level again.  The enemies either appear out of thin air, or drop in from above, clip into each other as they land, and run straight toward you.  If multiplayer worked, then they would have multiple targets to choose from.  as the minions are thin papper that are easily torn apart, deal damage no larger than paper cuts, and die quickly.

They are also incredibly fragile, though the browns are 'somewhat' capable of surviving battle. The fact that the reds went from support fire role to living bomb role is a big letdown. The incredibly low amount of minions we can take with us, considering their frailty, is also a problem. I died in the second mission, because all my minions had been killed. and most of them were brown.\n\nI don't know if it's a dwarf-only problem, but the special attack is a pain to use, and the normal attack has too short a range, especially considering the character remains static(the amount of times one of my minions died because the enemy agroing him was JUST outside of my attack range).\n\nAdd to it that I can't remap the buttons, and since I have an AZERTY keyboard, I'm pretty much screwed, yes?\n\nAlso, clarifications are in order. The tutorial doesn't really explain anything, we're basically dropped into the game and have to figure everything out ourselves. It took me 5 minutes to understand I had to interact with the map in the portal room to teleport, it should have either been said by gnarl, or pointed out in some way. Then there's the problem of the keys floating above the enemy heads, what the hell are they supposed to mean? What am I supposed to do? yes, that 2 above the elf's head is very pretty, but WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO DAMMIT ?\n\nSo yes, as it is, this game is not enjoyable, at least not in my opinion. It feels unfinished, and really needs lots of patching. I won't call for a refund, because I hope to see an Overlord 3, but I am deeply disappointed.","October 20, 2015","false","0.9"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

The humor is there, the art makes me feel I'm in the Overlord universe but the gameplay isn't there for me. I recognize that the devs wanted to go a different route here, and perhaps me being a big fan of the previous Overlord games influences me. Core gameplay consists of your character hacking away at enemies while dodging obstacles. Looking at it, you'd think it's a Diablo-like game but without the powers or special abilities.\n\nIf you're playing co-op, death has just about no penalty at all. In the other Overlord games, your health was very limited and combat and puzzles required you to utilize your minions. Minion control in this one is non-existant. If the minions were removed from the game, I think it would minimally impact gameplay; that's how little they add to the game. Except the humor.

Fellowship of Evil is a top down hack and slash, similar to Diablo, but even that in manages to muck up.  You start with being able to only summon two of each minion; the reds and greens die after a single attack and the blues are only good for healing.  You can only get more minions from special spots that drop minion energy when you hit it.  All of this is pretty encumbersome on it's own, but it's only made worse by the clunky key strokes.  When in the middle of a fast paced hack and slash, trying to hit shift+3 to summon a minion is pretty difficult.\n\nI loved Overlord 1 & 2 because it was a less cutesy version of Pikmin and only game of that style you could get on the PC.

The play mechanics was completely reworked and it just felt odd and harder to play. you dont control your minions per say anymore they just go and do their thing and you cant park them so they will go towards their deaths all by them selves and really wind you up. your basically the main player and must do all the fighting with yoiur minions now having a very side role in the game.  The dark theme to the game is awefull as its hard to see where the routes are and you easily get lost or dont realise there is actually a path you can go down, and there are many dead useless ends.

I never played the other Overlord games, but this one looked promising, and co-op gameplay is always fun. However, sadly, this game brings nothing to the table. The first thing I noticed when I launched is that none of the stuff I did saved? Oh wait, I had to relaunch the game to get the saves to show up. What?\n\nOnce you get ingame, it gets worse. This game runs off the Unity engine. The Unity engine is an okay engine, and the game actually looks pretty decent for running on it. However, the gameplay is painfully boring. After the first 10 minutes, you've seen it all; Simple Puzzles, Mob, Race, Repeat. Every level is the same, and the combat is just as montonous. You have only 3 kinds of enemies as far as I can tell, and they are all cookie cutter and not fun to fight at all. The combat is just tedious, with 3 attacks (Light,Heavy, and Special) and a special Minion attack or something. You'll end up doing the same thing, spam light attack, use heavy, then use special. Rinse and repeat.\n\nWhat about the Minions, the main part of Overlord? Well, they are practically worthless in this game. Unless you need to complete a puzzle, there is no reason to be using any other minion other than the blue ones that heal you, and even then they die instantly before they can heal you. The other minions are supposed to help you in combat but they die before they become useful. You might as well just run around by yourself if you don't have blue minions, which kind of defeats the purpose of Overlord.\n\nEven though I have not played for that long, this game has not impressed me in the slightest. I feel like this game was an hour of my life I will never get back, and I feel bad for the friend who spent his money on buying 4 copies of this garbage. Overall, avoid this game entirely. There are far better things to spend your money on.","October 21, 2015","false","1.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

So I started on single player or "Local". Again got the same mission as the game didn't save(?) my progress. And then after getting to said second egg where the troll steals it whilst you kill elves I got stuck and could not move. So with that I stopped playing.

Buy the other three Overlord games. They are better, despite their age and poor controls.\n\nThis game attempts many things, none of which are done well. It tries to ba a hack'n'slash, but doesn't have anything other then mindless single button mashing. Each character has one skill. ONE. Not many. ONE. The progression is entirely linear with zero diversity that even the ♥♥♥♥♥est of hack'n'slashes have. The minions are ♥♥♥♥ compared to the games this pile of ♥♥♥♥ is based off. The browns do their jobs with suicidal abbadon, but you don't make them do it that way. In its predessors you sent them to their deaths. When they died, it was your fault. In this shithouse of a game, they will just rush straight to their deaths. The greens sort of do the backstab thing they did in the better Overlord games, but they were usually an ambush squad you set up and lead enemies into. In this shitbrick of a game, they back stab once and LEAVE. Yes, they just ♥♥♥♥ off after attacking one enemy. You have to unlock the ability to make them attack more then once. Not a joke, unlike this game. The blues heal, like they did in the better Overlord games. Well, they heal you. Not the other minons. Unlike how they did in the better games. They also don't attack, and die in one hit. Then there is the reds. God damnit all to Hell. The reds are now Jahidists. They just blow themselves up. They don't hurl fireballs and back up your other minions from a distance. They carry a bomb and kill themselves. It is completely pointless.\n\nThen there is the glitches. ♥♥♥♥ a duck. Infernas' body shifts upward about 1/10 of her height and drops down every two steps. The rag doll is ♥♥♥♥. I haven't seen it this bad since the PS2. Hit detection is questionable far more than it should be causing minions have a hard time destroying objects right in front of them. Speaking of minions and objects, the AI seems to care more about breaking ♥♥♥♥ then it does not entering the Golden and turning.\n\ntl;dr\nGame is a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥. DO. NOT. BUY.\nI'm not refunding it soley because I deserve to be punished for wasting my money on it, and owning this game is the perfect punishment.

They were loads better. Even the prequal made on the wii was loads better. I am grips with myself on wheather I will return the game or not because i want them to make a ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic came deserving of being a continuation of the franchise. I understood there was no Overloard. I understood it would be a different style of play. The story is there, so is the characters, and art/graphics. What isn't there is soley the Gameplay itself. I have a little over an hour played so far. I am waiting on my friends opinion before i make my final diciscion. What was expected and explained to be had in this game was severly lacking. They made it seem like you could still control minions, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING CANT. They did say you weren't an overlord so having less minions out I understand. Removing that reds can do ranged attacks, ♥♥♥♥ING WHY REMOVE WHAT DEFINED THEM. I am fine with the scuicide mechanic being added, but not ok with it being the only thing you can do with them. Having to slash away at an enemy for ♥♥♥♥ING MINUTES (WITH THE HEAVY ATTACK MIND YOU) to kill them is a ♥♥♥♥ in my face. Trolls took 13 minutes to kill... that is just a no. I see you can get better weopons/ make better weopons. I see uprading minions. For some reason i don't see either of them improving the game though. I understood this game was going to be different, i expected there to be some stuff i wouldn't like due to it. I did not expect shity gameplay. That is purely what this game is to me right now. The ♥♥♥♥ is covering the few good things i mentioned it had. Don't buy it at full price. Don't buy it at half price. Buy it at ♥♥♥♥ price.

Between a lack of precise control over your minions and the giant areas of minion killing/converting effects I found myself never using them in combat, reserving them for the desperate scramble for resources that scatter across the map after a fight. The game feels formulaic very fast, walk here to there, then gates close (sometimes killing minions or stopping some from following) and you fight, then you scurry for resources. In addition, there's some AI and physics oddities that make me think this wasn't very thoroughly playtested.\n\nI'll probably slog through the rest of this in the hopes that Rhianna Pratchett's writing will pull this out of the muck.

Taking suggestions from someone who commented on my former review, I reinstalled the game and tried to play again.  I had some negative stuff to say before.  First, this is not like our old Overlord games, and if you can get past that, it's alright.  Honestly, I'm still confused by a bit of the gameplay.  I don't know what rules it goes by.  I still have no idea how summoning works.  I still have no idea if I'm even able to summon X of one type minion and X of another type and leave the other two colors alone...  There are times I summon reds, and they immediately explode.  I miss the old days when they cast balls of fire.  I miss the old system of telling some minions to stand "right over there" and keep out of the way, casting fireballs while I lured an enemy close enough to be damaged, but my minions were safe.\nThat being said, I DO like the combat.  I like how we're given an option between 4 different characters, each with a differnet elemental bent and way of attacking.  I've been using Malady, and I like being able to attack at a distance.  Unlike the other games where combat was mostly about moving minions with a control stick (which I do still wish we could have the Option of doing) while you could only fight using a light or heavy attack, here You are more involved in combat.  I like that.  I like being able to charge an attack and hitting a line of enemies with MY power, blowing them all up.  I like that we have a special attack now that can do some major damage.  It is a bit more simple, but as an Overlord, I prefer to do most of the work myself, rather than looking intimidating while my minions do all the fighting.\nNow, my big hangup is how the game can be unclear on what to do at times.  My first major issue was in the tutorial where it introduced the red minions.  The game was telling me to summon minions.  So, I kept summoning minions.  The Golden kept closing in on me, killing me and making my minions little rabbit things that attacked me along with all the other enemies.  And Gnarl kept telling me to summon minions...and I did...and they kept turning immediately and atacking me...and I kept dying...  So, I finally gave up thinking that my red minions would burn down The Golden with their fire powers, and I began to FIGHT.  After killing all the enemies, the gate to the next area opened, and I survived the tutorial.  If a game means "kill all the enemies," it should say so, rather than telling me to keep summoning useless minions.\nThis game IS a little disappointing.  But at least the control for the main character is good.  At this point, I feel like the minions are just for show, and not for effect.  Maybe they wanted to make a new Overlord game and scrap the minions, but knew they couldn't do it, so they gave us a game where they were mostly useless.  The humor is still here, the atmosphere is still here, the standard premise of doing evil and upgrading yourself is still here.  If you expect old Overlord, play that instead.  This is different.  If you can get past all the negative reviews, and the oddity of even the positive reviews saying a lot of negative stuff, you'll find a decent game.","January 4","true","7.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

The TL;DR version?  If you're a fan of the Overlord world and story, buy it during a sale.  If you're like me and you really, really like Overlord and need your smashing sheepies fix, then maaaaaybe it's worth buying now.  YMMV.\n\nFirst, the good.  The story is funny, with Pratchett's humor put to good use.  The minions are entertaining, as always, and the dialogue is cheeky and fun.  The world designs (especially the Netherdeep hub) are quite neat.  The Netherghul designs are fantastic, and it's fun to be able to play a variety of characters.  It seems obvious that Codemasters put a lot of love into the game.  The minion upgrades you can purchase were also pretty useful and unique compared to the previous games.  The voice acting is fantastic, and I really liked the new characters as a whole.  It was pretty cool to see the remnants of the old Overlord's empire, too, such as statues of the minion wolf riders and Fay.  The animated cut scenes had a really interesting wood-cut kind of style, which was unique and kind of neat to see in a video game.\n\nGameplay wise, I liked the fact that you could "carry" minions in reserve and use them when you needed them, rather than have them trail along behind you, inevitably getting lost or stuck somewhere.  The minion hammer was really useful.  I loved the fact that my blues could heal me.  The gameplay mechanics with the Golden was also pretty interesting, and it was very satisfying to finally be able to burn it back.\n\nAnd now...unfortunately...on to the bad.  I really, really wanted to love this game whole-heartedly.  I love Diablo, and I absolutely love the Overlord universe.  It would have been really, really easy for this game to win me over.  The fact that it didn't really speaks to its flaws.\n\nFirst of all, it's very, very short.  I was hoping for something a bit meatier.  I was hoping for more backstory.  The ending was very ambiguous, and while they're obviously setting up for a sequel or DLC of some kind, I'm just not sure if that's going to happen based on all the bad reviews.\n\nThe game play feels, as others have mentioned, very "clunky".  You're not able to recall your minions, which leads to a lot of them running off and getting themselves killed, which is annoying.  You also can't sweep them or plant them on a marker.  Yes, I know, you're a Netherghul, not an Overlord, but story shouldn't get in the way of good gameplay.  The reds were suicidal, which yes, was the point, but also massively, massively stupid.  They seemed to have no targeted mechanic whatsoever.  I'd point them at an enemy, and I'd be a *few* degrees off, and they'd go sweeping past the enemy to blow themselves up against the wall.  Ranged units would have been much more helpful, to be honest.\n\nThe attacks and battles are quite frankly boring, and this is coming from someone who once lost fifteen pounds over a summer spent playing Diablo.  I was hoping for a spell tree that I could use to do different attacks, at the very least.  The battles last too long, the enemy attacks lack variety, and the whole time I spent fighting just felt like a grind.\n\nThe traps were irritating.  I had trouble controlling my character (Inferna) using a keyboard and mouse, and often found myself blundering into something I thought I'd gotten out of the way of.  The time trials were honestly just really annoying, and didn't serve much purpose.\n\nI would also have liked it if I'd been able to visit previously-conquered stages again to gather more loot.  The game was linear to a fault.  I'm terrible at maps, and often have trouble finding my way around complex stages, and even I found the linear nature of the game to be dull.\n\nI don't regret my purchase...I love the Overlord universe, and I love Rhianna Pratchett's writing.  That said, I feel like this game had so much potential, and could have been so much more.  Hopefully the next installment will be (if not a proper Overlord 3!) a bit better...and cheaper.","October 20, 2015","true","11.5"," 28 of 61 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","28","61","0","0"

If looking for the next overlord game, this is not the one.\n\nOne of the things that hit me is that the minion order for commands is not like the overlord games where 1 is brown, etc. here 3 is brown. Next to this it feels.. buggy and cheap.. (they used the models it looks from overlord 2 directly) my advice get it on a sale if you want a light snack and fan of overlord, else avoid.\n\nSecond part the combat feels, disconnected and disjointed with no real effect or impact on the enemy, stuff hits while being too far away or not, just keep hammering either light or heavy attack related to type of enemy and enemies will eventually fall down suddenly. The combat does seem to feel better using a controller instead of the mouse and keyboard.\n\nThird thing, controls can be unresponsive while an animation is still going, one can not move nor dodge, which can get you killed fast even tho you stopped fighting a while ago or hitting something.\n\nFourth, easy to get stuck behind miniature parts of terrain and hence getting hit by and enemy or trap especially on the parcour parts this can be bad.\n\nStory wise it is nice, humor is ok.","October 20, 2015","true","15.6"," 22 of 49 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","22","49","0","0"

And unfortunately for CodeMasters, I don't like MOBAs very much.\n\nHonestly, it's not a bad game. There's really nothing wrong with the gameplay as far as it goes, but it is a *MAJOR* shift from previous Overlord games.\n\nFor starters, it's in a mostly isometric view, similar to Diablo. Which would be fine, but *you can no longer control your minions directly*.\n\nMeaning no rally flags, no 'attack this guy', no 'sit here and ambush', nothing. They've also massively lowered your minion cap, and now they've also capped how much Life Force you can hold of each minion type! You start at 2 per color. Yes, 2.\n\nFurther, the Life energy management of previous games is barely a thing now, because you find fountains that spout Life Energy cubes (yes, they're cubes now) when you hit them,\n\nThe Overlord you start as is the fire one, Inferna. Yes, a female overlord. It makes no difference to the gameplay except for her voice, but they decided that the fire warrior would be female.\n\nAnd that brings me to something that grates on my nerves. I'm hoping that there isn't any more of it, but there have been a few feminist moments in this game thus far. Gnarl now has a female counterpart named Ricket (which makes no sense, given that minions don't breed, so they shouldn't have sexes). And Gnarl has a like where he says "Sorry, Ricket, I was totally Minionsplaining there, this is your show!"\n\nSeriously, guys? Overlord is SUPPOSED to be an anti-PC game. We kill baby seals, destroy orphanages, burn homes and people and eat children for breakfast. That's the sort of OOC behavior that irritates me, because it's completely wrong for Gnarl to be *apologizing* to anyone but the Overlord.\n\n\nSo, massive gameplay changes from previous iterations, and subversion of the basic anti-PC theme of Overlord. The dark humor is mostly still there, but I just don't really feel like *THE OVERLORD* the way I did in previous games. Hopefully it gets better.","October 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","0"

But this was never, ever, intended to be like Overlord 1 and Overlord 2. Codemasters and the team behind this decided to go with a top-down RPG co-op game and I say they did an admirable job with it.\n\nSo if Overlord games have always been more about the story and characters and the lore for you than about the actual gameplay, give it a go. If it is the other way around, then I say that you are better off waiting for a new Overlord game that follows the same gameplay style as the previous ones.\n\nAnd to those of you who say that this is the first time Codemasters does a thing like this for Overlord as a franchise, I suggest you look into things a bit more.

Here's my review for Overlord:FOE: But first;\n(Because so many people seem to be giving it a harsh time, I think a little defence is in order. I'm not sayimg it's better, I'm just saying it's not worth this much hate. Like minions DS, it IS a side-game. Give it a chance.)\n\nThough it is not the same style of Gameplay that we all know and love, I suggest you stick with it to the end; once you get over the fact that it is very different (and not all for the better, I admit), once you've gotten over the changes it proves to be a surprisingly good play.\n\nTHIS IS A SIDE GAME, PEOPLE! I'm sure Codemasters won't be making the Overlord games to all be like this. Have a little faith in your old Overlord! :)\n\nCodemasters told everyone that this was NOT part of the main Overlord series, simply an exploration into a more multiplayer- themed "spin-off". Now that fans have made it crystal-clear that prefer the original, I hope that the backlash for this game does not  deter Codemasters from creating their next Overlord Experience; As they have hinted on continuing the series. I do love this series...\n...So....\nPlease forgive this game its differences and give it another chance; It's well worth it. And if you still don't like it, then consider the purchase a donation for the development of the next overlord game.\n\nNow. On to a more personal review.\nThere were some things about this game that I personally enjoyed.\nThe story was fun, and I liked the multiple choice in characters (I was the ice prince Cryos of course <3 ); Though I did wish I could have customised them a bit. different armour, perhaps?... Don't mind that, a mere fancy of mine...\nThe gameplay was good in its own way; it was a bit of a shock at how different this game was, but it is to be expected as a Spin-off. Ater I got used to the changes, I actually found it quite enjoyable- I was certainly eager for more once I'd finished it. (ok, 18 hours done... wait, finished already? Aw man! I was just getting into that!) So many unanswered  questions, so many mysterys... What are they up to, I wonder?...\n\nI for one am hoping for a bit more on the Netherghuls (in a part 2 spin-off, not overlord 3, keep calm), as I have become quite fond of my little Cryos, and am cheering him on for that Overlord title and throne! :D\nI am sad for old Overlad though; his bloodline as the overlord ended so young. I wonder if he did have an heir? ...probably not, though, or they wouldn't have needed the ghuls... (I hope I'm not spoiling anything)\n\nThe control of the minions is not to my favour. The movement to direct the minions in a certain direction seems to do almost nothing, and I was dissapointed that I could not control them as I used to, but I suppose the Netherghul is only a "Candidate" for the Overlord title, so that may explain the minions lack of obedience.  I did notice a few bugs, but as others have already mentioned these I won't repeat them.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next overlord game, and will be happily playing through the vious Overlord games - again - while I wait. Now that I really can wait for a new release! Thank you Codemasters, for bringing back the black! er, I mean, the Overlord!\n\nThanks for reading, and please don't say anything mean. We're all people here. And they're working on the Overlord games again! Yay!!! (Cheering)","November 3, 2015","true","21.0"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

Not that it was a bad game on its own, but I expect a certain kind of game with the Overlord series, and this is not that game.\n\nFor those familiar with the series, this is much more overlord focused than the previous titles, which were more minion focused.  Most of the combat will be done by you, with the occasional spamming of the "spawn all" minions button to throw explosive reds and assassin greens at the enemy.  The only minions that stick around, at least in the beginning, are browns and blues.  Blues are worthless except that they heal you, but until they are upgraded, you have to stand still for them to do it.\n\nThe story here is a bit weaker than the past series, and while the story was never a huge portion of the games in the past, it is even worse here.\n\nI can recommend this as a game, since it is relatively complete, though from what I have played, seems a bit short, and plays well.  But if you are looking for a game like the past Overlord titles, look elsewhere.","October 22, 2015","true","3.5"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

Developers stated this many times.  You do not play an overlord.  You do play a netherghul though, which is like a exalted minion.\n\nAt the moment of writing this the game has some bugs that need to be worked out.  Too many to write down.  Some stupid, some game breaking.   Ill rewrite this if/when they patch it.  But I will review what I see in the game at the moment.\n\nThe game is fun to play.  It's meant as a couch co-op game.  I played for a good few hours with my friends and we had a great time.  The progression is a little quick as resources you get in the game are plentiful but what makes it more fun is that they are not shared amongst the group.  Its a competition between your mates to gather as many resources as you can.\n\nMinions in the game do have uses but not as much as previous overlord games.   Greens and Reds are one time use minions at first.  You will mainly use blues and browns quite often.  Browns to tank and blues to heal as you damage with the help of greens or reds depending on the enemy.\n\nIf you are a patient gamer, like the Overlord series, and have friends you enjoy playing with.  I recommend the game as of now.  FYI,  all bugs can be defeated by using Cyros's wall power to push your friends through walls :P lol (do hope thats fixed soon but it was fun breaking the game with it).\n\nIf you happen to be one of those gamers that aren't patient.  Get mad easy and doesn't play well with others competively or doesnt have others to play with.  This game may not be for you as of now.  Again I will rewrite this once its been patched.\n\nAll in all.  Its a $20 game and a mini Overlrod story.   Its worth checking out.","October 20, 2015","true","9.7"," 15 of 36 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","15","36","0","0"

They said they are working on the co-op save issue so they may fix this too.\n\n~ABOUT THIS GAME IS~\nGame type - Diablo/Gauntlet like (top down dungeon crawler)\n* Play as 1 of 4 characters in 20 single player levels or co-op.\n* Each hero has a base attack, a charge attack, and a power move that charges over time.\n* The right analog stick will make a shield for Cyros/Infirna,  dodge for Hakor, & teleport Malady.\n* When you continue you can change your hero.\n* The hero(s), 4 minions, & your weapon can all be leveled up via item drops. (heroes do not share upgrades)\n* You can buy then equip hats for your minions.\n* You can summon minions to run forward to attack/break things but ones that are already out can not.\n* The 4 minions are: browns for fighting, blues for healing, reds will blowup, and greens attack once.\n* There are about 11 different enemies outside bosses and are: fighters, rogues, wizards, knights, knights w/shield, slugs, big slugs, bugs, peasants, zombies, & your flufafied minions.\n\n~THE BAD STUFF~\n* there are a few bugs but nothing game breaking that i ran into.\n* Minions are not controlled and will do as they please and that's not a good thing.\n* "Golden" will turn your minions against you and they seem to love to run through it.\n* Red minions are a 1 time attack & greens need to be upgraded to attack more than once.\n\n~MY OPINION~\nThe game is bland, buggy, and mostly crap. I love it!  Yes, I understand most won't get the enjoyment i do from games like these but The story does have the charm of the other games but lacks their game play. The bugs are not game breaking (none that i have seen yet) so overall it is playable. The real charm here is seeing enemies fly off the screen when hit with specials, hovering when dead, or endlessly chant when killed, all are hilarious. I would have liked my minions to get stuff from crates but overall i enjoyed myself. the question is will you? maybe not.\n\np.s.it took me a little over 6 hours to beat it my 1st run & under 5 the 2nd (you can see my full 2nd run on my channel).\n\nIf you like this review check out my steam group\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Blinkdog","October 22, 2015","true","16.5"," 15 of 36 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","15","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeanh13/recommended/306670/","jeanh13","JeanH13","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeanh13/","88 products in account","First, this is not Overlord 3 or a Diablo-like game. This is a hack 'n slash, multiplayer game. The tech tree and item loot are minimal at best, but on par with a Gauntlet style game. If you like Gauntlet style games, I recommend waiting for a sale on Overlord: FOE. Both Forced and Gauntlet offer better 4-player co-op for the price point.\n\nI'd say this game most closely resembles Gauntlet: Dark Legacy. This game has the same humor as the previous Overlord games, BUT the minions take a big step back in regards to their utility. If your absolute favorite feature of Overlord was being a Minion Master, then you will not like the minions here.\n\nHowever, if your favorite part of the Overlord series was killing people/animals/elves/etc. with your Overlord and being followed by a parade of tiny, evil cheerleaders, then you should enjoy this. Think of the minions as the pet familiars from Gauntlet: Dark Legacy. They are somewhat useful, but don't bring a contribute very well to the game.\n\nAbout the minions: Minion spawners are more frequent than the single-player Overlord titles, to compensate for how expendable they are in Fellowship of Evil. Browns are the only minions I keep out around me, as they stay near you and attack like the previous Brown minions (deal and take damage for you). Blues can only heal you, they do not deal any damage. Greens are better melee damage-dealers against foes, but disappear from your Minion control after they have slain their target. Reds have been completely changed. They are no longer ranged fireball-casters; instead, they are suicidal bombers that run in a straight line towards whatever you were facing and self-destruct on impact.\n\nThe game took me roughly 7 hours to beat, in a 2-player co-op session. I doubt the number of players would change this completion time.\n\nYour Overlord has 4 attacks to play with: light attack (fast dps), heavy attack (slow strike with knockback), a charged heavy attack, and a special attack (strongest attack but tires your character for a few seconds and has a cooldown).\n\nThe focus is on your character, one of four Netherghuls, whom is trying to reinvigorate evil and the minion horde. Each Netherghul plays vastly different from each other in how their attacks work, but all feel very balanced and neither is OP in comparison to the others.\n\n\nFinal review (TL;DR) : This is a great couch co-op game to play with controllers (I use Xbox 360). If you only played the Overlord games to be an evil Pikmin Minion Master, then this is not a game for you. If you like multiplayer, hack 'n slash games in the style of Gauntlet, then you will enjoy this spin-off of the Overlord franchise.\n\nOverall, $20 isn't a bad price, but I would recommend waiting until it is closer to $12 - $15. Fun game, but Forced and Gauntlet offer a lot more value at the moment compared to Overlord: FOE.","October 20, 2015","true","8.6"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagandemerald/recommended/306670/","nagandemerald","NagandEmerald","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagandemerald/","38 products in account","Overlord: a franchise that would live in in fame for its interesting story, characters, humor, and gameplay. To others, they see only the gameplay, but I am here to tell you that to have a decent Overlord game, you don't just need gameplay. The essence of Overlord is the world of which is created from it. So, let's start off this review by saying that "this game isn't the game we were hoping for," but it's still a decent game. Let's look at the facts.\n\nThe world itself is still very much in the spirit of Overlord, as Rhianna and the team have been saying. It continues to have its dark humor and its mischevious fun, while still spinning an intricate and well-thought out story. The player characters: the Netherghuls, are a nice addition to the lore, and I think that, despite their weakness to the story itself, they are still a good piece of it. It is the tale of how four evil doers died and got resurrected by the Forces of Darkness, led by Gnarl and the nigh-extinct Minions. The idea of Good finally coming into play as a real threat to Gnarl, the Minions, and the Overlord is also a welcome change of pace from the typical "corrupted" heroes and the prejudiced empires that were present in the past games. Good is finally getting the upper hand, but this story shows that you can't permanently put evil down, and if you try, it'll come back with a vegeance.\n\nNow, onto the gameplay. Yes; the gameplay is a departure from traditional Overlord; yes, I am somewhat upset about the fact that Codemaster's decided to pander towards EA's way of thinking rather than keep their uniqueness; no, it's not a bad game. Why? Because of the simple reason that this is a "spin-off." The beauty of a spin-off is that the developers can take the gameplay in a different direction while still keeping it in the same world. Codemaster's wanted to see if they could make a successful Overlording Co-op title, and they both did and didn't. They did because the game is fun and it's still emulating the fact that you are the bad guy, but it doesn't due to, lack of a better word, "bugs" in the game's core programing. I played several hours with a good friend of mine using the online multiplayer, and it took, on average, 4-5 tries to get him connected into the game. Sometimes his game wouldn't load in and he'd have to restart. All in all, this co-op system is plagued with glitches and bugs. Now, onto the core parts of the game itself. The gameplay may make it seem like a Diablo clone, but it isn't. Instead, it is its own thing: a gauntlet-style Overlord spin-off sequel that is meant to be played locally with friends. Is the gameplay good? Yes. Does it get repetitive and boring? Most certainly. I found that Minions are not the core part of the gameplay, but play more of a supporting role to the player characters, as well as providing some dark humor along the way. It is difficult to properly use them, and it seemed more like Codemaster's was trying to get players that had played Overlord before to play this game, rather than reach out to newer fans of evil. Its tutorial was also quite unhelpful, and I had better luck learning the tricks on my own. The lack of Minions as a main commodity of the gameplay itself rather irks me, but I still don't feel too bad about it. This is a spin-off, after all.\n\nFinally, here's my final thoughts on the game. The game isn't necessarily as bad as people said it would be. It also isn't as necessarily good as I would've hoped it could've been. It's rough around the edges, changes the formula of the gameplay style of Overlord drastically (hence the hate towards it), and seems to not really emulate Overlord as much as it does other cooperative top-down RPGs, such as Magicka. However, it remains its own thing with Rhianna's wonderful writing on the story, Marc Silk's good performance on Gnarl, and the fact that it retains the series' signature black comedy/dark humor and letting you be the villain. The change of pace to fighting actual forces of Good was a nice touch in my opinion, but without a successful gameplay element, I can say that I want to love this game to death, but I can't because of its setbacks in both gameplay and the repetitive nature of the game itself. Unlike other Overlord games, its replay value so far has been nothing. I rate this game a 6.7/10 for its repetitive gameplay, frustrating glitches, and other such things that I've listed in this review.\n\nIf I have one thing to say to Codemaster's, it's that you should look on this more as a growing/learning experience. Fans were angry at you for changing the formula so drastically, even in a spin-off, and its release, although amazingly fun for the first 10 minutes or so, does get repetitive. Please make a proper Overlord game with some particular requests, such as:\nNever-ending gameplay that changes dynamically with your Overlord\nReturning Minion Mounts and keeping current stuff that's been put into both this and past Overlord games (Brown taunting, Red kamakazi, and Blue-Overlord healing)\nContinuing the series' dark humor and great storytelling\nMore of a true good vs evil side to it, with the constant cycle of good and evil being in the balance\nEndless peasantry to dominate/destroy like in Overlord 1 (where they would respawn when you reentered a town or village)\nIntermixing of the tyranny system from Overlord II and the Corruption system from Overlord: Raising Hell\n\nAnyways, I hope that you all give this game a try, even for all of its faults, and just see that it's not the "franchise killer" that people were talking about for months on end.","October 19, 2015","true","27.9"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

Game play it's self is really good. Overhead view kind of sucks since you can't move the camera around. I'm sure they will release an update for it in the morning and then maybe some of the glitches will be fixed.\n\nIt's not really a bad game for the price, but I would wait until they release an update and if you pre-ordered it and are complaining you didn't get your TF2 hats yet, just wait until morning and see if you get your stuff.\nThings may come up with an update. But for now just playing 2 hours of the game, it's an alright game.","October 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/headlesseggman/recommended/306670/","headlesseggman","Legion-And-Friends","http://steamcommunity.com/id/headlesseggman/","137 products in account","As stated by the producers: It's not Overlord III, and should not be expected to be similar to previous Overlord games, which is exactly what a majority of the people are whining about.\n\nThat being said, I'm not saying it doesn't have its issues and whatnot, but it still pulls its own weight to a certain degree to be a decent game.\n\nPros:\n+ Storyline is good\n+ Dialogue is still as snappy as ever\n+ You're not stuck with one type of character; you can pick from 4 which suits your playstyle\n+ The environment has been rendered quite nicely. I especially liked the town with the zombies.\n+ You can kill your allies with humorous results\n\nNeutral:\n+ New minion system. While this is one of the cons for many, I file this under Neutral due to simply the mechanic balancing itself out; as an intended multiplayer game, 4 people swarming minions tactically will be too overpowered. Instead, what they've done is decrease minion control while also making minions more cheap and expendable, in the form of easily harvestable cubes (and can be spammed in Cryos' case if you have the right weapon)\n+ New Hub layout\n+ Lack of a map\n+ The style of how the characters look like haven't changed, and are still as cartoony as ever while managing to look serious at the same time.\n\nCons:\n+ Still fairly buggy at certain points, but I do find it funny when one of the enemy soldiers just suddenly float off without any absolute reason\n+ Not a lot of enemy unit variation so far: Standard Soldier, Big Sword Soldier, Shield and Sword Soldier, and different elemental Mage variations. But then, the previous Overlords did have this too.\n+ Not a lot of attacks per character; we could do with more spells.\n\nOverall, it's a decent enough game to play if you're a fan of the Overlord series for the storyline, but if you're looking for similar Overlord gameplay I'd advise waiting for Overlord III. For new players yet to be introduced to Overlord, it should prove decently playable if one can get hooked on the story.","October 20, 2015","true","9.5"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"
