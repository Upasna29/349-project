"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/2520/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","Gumboy - Crazy Adventures earns my first negative review.\n\nCampaign:\nLet's get started, the protagonist known as Gumboy is a ball (most likely made of gum) that can transform into different shapes by collecting different in game items. There are different story sections of the game: Tutorial, Magic Forest, Bean World, Summer Meadow, Underground, and Caves. Each section is about equal in length except Underground which only has three levels. The tutorials offer a system which allows you to learn the basics of the game before they infuriate you in the actual campaign. Each mission you  have an Astral Guardian who will help you to achieve an objective. Once you have completed the requirements a pollinator (somewhere on the map) will release pollen, you must then using an item offered by the Astral Guardian push the pollen back to the Astral Guardian. Upon completing this a portal opens which you can roll, roll, or roll into. This ends the level and allows you to move up to the next challenge. You can start in the first level of Magic Forest, Bean World, or Summer Meadows meaning there is no real beginning to the game. In fact there is no real story, just simply roll and collect the dust then roll on your merry way.\n\nGameplay:\nIf you didn’t notice I used the word roll a lot, this is because roll is your only native control. In order to jump you must collect a hiccup seed and it only lasts for a set amount of time. This is fantastic the character can essentially only roll left to right prior to collecting an item, this means before starting a level half the time you have to roll and find this item so you can actually start the level. Not only do you need to find the ability to jump before starting a level, you must then go find the shape transformation items on the levels (this is not optional). You play a character who is made of gum and cannot mold itself or jump by itself. The game continues by making it so the terrain has random bumps in it that block you from effectively moving (half the time throwing me in the wrong way – over and over again). The jump ability only works half of the time and the heights obtained by the jump seem completely random so going from one platform to the other is essentially just luck of the draw. If you could get past the incredibly poor controls, the required transformation changes, the ridiculous requiring an item to jump concept, and the awfully designed terrain you'd still probably not like this game. Gumboy - Crazy Adventures still pushes the boundary with an awful menu interface, rather than being able to simply move the mouse and select to exit a menu you need to roll your character through each menu option where it requires you to stop and wait till the sub menu interface opens. Even the in-game menu works similarly; to exit you have to roll round a huge ball just so you can quit the game. Gumboy – Crazy Adventures is a game that offers very little in the sense of entertainment. Then this game strives for being least interesting game by offering poor controls, terrible terrain navigation, and illogical gameplay.\n\nResult:\nOverall I would not recommend this game, although seeing as it came with the Indie Puzzle Back I guess you'll just have to have it stuck in your library. Some people would say you could get past all these deficits because the ambience is nice, the environment is pleasing, and the music is soothing. If you want a puzzle game where you are a ball, that offers interesting music, beautiful scenery, and a serene ambiance play influx. It’s the same price, it was made in 2013, and you will not want to kill yourself every time you try and move the character.\n\nPros:\n+Whimsical music.\n+I personally like how the dialogue is gibberish.\n\nCons:\n-Poor Controls\n-Poor terrain set up\n-No default jump command "must find a Hiccup Seed"\n-Poor menu interface/navigation\n-Requirement to change shapes in order to beat levels (rather than allowing the gamer to decide when to change shape)\n-Jump ability only works half of the time once you get the hiccup seed\n-Jump ability heights are almost completely random and do not couple with speed boost\n-Ball will bounce randomly around terrain rather than move effectively in one direction or another","March 5, 2014","false","1.1"," 62 of 96 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","62","96","0","6"

To me this little game is pure genius. There's something about it you just can't put your finger on... something strange, hard to define. The premise is utterly simple - roll left or right - but the game keeps adding new possibilities every level. And it doesn't make a fuzz about it. "Here's something completely new, it's there, who cares". The mechanics and physics are spot on and the game explores them brilliantly. Visually it's beautiful and the characters you interact with are strange and fascinating. A feeling of novelty and discovery permeates the game from start to finish.\n\nHere's my suggestion: watch some videos of the gameplay and see if it bothers you. If not, go for it, for you've barely seen the tip of the iceberg.","June 18, 2014","true","6.3"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","23","33","0","1"

Wizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AntagonistWizard/","168 products in account","This game was made for children, i could read the entire game design from the second level, and it managed to be WORSE than Nightsky and Gish.\nEven thought it is more detailed and beautiful than those two, it still feels like it came out of a game template maker or something.\nThe mouth sound effects the character makes was bad.\nThe movement is too floaty.\nAnd it is just bad in general, i do not recommend it.\n\nNightsky is more challenging, and Gish has more grip and feels better than this. Go buy those instead.","July 24, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I can tell at least some effort went into this on the programming side though, and that's a shame.\n\nOn the face of it, its a simple ball rolling into hole puzzle game but tries to be more than it is by inventing names for well esatblished mechanics (power ups are luciferoids and stars and junk) certain number of points required before you can leave the incredibly simple levels, controls are clunky and bogged down at best frustratingly fast and floaty at worst.\n\nnot worth the respective 25 cents I paid for it in a dollar puzzle pack. I'd have more fun with a stick of gum.","March 31, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"
