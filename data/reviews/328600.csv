The menus and UI are all designed to be used with a gamepad, and arent very mouse friendly. I don't think there's any new content either, I've not seen any. No new units, No new dynamics to the gameplay or the maps / stages. You figure they could do something like add multiple floors to buildings and stairs to make the gameplay a bit more interesting but they just somehow couldnt come up with any new ways to improve the gameplay.

In other words, when you turn, it isn't some 180 degree in a millisecond trick. You have to actually turn. This requires more planning and thought for checks, rounding corners, etc.\n\nIn the original synapse (with the Red DLC, actually) were mutators. FS Prime has smartly integrated the Focus Aim and Double Kill ones. WIth Focus Aim (called Sweeping Aim in Prime, if I recollect correctly), every unit can choose whether to aim in the classic sense (facing in a direction and continuing to do so until orders change), or in the Focus fashion, which locks the aim to a single point rather than a direction, thus allowing units to move and remain aimed at the dictated point. This is a far better way of handling this feature than making it all or nothing as it was in the original. As for Double Kill, it is now the standard. All things being equal, two units squaring off will both die if there is no particular advantage.\n\nBalancing the power of weapons: In FS, shotguns were unbeatable if coming around a corner against an MG. Not so much now. Now any unit will defeat any other unit, or both will perish, in more realistic fashion. If I'm an MG unit and I'm sitting in a room pointing at the door, and a shotgun rounds the corner, I am going to get the jump on him with my trigger, one would think. Now that is the case. I don't have to square off, look down my scope, etc. at that short range, so it only makes sense that I'd fire quickly from the hip and head home for glory. This does not mean that shotties aren't more deadly at close range, faster moving, etc.; they are. Now range just isn't the only factor.\n\nMatch creation has become much more straight forward. There are preset squad setups, as well as the expected random and player defined ones. Maps are easy to resize, and the amount of cover, windows, doors, and state of the walls on a map are all easily definable. Changes to these elements are reflected in a quick loading preview.\n\nNo more Global Elo! This is, unfortunately, both good and bad. The Elo system is brutal on high ranked players, and morever, nobody on the planet Earth fully understands how it calculates. However, while Prime keeps things much simpler, the one downside is that it is based purely on points from all matches played. So, the unemployed guy who plays all day, if good enough to win more than lose, will likely be king of the hill into eternity.\nThere are a number of very nice details and changes, and this review is long enough already I suspect. There are some bugs as well, but from my very brief experience so far, Double Eleven is listening to the community and attempting to address all feedback, concerns, and issues. Unlike Mode7, they seem to actually act on their words. I hope it stays that way and the various bugs get fixed in a timely fashion.\n\nThe final buy or don't buy is really very simple:\nIf you love Synapse and want the same game in a slightly updated and interesting fashion, this is a must, especially at the $10 for two copies price right now (until Nov. 21, 2014).\n\nIf you are not a real fan of the original game, and the reason is not because of the top-down only, dullish, graphics, then you won't want to spend your money on this either.\n\nI personally enjoy it, and even though point rankings aren't that important, given the hope for upcoming patches, I'd have to offer up a 7.5 out of 10, maybe even an 8.\n\n\n\n\n","November 17, 2014","true","112.6"," 58 of 72 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","58","72","0","1"

I have played the first one and so far from what I have seen the core gameplay and campaign havent varied from it, so I will just take my experience from there over here in matters of which I am sure have not changed.\n\nThe game is brutal stragety. No RNG. If you lose its not the computers or the games fault, just yours. Matches against the computer ar fair, the AI doesnt "cheat" and matches in multiplayer are always an interesting experience. The tutorial gives you the basics, but some things you have to figure out on your own. Playing against pros usually teaches you some new tricks, even if you have been in the game for a while. So how does this game work? You have a bunch of different units, all with unique skills (Sniper good at long range, shotgun good at short range, rocket guy goes BOOM! and so on). You give orders to these units, for example move there while aiming there. You can also give orders to the enemy units. Then you simulate what WOULD happen if the enemy moves exactly the way you expect it to. You can simulate and give orders to infinity until you are happy. Then you click on the button to actually activate your actions and once the enemy has done this as well (auto against AI) you see the actual results. The closer it is to what you expected and planned for, the more damage you usually do. You win if you kill all enemies or capture certain things, depending on which mode you are playing. All the modes also have a "Light" and "Dark" version. In Light you see the enemy units. In Dark you see them at the beginning and then after that you can only guess where they are (which can get your heart pumpin if its coming down to an all or nothing one on one hunt). The music is nice, I personally can't agree with the "OMG SO AWESOME!" that the others rate it though, it fits the futuristic style of the game though. The looks are also futuristic, but...I dont know why, but I kind of dislike the way the game looks. Its very subtle and experience will of course vary with others. There is a pretty lenghty campaign with a story that has rather confused me more than anything else so far, but I guess if I read every single text I probably would understand more of it, since the game gives a LOT of background information about its world. The campaign also contains some gameplay features that arent in the multiplayer, for whatever reason. Since the multiplayer matches are turn-based it sometimes takes weeks to finish a match because the opponent goes offline. Once you are in the game and while you are in the game you will be told if in one of the games you are playing a new turn has occured. The controls with the keyboard are a bit clumsy and I would reccomend using the mouse and maybe one or two keyboard buttons for functions that you use often. All in all, if you like a game that is really nothing more than simple strategy I can totally reccomend this.\n\nNow to the comparison:\nThe game looks a lot different. While I dont like the new looks I like them more than the old ones. Sometimes the old looks were just TOO simplistic for my taste and left room for interpretation. With the new looks I know exactly whats going and to going to go on. There is also a killcam now, which is fun to watch so far, expecially since in the old game I sometimes had "how the hell did that kill me?" moments. the controls are...worse? better? I cant tell. I think they could have been done better in both games. I have to say that it is a lot easyer to give orders while waiting though. The best addition really is the new order. You can tell your unit to always look at a certain spot even when moving. So now you dont have to change the field of view every few steps, which in my opinion was a much needed update. One thing, that I am wondering though: where did the riotshielders go? I never figured out how to use them in the old game anyway, but they could have at least used them here as well, without DLC. I havent quite figured out the new arena mode yet, so far it just seems like a normal match on a pretty large map to me. One thing I am uncapable of finding is the chat in multiplayer. If they removed: MY GOD WHY? If they didnt: where is it? A change of look that I am liking is the.. I'm just going to call it interface, of the campaign. Where you view background information and talk to people. I just..looks better in my opinion. Now to the main question: "Should I buy it if I already own the original?" Cant answer that one, I know I am glad I did it, but that is, hoping, that there will a couple of updates on this game.\n\nUPDATE:\nplayed again after a while and from I have seen the multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ing dead. so if ya buy it, do it for local play and singeplay","November 14, 2014","true","4.1"," 53 of 77 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","53","77","0","1"

It's hard when playing against the AI, I'd go so far as to say it's a puzzle game. You basically replay a map over and over in the campaign until you've mapped out the AI's moves because you are usually under gunned and pressed for time which the AI digs in and runs down the clock.\n\nIt's difficult to get the drop on the AI because it seems to anticipate your every move. Difficult - frustrating. There's a decent selection of game modes for skirmish and the multiplayer scene isn't as dead as smaller niche games out there so you'll probably find someone to play with depending on the time of day.\n\nI'm still a bit confused as to why you can't change the name of the protagonist which appears hard coded to appear as 'Tactics' for some confusing reason. The UI is clunky and controller support will leave you at a disadvantage over people who play with a mouse. There are a couple bugs yet to be worked out and the game crashed once during my play test, since the game auto saves after every turn it was no big deal.\n\nThis is a turn based game where you can easily invest ten plus minutes in each turn but if that's your forte it's worth your time.\n\nMy YouTube Review: https://youtu.be/JKMZdF-WAk8","April 20, 2015","true","3.3"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","1"

Well you are a hired elite soldier for the rebels. your goal is to overthrow a powerfull coperation.The story progress through a city map screen where you can click to progress or hear what characters have to say through potraits with a text window.\n\nYou controll a team of elite soldiers and you need to outsmart the Ai on the battlefield. You must plan carefully every move for your soldiers. If it goes wrong? Restart and change tactics. The Ai will and can change tactics on the battlefield. (Note! I recommend playing through the 2 tutorials so you get a hang of the game and mechanics before starting a game.)\n\nGfx, interface and levels ingame is clean and stylish. Levels are clever and tactical and fun to play, They will surely give you a challenge but they can be beaten. Iam counting myself as newbie tactical but i havent found a level yet that have been unbeatable. My only complain is the campaign wich is a big city map wich you click to progress your game. Nothing wrong with the map but you can only read what characters want to say but not really talk to them. Also you can not setup your team weapons and outfitt, those are premade for each missions instead.\n\nThe sound effects are good and music does what it should. Some speech for the text screens would have been nice.\n\nWhen you have beaten campaign you can play skirmish. I think the game will be enjoyable for a longtime in skirmish because you can change almost every aspect of the rules, soldiers weapons  and generated maps or why not use the pre-generated maps with other settings.\n\nThe game also includes multiplayer. And i can imagine myself the game can be alot of fun with friends for a laugh or two.

Price is a bit high so buy it on sale. Its a game every tactical gamer should have in library.\n\nEnd notes!\nI have read that some reviewers complaining about Ai and windows? Just have a guard and have him sweep it and he will kill what comes in front of it. And if you want to move in front of window just click knee and then dash to not to be seen. It was fully explained in the tutorial howto do it. I have done it in my missions and it worked alltimes. Sometimes i did misstakes and the Ai got the upper hand but just restart untill you know what you did wrong in frist place. Or better press space so the timeframe can show what will happen if you end turn. It will only show seconds but it will give a glimps view what can happen. Use it often and wisely. ;)\n\nAs allways english is not my main language. But i have tried my best to get it readable.

There is also a visual representation for standing, crouching and dashing etc. But trying to select two waypoints or units next to each other is a nightmare.

The only chance to finish campaign missions if you manage to dominate the map on your very first turn, because the movement of AI in the first turn is constant, they doing the same.\n\nMultiplayer part of the game at least dont have cheater AI, but its dead, so if you want to buy it for that, then you can just forget it.\n\nI also love, that if you need eliminate all AI units on a map, they just stand at the same positions and they dont try to attack you, they dont move to your line of sights.

Having to go into a menu to get to the specific options seems like a nuicanse, but having lost one game too many in the original from a move I didn't intentionally plan makes me think this feature is useful, especially to less experienced players. While the graphics are a nice touch, I very much prefer the old look of the game. It was distinctive, if not unique and gave the impression you really were commanding them from a saferoom somewhere. That's not to say this game looks bad - sometimes it could be difficult to tell what was going on in the middle of a game and the more defined models are easier to make out but this is a "to each his own" affair. Realistically, there's not much to choose between the two so pick up whichever one takes your fancy.

The interface gets very choppy, much due to the "preview" mode and automatic camera panning. Also, I found no way to rebind the keys, why the hell would you hard code something like that?\n\nThe randomness can be really bothersome - you'd think that each unit type has a certain skill, like in chess. But once in a while your shotgunner will get killed in close combat by a gunner, even though he's crouching in aim mode. Lack of predictability kind of ruins the idea of a strategy game like this.\n\nThere are not enough unit classes, this makes the game like a demo with to many maps. The classes are pretty boring as well. Why not have different grenades for the grenader, like smoke and singularity?\n\nNo ability to rewind a turn, you'll have to restart the map if you ♥♥♥♥ up in the fifteenth round, and replay the whole level in exactly the same way. This gets incredibly repetitive.\n\nYou don't get anything for performing well. at least I didn't see any benefits for keeping the team and hostages alive, or capturing more comlinks. All I got was a bloody Steam achivement!!\n\nThe story's kind of lame, and the intreface which it get's presented through is fragmented and doesn't really engage me as a reader.\n\nI got this game through Humble Bundle for a buck or two, and I consider that a fair price for a demo game ike this.\n6/10","April 18, 2015","true","15.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","1"

I HOPE THIS DOESNT CHANGE THE VEIW FOR NEW COMING PLAYERS, IT IS A GREAT GAME. REVEIW BELOW FOR NEW-COMERS\nThe devs of this game are different than the devs of frozen synapse ive heared. so my first impression was "cool, a frozen synapse with better graphics. (thinking about who installments work-) they must have alot of new features too, like maybe a suppression option, new campaign, and maybe even a new unit." so, without second thought, I bought the game with alittle extra steam money left over from I dont even know.\nafter loading it up, i took to the campaign to play the tutorial and see what was in store for me. after the loading screen went through, I was placed in the game with the same AI that was with me the first time. the tutorial looked different. saying to myself,"ok, shows that they work on the game maybe." I found that the game layout made me press weird buttons to open up menus. For instance, I have to press "X" to open the menu that allows you to change where your aiming, ducking, etc. , and then the "F" button does something that changes how you move or something, they never really went over that much. you still have to double click to place movement. on the plus side, its easier to see whether someone is disengaged or ducking. all in all the annoyances outweigh the easy-ness, making the controls very uninviting compared to the last. now, getting tired of writing, ill put it sumple, the campaign is exactly the same as the old one, they didnt change a thing. they only added the strafe (basicly aim but the point is fixed) and check, which is a quick aim that automaticly goes back in a second. stick with the original.\n\nNEW PEOPLE REVEIW\n\nDespite what i said before, this really is an awesome game. I am inept at describing things but here i go. frozen synapse prime is a game in which you are an AI that controls a group of robot soilders and you and others are trying to take down an evil corparation. In this game, you control a group of up to six soilders usually, you can pick where each of them go, how they move where they look, etc. the catch is, they cant see anything other than their feild of veiw, you control their every move in a very detailed way, it is amazing. usually the objective is to either clear the map, or get to a base. In multiplayer you must outsmart your opponent to win. If you become skilled enough you can combine different actions to look behind corners, pop up out of cover to have someone be able to get a shot on them and duck back down before they hit you, etc. It is a very fun game I do reccomend it","November 24, 2014","true","10.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

I got this in a bundle, so I pretty much bypassed the  $25 price tag.\n\nOn to the game itself, it plays just like the original game. You issue orders to your dudes, such as run here, look in the direction as you walk, crouch, etc. Then you press play and watch your plan act out as your opponent(AI or player) acts out their pre-made plan at the same time. Team with the last man standing wins.\n\nUnlike most people, I like the new graphics, and also unlike them I liked the keyboard controls, and actually prefer it over the original game. The controller support is perfect, with all the right mapping to make the experience smooth. There's more feedback on what the various map, game mode, and team setup do, and easier to mess around with. There's plenty of interesting pre-made maps and scenarios to screw with, plus the map generator and campaign.\n\nSo the game is definitely fun, with nice controls and graphics, BUT it's a reskin of the original but with more polish. I would not get this if you don't think what I mentioned above is worth it.

I was satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like tactical turn-based games, strategy, and futuristic, sci-fi themes, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are decent - the character models and amount of detail in the levels are average, however, the assets (character models, level design) are extremely repetitive and can get stale quickly. The music and sounds are good and add a relaxing feel to the game, although I muted the music in favor of my own after half an hour. The story is good, but nothing special - you act as a member of a rebel organization trying to break the hierarchy of power and oppression in a futuristic world. There is a lot of optional lore you can go through in the form of character dialogues.\n\nThe controls are slightly complex and can take a bit of getting used to if you are not experienced with tactical turn-based games. There is a set of tutorial missions that will help you get a feel for the gameplay. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with this genre. Characters die with one hit, so micromanaging every single step and action is critical to success (ex: check every corner and angle as you move).\n\nGameplay consists of you planning out moves for each of your units each turn, then executing it once you are ready (this counts as one round). You can experiment with potential enemy movements to help you better plan out your strategies, which is something I thought was interesting. There is no fog of war, so you can always see the entire map, including enemy locations without having to first spot them. In a way, this makes the game more challenging because it can bias you to consider too many possibilities (ex: every possible way an enemy can move), when a fog of war/line-of-sight mechanic helps slow you down and only use intel you actually have.\n\nWhen you have queued your actions for each of your units, you can "prime" (end turn) to move to the execution phase. Here, it will move all characters, providing you with a slow-motion replay whenever characters shoot each other and/or die. You cannot undo turns, but you can cancel any orders you have queued when you move on to the next round (you will always be prompted if you want to keep your queued actions or clear them). Enemy reinforcements may appear if it is part of the story, however, you will always start with all your units for each level. Sometimes, you may have uncontrollable allies or non-player civilians present.\n\nUnits have a circle dial of actions that include, crouch/stand, aim (focus on an area and have faster reaction time), sweep (scan an area during movement), etc. When you command a unit to move, you are able to add waypoints to the route and can even manipulate it as much as you want (ex: you can turn a mostly straight, tight right-turn into a wide, erratic route). You can also add actions to each waypoint you place - this is useful if you want to make your units scan each corner/angle as they move to a flanking position. Compared to other games like Breach & Clear, I felt that Frozen Synapse Prime's action set was a bit easier and user-friendly, however, I personally preferred B&C's. Frozen Synapse is definitely an easier tactical turn-based game to sink into if you are inexperienced with the genre.\n\nThere is a story, online, and skirmish mode available to play. The skirmish mode has all units unlocked to use, while the story mode requires progression before you have access to all unit types.\n\nOverall, the game plays very well and is reasonably challenging, and anyone interested in the tactical turn-based genre should check it out. I always try not to mention price in my reviews if I feel it is unnecessary, however, I do think that people should wait for this game to be fairly discounted unless they are dying to play it.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","May 11, 2015","true","3.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

I miss how you can aim/ order wait time without having to open a menu up every time. Having a classic UI option would be great. Setting actions mid waypoint doesn't seem to exist, but you can just make a new waypoint within the waypoint to get around that problem.\n\n-The Riot Shield unit does not exist. I don't know why.\n\n\nGraphics:\n-I actually prefer these graphics over the original from a gameplay standpoint. An example of this is that it's easier to see players crouch and crouch walk.\n-Personal Preference: I think I like the graphics of Prime better than the original.\n\nPerformance:\n-The game actually runs faster than the original for me which is pretty weird. Priming turns and watching it load and generate my turn and the opponent's turn takes a shorter time than the original. Prime also crashes less for some odd reason. Maybe the game is more optimised?\n\nSound/ Music:\n-The same music from the original game, which I like anyways. The music fits the graphics more in Prime because it complements how cyberpunk the game is.\n-Sound of weapons and explosions have been improved. I guess to complement the graphics.\n\nOverall: This game is complicated for veterans coming from the original because of how different the UI is.

I can also no longer see the actual numbers going into it, like the chance that a wall is destroyed or not instead of showing me the actual chance that it is destroyed it just shows me "Faultless" or "Destroyed", which is a large step back from the original where there were 51 different possibilities, each increasing in implements that even though small made a visible difference on the map created. My other main problem is the RGB colour editor. While it is great that this game has it in with sliders, you can only move the sliders one number at a time, rather than clicking and dragging. I also found that you can use arrow keys, but even if you hold down the key it only goes up or down by about five, over five seconds or so, then stops anyway. If I want to make my units red that should not take 510 key presses to get red to 255 and blue to 0. The sound options have this same problem, and when I am altering voice sound every single time I press the key it plays an annoying sound file, and it takes 100 key presses to mute it, and you will want to, with all of the ridiculous confirmation in the game. If I press "Aim here" then select somewhere to ♥♥♥♥ing aim then I don't want to be asked if I am "Really really really sure?" for the third time this round. And that is something which needs to be changed in the options menu, I want to disable these bad mecahnics, which do nothing other than slow me down. If I press spacebar to watch a video of what will happen in the next 5 seconds (it is always five seconds, no altering it for some reason) then when it is over can I not have to press spacebar again to get rid of it. If I try to make a change does it not realise that I no longer want it to be in video mode anymore? The amount of content missing in this game is atrocious, and the only notable differences seem to serve only to slow players down and make the game janky. I want to love this game, I really do, but if I have to press yes on the "Are you sure?"ometer one more ♥♥♥♥ing time I don't think I will be able to. With all of the mandatory instant replays on every single kill, the six man player limit, and a campaign that as far as I can tell is a literal copy-paste from the first, with slightly better map design at least, I just feel that as user-friendly that you have tried to make this you have failed. FS was all about being able to make complex plans in seconds, the thought of what you were going to do was always the complicated bit, but now I am being discouraged from using the wait command because the menu to just set up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing takes 30 seconds, not three like in the original. To make this game playable and sellable to any veterans or fans of FS, or STBS at all for that matter, is to add the the options menu\nA: Sliders for the colour bars\nB: Turn off confirmations on commands\nthen add to the game-making menu\nA: actual data for map creation, I don't care if in brackets you put (fractured) next to 0.5 on the chance that a wall will be broken for some context, just have the actual data so we have some more control over the maps we play\nB: choices on turn length and limit, not just 5, 10, 20 turn games, I want an option for 3 turn games, or 2 turn games with minimal cover or walls, for a fast paced game, I want options to have more than 5 seconds a turn, 1 second turns were loads of fun in FS, if the other person was there, same for 30 second turns. I'm not asking to change the default, just have the options\nC: More than 6 people aside please, that's pitiful, really.\n\nJust make these five small changes, and seeing as how you copy-pasted the campaign you can copy-paste these from the base game, the coding ain't that hard people, and I swear that FS vets who loved the original will adore this game, honestly, I have several friends of mine who got this, and all were let down by the aforementioned problems. And please, whatever you do, don't lie to us like you did earlier this discussion thread in a reply to @THOMPSON, claiming that you had not taken these things out. Slowing down the game is in no way "User Friendly", and while I have no qualms with the radial menu perhaps just an option to replace it with the list functionality of FS would simmer people's nerves a bit. No matter what you do this will be compared to FS, and in it's current state it is just so janky and fragmented by kill cams and constant affirmations of your actions that has been weighed and found wanting.","April 18, 2015","false","3.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

(Mostly)\n\nI love the graphics, they are soooo much better than the original. (I'm sure purists will disagree with me, and that's fine.) My previous problem with the game not allowing me to choose which controller scheme to use has been fixed.

This isn't the only game I've noticed this issue in though.\n\nOther than this issue (which will hopefully be fixed soon) the game is fantastic. I don't share the same criticism as others (such as the FPS being limited to 60) I don't see why more than 60 FPS is really all that necessary.\n\nI plan on playing this game much more in the future, it seems like a great strategy game.

It seemed to me a very strategic game of reading your oponents moves and trying to counter accordingly.\n\nFrozen Synapse Prime isnt necessarily a sequel. I don't want to call it that. It is a graphical and UI update. The graphic update is whatever to me (it's nice), but the UI update is much needed. With the action command bar everything feels a little more smooth. They also implemented a UI update to the wait command which is very, very much needed. For example, in the first Frozen Synapse the wait command could get extremely cluttered really quick. When trying to use checks, and ducks, and aims, and stands all in the same wait command it got extremely clunky and cluttered. They changed that in this one expanding it so you can easily place and alter your commands within the wait timer and you can even isolate your wait command and play it out separately.\n\nThe multi-player is back yet they changed the multiplayer matchmaking a little. You no longer que and wait for an opponent. Instead you look for a match, and if none are open you create your own match (or two, or three, or four of your own), input your unit commands and come back later (if no one has joined yet) to follow up after someone has filled the seat of your oponent and input their own commands for their units.\n\nThey also gave the match creator more power in editing the type of match to create. Something that is lacking in the first Frozen Synapse. More power in adding/removing cover, adding/removing doors, how many rooms, what types of units. All is still randomly generated in the end but only within the parameters that you had already set.\n\nI am a little disappointed in actual gameplay additions. They didn't really add any new content (except the campaign mode), units, features! They also removed the beloved shield dudes! It all just feels like an update. An update im more than happy to support since i love the series so much and i have a lot of fun proving my intellectual and tactical superiority.

Normally, I'm not a huge fan of the strategy genre.\n\nThe idea is that you have each of your pieces performs actions (with a very robust set of options here) and end your turn. Once your turn is over, not only are your actions implemented in real-time, so are your opponent's. This leads to a very tactical, almost real time feel.\n\nSadly, I haven't gotten to do any online gameplay, so I can't review it there.\n\nOne drawback is the story, and the interface.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsnowman111/recommended/328600/","mrsnowman111","MrSnowman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsnowman111/","288 products in account","Header: I've played the original for 82 hours here on steam but only played this new version 1.5 hours. So while my review isn't 'well founded' it adresses the issues I see and how this game relates to the original.\n\nSummary: All in all I'd say I recommend the previous title. This is a mobile version of the game, it has bigger buttons than the old mobile version. I'd wager it's better because of that. This title doesn't seem to have all that much life but that's also true for the previous game. In this game they've adressed this to some degree by letting you post game setups on a matchmaking board where people can grab them. Rather than having to be logged in and wait for someone to take your game like the previous game did. Huge plus. But frankly with the way this game is played you don't need a massive player activity. You can go into the previous game, open it in windowed mode, start a "find a game" search. Have it succeed and play your game later. But now there's mostly hardcore players left and newer players might struggle. Either way purchasing this game is a gamble I feel. Hopefully it's better on mobile. But reading some of the reviews on the android version I'm having trouble believing that now. I don't know what happened. But Double eleven seems to be doing this game as opposed to mode7 who made the original. But if awards is something to go on Double Eleven seems to be doing ok. So why does this suck?\n\nDetails:\nThere's problems. The UI is clunky and is definetively a step back from the original. This game crashes. Ridding you of all your careful planning and enrages you to no end. It's clear there was an attempt at expanding to the mobile market here. That's the UI. It's almost entirely focused on being touch screen based, only PC-specific feature i've seen is that we have hotkeys for actions. But these actions are only accessible once you've entred into a menu (command wheel) via X or right click. So they're completely unessesary. The default keybindings are all the keybindings you have, you can't change them. And infuriatingly almost every action needs some form of confirmation step. For instance if you set a wait command you will have to hit E to confirm you're done. Unlike the previous game where you'd place your actions on the timeline directly you're now restricted to 0.1 second increments for your actions. Which may seem like a sensible gameplay change due to the amount of milisecond micromanagement that might very well have gotten you the advantage in the previous game but all it really does is introduce more randomness. You can't plan for very specific things and you might find yourself having to use waypoint tweaking to delay your actions instead. So if it's intentionally restrictive for gameplay purpouses (and not to support mobile better in some way) it's poorly implemented since all it does is change where you delay your actions.\n\nFor whatever reason the intro screens presenting the game technologies and the game company are now unskippable. Which is a very big deal for me since it really shaves away those precious seconds I have to jump in - play a turn - jump out. And the game decides that it's absolutely vital you're reminded that there's an autosave feature in the game. Except there really isn't. Because the game ♥♥♥♥ing crashes and erases your turn when you submit it and the only restorable state is before you've done any planning. You'd expect they'd actually have autosaving implemented since they're so keen on advertising it.\n\nYet dispite all of this it's a great game at its core. I recommend this for a mobile platform. I had performance issues with the previous Frozen Synapse on my phone (not surprising considering how cheap that tablet was) but if this runs better on your phone/tablet than it did on mine then I highly recommend it there. The UI in the old game was pretty much this situation but in reverse, you had the PC interface on the phone. Which wasn't too bad considering. It did take more time I feel and they've definetively increased the size of every element on the screen in this game so I can only imagine it's better. The confirmation steps are also nice on a mobile platform because it's not rare you accidentally touch the screen.\n\nOnly gameplay differences I've noticed is that double kill (stalemates, units can 'trade' killing both of them) is enabled by default. You can no longer rapidly switch view direction, something I'm a bit torn about if I like or not but I do see the problems it wishes to alleviate.\n\nThe graphical 'improvements' are purely technical. I much prefer the older aesthetic. It didn't need more in that department. It was stylistic and now it feels kinda bland. You don't really like looking at the characters in this game, they're not well made enough that you would like them. The only graphical improvement I really enjoy is the fact that they show LOS now. So you can tell exactly what's been "cleared" in dark mode. Which is nice. But you usually could figure that out just due to the simplicity of the playing field many times along with your ability to draw lines using the aiming markers.\n\nIt's regrettable that due to marketing reasons this would have to be a new release becuase that's the best way to catch peoples attention apparently. I really really wish all the focus would have been on extending the gameplay rather than visual trinkets. Sortof like Red did. The shield guys were amazing, open up so many possibilities and interesting gameplay. Along with Upload that really drove it home as an expansion with me. But this game doesn't do anything like that. The best feature of this game is room selection. But even that isn't that important. The old mobile version had something very similar with areas you could draw and have enemies be ignored if they were in them and that was way better because it increases the granularity. Here it becomes a very niche feature rather than something you'd actually consider using.\n\n\nProbably won't update this so any inaccuracies mentioned in potential comments you should probably trust.","April 27, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A new look with updated, swanky graphics, some more options for combat, giving you greater control over the outcomes; and a revamped multiplayer system. All together, there’s not that much new going on. The new commands now allow your units to ignore or focus on a particular room, and also allows them to focus on one particular point while moving, not exactly ground-breaking beyond the initial mechanics. While the graphics quite nice to look at, they’ve been implemented at a sacrifice to UI cleanness and clarity; and graphical smoothness. All the units move a little sluggishly, making the game feel less fast-paced, less tense.\n\nThe UI is nothing short of clunky. You can’t give a unit a move order while in the every-other-order dial, which requires a button to bring up and close. Space bar opens the turn predictor and closes while pause, fast forward and back have different keys again. The UI is clearly designed for the PS Vita touchscreen which doesn’t translate well to the PC.\n\nFrozen Synapse Prime’s single player is pretty poor. The strength in the series is ultimately in its multiplayer. While adding an extra game mode and revamping the old ones, FSP wholly fails because of its multiplayer. Not that it’s doing anything too wrong, but more because there are just not enough players. FSP hasn’t got a large enough player-base to keep new players in the game. I played several matches against some European players (European a guess from their names), but most matches were never continued once the other player decided they were going to lose, a bit of a killjoy. I booted the game yesterday and there was only one player online… me, and zero matches waiting to be started.\n\nI’m hoping I’m just a victim of the right game, wrong console. I imagine the game would actually be a lot smoother on the PS3 and PS Vita with more players online. Otherwise, despite the graphical upgrade, Frozen Synapse Prime isn’t really worth it, unless you can grab a group of friends to play with.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/12/07/frozen-synapse-prime/","December 6, 2014","false","7.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Not so very PRIME...\n\nOverall:\nSo far, I am disappointed. It is missing features from the previous game and there is not enough features to recommend for those who are fans or just getting into the game. Ultimately, it is a lazy port from PS Vita.\n\n\nGamplay:\nStill the same great gameplay from the excellent previous game Frozen Synapse (without prime), but they slowed it down. They made the "play button" in a different menu and place the commands on the top-right side screen when it is opened. When I want to adjust something, it is really annoying to close that separate menu and then open back to see if it works or not.\n\nIn the previous game, all the buttons are layed out on screen and the commands menu are located where you right-click. That was perfect!\n\nGraphics:\nIt does not look good. To me, it looks a low resolution game.\n\nThe art style looks good but I prefer the previous game. But that is my opinion.\n\nSounds and Music:\nStill the same from the previous game.

The only improvement this game offers over the original is the level and unit skins which to be honest are not that impressive.\n\nThe campaign is alright if you enjoy playing against bots but I think most of us will get this game for the multiplayer. Up to now finding matches is difficult but I always manage to have 2 or 3 going at a time so it's manageable, just not a great selection out there.\n\nThe units seem to have changed around a bit which is taking some serious getting used to along with the changes to the UI but once you get the hang of it the UI is manageable. I would say this is worth picking up for about 5euro and no more unless they do some work on it.","December 10, 2014","false","7.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Turn Based means, "You Go" then "I go" method of back and forth. While that looks different in a lot of TBS.\n\nYeah you get your turn, but you plan out your turn, and then you start the turn, and both sides play out Simultaneously.\n\nSecondly, very early in the game, maybe the first mission, or the second mission. I've got my guys in good positions to ambush the enemy as they come down. Then suddenly.... the room where my guys were in simply explodes, killing everyone including the VIP I was supposed to be protecting. While it might of been a plot event, their was to my knowledge no advance warning, to suggest a room was going to explode, and if their was, their was no way of knowing which room would explode.\n\nHow am I suppose to plan out moves.... when rooms can explode, without simply playing the same mission over and over and over, and memorize all the stupid events that happen.... this room will explode on turn ... x... etc.\n\nMaybe I missed something, and perhaps I should of read more of the game description than other peoples reviews.

I wouldn't call it watered down, but rather stripped to the bare necessities; you have a team of units (RPGs, snipers, etc) who need to escort a package, protect civilians, or just straight-out eliminate the opposition. You tell them where to move, where to look, how quickly to do so. Great graphics along with intricate gameplay make a really enjoyable experience. Adding to its atmosphere is a cool, subtle feature that increases or decreases your volume output accordingly as you zoom in or out with the view.","May 23, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If so Frozen Synapse Prime is the game you want to try.\n\nImage a world where you command mindless soldiers that do -Exactly- what you tell them to do.\nWalk forward to a doorway, quickly sweep in front of it, now check behind you to make sure no one is there, quickly step out the door, duck behind this cover and keep moving.\n\nForget to check somewhere or plan for something, a detail left unaccounted for, that troop might die. A lot of Frozen Synapse is just spent in between turns going over and over that single turns plan, trying to account for every possible scenario and picking the best one. It sounds tedious and maybe it is to some extent but when you get a full map all quickly and efficiently doing what you told them to do and it works even better than you planned, its an amazing feeling. That feeling of knowing you used your brain and got the best possible outcome because of it is what makes this game good.\n\nFrozen Synapse Prime is a remake, sure, but its done well. Graphics are actually good now compared to the original, SFX, game balancing and a few other changes to make the story a shorter and more enjoyable experience. The first one had gameplay at its heart but several things kept me from really enjoying it. This version, Prime, takes care of those and is the gem that the developers truly intended.","May 16, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess it is an okay game, I didn't play too much yet, but I will admit they did do changes and they did fix crashes, so for now yes I will recommend it.\n\nI left the original review below as it still has some merit.\n\nOriginal Review:\n"At this moment it is a bad port. (30 minutes of trouble)\n\nIt basically is the previous game with a graphics update, except that:\n\nCons\n- It has crashed multiple times while doing basic actions (like moving a unit)\n- I still haven't found the option to play with a friend.\n- The control scheme is considerably bad compared to the old game, everything seems to be made for a controller, which is nice, except that I don't use one for Frozen Synapse\n- Coop is nonexistent (this was DLC in the first game)\n- The menus are a bit confusing (same with the original game)\n\nPros\n- Fancy graphics\n- Fancy kill cams\n\nOverall it is barely an upgrade, if you want to play Frozen Synapse I advise playing the original, the controls are more smooth and it is crashes a lot less."","November 14, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","11"

Overall I've enjoyed the single player mode, but have yet to get very far in the campaign, or participate in multiplayer yet.\n\nThe reason for many of the bad reviews that I see is because the difference between Frozen Synapse and Frozen Synapse Prime isn't really much.
