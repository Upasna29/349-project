This isn't a bad game for it's low price point. I would never replay this though.\n\nThis hidden object game drew me in with it's Halloween-themed story. At first it starts as a basic haunted house story and then it turns into Jumanji junior in a sense. The entire plot revolves around your friends being trapped in a board game and the ghosts of the game's last victims haunting the farm. They send you on a bunch of fetch quests, so only a fraction of the game is about finding hidden objects. I managed to finish the game in around 6 hours, so that's not bad for the $4 or so I spent for this on sale, but I also lost interest about two-thirds of the way through. I stopped reading the diary pages, for example.\n\nThe fetch quests were grinding on me. Some of the objects in the hidden object scenes didn't look anything like I would ever imagine them to look like. Some of the puzzles didn't have clear directions and if you hit the "?" to get an explanation, it focused more on telling you how to beat it than explaining the objective. Some of the later puzzles are very generic like they ran out of ideas near the end. For example, two of the last puzzles are a Sudoku puzzle and a sliding tile puzzle.\n\nThere are some good animations that might look like a puppet show starring silhouettes, but the simple visual style had its charm. The voice acting over them is pretty bad. Early in the game, there are a few animations with higher production value. The graphics are nice for a hidden object game, though those animations are a bit hazy. Maybe they just didn't like the HD resolution.\n\nEach location is interesting enough and works with the Halloween theme for the most part.\n\nThe developers made this game very easy to complete. Can't find a hidden object? Use a hint. Can't solve a puzzle? Skip it. Not sure where to go next? Just look at the map. It shows you. It'll be hard to get frustrated with the game when it provides you so many bypasses.","December 21, 2013","false","6.1"," 51 of 60 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","51","60","0","0"

Those new to mystery games will find themselves hitting the hint button alot, though the game is friendly to new players since any puzzle can be skipped or the hint button can be hit if stuck.  Cant get lost because there is a map highlighting where an object of importance is to continue the story.\n\nThe Hidden Object Puzzles can be very difficult, there are things that can be moved on screen in the puzzles, meaning you just need to click everything to see what moves if there is an item behind it since there is no cursor change.  Due to the games age many objects are difficult to spot due to them being very small or the detail is so low they cant be clearly seen.  During puzzles it may ask to find a heart, or a knife, but there will be tons of hearts or knives meaning finding some arbitrary one.  Other times objects are just named wrong such as saying "darts" but there are none instead there is a dartboard you click instead.\n\nThere are not many full on Halloween games on steam so this is worth trick or treating it up.\nRating:  7/10  Value:  $2.99","October 8, 2014","true","6.5"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","2"

While Dylan is taking a phone call from her concerned mother all her friends are sucked in the Jumanji-like game board.  (I personally do not think Miss Disgruntled (Dylan's girlfriend, Samantha) actually realized the game board was haunted by the ghosts of a previous tragedy.  The "haunted" gameboard simply recognized similiar natures, and history repeats.)  Simple enough storyline.\nNOTE:  I really like the opening where the car headlights light up the pumpkin from behind before the car is seen and drives past.\nNOTE 2 - Safety announcment: Please do not talk on your cell phone while driving even if it is your mom calling.\n\nOf all the reviews I read, good and bad, after I played the game I only have this to say: This is an old school Hidden Object game.  This is how they all used to be when actual storylines were first being introduced and being refined.  The games centered on the Hidden Object scenes, with the occassional pick up of inventory items to be used later or to solve some puzzle.  The games were not as strictly linear as they are now, but had a more "open world" feel with "bottle necks".  The games were also not nearly as "hand-holding" as they are now.  The gamer had to think and OMG guess about what had to done, plus click everywhere.  Yes it was and is annoying and frustrating but that is partly what made the game challenging, out thinking the game/developers.\n\nBeing a fool for old school this was a really refreshing game for me to play.  Very different puzzles and needing a completely different mind set compared to more recent and HD graphic "hand-holding" games of today.  One of the complaints centered on the half-completed objects in the hidden object scenes.  Well all I can say to that is you got what you clicked (Do remember this game was made before 3D was standard, so the objects were drawn in, not overlayed.)\n\nThe actual puzzles of this game include suduko, logic, slide, matching, "minesweeper" among many other types.  This game includes a vast and usually unseen variety of puzzles compared to the color, sound, and match fare of today.  So no crying about how hard the puzzles are, expand your repertorie.\n\nIf you want a challenging game and are bored with the standard fare of today, try yesteryear (in game time 2 years is like 2 centuries).  This game overall is quite challenging.  No penalties for hints which I had almost forgotten about being so used to today's games where there are penalties for hints, map use, and misclicks.  Hints were standard fare in old school and the gamer was expected to use the hint button... a lot, as well as be click "happy".  Guides and YouTube did not exist then like they do now.\n\nOld school games did not have (or require) achievements, in-game or later the all important steam achievements.  They especially did not require trading cards to even be considered playable.  So if as a gamer one is looking for those things, this game has none of that.  So welcome to the adult version of "Highlights" and enjoy what made the games of today what they are today.","September 5, 2015","true","9.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The CGI cutscenes are terrible. They are blurry and the animation is a bit stiff. If looks like something out of the 1990s. Normally I wouldn't be so harsh on them but this game was released in 2013. Why it has very poor animated cut scenes is beyond me. The nto confuse me even further are these completely separate cutscenes that are done with flash animation rather than CGI. It looks like as if this game was done by 2 completely different developers. It just throws you off. The voice acting is dull and emotionless like they weren't even trying. The gameplay was your standard hidden object play through. Nothing fancy. The puzzles were great as least but some puzzles were either a little too easy and some were totally cryptic. Do I recommend this game, no. Not unless you are a die hard fan of hidden object games or if it's on sale.

Why?\nThere are good things - a few. Drawings/scenes are quite nice, and there are some intresting cutscene animations (videos that resemble to the story about Death in  Harry Potter 7 ) , but after a certain point I just skipped them, as the game itself was too painful.\nThere is no voice acting to speak of.\nThere is little to no feedback about the interactive areas in Hidden Object Scenes (HOSs), this usually turns the game into a clickfest. Items hidden behind tiles of wall that looks the exact same as the other ones, but you need to find THAT one.\nQuite a few items in HOSs are not even drawn correctly - only the visible half is drawn, so when it pops out because you found it you can eyeball a nice half watering can, for example.\nAlso, click detection is strange, usually you need painfully precise clicks to your actions be registered, especially while using items between HOSs.\nThe message window - info about your surroundings, about the story - if visible for a fixed, 5 secondish time. But wait! It's not visible for 5 second until your last click on an item - it's visible from the first! The timer doesn't get refreshed when you click on an item as long as the message window is up , so you quite often end up with flashing text that's only visible for 1-2 seconds.\nAnd finally:\nHOSs sometimes have invisible items. Once I had to find a peace sign and even the hint showed a blank place where the sign *supposed to be*.\nAnd this is why I write this review now, instead of finishing the game. I think I'm at the Stables and need to find a floppy disk in the recect Hidden Object Scene, but EVEN THE HINT COULDN'T FIND IT.\nNever, ever buy this game.  I've played with bad-ish HOGs like Theatre of the Absurd - but I enjoyed it all along. On the other hand in the case of Shadows: Price for Our Sins I only struggled, because of how bad and frustrating the game is at almost every point.","January 5, 2015","false","7.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

While the puzzles and hidden object parts of the game work just fine - the story is incredibly lacking. Which is saying something considering that most hidden object games have very weak stories to begin with.\n\nThe premise starts out okay. You're going to a friends party. This friend just inherited an old mansion. Starts out okay. It's after you find your friends that the story starts to fall apart. You don't really know what's happening because you step outside to take a call from your mom, but your friends decide to play a jumanji-esque board game which ends up trapping their souls. Standard stuff. But it's the 'why' they are affected by all of this, is what causes confusion.\n\nI loosely think I understand the whole plot, but it's completely dreadful and definitely not worth the price. If you insist on getting the game, please save your money and buy it on sale or in a bundle.","October 26, 2014","false","8.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I actually cared about the story for once in one of these things. While the story wasn't the best it was still interesting and had a decent catch and conclusion.  I enjoyed the silhouette cut scenes even though all the cut scenes in this game had terrible resolution. The puzzles were decent. The difficulty went up and down a lot; some puzzes I found just plain difficult, others I found the instructions baffling, and others were very simple. The Hidden Object Game parts of the game were interesting. I liked and disliked that for some of the items you had to do some other actions first. I liked it when the actions made sense like taking other items, putting them together to make the whole item. That was cool. But I did not like it when it was an arbitrary "click on this RANDOM item to get it to move so you can see the item you need hidden BEHIND it!" Why the hell would I ever have thought "oh yes, that thimble is DEFINITELY behind that hat!" The item using puzzles were decent though sometimes the reason you needed an item was pretty stupid. Like the part where your character wouldn't put her hand in a fountain because it's dirty? Hello? People's lives are at stake and you're worried about a bit of algae on your hands? Please.\n\nOverall, a decent Hidden Object, Point and Click game.","December 9, 2014","true","4.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

It’s far from being the worst hidden object title on Steam, but even further of being the best.\n\nLong version:Shadows: Price of Our Sins had a really sound idea behind it: a hidden object puzzle game featuring a ghost story about witchcraft, love, betrayal and tragedy. It’s the execution that suffers.\n\nThe game has no voiceover after the intro, so everything is told in large– and frankly, very boring– text dumps. Also, the main plot seen at the beginning pretty much disappears, and never gets a proper resolution: after solving the final puzzle, it just… stops.\nThe puzzles range from bad to above average. They are also repetitive, with an uncomforting emphasis on colour puzzles. Despite this it is recommended to play it on an easier difficulty, since they follow little logic: key items just turn up abruptly in the most unexpected places.\nThe graphic style fits well to the atmosphere, but it is also quite dated, which really shows in the meticulous pixel hunting of the hidden object scenes.","November 22, 2014","true","3.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

And I am afraid, that is one of the real true horrors in life.\n\nEspecially certain age groups have this trouble, regardless of gender issues. This game has a surprising Halloween story that is telling such a type of story, and it does it in a very good way. The sound is atmospheric for a horror/nightmare HOG, the graphics are just fine (actually, you can play this game through without using a hint because the graphics are quite crisp and you'll be able to find anything when you just use your eyes). The riddles though are a bit... overused, but it has some things within the story that make this game a nice waste of time.\n\nPro:Good graphics with clear HOS.Atmospheric Sounds.If you like the type of movies, where adolescend young people are the victim either in a slasher or a paranormal ghost story, you'll be loving the game.It offers some of the more outlined backdrop stories.Con:Some Riddles are overused now.Replayability as with most HOG's tends to zero.\nRecommended\nThe game actually is fun if you like movies like Paranormal Activity, or Helloween, or... well Nightmare on Elm Street...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smileyfax/recommended/260270/","smileyfax","Smileyfax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smileyfax/","1074 products in account","In this game, you play as some teenager who constantly throws away sharp objects and hammers as you investigate the mysterious disappearance of your friends from a Halloween party hosted at the most haunted house in the universe, and whether or not your immensely bitter best friend with access to mysterious occult artifacts is somehow involved.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are serviceable. Most scenes use the 'one or two items are arbitrarily hidden behind another item' mechanic, which is kind of stupid, but at least your mouse highlights whenever you hover it over such an object. One big flaw is that the list of objects only displays about half the total for that scene, and you can't 'click ahead' and clear an object if it's not on the visible portion of the list.\n\nThe puzzles are definitely the game's weakest point. Many of them are unintuitive (the fish/bathtub one springs to mind) and perhaps because of this a lot of the puzzles include a complete solution under the '?' menu, which if you find yourself reaching for it I don't know why you wouldn't just click the Skip button altogether. I also have a specific beef with the sudoku puzzle late in the game; I wanted to try and puzzle it out on my own, but turned the game off to go to sleep. When I returned to the game the next day, none of my progress had been saved. (An earlier puzzle, one of those beams of light/mirror deals, saved the positions of its lanterns even after quitting and returning, so this was a particularly boneheaded move).\n\nSometimes the 'take item to a certain location' puzzles were a bit obtuse, but fortunately the map highlights any place you can interact with given whatever items you have in your inventory. There really are a lot of locations, and as a result hidden object scenes are rarely repeated.\n\nThe plot is typical bananas revolving around a cursed board game and a bunch of dead losers whining about how they were personally responsible for sending the whole estate to Hell, despite it being out of their hands thanks to a big ol' curse. The more interesting plot, ironically, is the teen drama involving one of the protagonist's friends going bonkers enough to send the whole class to Hell, but sadly that's hardly touched upon.\n\nI wish Steam let you rate games as mediocre, but I suppose in the end I'd recommend this game. Definitely not at full price! I'd say hold out for at least 75%, or wait for it to pop up in a bundle again.\n\nOh, almost forgot: This game had an awesome cat, an awesome crow, and three awesome owls.","August 3, 2015","true","14.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

There doesn't seem to be a fix for this yet.  Along with that, in the two cutscenes I was able to see, the voice volume was inaudible.

Once you start searching for them however the game shifts away from that current day setting and you end up searching through generic old kitchens, farms and churches and solving issues of some old ghosts. The story itself is just some generic love story with black magic and stuff and never manages to properly tie together with the current day setting at the start of the game.\n\nMinigames are overall ok, hidden object scenes are solid as well. The item use in the game however feels pretty arbitary and requires far to much backtracking, which is fast thanks to the minimap, but kind of destroys the flow of the game.\n\nOverall it's not a terrible game, it just ended up being far to generic after the promising start.

The music and scenery are very nice, and at some points it's enjoyable to just sit there and kind of take it in.  The puzzles are challenging enough (the map tells you which areas are "Active", i.e. "it's possible to use an object here", however) and if you're a fan of "I Spy" type of puzzles (sit there and find all the hidden items), then you're in luck - because this game has plenty (to the point that I almost got a little tired of them).  I will say this game is pretty well put together, but does have its problems.  The voice acting was a little awkward in the beginning, but during the black and white animated "cutscenes" it was pretty good.  The story itself is pretty standard - ghosts trapped by their compliance in a curse, etc, etc.  The characters were fairly typical (and one of the ghosts was about every stereotype of a Japanese and/or Asian woman? Was that really necessary?), though most of them were likeable enough.  The story relies on a lot of outdated horror tropes - being cursed by "black magic" messing up a "Pagan Ritual" and using supposed "Voodoo Dolls".  And sometimes the search and find puzzle sections were a little ridiculous?  There was just so much stuff thrown into them, sometimes it took away from the puzzle.  At any rate, it's not a bad game, and was actually really fun at some points (The puzzles, art, scenery, and music made it likeable), but I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it.","June 22, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like most other hidden objects games these days, you can skip the puzzles; and it tells you the "Available Action" on the map, so you can advance in the game easier.\n\nAnother thing I like is that you can click on any location on the map, and you get there right away.  I also like the fact that its very fast loading too.  The graphics, story, and music are passable, no complains there.  I kind of like the way it tells the story, also you get a variety of puzzles as the story progress.\n\nThe cutscenes looks a bit grainy.  It seems like the widescreen option doesn't work for me for some odd reason, when I watch cutscenes of the game, it will go to black screen.  So I stick with their native 4:3 aspect ratio, it's alright.\n\nI encountered one problem with this game though.  One time it stops showing "Available Action" on the map. And I thought there was some bug or glitch that prevent you to advance in the game.  So I stopped playing it for a while because I don't know where to go(yeah I really rely on that " Available Action" thing on the map).  One day I just decided to give it another try, I thought that maybe it was just a minor bug that stop showing the "available action", and it was indeed that problem.\n\nAll in all, I love the fact that the game is so casual, basically you can just breeze through the game in a few hours(maybe its a turn off for some though).   I recommend it people who likes it nice and easy.","June 3, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazerniel/recommended/260270/","kazerniel","kazerniel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazerniel/","625 products in account","I have a very mixed opinion about the game.\nGraphics: The locations and characters are beautifully painted. The 3D animated scenes are pretty good for this genre, albeit a bit simplistic. Unfortunately the HO scenes are a lot lower quality than the rest of the game. I liked that there are quite many locations in the game.\n\nSounds: Excellent! Some places are really freaky because of the sound effects. Loved it.\n\nMusic: Fitting for the genre, nothing special\n\nUI: Quite user-friendly. The map is very modern and useful (though I guess old-school players would be annoyed by it, because it shows which places have available actions and players can even teleport with it.) The only minor annoyance I had is while all other pop-up/zoom-in windows close if you click out of the window, to close the board game you have to click on its icon again. Seems inconsistent.\n\nPuzzles/HO scenes: The puzzles were mostly quite easy, which I liked, but one of my main problem with the game is that the instructions were often vague and in a couple of cases incorrect. (= It told me to solve puzzle in a different way than what later turned out to be the actual solution. Minor but important errors in wording.) Also the HO scenes are very junkpile-ish with many unrelated items (and what is a takeaway food box doing in an at least 100 years ago abandoned place?) and the scenes sometimes had wrong names for objects, like calling garlic onion and such.\n\nStory: kinda BS, the whole thing is just one boring and overcomplicated deus-ex machina, with very 1 dimensional characters (perhaps the only exception is the cook). Also the game seems somewhat racist to me, with 3 token minority characters, all based on racial & gendered stereotypes. Plus one HO scene mixed Native American and Japanese elements, which seemed quite culturally appropriative.\n\nOverall: I don't know if I would recommend it, I'm really on the fence, but I picked recommend because for me it was still worth my time, even if just barely. If beautiful graphics and very good sound design make a game worth for you then go for it, but if the quality of the plot or the HO scenes are important to you or you are bothered by racist and sexist stereotypes then avoid it.","October 27, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
