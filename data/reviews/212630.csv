So when a new game was released I rolled my eyes to other, more interesting games like Spec Ops, Darkness 2, etc.\nBut then the game was so cheap in the summer sale I picked it up and... I'm shellshocked at the amounts of fun I've had with this game! In no other game I've felt so badass when clearing a whole room simultaneosly with my fellow A.I teammates...\nTalking about the graphics, they are good, not Crysis 2 amazing or anything like that, but explosions look amazing, texture quality in some places is absolutely stunning, but most of the time it's just good...\nCharacter models are great too except for face animations (lip syncing mostly) which suck!\nThe story is pretty forgettable...basically a "Ghosts" team died in an ambush and your team of Ghosts must get payback on them by dismantling this arms dealing group or whatever. Pretty basic Vendetta type of story, I never really gave a crap about it due to how forgettable it is...\nWhat steals the show here is definately the gameplay, guns feel amazing, you can mark enemies so that your teammates kill them at the same time as you (the called "Syc-Shot" which is absolutely badass!) and the game evolves all around stealth (you belong to a team of "Ghosts" after all...)\nYou have other gadgets (this is a crossover between present and future (standard guns with standard attachments but some futuristic stuff, like the invisible camo "suit") and all play a very important role in the game.\nThe game also has the best cover system I've ever seen! It's fast, responsive and flows very naturally moving from cover to cover!\nThe game features a "gunsmith" mode which is amazing! Basically you grab the guns you want to use in the mission and customize them to the most little detail. I'm losing a word limit but here goes all the stuff you can customize on a standard primary weapon:\n\n- Sights\n- Stock\n- Gas System\n- Underbarrel\n- Sidebarrel\n- Barrel\n- Camo\n- Trigger\n- Magazine\n- Barrel Tip\n\nYeah...it's THAT deep of a customization! And guess what is the best part? Every. Single. Attachment! Alters stats on the gun (accuracy, range, damage, armor penetrations, etc.), so the customization is the deepest I've ever seen in a shooter, it's not superfluous at all!\nAudio is quite amazing, every gun feels (and sounds) great, voice acting is good too! And also the weather effects (sand storms, snow storms, standard rain storms are in the game btw, levels are super varied too!).\nLike I said above, the game is AMAZINGLY varied! You have around 15 missions, most of them different from eachother, there is a rooftop level, a favela level, snow level, desert-ish level, rain forest level, sunny forest level, night levels are there too, among others, very varied, like I said!\nAnother thing about the game is the characterization of the game, the "Ghosts" are like these top specialists in the game so they are a bit isolated in the base from the other soldiers/ marines... They have their own particular corner to hang out in. Characterization is the best I've seen in an shooter is years (Yeah...). Characters sometimes approach a certain situation with a joke and most of the time works, I literally laughed out loud at their funny moments. THIS. HAPPENED. IN. A. SHOOTER! So I guess this puts every MMS (Modern Military Shooter) around to the side right? Yeah if the game was a bit more polished...\nYou will encounter some bugs and glitches, some of them game-breaking! But it doesn't take away from the experience, they aren't all that common! But I expected more polish from a AAA title from Ubisoft...\n\nIt still puts most (if not all) MMS in the "shame-on-you" corner!\n\nTo end this worship session, 9.5/10! A must have, now at 15€, pick it now! Or wait for a sale...","September 2, 2013","true","20.1"," 114 of 133 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","114","133","0","3"

There are no "waves" of baddies coming at you, no cinematic mow-downs, no angst-driven baddie that always got away. Instead, you are the the elite of the elite (cliche, I know), a special cadre of "operators", augmented with the best technology available, from CrossCom that lets you easily coordinate fire among your teammates, sync shoot that lets you designate targets for simultaneous extermination, optical camo that makes you nearly invisible... if you don't move very fast, sensor ball that picks up baddies in the area... X-ray viewer mode that picks up metal in ANY condition, even blinding sandstorm, as well as aerial and ground drones. And at the finale, you'll get access to Warhound... a mobile fire support platform that has missiles and mortars you can call in. Imagine the stealth kills you can do with the active camo... if you don't want to shoot them in the head.\n\nObviously there's always bazillion bad guys between you and your objective. And with suppressed weapons taking them out quietly is always an option... or you can go loud and just go guns blazing, but make use of cover or your teammates may not save you in time. At other times you can shoot through enemies cover, and that really makes you feel powerful.\n\nThe weapons can all be customized and there are a lot of changes possible, muzzle can be changed to different flash supressor or sound supressors. Sights can be changed from iron sight to red dot scope to 4x tactical scope and more. Magazine can be single, extended, double, or even loaded with armor piercing ammo. And so on. Every weapon is customizable, with parts that you can unlock through playing and accomplishing missions and challenges (i.e. make X kills with weapon Y, or such).\n\nThere are multiple levels of difficulty and let's just say, this game REALLY punishes you for tactical mistakes, i.e. exposing yourself when you shouldn't, picking the wrong targets, fail to flank, and so on. Though at easy levels you'll have a chance to recover, albeit unlock things much slower as well.\n\nThe graphics are very nice for a shooter, everything looks proper as they are. Jungle looks like jungle, village looks like village, and desert looks like desert. And you get to enjoy watching the operators move, crawl, lean against cover, and so on wit the third-person view, with seamless first-person if you go to scope mode.\n\nThe game is an Ubisoft product so Uplay must be installed and game activated through Uplay, but it's not overly tedious. However, it's rather annoying to have to deal with TWO platforms instead of just one.\n\nAll in all, as a shooter this game really makes you appreciate what a futuristic soldier will be like, without getting into power armor, exoskeleton, and jump gear of the further future. We have the tech to make this now... or at least in a few years, and we'll need them to solve problems developing around the world.\n\nAnd yes, I am recommending this game. But remember, I only care about the single player game. And it works fine.","May 24, 2015","true","16.3"," 96 of 112 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","96","112","8","0"

I completed the game in 11 hours, considering how much smaller most shooter games are these days (looking at you BF and COD), 11 hours is great, but I do wish it was longer than that because I really want more of that awesome gameplay..\n\nUsually the story is pretty important to me because I only play games for their SP content, but this time I forgive them for making a weak story because the gameplay was THAT good ..\n\nTotally recommend this game\n9/10","July 3, 2014","true","11.2"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","49","51","0","2"

It is the next installment in the Ghost Recon series.\n\nTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier gameplay is far more different than the previous Ghost Recon game, because Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier use third-person rather than first-person like before, but that doesn't make the game bad, in fact I think this game is great, quite epic and fun to play. My favorite feature is the Sync Shot, where all the Ghost Squad tag and then shoot at the same time on different enemies. You can also customize your weapon with many thinks like scope, camouflage pattern, stock or magazines. There is also Guerrilla Mode, it's a game mode where you get to secure an area, then hold the area against wave of enemies. Guerrilla Mode can be played with friends too.\n\nTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier graphics is good enough, the detail on the Ghost Squad are impressive, but the rest of the pictures is somewhat like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, well at least Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier has better graphics. The performance of the game is good, no lags and the game runs smooth. If you see many people complain the game doesn't work, it's not the game, it's Uplay. The game works just fine after you get through the Uplay part.\n\nTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier is good tactical shooter game, with great features, too bad the multiplayer is empty now. I recommend this.\n\nRating 8/10","November 1, 2014","true","16.8"," 72 of 93 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","72","93","4","0"

It APPEARS to be however. It wants to look professional, detailed, using a lot digital interface effects that float in 3D, but when you actually PLAY the game you'll feel something is wrong. And here is why.\n\nThis game, like many these days, does not offer challange. Does not offer depth. It's a generalized experience that exists only to serve the player, not to challange him/her. You are walking around in practically godmode, being invisible, spreading the glorious headshots, and in case anything goes wrong you have an "oh sh.....t!" button that is supposed to be "tactical command", but basicly a button to instantly kill any enemy at any time, anywhere, saying your squad members shoot them. Who are also following you under the gentle cloak of godmode invisibility. Of course the maps are very limited to guide you towards scripted wins and perfectly ideal situations, just you can feel smart you killed 3 guys at once because you marked 2 for death, and shot one yourself.\n\nThere are no tactics, there is no tension, no andenaline, no actual smart play, even if the game tries so hard to create the illusion of these for the player while all it really does it bows down before you, so you can W+M1 through it. Or actually W+F here with the "tactical command" that is God Strikes You Down instant death. Of course while your teammates continually compliment you for it and you get all kinds of "HyperSuperDuperUber skilled player you are!" stuff.\n\nVerdict? It's not only boring, but boring for all the wrong reasons. I couldn't get myself to luanch this game a second time. I feel so served, so unchallanged, so bored of walking as god among mere mortals, that it is actually deeply discouraging to even play. Because I don't play, I do zombie mode, while the game fails so hard to create this feeling of professionalism, challange and pro play, that isn't even there at all, but also fails at faking it, because it pushes too hard to the point where the obvious just starts to hurt.","May 24","false","3.7"," 111 of 163 people (68%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","68","111","163","16","13"

Absolutely! Do I recommend the game? No, not at all! Let me tell you why.\n\nThe only reason I bought this game was to play its story with my friends, being blinded by the full story co-op mode and the awesome Steam sales. Of course we had to install the infamous (and useless - you'll see why) Uplay to play the game; we started the game and tried to connect to each other in co-op, but I could not connect to neither of my friends, so I spent the next 3 hours searching for a solution... I've tried every single thing I could find, from opening every port of my router or connecting without a router to reinstalling the game and checking its files. And guess what? Nothing worked. Finally, I decided to do a fresh Windows install, which managed to fix the problem somehow, but that was a big turn off for me, as you should not reinstall your operating system just for a game... at least the game was working now. Everything went smooth after that, until I had to do another fresh Windows install, when I forgot to save my progress, being so sure that Uplay's cloud save feature would take care of that... boy, I was so wrong! Neither Steam, nor Uplay could save my progress, even though it is mentioned that cloud save is enabled on this game on the latter, so my whole progress was lost (this was also confirmed by one of my friends, who lost his progress too). Luckly, we only had to replay one mission, as the career progress is saved on each player's computer, but we had to change characters because I had been the host before.\n\nAlso, I have to mention that the game is a rushed PC port, a great example being the low frame rate, even on lower settings and the console button that is permanently present on the HUD without having a controller connected, but by no means the worst port ever. The story has nothing outstanding attached to it, so don't expect much if you intend on playing this game alone - what you shoud expect instead is a typical military shooter plot (don't get me wrong! it is not bad... but it is not the most intriguing one either).\n\nHowever, I have to admit that this is a fun game to play with friends because of its tactical and team-based approach, with pretty good graphics, lots and lots of customization options and challenging AI on higher difficulties. Also, the campaign is long enough to justify its price, with no major glitches regarding the gameplay or technical problems, with the exception of those mentioned earlier. Consider buying only if you are aware that this game's co-op mode/multiplayer may or may not work on your system (as a last resort, a fresh Windows install may likely fix the problem).\n\nIn conclusion, this is good game, if not a great one, but the connection and the cloud save problems made me go for a negative review because of the time I lost searching for a solution.","June 26, 2015","false","24.3"," 115 of 177 people (65%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","65","115","177","35","9"

As the title says it's Future Soldier, a TPS game, that in my opinion really sets the mood for a future warfare environment, yet in a somewhat* realistic way (*in all fairness, a game must have it's limits), i tried multiple other games on way way here though, some good ones, (like Binary Domain) and some not so much. Not mentioning any names here, right Takedown: Red Sabre and Global Ops: Commando Libya? :P anyways, Future soldier implements a lot of new cool stuff,  and whatnots,\n\nAs one of the first shooter games I've been playing in a while, it doesn't feel like the AI is completely dumb. As a matter of a fact, I've had to lower my difficulty settings to veteran, (medium) in order to keep up and not die more than a once or twice during a mission, (tried elite (hard) for a short while, it was duable, but given i was stuck with my laptop at the moment, and you know, lags, i had to turn down the difficulty) but even with difficulty turned down, they got me a few times http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231409917\nwhen starting a campaign you have 2 options, you can either invite your friends, and actually play with them, or you can let three friendly AIs take that job, and suprisingly enough, they're quite clever too, and heck, with me at their command, we're like a 4 man army! then again, we do get some help from the navy now and again. Your teammates are easy control and work with, and did i mention, great for syncronize-killing.\n\nthis game often has 2 ways to get the job done, there's the way of rushing in and shooting everyone on sight, it's like meh[imgur.com], and there's the stealth way, and of course i prefer the stealth way, who wouldn't? it has alot more tactics to it, besides, i'm not in the same rush of finishing games as most of you guys with bigger backlogs. (however some missions you're required to do it one way)\n\nas a new way to improve stealth killing as we know it, one of the many new cool features in this futuristic warfare game, is a new suit, improving both stealth, mobility and badassitude with the powers of an extreme camouflage, making you close to invisble, as long as you keep your head down and don't move too fast.\n\njust to show how much they've actually ellaborated this costumization feature, here's a list of things you can costumize with your primary weapon:\n\nsights\nstock\ngas system\nbarrel, underbarrel, barrel tip (and sidebarrel too i think)\ntrigger\nmagazine\ncamouflage\n\n\nas with any game, no matter how well designed and how much they thought it through, it has it's occasional flaws, such as floating people http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231410291\noh and when you catch it off guard, and walk somewhere you're not supposed to (husky style) it tends to drop you out of the world,\n\nthe graphic quality in this game is quite good, even at the lowest settings. It gives a good feelings while playing, and it's simply a nice aspect to have.\n\nbut now, for the thing letting this game down (when using steam atleast) is, -well i guess it's not as much for the game itself, but launching it from steam,- the fact that it has to open uplay first, and then launch the game. But then again that's the problem with buying some 3rd party games on steam, and really i can live with that.\n\nI have yet to try out the co-op part of this game, but I am certainly looking forward to it.\n\ni haven't finished the game yet, but this is what i can tell you about the storyline:\nyou start up as part of a four-man Ghost Team deployed in Nicaragua, with the objective to disrupt weapons traffickers, 5 minutes into the game, after being introduced to the controls, and killing the first few men, the team starts an inspection of the convoy vehicles, and to their suprise they discover a bomb, which well unluckly for them, goes off, Bum!, it ends up killing the entire team. another Ghost team is set on the job to investigating the cause and tracking down the source of the bomb. The team is informed about their new mission to rescue an arms dealer who has information about the bomb. After the team rescues him, they then based on the given information, take off to Zambia where they kill a local warlord -and a few dozens of men-, then you continue to Nigeria, Pakistan, Norway, and end up in Russia, where the team destroys a weapons shipment at an airport. this is where i've gotten so far but i will update this as i progress\n\nsorry for the review quality, was really tired when i made this, but i wanted to get it done by the 28th,\n\nthis review has been kitten approved[imgur.com]","February 28, 2014","true","27.0"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","1"

The cons though would be: pretty frequent intermissions, lack of checkpoints and forced cutscenes (if someone dies, you gotta watch the entire cutscene again and again until you get to another checkpoint). It is not your average third person cover-based shooter at all, this game requires a more subtle approach when it comes to taking targets down. Also gotta mention that the stealth system is great and allows you to ghost through missions without shooting and it's satisfactory as well.

Mind you, I've only played the coop part of the game with a friend, which, for me, is much more enjoyable then playing alone. The game has nice graphics, easy to use controls, most of the time, and I love the music, which is rare for me. Some cons for me are the frustrations of moving about when coming out of cover or going into cover and moving elsewhere. Another is not having the ability to change keybinds while playing coop campaign, you have to quit the session to main menu to do that. Oh, and it's Uplay lol. Other then that, I enjoy the game and I recommend it to all Tom Clancy fans.","July 21, 2015","true","35.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","23","31","4","10"

Result at the bottom with a total rating of 7/10.\n\nPlot  - 6/10\nOne very nice thing about the plot is, that you will be fighting all around the world (Africa, Middle East, Asia, etc.), which prompts variety created by very distinct level design (see "Game world"). The sad thing is, that  again the Russians are the bad guys , which seems to be the standard in today's games featuring a militarized America. Because of this uninspired idea, regardless of the rest of the plot, I can only give 6/10 here.\n\nWeaponry  - 8/10\nWhen you are about to start your mission you can always choose your loadout. This might sound generic, but you are actually able to modify your weapon right down to the barrel to improve your weapon management or fire power. Unfortunately, you have to unlock many camo patterns and attachments with ridiculous challenges for which I found no way to read what the challenge actually is.\nIn the battlefield there is a huge amount of different weapons and gadgets, one of which is the drone. I am meantioning it, because it is - in my opinion - your most powerful tool in the field. Of course there is much more to it:  xray and thermo vision, artillery strikes, several types of grenades, a vast amount of guns and so on.\n\nGame world  - 9/10\nEven though textures are blurry and messy from time to time (especially on trees or walls) player and weapon models look stunning. Also, the level design is great. You do not feel like following a rather linear path to the goal of your mission, since levels seem to be pretty open and intertwined. This effect is intensified by the fact that you are travelling around the world visiting different and nicely designed places on Earth in an individual fashion as meantioned above. All this and fitting environmental sound effects lead to an atmospheric experience - well, if you do not count weird sound loops e.g. of screaming people which have been expelled from their homes and aren't even there anymore, but the sound is.\n\nCombat  - 7/10\nNow this was hard to rate, since the main aspect of the game is stealth and action driven combat combined. The stealth parts are great,  when you have to sneak into compounds, restricted areas or even airports,  although you do it over and over again. It does not feel repetetive, because there is always something going on (different level design, tanks incoming, sniper assault, different placement of enemies and so on). This is usually followed by quite the opposite of stealth.  Shoot your way out, either protecting only your three mates or even VIPs  to reach designated extraction points.\nA very negative impact on the gameplay are the many, many mini cutscenes. For example, when your team needs to rally up around doors or just to regroup, you always have to wait what feels like for ever! This takes you out of the moment completely and does not deliver - as I suspect it was intended - a moment where you can catch your breath. You actually do not need to calm down and pause, since there are no waves and waves of enemies enclosing on you like in other games (e.g. COD). When the action strikes, enemies can be killed rather quickly. So do armed forces.\n\nLoading times and videos  - 3/10\nYes, this is actually where the score drops significantly. Loading times are too damn long. When you start the game, you have to skip three videos and in the process, need to click "any key" twice to get to the menu. Every menu itself does need to load for more than three seconds, which is unacceptable. When you continue/enter the campaign, the loading takes far too long for a game not looking that great (it is decent, as I said above, but it will not make you go "WOW!"). Also, in any case you need to restart from a checkpoint, you will get the intro screen a la COD (location, time, mission name) displayed, which adds five additional seconds to your waiting time - after waiting for the checkpoint to load for roughly ten seconds. I am absolutely sure, that my system is not at fault, since I can play the game on maximum settings everywhere without troubles. This might be credited to bad scripting, I suppose.\nVideos are there. Well, that is a fact. Not a fun one, since videos mostly don't further the story and are highly similar to Call of Duty Modern Warfare intermission sequences: You see the world and get to know what's happening from a satellites perspective. This is just a copy, to say it bluntly. Videos where you see the protagonists, do not really affect you in any way. There is shallow dialogue, bullsh*t propaganda and testosterone driven antagonizations and you do not really start to care about the characters. The videos and waiting times, of course, significantly make the game longer.\n\nMy result  - 7/10\n\nI've never been much of a fan of Tom Clancy's games, but this one really grabbed and stuck me where the action is. Although the story is blunt and I do not care about the characters, it is a decent tactic shooter with many levels of operation and variety. I'd like to recommend this game to anyone who loves tactical FPS where you are in control of how to accomplish your goal. Nevertheless, this game is very special in light of how you play it - you have to like this kind of tactical gameplay. Hope I could shed light on this ;)","October 26, 2015","true","9.1"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","25","35","5","0"

Unfortunately, Ubisoft has proven once more to care very little for their PC fan base by releasing a game so riddled with bugs, that a huge portion of the player base cannot even play the game, which is just an example of blatant laziness on the part of the developers.\n\nNo matter that it is based on an extremely successful franchise and could otherwise be a brilliant game, using the controls is unbearable, let alone all of the left over icons from the Xbox version, inclusion of mouse acceleration and the lack of any real customisation menus. This makes it difficult to want to be able to progress through the game regardless of how good the story or multi-player could be.\n\nThe developers tried their hardest to make it seem like this game is not on rails, but it is. You have operational freedom when you’re in designated combat areas but always have to follow their lead. When you’re in camouflage, you may never run for extended periods without losing the use of the camouflage, however, your team mates may run, gun and dance while their camouflage is still active and stays active. Furthermore, your team mates are either super heroes or idiots, either spotting and killing adversaries before you ever do so, or standing around like idiots while you’re bleeding out at their feet. The ability to customise your weapons is a stand-out feature; however it fails to carry the game.\n\nWhile it looks pretty and sounds good, it doesn’t make the game; playability and usability do. You’d be glad if you got this game for free, or if you must have it, wait for it to reach the bargain bin.","December 17, 2015","true","40.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

Well because of the Coop! You just need a buddy to play with since there's no public quick game on Coop Campaign and no Local Coop either. Steam/UPlay friends required ;)\n\nWhy? I just love the way it is. It's the second copy I have. I have one on uPlay but just want a copy on Steam so me and my brother can play it together too.\n\nI was playing this on my uPlay version account with my classic mobile laptop.\nCorei7 2670QM 2.2ghz-3.1ghz\n2gb GeForce 540M\n8GB DDR3 RAM\nI get roughly ~30 FPS with 720p reso. It's good! But now I'm playing it all over again on 970M gpu at 1080p reso, and still rocks even more better.\n\nPROS- Coop campaign(up to 4)\n- Long Campaign (depends how good you're and difficulty!)\n- You get to play on too many different locations and environments from artic, dessert, wetlands, jungle, airport, town, etc...\n- +1 on Raven Strike DLC Campaign mode\n- Sync shot\n- Guerilla Mode (Coop/Solo)\n- Epic Weapon customization style(Gunsmith). I just like the way they implemented it. The customization is deep.\n- Firing Range to test all your weapon customization.\n- Multiplayer mayhem a blast! It's really fun (The bad part is when there's hackers. overpowered pro players where you need to get them first or else you're dead.)\n- Multiplayer Progression up to Level 50 and gain unlocks for addtional gadgets, weapon, customization for each classes. +20 more levels if you have the 2 DLCs\n\nCONS- No Local Coop, You need Steam/uPlay friends to play with.\n- Multiplayer though is connection problem like disconnected from server. Rarely happens now but was a big problem during at launch up to it few months after. Depends on who is hosting anyway so can't be blame if the host have slow connection and way too far you and everyone else playing on the same game. To be honest this mode drives me crazy when your team suck and when there's stazers and hacker freak then makes me rage quit before despite the fun. So as there like any other game, those called cheaters using speedhacks and aimbots.\n- Multiplayer hacking, cheating, spawn killing and everything. Really it's no fun even if you play on their side when you know already the outcome. It's bullying multiplayer as it happens. AVOID! But if you're like them then this is best and perfect for you all, cheater's pool!\n- UPlay I guess, not a problem for me at all but there are those whiners who add it as a problem so I add it here. Lol\n- No one plays the DLC Mulplayer Maps on public! Lol\n\nNOTE & TIPS: - Play and complete the campaign first. Jumping straight to multiplayer is silly for a noob. Complete campaign unlocks lots of addtional advantage for Multiplayer.\n- If you own the DLCs or Season Pass be sure to set the multiplayer settings to BATTLE when using Quick Game. Never set it to the default selection ALL or else you find zero game at all! If you do not own the DLC then it's not a problem\n- Try no to leave the lobby when there's few. Give it sometime until it get enough players. New players tends to go in and out that preventing the lobby from getting enough players. Be patient and wait!\n- If you want the DLCs just get a discounted Season Pass if it goes on sale. Otherwise just get the Raven Strike DLC it is the only DLC for campaign mode and the other two are just for multiplayer which adds +10levels each + maps that no one plays.\n- Connection problem relates to your system Firewall so don't for get to add this game to exclusion or allow all conncetion on MS Firewall and Anti-Virus Suite( with Firewall ). If other's can play it fine then ask yourself why you cannot before blaming it elsewhere.\n- Cheater's pool check source: http://future-soldier-alive.enjin.com/forum/m/30142094/viewthread/20896388-hackercheater-list.\nNo one likes playing with cheaters. On GRFS there are also cheaters. They keep this game alive! If you're new then you're their best choice for kill on sight.\nSee source link. If you find them as you play GRFS Multiplayer and you noticed they play way differently then check their names on the source link.\n\nMY RATING: 9 / 10 - Highly Recommended if you just wanna have fun.","June 13, 2015","true","42.7"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","30","47","2","6"

You play as a group special ops guys doing some secret mission stuff and being “future” soldiers you get a lot of tech stuff like magnetic vision and sensor grenades for making enemies appear on your HUD even behind cover. Camo that is incredibly useful for being stealthy. You also get a drone for marking enemies and an EMP to disable electronics.\n\nThe gunplay feels good. Its fun and enjoyable, you get to do a lot of cool slow motion breaches into hostage rooms. Its a blockbuster title; meaning lots of explosions and pretty looking environments. But more or less is a tad shallow in gameplay mechanics.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nI noticed a lot of other reviews saying the mutliplayer is bugged. I did not try any of the co-op of the main campaign so I cannot speak to that aspect. But I did try the Guerrilla wave based mode and the regular objective based mulitplayer. I was able to connect and it worked just fine, it seemed again, very run of the mill.\n\nThe AI of your teammates in the campaign is okay, the only real complaint I have is they seem to really enjoy walking in between your gun and the people you are shooting. You can set up sync shots up to 4 people at a time. That also feels very satisfying. Coordinating 4 headshots at once indeed makes you feel like a proper special ops team. I imagine even more so playing with friends during the campaign.\n\nThe game does seem to be a console port; meaning limited graphical options and unfortunate poor optimization and having VERY deep frame drops that last about 2 to 3 seconds while the next area loads. But it never really gets in the way too much as there are never any enemies that need immediate attention after a load.\n\nTHE GIST\nIt's an enjoyable experience. Very run of the mill. I'm very meh about it overall but I did indeed enjoy the time I spent.","June 3","true","8.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

You control your character and at the same time you direct your teammates to carryout certain orders; Ghost Recon: Future Soldier employs those same game play characteristics. Ubisolf utilized an action based/stealth approach to Future Solider, requiring one to stealth around a location, identify targets, sync those targets, and get out undetected.  On several of the missions, stealth is a requirement.  This aspect of the game is where people tend to have issues.  Future Solider is more of an action based game rather than a stealthy game; in a sense, it can go both ways (like Hitman Absolution, Dishonored, Assassins Creed, etc).  However, you are rewarded more by taking a stealthy approach; high scores, items unlocked quicker, etc.  In comparison to majority of other Tom Clancy games, OG Rainbow 6, Rainbow 6 III, Vegas 1 & 2, and the original Ghost Recon, teammate control seems to be at a minimum.  The only real control you have over your teammate is to set up sync shots and have them focus a target, you cannot send them to a location, you cannot have them set up a frag run, they cannot breach and clear, etc.  Overall, I liked Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, as an action based 3rd person shooter it was fun, as a stealth game it wasn't half bad, and remember...the game can be played both ways, as a stealthy inflitration game or as a Rambo game...it is your pick.\n\n****Note: You have to download Ubisoft's platform Ubiplay to be able to play Ghost Recon: Future Soldier.  It only requires you to download it, install it, and login when you play.

Its exactly what a Ghost Recon game should be.\n\nPROS:\n- Action is intense. There will be lots of firefights (shootouts) and explosions.\n- The graphics are still very good.\n- The weapons are sleek and cool.\n- The story is well-written.\n\nCONS:\n- Sometimes, enemies are stupid. You can pass by them even though they should definitely see you.\n- Sometimes, you cannot improvise. For example, if you are spotted during some missions, you automatically fail. In the real world, you adapt and overcome.\n\nI give this game an 8/10.

Here you've got  some characters from the past Ghost Recon's series but with a brand new team of Ghosts. It's a fun game to play alone but mostly with friends on co-op, they added a new game mode Guerrila where u and your friends have to defeat wave enemies. Multiplayer it's fun and tactical, I personally found every time online matches, but it has some problems that need to be fixed. Another problem it's with aspect ration at 19:9 monitors where 2 black borders appear on the top and bottom of the screen. But all in the end seems to get us a different gameplay from others shooters as Ubisoft know how to do it.

My first two hours in this game was basically spamming "OMIGOSH" to all my friends because I had never seen something as amazing as this.\n\nBeautiful gunplay, really advanced customization menu for guns (though you should just listen to your benevolent overlord who recommends everything for you before the mission), there's so much you can do in combat, from super-stealth to Sync shots, to infiltration (slow-mo retro style shooting included), prioritization of targets during normal combat, marking out targets with airborne devices such as drones, etc.\n\nYou also have X-Ray vision and sensor grenades (which are pointless once you have X-Ray vision). Your team is equipped with extremely futuristic weapons, gear and outfits (you actually wear a Chameleon camo that changes your color according to the surrounding, making you nearly undetectable). The cover system while firing is extremely impressive.\n\nThe main missions are co-ordinated and always point you in the right direction, so you don't have to worry about wandering off into the deep forests of nothingness.\n\nConclusively, amazing game, totally worth it, definitely something I'd play repeatedly, however, there is a small issue. This game does not run from Steam independently. Lauching it actually lauches uPlay (the Ubisoft content delivery client) which requires you to register/sign in and then use the CD-Key provided by Steam to activate the game. However, this is only initial and you can launch the game normally after that.\n\nToo long, didn't read: Buy it.

My machine isnt a power house, but Ive had newer games running on 60+ plus frames with no issue. Here, I was dropping to 30 or below, but this is easily fixed by just turning DX 11  mode off.\n\nThe game itself is a fun experience, personally I played it single player, but I can imagine with 4 player co-op its a lot better. Its refreshing to have a game like this that is mostly built around Stealth, and avoiding open fire fights is very rewarding. Just like other Tom Clancy titles, your not a bullet sponge, so to have this built around sneaking is a lot of fun. Throw in some near future gadgets, camo tech and some gun customisation and you have a well built campaign to play through\n.\nIf your playing alone, the companion AI is perfectly adequate, and being able to direct them (although in a limited copacity) certainly made the stealth elements and open fire fight very enjoyable. The AI was very rarely killed, and always came to my aid when I needed reviving.\n\nWith the exception of the DX11 performance, my only main gripe is the story. It feels very throw away, and you dont particually care about why your doing what your doing. This understable, as the game is obviously a showcase of the (sometimes a bit too scripted) missions, rather than the main plot (why have Tom Clancys name attached at all then?).\nThere will be those that will grumble about Uplay, but personally it never caused me any issues when playing.\n\nRecommended, and worth the money","April 3","true","12.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Also we can't set any option, be it graphical, control or game once you're in-game, a typical console game design)\n\nBut why I recommend this game? Once you adapt and get comfortable with the 'dont' above, you'll get this:\nAction-Co Op Campaign Sequence (the game is made for playing co op, though it is still playable for SP, it have mediocre campaign story, but glorified with action packed sequence throughout the mission. Its no Michael Bay action, but a realistic approach to Tom Clancy's Elite Ghost Recon squad action)\nGuerilla Co Op Gamemode (a solo or 4 player co op, survival based game, where the player must hold of for enemy waves, complimented with periodically stealth wave, wave streak that will help you survive and assault waves, and cover-and-gun-run action, where you must take cover to stay alive in combat or risk getting downed and a teammate must risk himself to get you back up again)\nGood & Balanced Multiplayer (a beginner can learn slowly while still getting a rational K/D ratio, while the veteran will be challenged to do the game with squad teamwork, and objective driven game. There's much option for gamemode, but each are also equipped with side objectives that when done successfully, gives scores to squad and team)\nArsenal of Modding (modify your arsenal to match your game style, a rush assault will equip LMG with mod to increase damage, a tactical soldier? use gun with mod to increase control and manueverability. Stealth Warrior will bring their sniper rifle complete with PDR with suppressor, control mod, and increaseing power mod)\n\nAll in all, its a decent and good game.\nIf you cant afford on it's normal price, then wait for sale and grab it when the discount is over 50%\nAs a shooter gamer, i never regret the decision to buy this game.","April 14, 2014","true","9.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The story is decent, but it doesn't drag on for too long. The ability to customise your weapons is nice, and cloaking is a very handy feature to have - especially when you do not have cover to hide behind. Your character will tend to run to cover after you've run out of cover, which is one of the most annoying things about the game, although the controls are solid. Graphics stand up well, without being mind blowing. Playing the campaign in co-op is recommended, however I played the story by myself and still had a blast.\n\nDefinitely should be played for the experience, even more so if it is relatively cheap during a sale.","February 10, 2014","true","15.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game definitely has flaws, but the shootouts and gun play are quite satisfying.\nPros:\nAwesome weapons/ weapon customization (like really awesome)\nInteresting visual style (all my opinion) with a cool hud\ncombat mechanics are top notch (sync shot etc.)\ncontrols are tight and responsive, competent cover system\nLengthy campaign + challenges + multiplayer + survival = plenty of gameplay\nSound design and combat atmosphere both solid\ncompetent survival mode, cannot use custom weps :(\nIn game animations and soldier models are quite good. Satisfying movement through the enviorment.\n\nCons:\nJumbled, confusing, and unoriginal story\nBoring characters lead to minimal emotional investment\nsometimes the visual style chan be overwhelming (there are often multiple semi transparent series of lines and overlays cluttering up the screen during mission briefings,\nStealth system is of little value\nSlows a little towards the end\nMandatory stealth bits are pretty obnoxious, fortunately there are few.\nCutscenes and human models in said cutscenes are bad. A lot of deformed faces and body types.\n\nOVERALL: I'd probably give it an 8/10 and would recomend it to anyone who enjoys a good bit of 3rd person combat. Combat mechanics are really good, and the firefights are well paced and exciting. The story on the other hand is not.\nTheres a lot of fun shooting to be had here, just don't expect shakespeare.\n\n****ignore the amount of time it says I have played the game, I own it on the xbox 360.

I expected the gimmicky gadgets to be ignorable like they are in most games like this, but the drone you get was actually really cool and changed the way I played teh game more than I anticipated. Overall, it's like Rainbow Six + Ubertech gadgets, so if you're into tactical squad based shooters, it should be entertaining enough. I felt it strayed too far into action-movie-logic a bit during some of the missions (The last sequence especially was extremely over the edge - apparently walking in a diamond formation in an open field makes you immune to millions of bullets!), but most of the missions were more of the tactical speed I was hoping for.","February 10, 2014","true","17.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I tried so, so hard to like it, even after how bad the GRAW titles were, but I cannot in good conscience allow this crime against video gamers to continue to leach our money away in return for a half-baked ball of frustration like this. Please, Ubisoft, either allow Red Storm the freedom to go back to the design, concepts and unique vision that made the original such a genre-defining, amazing experience that we all still play 12 years after its release, or let it die with some damn dignity, rather than continue running it into the ground this way.","February 7, 2014","false","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To begin with the visuals are excellent and the voice acting, gun sounds etc are top drawer as always. Most shooters these days push on the whole action element, i.e your in an over the top situation and you take on armies of soldiers in hollywood blockbuster style action sequences, Ghost Recon Future Soldier plays exactly the way it should, your an elite group of soldiers nicknamed ghosts because people don't know they really exist and the game wants you to play that way. Your presented with a situation which you can imagine spec oips soldiers being in, outnumbered (but not drastically) you have the option of stealth and team work, scout enemy patrol paths and potisions and take them out quietly as a team or you can still go in all guns blazing and spray everyone to pieces, i found myself doing that occasionally. But my favourite part of the game is the uav drone, so many times i found myself lasering enemy soldiers and just allowing my team mates to pick up the kills, it allows a whole new approach and gameplay option to the modern (if not slightly futuristic) shooter. If you like the all out guns plazing action of say Call of Duty or Battlefield then this may not be for you, but if you like to go for a game that allows you to use tactics, p[lan ahead, use different routes and strategies each time while fully utilising your squad then this game id for you. Sure it has its odd annoying grindy shooter bits, the ai can be dumb but surprisingly not often and the missions can seem similar to the ones before but having the option of going in Rambo mode, using a more splinter cell espionage approach or being support with the drone, it keeps the game fresh as you play through. All in all imo a diamond in the ruff of the saturated shooter market we have today. 9/10","December 30, 2013","true","17.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I could join perhaps 3 games on average every day, and that is continually trying.\nAnd even if you do join, expect someone to drop , it may just be you.\n\n\nSummary:\nAs a single player game, this game was fantastic, but there are far more military titles out there that will keep you entertained for longer. Once the single player game is over, you crave for the multiplayer. But alas it is non existent. They have instead opted to create a free to play (Pay if you wanna get anywhere) model with ghosts.

There's some serious customisation and plenty of choices to be made as to how you play the game. Every gadget I unlock gets cooler and cooler and unlike other games, I actually feel like using all of them.\n\nI'm dissapointed that it wasn't the same game that was shown at E3 2010, but Ubisoft Paris still managed to pull it off.\n\nI've never played a Ghost Recon game before, but this is incredible.

A typical Ubisoft PC product where connecting to your friends is an impossible feat.\n\nA real bummer, since the game is actually really good. It's putting a more modern actiony touch on the Ghost Recon series while still keeping the tactical elements that make this such an interesting and worthwhile experience. It is a bit more linear and unlike earlier titles (minus the console offshoots of the Advanced Warfighter games) you do get the possibility of just blasting your way through bad guys, allthough expect it to not be an easy task! At your disposal are tons of near-future gadgets, from the "Active Camo"-suit that can turn you invisible as long as you're moving slowly to the Battle mech that rains havoc on your foes (not really the quiet approach though). All accompanied by a very fancy presentation, I liked the GoPro-style camera that directly follows your guns motions and the interface that blends into the gameworld, a concept already well established in the latest Splinter Cell-Games, also from Ubisoft.\n\nIt's a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC Port nonetheless, apart from the already mentioned connection troubles it follows the sad trend of Ubisoft PC games not having proper support for standard resolutions. If youre running a 16:10 monitor, expect to play this game with big fat letterboxes.\n\nIf you're willing to look past these flaws, you'll find a fun tactical third person shooter that is willing to break free from mainstream military shooter tropes.\n\nSorry to those three friends I convinced to buy this game only to later find out the netcode is broken!

Firstly, the gameplay mechanics are pretty much all terrific. All the gadgets serve useful purposes and the squad commands (like sync shot) are very well done. Your AI squadmates can also handle themselves for the most part and contribute at a decent level to any combat. Infact in many areas, especially when stealthed, you can leave most of the killing to them whilst you scout. Level design is varied and whilst the storyline and character are fairly generic, it's all delivered in a fairly engaging manner.\n\nCons? Missions periodically use dated autofail conditions where you can't alert a single guard, must complete a task in a fixed period of time or cannot let a target get further than a certain distance away. The later two conditions in particular have a negative impact on gameplay as they force you into a run n' gun Call of Duty-style rush which the game doesn't pull off well at all. The use of these extremely rigid conditions also kills immersion. They could have achieved similar goals in ratcheting up tension without this autofail nonsense.\n\nAnyway, still recommended despite these annoyances - impressed me a lot more than the Advanced Warfighter games,","May 27, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I say it's futuristic/fantasy as there's a good deal of tech that you get access to in this game that maybe in the future could exsist.  Though that tech does add a lot to the fun you can have with the game, whether it's the UAV, active camo or the walker thing you get,  All the tech ties in nicely to playing the playstyle you want, using that tech to either run and gun through or to take out enemies one by one or in small groups.\n\nThe tactical portion of the game is really good as well.  Again using the tech and your squad you can tackle various challenges throughout the game.  Your teammates also don't suck and routinely help out with objectives/revives/kills.  There's a good deal of cover to move between and ways to move around the map that add to the tactical fun.  One of the most satisfying parts of the tactical portion for me was using active camo and UAV to set my team mates up for multikills.  The game played a lot slower that way, but it felt right clearing areas out without alerting the enemy and watching all 4 enemies falling over.\n\nThe levels were all really well done as well and again allowed for multiple ways to clear out objectives.  The layout of the map as well as enemy placement would allow you to sneak through or find a way to dispatch of all the enemies before clearing that part of the map.  There is also a good diversity of maps and enviroments to fight through, some jungle/desert/tundra(snow)/urban made each map feel some what unique.\n\nStory felt bland and kind of unresolved.  There wasn't much in the story that really makes you want to come back for it, or even pay that much attention to it in first place.\n\nThe guns are nice and there is a good deal of customization that you can make each weapon unique to how you want to play.  You are given a recommended set of guns before the mission starts but you are able to change them if you so choose which is nice.\n\nGame is old, so don't expect much from the multiplayer if anything.\n\nFew minor annoyances though during my single player playthrough.  You use the shift button to move between cover, however for me, every now and then the shift button would bring up the Steam overlay without pushing the tab button along with it, no idea why it happened.  As moving between cover can be tricky there was a few times where I'd select something, either not go to the one I wanted, or not return to cover after I finished moving.  Also there are parts in the game where it's recommended to go stealthy and when you move over cover it breaks your active camo which can alert enemies.","March 19, 2015","true","23.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are required to use the "swift silent and (quite literally) invisible" motto that the original Ghost Recon used, you stand around for too long, #1, you get bored and #2 someone will come over and shoot you up.\n\nSome of the features I liked, visuals aside, was the new stealth tactics employed in the game, even with your super amazeballs cloak of badassery on, you can still get detected, and it's story is pretty gripping, certainly the first mission, if you've played the game from Ghost Recon 2 onwards, you'll know who Ramirez is, and if you've played GRAW, you'll know who Allen is, and the first mission involving them, while I can kind of see some things, I personally would have done differently, being primarily a milsim player and a military nut, it was a good prologue to start you off, sets the mood, what you're after... then something bigger comes along and pow piddy pow! you're stopping a full scale war from breaking out... and there's four of you.\nIt isn't the typical "america vs russia" crap either, in fact, if my memory serves me right, you're actually helping the majority of Russia at more than one point, against an international force of crooks and cronies.\nsome missions are more relaxed, some missions carry a lot of tension, and some missions will have you on the edge of your provebial seat.\nand at some points, some missions will have you very infuriated, but in a good way.\none thing I did like, and this is just a tiny thing that makes ol' Klaus happy, is when you throw a grenade into one of the buildings in the second mission, it blows up and some dust comes off the roof, I thought that was pretty cool, but this is the person who thinks fountain pens are cool.\nGunsmith is an excellent feature, I like it a lot, it's pretty different, I mean you don't see customization options depicted like that every day, personally I think it's genius, I enjoy using it, and while this random dude called "Marcus Kelso" will advise you, you can take whatever weapon type you want. I would've liked this Marcus Kelso dude to be Marcus Brown, it would've made more sense in terms of context, but hey! who cares!?\n\nFor those wondering where all the ladies in the game have gone, my theory, basing it on what Alicia Diaz ended up doing, is that all the Lady Ghosts, have moved into a specialized area of the CIA Special Activities Division, or have taken on support/HQ roles in the group, rather than have a main front line role.\nPersonally, not having any more than one notable female character (twisting's pilot) in this game wasn't such a big deal, but with women being in all installments previous to this one (console versions for GRAW1+2) it's kind of out of character, for a better word. But like I said, you do appreciate not having many female Ghosts around, certainly ones that don't shut the hell up, not naming any names...\nBut please Ubisoft, if you are reading this, and you are making a next installment, being able to choose your squad, and some women would be great to have back in the game.\nI did like the Melee kills, because #1, they make sense and #2 they don't half come in handy! they also look pretty cool, you don't just smack that guy with the butt of your gun, you smack that guy silly, break his arm and slam him into the ground, it looks pretty epic.\n\nSome features of the game could've been left at the door, though. most notably health regen, in the games before GRFS, if you got shot, there's a pretty decent chance that you'll die, in this one, you can get shot in the head but you take cover so you'll be fine in a tick. there's this very odd sound that plays when you hit someone too, it's okay, but it gets annoying in an onslaught. Then there's the "you can't do anything else until you've done this that and the other" palava, also known as 'tutorials' which I'm pretty sure in previous PC versions of these games except Advanced Warfighter 1, there was a separate, optional, level for it, even still in advanced warfighter 1 you weren't limited on what you could do until you did that one thing it told you to do, if you knew how to do it, you did it, if you didn't, you learned something new from, being honest, a quite redundant feature in almost any shooter.\n\nAnd then of course you have the "unnecessary cutscene extravaganza!" basically, if there's a door that needs opening, expect to have an uneccessary cutscene showing off tacticool movement and ♥♥♥♥, y'know, all I did was open a door, it's not that significant! While it was pretty cool at first, it gets a little repetetive, and boring.\nIt also has the typical norm in most shooters now too, on the rails shooting gallery-esque modes, in this one, that is 'diamond formation' where you have to escort a person from A to B with you holding that guy's hand, with your magically appearing pistol and shooting any threat to you or your new friend, because it's obvious that you as a gamer are not mentally capable of getting them there alive in the normal play mode. Aaand of course helicopter gunning, because, y'know, there's not an assigned crew chief for that crap in 2020- something.\nyou'll probably allso notice at points, it still has xbox 360 button hints at places, the grenade change button is the most prominent, telling you it's the left bumper on the pad to change grenade type for those of you with a smattering of common sense, you'll realise that it isn't that button.\n\noverall, for what it is, it's a decent game, if you're like me and you've played and enjoyed the entire series, then you'll probably be VERY slightly disappointed by it, but if you take the game as a standalone addition to the Tom Clancy franchise, it'll go down pretty well, I sort of do a bit of both, I know it's got the Ghost Recon name, but it's a new game in its own right.\nI'd recommend this, certainly now that it's been patched and it works.","February 22, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theraintransformed/recommended/212630/","Theraintransformed","In-Game DOGG™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theraintransformed/","412 products in account","The newest full entry in the acclaimed Ghost Recon tactical shooter franchise, Ghost Recon Future Soldier was developed by Ubisoft and released in May 2012. Originally planned for release as a console exclusive, Future Soldier experienced a relatively turbulent development cycle, with the game's release date having been pushed back by Ubisoft at least 3 times between 2009 and 2012, and the PC version going from "coming out" to "cancelled because of piracy" to "coming out (alongside the console versions)". Nevertheless, Future Soldier did see a release, albeit unfortunately saddled with a shoddy porting job and an obnoxious system of DRM, courtesy of everyone's friends at Ubisoft™.\nAs stated earlier, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier is a console port. An Ubisoft one no less, so expectations are understandingly lowered upon going into this game, as Ubisoft are very infamous for their lazy, bug-ridden porting jobs and their overall negative and condescending attitudes towards PC gaming in general.\nThat being said, let's dive in. Future Soldier is actually a surprisingly good shooter in many aspects; a rarity among modern video games, and the modern shooter genre in particular. Future Soldier is also, however, an unsurprisingly bad console port. Despite being expected by potentially very many players to be so, Future Soldier's crude porting is a legitimate issue, and must be addressed as such. Remember, just because something negative is expected or "the norm" does not mean that it stops being a negative aspect or that it should be accepted.\nGhost Recon Future Soldier differs a good deal from the rest of the Ghost Recon series in two primary elements. Firstly, the aforementioned console-oriented development/design of this game. Secondly, the fact that Future Soldier plays primarily from a third-person perspective with some mechanics that assume a first-person perspective. This transition is a bit jarring coming from earlier Ghost Recon games. The change isn't necessarily a bad thing however. A camera angle is only a camera angle; it's up to the director to make the best use of it possible. And Future Soldier does a pretty good job with making the best out of its third-person perspective, all things considered.\nThe majority of third-person shooters I play leave me with a distinct lack of awe, and more often than not a feeling that the game would have been better had it been from a first-person perspective, with the given game's third-person camera seeming to be more of a gimmick put in place to make the game seem more "distinct" from the sea of similarly-feeling, similarly-playing first-person shooters released so often in modern gaming, rather than as a well thought out game design decision. Not so in Future Soldier. The third-person camera does not undermine or damage the player's ability to acquire targets in firefights, and the player is given the choice to change to a first-person perspective at any time while aiming, in order to gain more powerful zoom. In fact, the game's third-person camera often helps in acquiring targets from the safety of cover. My only problem with the camera system is the fact that the game has a very unimpressive default field of view (to better optimize the game for consoles), with no built-in option to change it.\nSpeaking of cover, Future Soldier happens to feature a cover system. Now I know what you're thinking: "Ugh." Well, upon further inspection, it's actually not so bad. The gameplay doesn't revolve around being in cover or making use of the cover system. It's entirely possible to use only manual cover as in most traditional shooters, and Future Soldier even allows the player to assume a prone position, so use of the cover system is not a requirement by any means. Using the cover system is often not recommended, as the player is not immune from all gunfire in a 180 degree field in front of them while behind cover like in games such as Gears of War or Mass Effect, so players behind a specific piece of cover will often be surprised when they find that they just got killed by some fucҝer they didn't notice beforehand. And the player dies very easily when compared to how fast the game is otherwise, so smart choice of shelter is paramount when playing.\nHiding properly is important when playing Future Soldier, not just to avoid gunfire during combat, but also because of the game's stealth mechanics. The game's protagonists belong to a special forces group who's purpose is reconnaissance and other similarly classified operations, rather than direct fighting. Staying consistent with the series, players in Future Soldier are usually influenced to avoid direct confrontations, as skilful use of the game's stealth mechanics give the player a significant advantage. To help the Ghosts with their infiltration, the player's squad is given several futuristic gadgets during gameplay. Included is an invisibility stealth field that activates when the player is crawling (the primary method of remaining undetected), several vision modes that allow the player to locate enemies through walls and other vision blockers, and the use of remotely-manned robots and drones. The purpose of the stealth is to use it to kill enemies easily and silently rather than avoiding them entirely, and every tool is geared towards that role somehow. There's also the "sync shot" mechanic, where the player marks a number of (up to 4) targets for him and their squad to eliminate simultaneously. On top of being cool as fucҝ, this mechanic is also somewhat central to the game's stealth, and learning how and when to use it is crucial to using stealth successfully.\nThe game's single player campaign is arranged in a fairly linear way, with there being a briefing before the beginning of every mission. During that briefing, the player is given the opportunity to customize their loadout for their mission. Future Soldier features a deep weapon customization system, where players can choose from a large number of firearms and swap out numerous parts on them, gearing or optimizing them for different roles. This gives players some flexibility as to how they play the game at some parts, although the game's level design is static and quite linear, so you're still encouraged to bring specific types of guns to certain missions.\nAnyway, the single-player campaign is relatively generic and there isn't much story or characterization to speak of, but it nonetheless makes good use of the game's established mechanics, and provides enough content and challenges to give players a decent experience, and still have a degree of replayability. My favorite part of the campaign (and of Future Soldier in general) is that absolutely every single single-player missions ends in some sort of semi-cinematic, "Black Hawk Down"-type set piece where the player and their squad need to hold out against waves of enemies while waiting for extraction or something similar. All these scenes are very well done, and unlike in similar AAA shooters, do not take control away from the player at any point, making them both cool to look at from a cinematic perspective, and engaging from a gameplay perspective. The best is probably the mission where the player is single-handedly sent into a Siberian prison with a HALO jump from SPACE to rescue the Russian president in a stealth operation reminiscent of Metal Gear Solid, which ends in a frantic firefight as the player mows down waves of advancing enemies while defending the president. Don't believe me? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL9c9JfWK9I#t=2230 It's legit.\nOverall, while not being "best shooter ever" by any means, Future Soldier is regardless a very decent modern shooting experience, and easily worth dropping a few bucks on if you enjoy fast-paced, semi-tactical shooters. Beware though, the ѕhit optimization is no joke. This fucҝer blue-screened my computer at least 5 times just from alt-tabbing, so exercise some caution when playing.","June 19, 2014","true","61.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It's so dissapointing to see a tactical game turn into ♥♥♥♥. This game is nowhere tactical as you might think. The only tactical thing is pressing Q keys 4 times and press m1 to win.\n\nThe first thing you''ll notice when you boot up this game if you have a potato CPU is that your frames go to near zero. To quote some famous youtuber "The frame in the game goes zero, zero, zero". I had to turn to the lowest setting to even enjoy ♥♥♥♥ing cutscences without fps lagging. This game engine is so poorly optimized that I would say Planetside 2's game engine is even more optimized. Hell sometimes the game just Alt+F4 without my input for no reason.\n\nAs with most AAA titles, the singleplayer returns with the same ol' plot.\n"Nuke, russians, vodka blah blah omg nuke go boom we 'murcia coming in the day 2 save the ♥♥♥♥in' day yea."\nI'll give credit for the singleplayer as it can be fun sometimes. SOMETIMES. Other than that it's just a   mock stleath game.\n\nNow the multiplayer... god who the hell was tasked to create the multiplayer for this game? A triple A title and there's no dedicated servers? No ♥♥♥♥ing server browsers? When I first played the multiplayer my game was plagued with problems. I kept on disconnecting from the game for no apparent reason, and when I even had the chance to play the multiplayer it was all like "Hammer the crocodile" game you have in arcades. That's the best I could summarize it. You wait for people to pop, you shoot, you win. Simple as that.\n\nTriple AAA game from Ubisoft that went through the quality control check. GJ Ubisoft.

NOT ONLY THAT, but the chat system is sub par, the game will not let you  edit your settings mid game, only from main menu, you can't swap weapons in game, which i would understand if you couldn't use gun smithing but you would think they would allow presets, but no. the communication with the spot button is ♥♥♥♥, only allowing to communicate an enemy if you have it dead on them and they are visible, or your able to tell your team verbally. though this doesn't hinder you being able to toss out a sensor ball, but they can destroy those if you place them wrong. the cover system, kinda ♥♥♥♥, if you wanna use your sights on an enemy behind you you are going to end up standing up from cover, if you wanna rush to a specific cover you could use the quick shift, but sometimes it doesn't let you go where you wan't. not only that but it is difficult as all hell to pull yourself out of that cover and it really restricts your reaction time to enemies flanking you. i could go on but all i can say is, if you want it for the single player, go for it, multiplayer though? dude, theres a free ghost recon game thats better than this, not as many gadgets mind you but the cover system  and movement, and all round communication as a team is better. [BONUS TIP: the ingame, does not have a chat button, only mic's, so if your wondering why your team is sitting behind spawn sniping instead of helping with objectives, better get a mic and possibly learn russian]","March 15, 2014","false","18.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

One bad thing about the graphics is that it does not have proper 1920x1080 resolution support. Without lowering the resolution to 1280x720, some players might experience massive frame rate drops, 1280x720 completely looks like 1080p in this game and i really have no idea why but it does, you can test it yourself.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nFeatures - Gun smith allows you to make your gun your self from paint to trigger, you can assemble it all yourself in both single player and multiplayer this option is available. graphics are really stunning but blood effects are really horrible. there are a lot of acrobat moves in this game which you can do both in multiplayer and single player. sync shot in single player allows you to mark and execute up to 4 enemy just like in splinter cell conviction. this option is also available in coop but not multiplayer.\n\nSingle Player & COOP - Just like other tom Clancy games like rainbow six or ghost recon old series the game is heavily depended on planning before executing, squad control and team plan is really important to pass the mission, unlike battlefield and CoD this game is not a run to shoot game and clearing waves of enemies etc. the gameplay is pretty much like splinter cell except with squad work, game has many ways to finish a mission and it doesn’t limit you from ending a mission, you can choose to be stealthy, or just avoiding all enemies, or just getting into direct fire and action. all single player missions can be done COOP and what makes it amazing in COOP is if you are not the host in coop you play the mission as another squad member so that means you see the gameplay from different view and your objectives will be different sometimes this means you have 4 views of each single player mission because each time you play as one of the 4 squad members you see the game from their perspective and their objectives. The story-line is okay, it's not excellent but it is fine, it is not that ALWAYS Russian devils vs ANGEL Americans. in fact like other UBI games it shows bad people are everywhere. most of the missions are in Russia and against Russian forces but you are also helping Russians to overthrow the president and get the control and give it back to the old president.\n\nMultiplayer - This is where this game shines, that's true sometimes multiplayer has issues but if you disable all your virtual network adaptors such as Hamachi, and firewalls and some antivirus programs the game works just fine (read my guide about multiplayer tweaking). there are 3 classes in this game:\n\nRifleman -  Assault rifles and heavy machine guns, heavy machine guns have really nice suppression effect in this game and i would say it is the only game so far which heavy machine gun does a true suppression. armed with grenades and can resupply friendly teammates.\n\nEngineer - Shotguns and Personal defense weapons such as carbines, can throw motion sensors and use UAV or UCAV assault drones and can plant sentry guns to defend objectives or spot enemy units. engineer has the key role in this game if one team plays with no engineers they have hard time winning the match.\n\nScout - Armed with submachine guns and sniper rifles, uses optimal camo to hide from enemy and can use flash bangs and claymore mines to trap the enemy. can also detect enemies through walls by IR lasers attached to the gun.\n\nThe most played multiplayer game mode is "Conflict", an objectives is randomly located on the map and both teams have to secure it, the first team which gets to it has to defend it from enemy team, the objectives are:\n\nSecuring sensor or resupply create - Both teams need to locate the sensor or resupply create and hack it and secure it for 2 minutes. if enemy teams kills the team covering the objective and get re-secure the sensor for themselves timer is not going to get reset, so that means if there is only 10 seconds left to completely secure the objective but an enemy starts to hack it in last 10 seconds then you lose the objective.\n\nEMP Blast - One team is defender and other team is attacker the defending team should locate and cover the EMP from attackers, same about attacking team they should locate and manage to hack the EMP from defenders. if EMP is secured after 2 minutes it will lunch an EMP pulse which disables all the enemy HUD and intel for 1 minute.\n\nHVT Tap into camos - One of the enemy or friendly members is randomly marked as HVT (usually the top score in team) the enemy team should locate the HVT and kill him before he reaches the intel swap point, if after 2 minutes HVT has not reached the point the enemy team has got the objective, if HVT manages to reach the intel swap point the friendly team gets intel over all enemy positions (wallhack).\n\nin multiplayer you can stun enemies with stungun or stun-claymore mines or if you heavily injure them you can get to them and hack them by holding "E" if you manage to hack an stunned or injured enemy you get intel over their locations and stop their fireteam spawn. the goal in multiplayer is only and only teamwork, killing enemy is easy in this game but winning is hard.\n\nI do recommend this game to anyone who is looking for hardcore tactical 3rd person shooter game, if you enjoyed GRAW series you will enjoy this more.\nOne easy way to tset if you gonna love this game or not is to play Ghost Recon Phantoms, that game is like DEMO to GRFS.","August 19, 2013","true","441.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jssrfx/recommended/212630/","jssrfx","jssrfx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jssrfx/","398 products in account","First of all let me say, this is a great game. As far as tactical squad-based shooters are concerned, this is very well done. The tactical planning seamlessly integrates into the game play, you get a number of really cool gadgets to help you plan your assault, but at no time does it feel that planning ahead hinders or dulls the game play. Very well done!\n\nThe instructions are clear, the objectives varied, and you get a great arsenal of weapons. The AI, especially your team members never gets in the way and sometimes it really does feel like you’re are part of a real time. The combat immersion is above the usual standard. As far as stealth/tactical/military shooters are concerned, this one is at the top of my favorite list for sure.\n\nAs far as performance is concerned, on any even semi-modern computer you will get decent frame rates at 1080p. If you're struggling, turn off DX11 and run on DX9. I've not noticed that much of a visual impact to be honest.\n\nSo, in short: If you like Tom Clancy based games, if you like tactical (FPS) shooters, if you have a little bit of a black sense of humor, get this. It's fun!\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of context, once again I don't understand those reviewers who are attacking Ubisoft (and their UPlay platform). Seriously, Ubisoft constantly pushes AAA titles, usually highly playable and enjoyable games, not perfect, sure, but no game is. If you are a huge developer of big buck computer games, you should have the right to push your own platform.\n\nI've never had any issues with UPlay; stand-alone or in combination with a Steam launched game. It provides cloud sync of save games, it provides rewards and ultimately, since a large amount of people (including me) never seem to have issues with UPlay, I would propose that whoever has, it's your problem. I'm tired of reading the flaming reviews of day-one releases and people picking on Ubisoft, just because they are unable or unwilling to maintain their computers properly and keep drivers etc. up-to-date.\n\nI don't work for Ubisoft, never have, never will, but I am an IT Professional, and I know that computers require maintenance and care to keep running optimized. Don't blame a game developer for something they cannot possibly do: Test each and every single PC configuration; a logistical impossibility. If a gaming console ever had one advantage over the PC then it is that one particular console is exactly the same to the next. Hardly one PC ever is, because most PC gamers, even when buying pre-built brands, will eventually upgrade with something that matches their budget or performance expectations.\n\nJust keep that in mind next time. And maybe, just maybe wait a few days with flame wars. If you want to let the developer know a game isn't working, fine, list what is not working, provide your specs and drivers, but don't do the whole "developer XYZ sucks" stuff. You know there will be patches. And seriously, if you don't meet the minimum, or recommended requirements, don't expect the game to run, or run well. Simple. Optimization is one thing, but I've read reviews of people that didn't meet the minimum requirements and then blame Ubisoft. My advice: Buy a console and stop insulting PC Gamers with your stupidity. </eom>\n","November 23, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This, like so many Ubisoft titles, is heartbreaking to think about because the devs wasted potential. A game that would have been excellent had the devs spent more time fixing its issues instead of throwing the game out the door to get their money. I guess they wanted to because the game was in development for a while so it's quite understandable.\n\nFuture Soldier is a title that stands out in the Ghost Recon series because of its shift from being a tactical shooter to a stealth-action title. Tactics are stripped away in favour of clearing out areas of enemies. Well, mostly. Some areas can be "ghosted" meaning you don't HAVE to take anyone out but most of the time you'll find yourself taking out enemies with the "sync shot" a new mechanic that when you tag 4 people, shoot someone in the head and the rest of the 3 ghosts will do as well. It's a nice mechanic that works well and makes you feel like a special ops soldier.\nThere is a lot of action in this game though Ubisoft overused the "we're at the end of a level and we need a shootout!" thingy. They are spectacular though, with tons of explosions and the loud noises of your teammates shouting over gun fire.\n\nNow the problems. Ever since Splinter Cell Conviction, all the cover systems in Ubisoft games are crap. Future Soldier has an unresponsive cover system so moving out of cover is quite obnoxious when the extremely DUMB enemies are flanking you and this results in a ton of frustrating and unneccessary deaths. Prepare to reload checkpoints a lot and this is made worse  as the challenges are stupid and make no sense. There's a challenge where you have to snap 40 necks. What??!!! Future Soldier doesn't have the mechanics for this challenge; it's not a Splinter Cell game. The Ghosts move clunkily and super slow and the enemy placement is meant for you to shoot them, not melee. Another example is in the same level where the "40 neck snap challenge" is, there's one that requires you to kill all the enemies stealthily at a certain point in a level. The problem is, the enemy placement is so stupid taking them all out without getting detected requires luck!\nA stupid, unneccessary score system is implemented but has no purpose nor does it give you incentive to get 100/100. It just feels tacked on and unfinished. There aren't any level leaderboards!\nWeapons can be customized extensively but you have to unlock attachments by completing challenges.\n\nNow onto the multiplayer. This is where the tactics are. There's no TDM but a few modes. One that involves capturing points on the map. There's also a mode where you don't respawn! Team play and not dying frequently are required so if you suck, sorry for you but you'll most likely cause your team to lose. There aren't "perks" but the gadgets make up for this. An example would be a turret that fires at enemies automatically or a sensor grenade that highlights enemies. Unfortunately, the multiplayer has died so finding a match is hard so if you buy it now, you won't be able to get much practice.\nThere's also Ghost Recon's take on "Horde" mode where you fight waves on enemies; 50 of them. You can play with or without other people. Tedium starts to settle in at about 10 waves though.\n\nBut to sum this review up, Ghost Recon Future Soldier is a great change to the series, a neccessary one to keep up with a newer generation of gamers. The new features and improved shooting mechanics should provide a foundation for next titles to come. But because of its problems, it's not worth full price at $19.99 so better buy this when it's on sale. It's a dissapointment though and there are times I am shaking my head at how Ubisoft couldn't fix many of its flaws.\n\n6/10.","January 10, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As far as tactical squad-based shooters are concerned, this is very well done. The tactical planning seamlessly integrates into the game play, you get a number of really cool gadgets to help you plan your assault, but at no time does it feel that planning ahead hinders or dulls the game play. Very well done!\n\nThe instructions are clear, the objectives varied, and you get a great arsenal of weapons. The AI, especially your team members never gets in the way and sometimes it really does feel like you’re are part of a real time. The combat immersion is above the usual standard. As far as stealth/tactical/military shooters are concerned, this one is at the top of my favorite list for sure.\n\nAs far as performance is concerned, on any even semi-modern computer you will get decent frame rates at 1080p. If you're struggling, turn off DX11 and run on DX9. I've not noticed that much of a visual impact to be honest.\n\nSo, in short: If you like Tom Clancy based games, if you like tactical (FPS) shooters, if you have a little bit of a black sense of humor, get this. It's fun!\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of context, once again I don't understand those reviewers who are attacking Ubisoft (and their UPlay platform). Seriously, Ubisoft constantly pushes AAA titles, usually highly playable and enjoyable games, not perfect, sure, but no game is. If you are a huge developer of big buck computer games, you should have the right to push your own platform.\n\nI've never had any issues with UPlay; stand-alone or in combination with a Steam launched game. It provides cloud sync of save games, it provides rewards and ultimately, since a large amount of people (including me) never seem to have issues with UPlay, I would propose that whoever has, it's your problem. I'm tired of reading the flaming reviews of day-one releases and people picking on Ubisoft, just because they are unable or unwilling to maintain their computers properly and keep drivers etc. up-to-date.\n\nI don't work for Ubisoft, never have, never will, but I am an IT Professional, and I know that computers require maintenance and care to keep running optimized. Don't blame a game developer for something they cannot possibly do: Test each and every single PC configuration; a logistical impossibility. If a gaming console ever had one advantage over the PC then it is that one particular console is exactly the same to the next. Hardly one PC ever is, because most PC gamers, even when buying pre-built brands, will eventually upgrade with something that matches their budget or performance expectations.\n\nJust keep that in mind next time. And maybe, just maybe wait a few days with flame wars. If you want to let the developer know a game isn't working, fine, list what is not working, provide your specs and drivers, but don't do the whole "developer XYZ sucks" stuff. You know there will be patches. And seriously, if you don't meet the minimum, or recommended requirements, don't expect the game to run, or run well. Simple. Optimization is one thing, but I've read reviews of people that didn't meet the minimum requirements and then blame Ubisoft. My advice: Buy a console and stop insulting PC Gamers with your stupidity. </eom>\n","November 23, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This, like so many Ubisoft titles, is heartbreaking to think about because the devs wasted potential. A game that would have been excellent had the devs spent more time fixing its issues instead of throwing the game out the door to get their money. I guess they wanted to because the game was in development for a while so it's quite understandable.\n\nFuture Soldier is a title that stands out in the Ghost Recon series because of its shift from being a tactical shooter to a stealth-action title. Tactics are stripped away in favour of clearing out areas of enemies. Well, mostly. Some areas can be "ghosted" meaning you don't HAVE to take anyone out but most of the time you'll find yourself taking out enemies with the "sync shot" a new mechanic that when you tag 4 people, shoot someone in the head and the rest of the 3 ghosts will do as well. It's a nice mechanic that works well and makes you feel like a special ops soldier.\nThere is a lot of action in this game though Ubisoft overused the "we're at the end of a level and we need a shootout!" thingy. They are spectacular though, with tons of explosions and the loud noises of your teammates shouting over gun fire.\n\nNow the problems. Ever since Splinter Cell Conviction, all the cover systems in Ubisoft games are crap. Future Soldier has an unresponsive cover system so moving out of cover is quite obnoxious when the extremely DUMB enemies are flanking you and this results in a ton of frustrating and unneccessary deaths. Prepare to reload checkpoints a lot and this is made worse  as the challenges are stupid and make no sense. There's a challenge where you have to snap 40 necks. What??!!! Future Soldier doesn't have the mechanics for this challenge; it's not a Splinter Cell game. The Ghosts move clunkily and super slow and the enemy placement is meant for you to shoot them, not melee. Another example is in the same level where the "40 neck snap challenge" is, there's one that requires you to kill all the enemies stealthily at a certain point in a level. The problem is, the enemy placement is so stupid taking them all out without getting detected requires luck!\nA stupid, unneccessary score system is implemented but has no purpose nor does it give you incentive to get 100/100. It just feels tacked on and unfinished. There aren't any level leaderboards!\nWeapons can be customized extensively but you have to unlock attachments by completing challenges.\n\nNow onto the multiplayer. This is where the tactics are. There's no TDM but a few modes. One that involves capturing points on the map. There's also a mode where you don't respawn! Team play and not dying frequently are required so if you suck, sorry for you but you'll most likely cause your team to lose. There aren't "perks" but the gadgets make up for this. An example would be a turret that fires at enemies automatically or a sensor grenade that highlights enemies. Unfortunately, the multiplayer has died so finding a match is hard so if you buy it now, you won't be able to get much practice.\nThere's also Ghost Recon's take on "Horde" mode where you fight waves on enemies; 50 of them. You can play with or without other people. Tedium starts to settle in at about 10 waves though.\n\nBut to sum this review up, Ghost Recon Future Soldier is a great change to the series, a neccessary one to keep up with a newer generation of gamers. The new features and improved shooting mechanics should provide a foundation for next titles to come. But because of its problems, it's not worth full price at $19.99 so better buy this when it's on sale. It's a dissapointment though and there are times I am shaking my head at how Ubisoft couldn't fix many of its flaws.\n\n6/10.","January 10, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But where Crysis 2 and Crysis 3 provide some interest once you accept that they are really completely different games than Crysis 1, Future Soldier is just embarrassing. I must admit I only played the first scene, but stopped there out of principle. No military team, certainly not a fictional one in the Ghost Recon series would open up in a market full of civilians. I don't know, maybe the Future Soldier team are the terrorists this time ?

There's no hold fire order, so I can't even step in and tell my team to wait until the civilians have gone away. The rest of the game feels off as well. The "HUD gone bananas" future theme just does not feel believable and is clearly not based on any actual research. Where in the first Crysis the Nano-suit sounds like something believable, even into Crysis 2 (yes I even read composite material chemical names on one PDA that I recognised from some science paper I read years ago about advanced omposite materials), the "future" theme here just feels pasted on. Huge level name and "Huddy bits" hover over the level as part of the 3D environment, probably meant to represent some "super HUD" display. But all connection with you as a soldier it lost along with all immersion. Crytek always include this kind of thing strictly from the PoV of the player so as not to break immersion. So, this game is not recommended by me. For future themes try Frontlines Fuel of War (underrated in my opinion), or if you like this kind of thing with sqaud mates following you around but with no squad commands then Medal of Honor 2010, or Warfighter is much better.

You can customize your guns, and I like how cool the camo is. The graphics are decent, and quite frankly, I feel as if this game has the qualities that would make me addicted.\n\nHowever, there is one but:\nTHIS GAME IS BUGGY AS SH**. Don't get me wrong - my computer can definitely handle this. I have a dedicated Maxwell GPU and a 4th-gen i3. I'm running Windows 10 64-bit with the latest NVIDIA drivers. This is more than enough for this game. In fact, I can max it out and still get 60 fps. Alas, I feel as if this were a programming attempt by a kid in some crappy third-world country. Every single damn time I launch this game, it will crash sooner or later. This game needs to have a built-in forecast for crashes. For example, "today, we expect single player campaign to work, but there is an 80% chance that it'll crash in co-op." If I try to search my issue online, I can find tons of people with the same crash issues I face, but absolutely no solutions.\n\nHonestly, f*** you, Ubisoft. You took my money and gave me a bug-infected PoS. I doubt that what you're doing is legal - taking people's money and giving them something that you know doesn't work.

Single player is also not particularly interesting - ubisoft went for call of duty style of gameplay, with BS factor beyond comprehension. They made this game easy and boring, weapon customization is rather unintelligent (Choosing trigger groups for semi-automatic or fully automatic before the mission? Has anyone at Ubisoft heard about fire mode selection?). Also, one of the biggest sins this game commits - lack of optimization. How could they make a game that weights 17GB, looks worse than majority of recent games, and runs worse than almost all of them. I had to run this on lowest settings, despite being able to run metro 2033 (which looks way better) in dx11 with only SSAA disabled.\nJust to wrap things up, if you want a good tactical shooter that's fun and works - buy yourself a Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2.

The missions are original and enjoyable, the environments are engaging and the difficulty level of the game is challenging.\n\nThe endurance of the solo campaign won't exceed the 15 hour mark, however it's nearly three times longer than its forerunner and a hell of a lot more lively. Definitely worth checking out, although maybe not worth the full price, wait for this one to go on sale since the multiplayer is dead and gone.

But because of Steam cards (for most games) it's grudgingly acceptable.\n\nI have to say with a heavy heart that I didn't enjoy Future Soldier. I've never played a Ghost Recon game and was always really interested in it since I love Splinter Cell. But that's basically the problem for me. It felt like it was taking elements from Rainbow Six, Call of Duty and Splinter Cell and mashing it all into one game.....except it was executed poorly. I expected a lot more tactical freedom than what was given. I also didn't expect HQ to act like a five year old considering you're part of an elite team ('blah blah blah, I don't care' is what I'm referring to). If I had more time, I would've played more to give it more of a chance. But seeing as there's only a 2 hour time frame for the refunds generally I was forced to stop before I went past the limit. I personally had no problems running it and it looked pretty good graphically. The sync shot was fun, but it's basically the same thing you do in the more recent Splinter Cells....it's just done with your squadmates. Camo was an interesting feature and maybe I just expected too much.....but I was also hoping to connect personally with each of my squadmates too early on. Hopefully they'll make a much better GR title next time.","October 14, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

I haven't played any of the newer (ghost recon) games in many years. I saw this game on sale the other day and thought that it was time to finally give the series another go and try and not compare it to the original game as I knew it wouldn't play the same and I'd end up disappointed.\nDespite entering the game with an open mind I am very disappointed. I have not anything to say about gameplay. Honestly I didn't get that far. This game is obviously a terrible console port. It is unplayable on my PC. The game runs butter smooth however the method that the game uses to capture mouse movement and move the character completely breaks it for me. From what I've seen the game emulates your mouse as a thumbstick on a controller. This results in there being a maximum input on the mouse (as what would happen if you pushed the thumbstick fully to one side, you can't move any faster than that).\nBeing a low senstivity gamer I set the sensitivity low (10/100) in game, this results in it taking ~5 seconds to turn around as no matter how fast I move the mouse it will not turn my character any faster due to the maximum input imposed on the mouse.","March 15, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I have been a big fan Ubisoft's Tom Clancy games, from the original PC Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon games though the XBox 360/PS3 generation.  I wanted to like this game, I really did, but as a single player experience, I can't give Future Soldier my recommendation.  First off, this is a pretty meh port of the console version.  Graphically at times the exteriors look pretty decent, but interiors tend to look low-res and muddy.  Also, don't expect a lot of graphic options to tweak.\n\nAll that aside, my major issues revolve around AI and gameplay problems.  The friendly AI is not the sharpest and tends to get shot a lot, even in small firefights.  The enemy AI, as is typical with many "squad-based" shooters, has a tendency to focus in on the you, regardless of the relative danger presented by your AI controlled squad mates, as if to acknowledge, "those dudes aren't very sharp."  The implementation of the mark & execute system, borrowed it seems, from the latter Splinter Cell games, is nicely done and provides a welcome tactical element.  However, most firefights descend into chaos, which DOES happen in real life, yet unlike real soldiers, you very much need to babysit your AI counterparts in the heat of battle.  And therein lies my biggest issue with this game, it sits somewhere between a tactical squad-based shooter and a third person action shooter, while not being a shining example of either.\n\nI suspect there is fair amount of fun to be had as a four player co-op experience, and the overall design seems like that is what the devs were aiming for; I would grudgingly give it a thumbs up for a like minded group-just don't expect to be blown away.","June 30, 2014","false","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are so many negative reviews about this game, but the important thing to realize is that most of these reviews are players who are really big into the multiplayer.\n\nThe multiplayer, from the two times I tried to connect, is essentially nonexistant so avoid this game if you're interested in a competitive experience.\n\nNow the single player on the otherhand is absolutely incredible. This game looks great, plays great, sounds great, and is actually fun!\n\nGraphics: The graphics look phenomenal. Lots of great textures, attention to detail on the character models, cool futurestic effects like enhanced thermal imaging, x-ray imaging, and cloaking. Lots of variety in missions ranging from rainy towns, snowy artic bases, to swamps. The only problem is you're going to need a hefty PC to run this monster.

I wouldn't try the DX11 settings unless you have a geforce 6 series or higher.\n\nGameplay: I played this game using an xbox360 wired controller and it works great. Full controller support including menus, button notifcations, and dualshock response. The game gives you several pretty linear missions with large spaces to explore and try different tactics. You can mark targets and pull off syncronized kills with your other squad mates, making the game a fast-paced tactical game unlike the previous Ghost Recons. The gadgets all seem useful in different situations. The game's customizability is some of the best I've seen since Battlefield 3. You can alter every single part of your gun right down to barrel length and compensator type. The enemies are challenging and gunfights feel realistic. Close quarter combat can feel a bit hectic when you try aiming very accurate guns at enemies right next to you.\n\nThis game also supports full 4 player campaign coop, meaning you can play all (or most I think) of the story missions with your friends.

I loved the damn game soo much. The multiplayer when working was the best there was. It required communication with your teammates and cooperative play too. One man on the drone, One with a lmg for suppressing fire, and ghost to run around hacking people so you could get your coordinated kills. Coordinated kills were the best way to score points and come out with the victory. We would hack the team and leave one guy alone and then hack him once the rest respawned that way you can just know where every enemy is at all times. As for campaign we played the hell out of that too, favorite mission was the mission with the secondary mission of breaking 40 necks. Game gets a 10/10 for fun. Only got a few hours on the pc but would recomend it to anyone for a $10 and under purchase because its not worth $10 anymore, You can see how COD copied this game shortly after this one came out.","February 7","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They bump into you while aiming moving you when trying to shoot the enemy, or when trying to shoot suddenly run in front of you.\n\nThis is game maybe fun when in coop mode, did not try it.\n\nSingleplayer : Gameplay 0/10\n\nThanks a lot Ubisoft and this is the reason why I only buy games at lowprice because after 30 years of gaming I learned one thing: I never pay full price because most of the times I feel like I am being framed when buying games like these.\n\nTo all gamers, never buy DLC before trying the actual game because you might end up spending a lot of money for a game which turns out to be nothing.\n\nThis game also uses Ubiplay and thus does not plays from Steam directly.\nThis means long loading times before getting to the start game menu and especially long 'end game' sessions so I use Taskmanager to end the game because I have better things to do wasting time in waiting.\n\nI really started to like this game untill I got to level shattered mountain, here Ubisoft totally messed up.","October 24, 2014","false","20.7"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","3"

Guerilla mode does not allow you to bring in any customized gear, and has nothing to spice up the mode so it gets boring quickly. If you are a Clancy game fan, steer clear!

You cannot command teammates to hold certain positions or man stationary guns, not to mention the "Ghost Lead" that doesn't even give orders. The only commands you can give are to "shoot this guy" or "blow up that car".\n\nAs for multiplayer, Phantoms is free and basically the same thing.\n\nOh yeah, and when they ported the game from the 360, they forgot to switch the control scheme from Xbox controllers to the keyboard. You're left with a HUD that tells you to push LB instead of MOUSE3.\n\nHOWEVER, if this game happens upon a sale and you can drag 3 of your friends into getting it, put it on the hardest difficulty for some tactical cooperative fun, where ANYONE can get detected!","June 6, 2015","false","8.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

I really, really do.\n\nThis is a fantastic game. Extremely enjoyable gameplay, great graphical fidelity and good performance. Enjoyable missions and good level design, with different ways of approaching objectives and satisfying "sync shots", where your entire team shoot 4 people simultaneously. A truly brilliant gun customization menu, where you can customize everything from the optics to the gas system.\n\nHowever, this entire experience is utterly ruined by two things; firstly, the mandatory use of UPlay. I'm not going to go on a rant about how much I hate UPlay (although I certainly could; and with good reason), because I'm sure that everyone else on Steam has had my exact thoughts every time they think of the word UPlay. You would think, however, that this would surely not ruin my whole experience of GR:FS? You would be correct. There is one problem which I simply cannot get past, and which ultimately ruins the whole game for me: Mouse Acceleration. I'm sure everyone here knows how awful this is, so I won't go on about it. However, if you are thinking of buying this game, beware; the mouse acceleration is there, it is very noticeable, and it cannot be disabled by any means. After hours of searching, I cannot find any way of disabling mouse acceleration in this game, not even through modification of the .INI files. What this ultimately means is that you cannot aim in this game without great difficulty. Not only does this make the game harder, it also makes it more annoying to play. It disgusts me that Ubisoft think that they can get away with no option to disable console features for a PC game, as well as the fact that they force UPlay upon us. In summary, don't buy this game unless you can handle very heavy mouse acceleration or intend to use a gamepad, and are happy with UPlay. For me, I cannot play this game, and will never buy another Ubisoft product.","October 25, 2014","false","14.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

Not even if it's on sale for $1. There are better things you can waste your time on, staring at the ceiling for instance is cheaper (free) while being much less frustrating.\n\nPossible issues you will (most likely) have with this game:-Won't even start\n-Will crash every 5min-15min\n-You will neither have Steam nor Uplay overlay\n-Won't remember your keybindings, graphics settings nor any settings for that matter\n-Your savegames will randomly get corrupted\n-Coop matchmaking doesn't really work\n-Textures fairly often look like from 2001 (I usually don't complain about graphics but this was ridiculous on a high level)\n-Is performing horrible while looking worse than comparable games\n-There seems to be some sort of memory leak that will cause your FPS to slowly drop until you restart the game (or until it crashes on its own). To give an example I was starting off at 64 FPS and ended up with 24 FPS after 30 minutes\n\nGameplay:I've managed to finish the first mission as well as start the second one during my 14 hours of playtime (no, the missions themselves weren't the reason why it took me so long). Equipement customization aside the gameplay is very linear, the maps look big at first but that's only until you realize that there are "invisible walls" everywhere around you and that there usually only is 1 path that you can take.\n\nIf you are reading this review, here is a friendly reminder:Don't pre-order Ubisoft games, no matter how awesome they look in the trailers. This applies to many gaming companies but not to the same degree as to Ubisoft in my view. EA for instance will grant you a refund if you dont like their game for whatever reason (if you don't wait for too long after playing it).","February 29","false","13.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Between this game, Assassin's Creed III, the new Rainbow Six and Splinter Cell Blacklist they have sold out and seen themselves off. This is not the calibre of game we are entitled to expect from an award winning company.\n\nThe saving grace of this game is a fun storyline, if somewhat generic and lacking in depth. I had fun playing this game, but was constantly aware of its flaws and reminded of it's shortcomings every time I encountered a bug.\n\nHonestly unless ubisoft sorts itself out I dare say their days as a big name in gaming are limited. They ought to be punished for delivering dreadful games across the board: not just the aforementioned (and great by the way) franchises consider their other recent(ish) titles - End War, Red Steel 2 and Watchdogs get a particular mention.\n\nI write this as a disenchanted, previous "die-hard" Ubisoft fan.\n\nMy advice?

Don't get me wrong, if anything about Uplay was worth a crap, this would be a really good title.  Unfortunately for both us and Ubisoft, there is nothing good about Uplay.  I don't play a lot of single player games. In fact, I generally only buy a title if it is a co-op or competetive multiiplayer title.  That being said, this game IS NOT AS ADVERTISED due to the incredibly poor preformance and overall gayness of Uplay and its inability to handle simple functions like matchmaking.\n\nThe mecahnics of this game are great and when you are actually playing it, it is a very smooth, very fun tactical shooter.  But good luck cutting through all the Uplay BS to get there.  Why the hell Ubisoft even bothers with their own hub is beyond me-- STEAM is the king of gamer connectivity.  Why would you need to have both STEAM and Uplay especially when UPLAY preforms like ♥♥♥♥?\n\nGood luck getting into a co-op match with a friend.  UPLAY crashes the damn system every time you try to start the game if you have a friend on your Uplay list that also runs the title.  It is an incredibly frustrating and unnecessary hinderance to an otherwise good game.  Unfortunately for Ubisoft, its a deal breaker.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE unless you want to play single player only.","January 7, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game follows a very linear and generic storyline, however the user’s ability to approach a situation in any chosen manner compensates for it. The game has a well-developed stealth system and that is what brings the game together for me. As without that, it would just be another generic game with generic controls and a generic storyline.

Towards the end it gets a little stupid.\n\nLong version - Graphics and Audio are good, the majority of the gameplay is fun.\n\nThe annoying parts include:\n\n1) an unbalanced AI - ie: if my team is engaging the enemy and I am just assigning targets (ie: not shooting) the enemy will still concentrate fire on me.\n\n2) wierd effects - ie: in one level when it is raining, any cover you hide behind suddenly starts "smoking". (even if you are not shooting, and nobody is shooting at you)\n\n3) Third-person shooter syndrome - little things like: if you run past something that could be "cover" then your guy automatically stops running and takes cover. If you are behind cover and find an enemy behind you, then swinging your camera around through cover becomes disorientating.\n\n4) Forced interactive cinematics - ie: certain cinematics force your character to walk through areas without cover, and you only have control over where you are shooting. If one enemy ends up behind you, you don't have control over your movements to turn around and shoot the enemy.\n\n","December 28, 2014","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I read some of the development note while the title was being developed and hoped that the PC version would have a bit more than the consoles as it relates to in game options. The game is a rail shooter and your options are really scripted.  The player’s involvement is simply one of timing as when to initiate an action. There is no planning stage where you can attack a known objective from any of 100 different approaches; it is much scripted in that respect. The performance out the gate was not very good for Nvidia users. The textures were smeared and the frames per second were very poor.

You may be total and extreme bad-♥♥♥ walking slowly down the alley and your teammates taking down enemy who look funny on you. You may do sneaky executions right behind general who is walking down the alley slowly and thinking it's totally safe. You also may shoot tons of enemies in their jeeps driving to kill you. So good thing in campaign - different situations, different rules of engagment and stuff like that. Bad things - usually same weapons (meaning that arsenal feature is practically useles). Another bad thing - how enemy spot you. Sometimes it's understandable, but sometimes it's just one of those "How the ♥♥♥♥?!" Multiplayer is 50/50. Coop is your typical survival mode. So bleh. Coop campaign on the other hand is great. So I do recommend this game, but get ready that you'll not use all features game has to offer (because they are either useles or there are a lot of high level people in MP at this point).","August 19, 2012","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This still holds true here. Hitting WASD and ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO COUNT THE TIME UNTIL YOUR DUDE MOVES is unacceptable, Ubisoft.

You can play alone or with up to 3 friends in COOP.\nThere is a Multiplayer Mode as well, but I will disregard it at this point in time, because nearly no one is playing it any more.\n\nPlease be also notified that this is an Ubisoft Game and therefore ships with their awful Uplay DRM.\n\nThe Game plays like your average 3rd Person Shooter, quite like Gears of War or Halo. Now you say: "These are Console Franchises" and you would be quiet right. Because it also plays really Console like, with all its "benefits".\nThere are the not really Mouse controlled Menus, the Console Graphics and just awful rail shooter passages.  In Addition to that, the Game constantly tries to shove its little Gadgets and Mechanics (that would otherwise be quiet nice to have) down your throat and therefore accomplishes a thing that no Game should. It begins to annoy very quickly...\nBut there’s not only downsides to the Game. The Gunplay is kind of OK. The Story is, so much uninspired, not so bad. And there is a COOP, which for the most time works quite well.\n\n\nPro:\n-COOP\n-weapon customization\n-weapon variety\n\nContra:\n-buggy COOP\n-too easy with bots (Sync shot)\n-clunky console like controls\n-bad graphics\n-not what the Franchise stands for\n-RAIL SHOOTER passages!!!\n\nSo no Recommendation here.

We tried to start again but this time neither of us could get connection.\n\nThere are obviously still bugs in this game that haven't been sorted out but only appear to affect some people.\n\nIf anybody has any ideas then please tell.\n\nDue to the bugs, i just can't reccomend it.","February 22, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play alone or with up to 3 friends in COOP.\nThere is a Multiplayer Mode as well, but I will disregard it at this point in time, because nearly no one is playing it any more.\n\nPlease be also notified that this is an Ubisoft Game and therefore ships with their awful Uplay DRM.\n\nThe Game plays like your average 3rd Person Shooter, quite like Gears of War or Halo.

In Addition to that, the Game constantly tries to shove its little Gadgets and Mechanics (that would otherwise be quiet nice to have) down your throat and therefore accomplishes a thing that no Game should.

I guess I should start off with that the game looks good, I like the designs of the futuistic gear you get to play around with and the gunsmithing is also neat.\n\nBut what I HATE about this game is that its not really a tactical stealth game, and it is so heavily scripted it hurts the soul. Basic mission is that you arrive into an area, and now you have to sneak (i.e shoot everyone without his buddies noticing) and it sounds good, but its scripted. You can only sneak in ceartain areas and once you're outside the "sneak zones" of the mission the baddies suddenly know where you are if you shoot one of them.\n\nHere is an example: The mission was on a ship, I had just snuck around inside the ship with a silenced weapons and the mission had taken me to a catwalk on the outside of the ship with 6 baddies and a catwalk on the other side of the ship. With some manuvering I managed to sync kill 4 of them and then full auto gun the last two with a silenced smg. Despite slaughtering the guards within a second, still I was somehow seen. How? Simple I was outside the "sneaking section" of that mission, it was time for action as waves of baddies was storming onto the other catwalk with sniper rifles.","August 29, 2015","false","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is nothing realistic or tactical about the gameplay here. The only thing realistic at all are weapon and country names.\n\nGRFS has removed nearly all of the fps simulator like fundamentals that the predecessors had and traded them in for movie like action scenes that are cliche and predictable, cover "systems" that are clearly taken from a successful game of a different genre (Gears of War), and forgiving and easy to jump into gunplay. Ghost Recon originally was never about any of the features that are within GRFS. You cannot even control your own squad in this game. They just run around like invisible gods amongst the enemy until you yourself open fire.\n\nThe name Ghost Recon should never have been attached to this game.

Being a core tactical game, it's all about patience: picking the right route to your goal, eliminate your enemies with surgical precision, and leave with no trace of your presence.\n\nBut now, this game has combined the tactical aspects that have defined the other GR games, with an action-paced game, all coupled with a unique COOP experience. Going from a stealth insertion, to a full assault, where your teammates are the only thing standing between a successful mission and a certain death.\n\nI must say, ever since this game was announced, I've been dying to play it.

A stealth shooter?  A shooter where you remain hidden most of the time and only engage open combat when things go wrong?  That is what I expected.\n\nThings started off well enough.  You were sneaking around and you got some nice toys to play with.  However as the game progressed, it became more of an action shooter with a very small stealth component.  Did you carefully pick off your targets to clean out that seemingly impossible area?  Well sometimes the game says FU, combat starts anyway.\n\nSo your lightly armored squad survived that onslaught of men?  Ok, now we are going to throw vehicles in.  Still alive?  Next time you will also have clock, so you got to do it in 3 minutes or less.  To the developer who did that final level with the last general, I say thanks for the total BS level that has absolutely nothing to do with “Ghost Recon”.\n\nOverall this game is more of an action shooter with a dwindling stealth component (one later level being an exception).  I think the game is about 8 to 10 hours long.  Steam just tracked it as being played when the UBI soft launcher was loaded, not when I was playing the game.  If you want a real stealth recon game, then I would suggest you pass on this title unless it is dirt cheap.  If you just want any old shooter FPS with a stealth component, then you be the judge for 8 to 10 hours.\n","April 20, 2013","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being a core tactical game, it's all about patience: picking the right route to your goal, eliminate your enemies with surgical precision, and leave with no trace of your presence.\n\nBut now, this game has combined the tactical aspects that have defined the other GR games, with an action-paced game, all coupled with a unique COOP experience. Going from a stealth insertion, to a full assault, where your teammates are the only thing standing between a successful mission and a certain death.\n\nI must say, ever since this game was announced, I've been dying to play it. I've had it for a few months and, while I haven't enjoyed the full COOP experience (not enough teammates), the game has exceeded my expectations.","December 27, 2013","true","48.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A stealth shooter?  A shooter where you remain hidden most of the time and only engage open combat when things go wrong?  That is what I expected.\n\nThings started off well enough.  You were sneaking around and you got some nice toys to play with.  However as the game progressed, it became more of an action shooter with a very small stealth component.  Did you carefully pick off your targets to clean out that seemingly impossible area?  Well sometimes the game says FU, combat starts anyway.\n\nSo your lightly armored squad survived that onslaught of men?  Ok, now we are going to throw vehicles in.  Still alive?  Next time you will also have clock, so you got to do it in 3 minutes or less.  To the developer who did that final level with the last general, I say thanks for the total BS level that has absolutely nothing to do with “Ghost Recon”.\n\nOverall this game is more of an action shooter with a dwindling stealth component (one later level being an exception).  I think the game is about 8 to 10 hours long.  Steam just tracked it as being played when the UBI soft launcher was loaded, not when I was playing the game.  If you want a real stealth recon game, then I would suggest you pass on this title unless it is dirt cheap.  If you just want any old shooter FPS with a stealth component, then you be the judge for 8 to 10 hours.\n","April 20, 2013","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play alone or with up to 3 friends in COOP.\nThere is a Multiplayer Mode as well, but I will disregard it at this point in time, because nearly no one is playing it any more.\n\nPlease be also notified that this is an Ubisoft Game and therefore ships with their awful Uplay DRM.\n\nThe Game plays like your average 3rd Person Shooter, quite like Gears of War or Halo. Now you say: "These are Console Franchises" and you would be quiet right. Because it also plays really Console like, with all its "benefits".\nThere are the not really Mouse controlled Menus, the Console Graphics and just awful rail shooter passages.  In Addition to that, the Game constantly tries to shove its little Gadgets and Mechanics (that would otherwise be quiet nice to have) down your throat and therefore accomplishes a thing that no Game should. It begins to annoy very quickly...\nBut there’s not only downsides to the Game. The Gunplay is kind of OK. The Story is, so much uninspired, not so bad. And there is a COOP, which for the most time works quite well.\n\n\nPro:\n-COOP\n-weapon customization\n-weapon variety\n\nContra:\n-buggy COOP\n-too easy with bots (Sync shot)\n-clunky console like controls\n-bad graphics\n-not what the Franchise stands for\n-RAIL SHOOTER passages!!!\n\nSo no Recommendation here.

Less silly bandana masks, more gameplay.\n\nAdditionally, the extra time they took with the PC version didn't seem to do much. My favorite holdover from the 360 version this is clearly ported over from is that in multiplayer, you will constantly have "LB" displayed by your crosshair to remind you that you can press LB to throw your grenade.

I read some of the development note while the title was being developed and hoped that the PC version would have a bit more than the consoles as it relates to in game options. The game is a rail shooter and your options are really scripted.  The player’s involvement is simply one of timing as when to initiate an action. There is no planning stage where you can attack a known objective from any of 100 different approaches; it is much scripted in that respect. The performance out the gate was not very good for Nvidia users. The textures were smeared and the frames per second were very poor.

Buying it last year seemed like a decent game for 10 euros.\n\nTo begin with the issues the game has are as follows: after you download the game you need a Uplay account in order to play the game, otherwise the game won't start... And even with that the game has many graphical issues with my GTX 580, sometimes the display driver stops working and other unnecessary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t happens. And sometimes the game gets awful graphical issues and look I can play games like Wolfenstein: The New Order without issues or Company of Heroes 2. The game has awful mechanics and the controls are straight from the console version.\n\nThen the actual game, the storyline seems alright even tough there are clichés within the game... Russia starting WW3 and typical ploy from western media. But the gameplay, it's nothing like the previous Ghost Recon games! The stealth is almost non-existent except for few levels (where you infiltrate the airport) and the stealth mechanics don't work always, even you use camo and act as discreet as you can the enemies still spot you and the mission gets scrubbed.\n\nThe checkpoints are fine as long as they work, sometimes it didn't even allow me to save the damn game which made me really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off! Thanks alot Ubisoft for making this crappy game! I'd rather get those 10 bucks back than play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nIf you want my advice, steer well clear of the PC version and if you happen to own a PS3 or an Xbox 360 this game might be the thing for you. I bought the game few years ago on my PS3 and it did work fine except some minor issues with the game bugging on a few scenes but don't worry it's not as bad as the PC version.\n\n","April 7, 2015","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(If you want to buy this just for it's multi, I suggest looking at other avenues)\n\nOther - I found the cut scenes are low res something Ubi needs to fix. Game felt a little raily in terms, Go here, stand there to proceed to the next part, which is fair enough. Game is a little slow to start with, continue onwards it gets better. Uplay needs to go and as mentioned below Ubi doesn't need it, could be a better experience loading without it, game works without faults to date.\n\nOverall - One of Ubisoft's better games, I do wish they would take it out of Uplay which is dam annoying, you cross over steam to login to Uplay just to play, isn't to much of a hassel once you put Uplay on auto login when you fire up Ghost on steam.\n\nMore importantly Tom Clancy series is one of the best out there and I enjoy alot of this content from both Ubi and Tom, it tells a good story and puts it into motion leaving you with a sense of awesomeness.\n\nVerdict  7/10 , This would have earned 8 of 10 if the multiplayer was way up, even a 9 if it wasn't tied to Uplay.","March 16, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Success depends on being able to understand the various, easy-to-basically-grasp techniques available to you, and how to put them all together to deal with different situations. Cover-to-cover movement and shooting are, of course, critical, but you also need to be able to use your gear and team intelligently. In particular, the sync-shot mechanic is key, and manages to stay fresh through the game by way of not being overused. Also, the ability to customize your weapons to fit your style is very welcome. There's just enough customization depth to be interesting without it all becoming overwhelming.\n\nThe downside to the game is that it's just a touch too linear and constrained for this kind of gameplay. It would have been brilliant to be given a list of objectives, plopped into a huge map, and given free reign to figure out your mission. Instead, you mostly get herded into restricted spaces so that you can be presented with a series of highly defined tactical puzzles. The viable solutions to these tactical puzzles seem to be pretty small in number, especially when an enemy alert will fail the mission. You either do things in the one right way...or you try again.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me particularly as feeling a bit odd was the "body discovered" mechanic. There were several spots throughout the game where I simply could not figure out how the enemy had located a dead comrade. The ability to spot a body seems to be driven less by intelligent AI and more by fixed, programmatic factors that aren't necessarily easy to suss out. I could swear that there was more than one occasion where a body was discovered by a soldier who was looking in the opposite direction, and through concrete. (Another thing that hurts suspension of disbelief is the apparent ability for an enemy grunt to see a body...and then immediately devine the exact location of everyone on your team. It feels bizarre.)\n\nUltimately, GR:FS is a little overscripted for being a stealth tactics game - but it's still quite enjoyable.","March 17, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a decent PC port though but Ubisoft still dropped the ball with that franchise.\n\nControls work most of the time. Graphics are tight for the character models, some environnment settings (some 'cause you can still see some low resolution ground and wall textures). Guns are great, feel great and even sounds great! The customization part is very nice. The game is quite easy and take you by the hand most of the time.\n\nAs a GAME, FS is fun for a military GoW clone. But... as a GHOST RECON game, this one is  a joke. No FPS mode and lots of dumbing down annoyed me very much.\n\nHaven't tried MP and won't!\n\nI'd recommend ONLY if you crave that kind of game and also, if it's on a good sale!\n\n6.5 / 10","November 19, 2012","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A stealth shooter?  A shooter where you remain hidden most of the time and only engage open combat when things go wrong?  That is what I expected.\n\nThings started off well enough.  You were sneaking around and you got some nice toys to play with.  However as the game progressed, it became more of an action shooter with a very small stealth component.  Did you carefully pick off your targets to clean out that seemingly impossible area?  Well sometimes the game says FU, combat starts anyway.\n\nSo your lightly armored squad survived that onslaught of men?  Ok, now we are going to throw vehicles in.  Still alive?  Next time you will also have clock, so you got to do it in 3 minutes or less.  To the developer who did that final level with the last general, I say thanks for the total BS level that has absolutely nothing to do with “Ghost Recon”.\n\nOverall this game is more of an action shooter with a dwindling stealth component (one later level being an exception).  I think the game is about 8 to 10 hours long.  Steam just tracked it as being played when the UBI soft launcher was loaded, not when I was playing the game.  If you want a real stealth recon game, then I would suggest you pass on this title unless it is dirt cheap.  If you just want any old shooter FPS with a stealth component, then you be the judge for 8 to 10 hours.\n","April 20, 2013","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It makes the game completely un-fun to play.\n\nHaving played the console version of this game, I can see that little effort was put into the port; even there, pushing around the left analog stick to move your dude was the most sluggish, unresponsive input I've ever seen in a game. This still holds true here. Hitting WASD and ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO COUNT THE TIME UNTIL YOUR DUDE MOVES is unacceptable, Ubisoft. It's the floatiest, loosiest, goosiest, and most un-fun way to control a shooter, and I can't in my right mind convince myself that it's in any way enjoyable.\n\nOh, and the windowed mode support is horrible; where is the borderless option?\n\nThis is a terrible port by a company known for terrible PC support, and I should've seen it coming before dropping a whole $5 I could've spent on a nice lunch instead. Unless Ubisoft plans to support PC players and fix this damn game, I'm never buying another Ubisoft game again. I've done it with EA, I won't have a problem doing it with Ubisoft.","February 23, 2014","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play alone or with up to 3 friends in COOP.\nThere is a Multiplayer Mode as well, but I will disregard it at this point in time, because nearly no one is playing it any more.\n\nPlease be also notified that this is an Ubisoft Game and therefore ships with their awful Uplay DRM.\n\nThe Game plays like your average 3rd Person Shooter, quite like Gears of War or Halo. Now you say: "These are Console Franchises" and you would be quiet right. Because it also plays really Console like, with all its "benefits".\nThere are the not really Mouse controlled Menus, the Console Graphics and just awful rail shooter passages.  In Addition to that, the Game constantly tries to shove its little Gadgets and Mechanics (that would otherwise be quiet nice to have) down your throat and therefore accomplishes a thing that no Game should. It begins to annoy very quickly...\nBut there’s not only downsides to the Game. The Gunplay is kind of OK. The Story is, so much uninspired, not so bad. And there is a COOP, which for the most time works quite well.\n\n\nPro:\n-COOP\n-weapon customization\n-weapon variety\n\nContra:\n-buggy COOP\n-too easy with bots (Sync shot)\n-clunky console like controls\n-bad graphics\n-not what the Franchise stands for\n-RAIL SHOOTER passages!!!\n\nSo no Recommendation here.

The issues on PC are so far gone that it makes it utterly unplayable. My PC specs exceed the requirements for the game, but it still won't work properly. Ubisoft has cut off support for the game- quite some time ago it seems- and ever since I bought the game on 12/14/2012 I have been unable to proceed past the first mission. Launching the game from steam, into ubisoft's own browser is already ridiculous enough. However, once in game it quite honestly becomes a lag-ridden rollercoaster. I literally bought a new computer just to play this game. It still won't run properly. (But GTA V does). The 6hours or so that I have on record are all repeating the first. Bloody. Mission. In wasted attempts to find some way to get the game working properly. When looking online after giving up on Ubisoft support- since sadly, the usually helpful steam support does not cover this particular game- it appears that almost everyone else who has bought this game FOR PC finds it unplayable. However the console version is, apparently, awesome. Amusingly, the multiplayer part of the game runs better than the singleplayer; I was able to get a full hour of actual playtime before the game decided not to allow me to even boot up the multiplayer anymore.\n\nTL;DR...

It's on the linear side for sure, this is nothing like the old Rainbow Six games in terms of tactics/planning, but that's not a bad thing. Lots of cool guns and near-future military tech, if you enjoy that sort of thing then there's a lot here to nerd out about. Gun customization feature is particularly cool. Sync shot is neat but I already feel like it's overused and the novelty wears off quick. Game definitely gives you the feeling of being a tier one badass - when you're sneaking around African camps with cloaking devices and x-ray vision your enemies are almost hopelessly outmatched, and it's quite fun.\n\nNot the best console port though. There's still an "LB" button on a constantly present part of the UI, the whole single player campaign still has this "party" element (I don't need to wait 5 seconds for other players to join when I'm playing it by myself) and controls are weird sometimes (there was one part where I was apparently supposed to aim a missile and I had no idea what was going on in terms of controls).\n\nOverall though I think this is a solid single player experience if you like military shooters.","June 29, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've honestly had less issues with GFWL than Uplay.\n\nLack of dedicated servers - yes... no dedicated servers of ANY kind. everything is P2P and more often than not you'll be playing with very high ping unless you are in the US or Russia (since thats the only kind of people that play GR games for some reason... it really baffles me... but anyway)\n\nMultiplayer - usually I'd put this as a good thing but here are a few major design flaws when it comes to Multiplayer...  there are 3 game types that you can play online: Campaign, Survival, and PvP\n\nCampaign. usually would be a cool thing playing with up to 3 friends. the main issue with it however is that Campaign is an INVITE ONLY system. meaning you CAN NOT make a public campain session. its acually impossible to do. so unless you have friends that you've made while playing PvP or bought the game already with a few mates. you'll never play campaign with anyone.\n\nSurvival. lots of wasted potential here if you ask me. the mode itself is rather solid. however I do have a few gripes with the mode as a whole... the first and (biggest) issue is like the campaign it is INVITE ONLY. so once again unless you have friends already, you'll never play with anyone else... secondly it basially throws the customisation system completely out the window. at the end of each wave a box of supplies will come down and you choose from a SMALL selection of weapons to use... yeah they change at set intervals but you cannot change the weapon attachments or anything... what is in the list is what you get, no if's and's or but's... I mean come on... at least give us the chance to go in with OUR OWN CUSTOMISED WEAPONS FFS....\n\nPvP. as a whole I'd say PvP is pretty good (when it works) the classes have their own strengths. the maps are nicely varied (though I think they have a few too many choke points... if one team has the area locked down you are gona be pretty damn pressed to make ANY progress what so ever... having said that if you communicate and work as a team with your fellow allies you can turn tides... IF you communicate...\n\nthe other issue that makes it virtually impossible to play online (at least for me) is the fact it is P2P in its matchmaking. not only have they segmented the community with the map packs but unless you have an open NAT (which is rather difficult to get with my experience with THIS particular title, never had issues in any other game) you'll have a VERY hard time finding a game to play....\n\nI'll give you a quick example of my online experience the last 4 times I've tried to play this game online.\n\nGet into MP\nFind a match...\n7 mins later gets into a lobby with 4 people...\nspend 10 mins waiting for more people to come because you at LEAST need 8 people total for a game to start (or is it 6 I cant remember at this point)\npeople leave the lobby making it take even more time to fill in the slots needed\n20 mins later FINALLY get enough people. the game begins to load.\nloading screen\nConnection to Host has been lost\ngoes back to main menu.\n\nthat has literally been my experience trying to play an online game the last 4 times I've tried to play.\n\n\n\nCan I recommend the game?\n\nIts honestly difficult to say... GRFS was not as it was first advertised to be (much like Space Marine) some aspects of the game are great while others are simply appalling.\n\nIF you get the game with some friends so you can all play together through Campaign and survival (and if you have enough to party up to do PvP... sure. go right ahead, I think you guys will have a blast.\n\nif you don't care about MP at all, sure if the game is on sale... other than the challenges to unlock different weapons and attachments for campaign... replay value is limited if you ask me because the levels are rather linier with little freedom to actually tackle things differently. (sure you can but you will be going out of your way to do so from my experience)\n\nit is a waste of potential at the end of the day not to mention a very average at best port to PC. it was unplayable when it first came out....\n\n\n","July 6, 2015","false","55.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was a little annoyed to find I had to delete and then reinstall the game to complete the challenge. still, this was better than not achieving that one last elusive challenge. I like the DLC content as well. I thought the gameplay was great and particulary liked the squad takedown function as well as the auto cover ability. really disapointed that Ghost Recon : Future Soldier wasn't extended ever further. All in all I would recommend this game for those who enjoy some of the stealth    options you can use here","December 18, 2015","true","335.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess I should start off with that the game looks good, I like the designs of the futuistic gear you get to play around with and the gunsmithing is also neat.\n\nBut what I HATE about this game is that its not really a tactical stealth game, and it is so heavily scripted it hurts the soul. Basic mission is that you arrive into an area, and now you have to sneak (i.e shoot everyone without his buddies noticing) and it sounds good, but its scripted. You can only sneak in ceartain areas and once you're outside the "sneak zones" of the mission the baddies suddenly know where you are if you shoot one of them.\n\nHere is an example: The mission was on a ship, I had just snuck around inside the ship with a silenced weapons and the mission had taken me to a catwalk on the outside of the ship with 6 baddies and a catwalk on the other side of the ship. With some manuvering I managed to sync kill 4 of them and then full auto gun the last two with a silenced smg. Despite slaughtering the guards within a second, still I was somehow seen. How? Simple I was outside the "sneaking section" of that mission, it was time for action as waves of baddies was storming onto the other catwalk with sniper rifles.","August 29, 2015","false","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The issues on PC are so far gone that it makes it utterly unplayable. My PC specs exceed the requirements for the game, but it still won't work properly. Ubisoft has cut off support for the game- quite some time ago it seems- and ever since I bought the game on 12/14/2012 I have been unable to proceed past the first mission. Launching the game from steam, into ubisoft's own browser is already ridiculous enough. However, once in game it quite honestly becomes a lag-ridden rollercoaster. I literally bought a new computer just to play this game. It still won't run properly. (But GTA V does). The 6hours or so that I have on record are all repeating the first. Bloody. Mission. In wasted attempts to find some way to get the game working properly. When looking online after giving up on Ubisoft support- since sadly, the usually helpful steam support does not cover this particular game- it appears that almost everyone else who has bought this game FOR PC finds it unplayable. However the console version is, apparently, awesome. Amusingly, the multiplayer part of the game runs better than the singleplayer; I was able to get a full hour of actual playtime before the game decided not to allow me to even boot up the multiplayer anymore.\n\nTL;DR...

It's on the linear side for sure, this is nothing like the old Rainbow Six games in terms of tactics/planning, but that's not a bad thing. Lots of cool guns and near-future military tech, if you enjoy that sort of thing then there's a lot here to nerd out about. Gun customization feature is particularly cool. Sync shot is neat but I already feel like it's overused and the novelty wears off quick. Game definitely gives you the feeling of being a tier one badass - when you're sneaking around African camps with cloaking devices and x-ray vision your enemies are almost hopelessly outmatched, and it's quite fun.\n\nNot the best console port though. There's still an "LB" button on a constantly present part of the UI, the whole single player campaign still has this "party" element (I don't need to wait 5 seconds for other players to join when I'm playing it by myself) and controls are weird sometimes (there was one part where I was apparently supposed to aim a missile and I had no idea what was going on in terms of controls).\n\nOverall though I think this is a solid single player experience if you like military shooters.","June 29, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
