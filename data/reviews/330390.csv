"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaizard27/recommended/330390/","vaizard27","Vaizard27","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaizard27/","699 products in account","Short Version:\nIf you played oldschool JRPGs but never played Grandia II, get this game!\nIf you like RPGs and look for an interesting turnbased/realtime combat-system mix, get this game!\nIn my opinion, this is one of the best JRPGs ever made, with quite certainly the best combat system.\n\nLonger Version:\nMy gametime doesn't tell, but I played through this game multiple times when it was originally released, so bear with me.\n\nPros:\nAwesome Storytelling:\nThere are multiple voiced dialogues and this version actually comes with the original Japanese voices, a great plus for me who only knew the sometimes a bit wooden english voiceovers.\nThe story itself is pretty awesome and told in some kind of episodic format with the characters on your team rotating throughout the story, you get to know these characters not only through simple cutscenes, but, what for me at the time was mindblowing, through conversations around the campfire when they are resting. Yes there are multiple games that use this mechanic, but for me Grandia was the first I ever experienced, so it made the whole thing even more enjoyable.\n\nThe Characters:\nWhile all of them are to a certain part classic JRPG tropes like the damsel in distress, the revenge driven clanleader, and the grumpy sellsword, each of them has facettes to their character you would probably not expect on the first glace. Each character has an interesting backstory and evolves a lot during the remainder of the game.\n\nThe combat system:\nOhh boy, where do I start. This system is in my opinion one of the best, if not the best, that has ever been created, the perfect mix between tactical turnbased and realtime combat.\nOkay nostalgia aside, I still believe this is one of the best systems I ever had the pleasure to play, it builds a lot around tactic instead of pure damage dealing and overlevelling your characters like a ton of other JRPGs. Instead of grinding it's just as effective to wrap your head around positioning, not just of your characters but also your enemies, and timing.\nWhile on first look quite simple the system has a lot of depth, with crowd control, animation-cancels, AOE-spells, a counter and a combo mechanic. There are so many different utility items it melts your brain considering the possibilities.\nAnd the bossfights are just a blast, the mechanics they employ to make the fights different are amazing. And because of the emergent complexity of the combat system there are multiple ways to kill bosses as well.\n\nGearing and customization:\nAs I said in the combat section already, this game is deep. There are multiple ways to build each character depending on what you are looking for.\nIn the game you can find so called eggs. Think of them as power-items that give your characters special magical abailities. Some are build around healing, others around damage, yet again some around meele and afflictions.\nWhile there are the obvious choices some fairly interesting and highly effective combinations are possible.\nDifferent weapons in this game can actually affect how a character fights and what he can do, it's important to think about your current team composition as well as their gear and skills when fighting, especially in the bossfights. Oh and do not sell your resistance gear, you will need it.\n\n\nCons:\nYes the game is not perfect, here are some things that people might find annoying:\n\nOverpowered Items:\nI think this is something the new hardmode will (hopefully at some point, when it's more than just 20% more hP for enemies) fix, but there are a few Items in the game that are just insanely powerful. While the maximum damage per attack is capped at a certain level those items can reach those amounts already early in the game and oneshot a lot of enemies and make bossfights significantly easier.\n\nAnnoying character tropes:\nIf you do not like a Damsel-Priestess and a Tsundere as your main female characters, you are probably going to have a baaaad time. While their characters get deeper later on, especially in the beginning they can be annoying.\n\nSlow start:\nThe first hour of the game is dialogues and some 1 or 2 serious fights (there are other fights but you pretty much 2-shot everything). Give the game time, as soon as your party is full and the story gets going the combat system becomes extremely rewarding.\n\nCombat camera:\nThis... thing... was/is the only letdown about the combat system. It's not that it makes the game unplayable, it's just annoying, because sometime you do not see everything. But as soon as an enemy acts the camera usually zooms out and shows you what you need to see to make a decision, sometimes it can mess up your tactics though, if you "forgot" there was another enemy.\n\nVisuals:\nI'm glad they took the "HD Remake" off the title. It looks slightly better than I remember and runs on 1920x1080 (with black borders because of 4:3) on solid 30 FPS, but well it looks very, very dated. Also no 60fps, 4k, or widescreen... but... well, it's still pretty damn beautiful!\n\nSo yeah, do I recommend this: Hell yeah! If you like oldschool JRPGs and never Played this, get it right now.","August 24, 2015","true","1.1"," 104 of 110 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","104","110","2","2"

Now that I've completed it again, I can tell you it's not just the nostalgia speaking.\n\nPROS:\n- The game has aged surprisingly well.\n- The combat is fast paced and has light tactical elements\n- The story is phenomenal\n\nCONS:\n- The Hut of Trials mini game is beyond annoying\n- There is an issue with playing FMVs, after the fmv has completed the game will hang for about 10 seconds\n- As with most JRPGs the special attack animations wear out their welcome rather quickly\n- There are various graphical and animation glitches\n\nFurther explanation of the pros and cons follow.\nThis game has aged well, much better than other classics in the genre.  The graphics are much easier on the eyes than the release date would imply.  The combat is very fun, not until the very end of the game was I skipping fights.  The story has a decent pacing to it.  The third act does outstay its welcome though.  The game just does not seem to know when it should end.  Overall, it's an excellent experience.\n\nThe Hut of Trials mini game is the worst part of the game and it's not even remotely close.  Let me begin by saying this, I've never enjoyed mini games in JRPGs, so take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt.  The whole structure of this mini game bewilders me.  You have to talk to someone to get into the Hut, at which point you walk up some stairs and into the hut.  Once inside you're greeted by another dialogue box which then leads you into the cavern where the actual mini game is.  But it doesn't stop there, no, you have to read a stone tablet and then wait for this furry thing to go open the mini game door.  Once inside the mini game, it's a pretty run of the mill JRPG mini game, nothing special.  Once you complete the mini game you go outside and what is your reward?  You get to watch the furry thing(s) dance for ten or so seconds before it opens the exit.  Once you proceed, you must walk to the end of another cave and then be sprung out of the cavern.  You're then greeted by a manimal that gives you your actual reward.  Now, if it was just a one time thing to get all of your rewards from the mini game, that wouldn't be awful, not ideal but certainly not awful.  Nope, you have to go multiple times to get every reward from the mini game.  It's a time consuming, poorly thought out exercise in frustration.  It takes longer to enter and exit the mini game than it does to play it, meaning, you'll never get successive tries, even if you fail.\n\nAnother frustrating issue with the game is the bug that causes the game to hang after playing FMVs.  Which only seems to occur after a bit of playtime, it's not going to happen on your first few fights.  It's a huge issue in the later game.  I would honestly say the fights last on average 10-20 seconds longer than they should.  However, the boss battles will last minutes longer than they should.  It's easily fixed by closing the game and opening it again.  The problem, however, lies in the fact that there are set save locations and exiting is not always an option.\n\nThe special moves outlive their welcome just like any other game in the genre, the problem is compounded by the brief hang after every move that has an FMV in it, which are quite a few.  Nothing surprising here, typical gripe about games in the genre that came out around the same time as this game.\n\nThe graphics for the most part are solid for the age of the game.  I did, however, notice many instances of the camera clipping through the scenery during cutscenes, animation hangs during cutscenes, and like one or two instances of z-fighting.  Honestly, pretty solid game even given the handful of times these issues occur.\n\nOverall, I fully expect the FMV hanging issue to be resolved, the Hut of Trials mini game is only mandatory once, the specials will be fixed along with the FMV bug and the graphical glitches aren't anything to get worked up over. The pros far outweigh the cons.\n\nVerdict:  Buy this game!","August 29, 2015","true","26.6"," 68 of 74 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","68","74","2","0"

Grandia IMO has one of the best combat systems in RPG history. The story alone is very well done, and there is a lot of interaction between characters and NPC. Gungho has worked really hard to fix the bugs that exsisted when it first came to Steam and i have to give them so many props for that. I couldn't play the original PC version back in the day (still have my CDs) because of bad memory leaks and crashes, i am grateful to finally be able to play the PC version as it should be. With the added bonus of a Hard difficulty.\n\nTips for newbies: GRIND, GRIND, GRIND! You don't have to go nuts, but getting Ryudos Tenseikin Slash up to Max early on in game is a handy stradegy. Once you get to Baked Planes, you can also farm Defense Seeds from the enemies there if you choose to. Make sure you save your Skill Points and Magic Coins, i personally have this thing where i don't spend until i get to around 2,000 of both so i can max out a skill or magic right away - early game.\n\nAlso, check everywhere, it is really easy to miss things on the map such as armor and Poff nuts.\n\nIf you want a challenge, you can keep pressing on, but bosses can pose a major problem especially with cancel spells.\n\nAll in all, this game speaks massive nostalgia. If you love classic games and JRPGs in general, Grandia is for you. Grandia plays differently from most RPGs in a good way.\n\nThank you Gungho for continuing to patch the bugs and for keeping us updated! Kudos.\n\nOpinion still Stands after completing the game on Normal Diffcutly, i will be doing this again on Hard.","October 12, 2015","true","54.9"," 41 of 42 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","41","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/330390/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4010 products in account","What is Grandia® II Anniversary Edition?\n\nIt is a port of Grandia II that has some technical issues but is as of the current patch 1.7 in a good state. The major issue, a desync of background music in cutscenes that only is really bothering in one or two of them, however will most likely not be fixed.\n\nGrandia II was a Dreamcast RPG, featuring the Geohound - hand for hire - Ryudo in his quest to save the Songstress Elena when she visits a ceremony. Of course, the ceremony goes wrong and it soon is apparent that the whole world might be in danger.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are for their time nicely done 3D maps with animated videos for spells. They fit in nicely into the battles, but have to be watched every single time, which can be around 20 seconds, depending on the spell. From today's perspective, the graphics don't hold up anymore, but a lot is done with mimics in speech boxes, which works very fine until today. However, in the 3D world the characters are without a proper face, it very much looks dated nowadays. Everything looks flat with some objects put on top of that, very unreal and in some cases even the textures can clearly be seen repeating.\n\nMusic and Sound: The sound still holds up, the music is excellent, but the voice acting only happens at certain points and then also partially inconsistent - not in quality which is very high, but in which scenes are acted and which are without voice. All in all, there could have been more, but what is there is very well done. The voice actors know how to express emotions.\n\nGameplay: Well, the gameplay is simple. You walk around, fight, etc. - standard RPG gameplay. The world is very linear, backtracking is quasi nil as every few levels or so the previous ones can't be accessed anymore. Still the levels are worth exploring because almost everywhere is another item to be found. Some of the puzzles are interesting, but usually they are just "press button X to open door Y". There are a two minigames but they exhaust themselves fast - you can do an arm wrestling and a nut catching which is both fun for a bit, but especially in the nut catching case gets boring fast. One can say the gameplay is mainly based on the story, and that is one that is well written, holds a few surprises, but may be predictable for people who know their RPG tropes. There are saving points where one can completely recover himself, and they are never too rare. At the least it has a lot of character development, and the characters grow to your heart - and each others...\n\nBattle System: So the battle system is where the game will fall or stand. All battles are done on a 2D plane with a maximum of 4 vs. 6 characters (one boss has more than 6, but that is an exception). Every character, monster or player, advances on an IP scale in the UI that determines when he can attack. The clou is that you have a certain distance between command and attack, so if you time it right, you can attack while the enemy is in that distance. This slows the enemy for a moment or if you do certain attacks costs him quite some space there, canceling his attack as well. You find books and eggs during the game that give additional attributes to your character or magic. Good: Every character can equip every egg, skills in the books can be individually equipped. So do you want rather the egg with few attacks but a lot of healing to be used by Ryudo or Elena? And what egg should the other characters use?\nRPG typically there are some status effects and bonuses you can apply during the battle or granted by what you wear. For example, if you sleep or are paralyzed your character moves to the very back of the IP gauge and can't do anything until healed. A special status only for enemies is being spellbound. It is applied by only one special attack and it has pretty much only one use in the game - but that one is needed if you play on hard.\nWhat also must be noted is that characters that stand close together or in a line can be hit by spells with that range, others target the whole party or just a single character, so it has another tactical component there as well. In many cases you will just use the magic or move that kills all enemies at once, however, and it flattens to choosing the spell based on if it is the special range (read: circle around the enemy) or all enemies.\n\nThe hard mode is a new addition to the game, not seen in the original. It makes enemies tougher, adjusts their stats, etc. With this, the game becomes challenging at times, before it was just a breeze to go through and now it is mostly a breeze to go through, but gets tricky towards the end. Better don't waste your good irreplacable items, especially those that fill up your points for the special attacks, or you will find yourself in need of them eventually! Yes, this is pretty much one of the very few games where I had to use items in a battle to win.\n\nSo what do I think about the game? It is marvellous, a masterpiece, despite its flaws. When it comes to the actual gameplay, the story is paced good enough to keep one going, and only gets annoying when there is an overly long sequence without a saving point. The battle system is well done and motivating, the possibility to level up what you want to use instead of just being it granted by level or item does the game very good. All in all I can only recommend this game. I paid 15 Euro for it and I feel that it was worth the price, even though I had played it long long ago in the earlier PC release.\n\nSince this is the only version with the hard mode, this version is the way to go. Alternatively you can try the earlier version and find a mod that makes it challenging, or just play through it as it originally was and don't expect a challenge.\n\nRecommended? Yes! The game is around 30 hours long (hard mode), then you have all achievements and no replayability, but those 30 hours are great.","November 15, 2015","true","35.4"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","41","44","2","3"

There is no God."\nOh, Grandia II! One of the best games from my childhood that were fortunately ported by GungHo America to Steam. Originally a Dreamcast title released in 2001, ported later to the PS2 in 2002 and later to Steam as the Anniversary Edition in 2015, this classic JRPG still holds well even after 15 years of it's initial release, mostly for it's memorable story and innovative combat system!\n\nThe story in Grandia II revolves around Ryudo, a Geohound (a sort of bounty hunter in the Grandia universe), moved around from place to place, taking requests the normal folks would generally despise. One day, he received a letter of invitation, or a job request, to escort a band of Sisters of Granas for their usual prayer ritual from the nearby village. Things unfortunately went south and from a basic escort job, Ryudo is now stuck in a potential catastrophic event that may decimate the world.\n\nBefore moving on to the pros and cons, I would just like to mention that I may be bias in recommending this as this game is held dearly by me as one of my favorite titles ever but I'll try to point out all the positive and negative aspects of this port.\n\nPROS As I've mentioned earlier, this game has an absolute BRILLIANT story! The plot itself is captivating with a mind bending plot twist occurring at the second half of the game. I've played a lot of RPGs and I can firmly say that Grandia II has definitely one of the best ones!\nEvery playable characters are surprisingly lovable! From the sarcastic and no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Ryudo to the calm and wise Mareg, every character stands out on their own and their lines perfectly matched with their attitude that Game Arts portrayed them to be.\nOne more thing about the characters are their lines. Seriously, read them all if you can! You can find tidbits of Ryudo and Helena's love-hate relationship, Mareg's pearls of wisdom, Millenia's flirty-but-chaotic tone. Even talking with NPCs will net you awesome dialogues between the characters! (PRO TIP: Make sure to talk to everyone at least TWICE. There's always 2 or 3 different conversations you can have each time you talk to anyone)\nInnovative and dynamic combat system! I think this one is what separate Grandia II with the other RPGs at the time. What I mean by dynamic is that everyone moves freely in the battlefield during their turn. Instead of the usual turn-based battles (a la ATB from the Final Fantasy series), once the character's turn is reached, they will run forward to their enemy to land the blows. This makes it interesting since the character, implied to both friendlies and foes, can miss or evade just by moving a bit. Also, another interesting mechanic in combat is the Cancel system. Every character have the basic Combo or Critical attack to use each turn. The Critical is weaker from the pair, since it only hit once, but when used when an opponent's turn, it will cancel the said turn, shoving the said opponent queue lower and allows for tactical comeback.\nGreat character's customization via skills and magic equip. In Grandia, magic comes from an equip Mana Egg you'll find across the game. Each have different spells, whether offensive or defensive, and can be equip by anyone, in AND out of battles! So basically, any character can be a healer or damager, with the limiting factors comes only with the mana pool and the character's stats. Same goes with skills, where upon finding and leveling up skill books, you can equip skills to boost the character's ability on what build you decide to use on him/her.\nBasically an all around decent port with a few minor quirks (I'll list them down in the Cons). During the whole 40 hours of my playtime, the game never crashed on me once. There's also an option to turn on VSync and Anti-aliasing via an external launcher.\nThe game supports both Japanese and English voice over. I used the Japanese voices most of the time since I forgot how cringey the English voice actors sound in the game (still good compared to the other JRPGs at the time though). I switch to English only when there's a plot heavy cut scene comes up because they don't have subs for it. The option is available via the said external launcher.\nFull controller support (I used the standard XBOX 360 controller) with customizable buttons.\nAn option to play in Hard Mode right off the bat. I suggest going for this since the game is quite easy once you got the hang of the mechanics.\nA perfect 100% game is moderately easy to achieve in one play. I took a little bit over the 40 hours mark in Hard Mode to complete the game with all the achievements unlocked. Surprisingly, it only took me a a little grind to get the 2000 enemies killed. Of course, you have to look in very nook and cranny for hidden treasures to ensure you didn't missed any specific ones, namely the "Bling" and "Put A Notch in it" achievements.\nNEUTRAL In combat, the HP bar for ALL enemies is shown clearly to you, even bosses! Bosses with > 9999 HP will be shown as ????/???? but with the bars shown, you can estimate when he's going to die. It's useful but I think it dissolve the suspense that the usual RPG boss fights have.\nCONS The biggest pet peeve I have with this game is that it doesn't support a native widescreen support. Sure, you can change the resolution and toggle the widescreen option but what it does is just stretch the aging 4:3 camera, making the game unbearably ugly. If the widescreen toggle is turned off, you'll have to settle playing with a letterbox resolution to the end.\nThe Japanese voice over is not sync with the English dialogue. The voice get cuts over prematurely if the text advances way faster than the actual voices. It doesn't happen when you're using the English voice though.\nCamera controls in the fields and dungeons are frustrating and dizzying at times. Since the developers tend to hid items behind walls, you have to rotate the camera nonstop to spot it and it's annoying. Also, the camera zooms in on Ryudo when you stopped moving even for a second.\nSome text glitched out passed the text box.\n30 FPS-locked. Yeap, it's still there. It's nothing major really but the characters does seems floaty at time during walking. Good thing is that battles runs in fully glorious 60 FPS! That's why it feels fast and frantic at times.\nAlthough the game runs smoothly at 30 and 60 FPS, there's a few area (namely the snowy mountains) where the FPS drops a bit. Not really important but I supposed I should mention it.\nOpening the save and loading screens took ages!\nThe field interactions are unnecessarily and painfully SLOW! For example, when you're climbing a ladder, everyone will take turns to slowly navigate the ladder and you CAN'T move until everyone's done. Missed something up there? You might as well go and order takeouts in the meantime.\nTextures sometimes glitched out and you can see through walls (whoa)\nIn combat, the game shows exactly what your opponents will do, even when it's not their turn yet. Even though it does make things simpler, I think it just ruins the difficulty. (Oh, the boss is using his ultimate move after this? Let's Cancel it!)\nTo conclude, even with the minor technical quirks and aging game engine, I give Grandia II Anniversary Edition a nostalgic and epic 5/5! Truly a masterpiece of a JRPG!\nTo the fan of the series and also JRPG fans, I can assure you that the money spent is well worth it! I would also recommend to use Leandro Eidi's HD Mod where it adds a few nice little HD touch to the apparently aging game.","March 28","true","40.4"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","42","47","3","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/recommended/330390/","jedo","Black Mage Jedo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/","3564 products in account","Before I review this game, I want to point out that I didn't have nearly as many game-breaking issues as some of my peers. I have seen some horrific bug reports and I feel relieved that I have only experienced 3 minor crashes during my 2 playthroughs (currently 1.5).\n\nContent-wise, this is the almost the same as what you could expect from a Grandia title. My focus will be on my overall experience after replaying this game on Steam.\n\nPros:\n- I had almost no issues with the achievements. Considering the humongous bug report thread, I was expecting to run into more trouble with this particular feature. Hurricane Belt was added in one of the achievement descriptions even though it does not exist in the game. Thankfully, they removed it within a day and it seems that my peers are able to obtain the achievement without issues.\n- The story is easy to follow. It's about the mutual existence and importance of good and evil.\n- For a JRPG, this is not as grindy as the rest of the games within the genre. This is a plus for me.\n- The Japanese voice actors are very good. I actually switched straight to Japanese after hearing Skye talk in English for the first time. Thankfully, the original cast did not disappoint.\n\nCons:\n- The battles were too easy even on hard mode.\n- Elemental weaknesses can almost be ignored. The fire element can carry you through 80% of the game.\n- The audio levels need to be adjusted! Footsteps sound louder than almost everything else.\n- There's no secondary check for the item collector achievement. I currently have a save file with all 3 belts required for an achievement. Despite this, the game does not award the achievement properly. I am currently replaying the game to make 'checkpoints' to try and remedy this.\n- Many, many, many bugs. Check the forum. The publishers are currently trying to slowly fix them all.\n\nFinal Verdict: Wait a bit before buying this game. It remains to be seen how proactive the publishers will be in rolling out patches for this game to fix the big list of issues. I am recommending this game <pending the update fixes>.","August 31, 2015","true","61.3"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","35","39","0","1"

I was obsessed with this game when I was a freshman in college. Incidentally, the semester during which I beat it also happens to be the semester in which I scored the lowest grades. There may be a connection there.\n\nThing is, it was worth it. Grandia II may seem like a prototypical JRPG, but here's the rub: just about everything about it is GREAT. The music, the story, the writing... it's all top notch. The adventure becomes insanely epic as you progress through the tale, and the whole affair is smarter than your average game, with commentary on religion, judgemental preconceptions, and social class playing out through crisp dialogue. Said dialogue is frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious.\n\nOne of Grandia II's strongest selling points is how it takes the typical RPG caveats and streamlines them, and it's so much more fun as a result. The menus are very intuitive and easy to navigate; it's all very clear and easy to pick up. Encounters are not random; though random encounters never bothered me, here the encounter system is implemented brilliantly, where approaching from behind gives you initiative (think Ni No Kuni) while being approached from behind reduces your initiative from the start.\n\nOther refinements that streamline the experience include how inns give you the option of restoring your health AND saving, instead of just one or the other. Same with save points. Yoan's Elixer, which revives fallen characters like Phoenix Downs, actually restores HP also, so you don't waste a rare item bringing a character back just to watch him get one-hit killed again. There are dozens more ways this game improves on the prototypical RPG formula. And unlike some JRPGs it doesn't take 40 hours for things to get going. The story gets interesting very quickly.\n\nThe battle system is one of the areas in which this JRPG shines the most. It's similar to Child of Light, where you can go for combo attacks and score more damage, or try to time it so critical attacks can cancel an opponent's assault. If you can't execute an attack in time, defending actually works to your advantage in this game, as it significantly lowers the damage you'll take. And if you can time your evades properly, you can avoid damage altogether while simultaneously repositioning yourself on the battle map. Watch out though, your opponents can counter and cancel your attacks as well. It's all extremely well balanced, and becomes real addictive real quick... just ask my freshman self.\n\nGrandia II comes HIGHLY recommended. If you've never tried it, give it an hour and you'll realize why it's so awesome.\n\nNote: As far as I can tell, the resolution and other settings cannot be changed from within the game. Fortunately, all you have to do is navigate to your steamapps folder for Grandia II, and the ini is super easy to find in the config folder. It's also very easy to edit. Change to 1080p for the textures, but I recommend maintaining the original aspect ratio-- it just looks better that way!","August 25, 2015","true","8.5"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","28","31","4","4"

Thankfully for the first week of release the game had a 25% off sale so I couldn't complain about picking up my favourite RPG of all time for a mere £11.\n\nWhen I was looking through the achievement list I was overjoyed to see that there was a hard mode incorporated into the game. Now I'm sure other seasoned veterans of the game also saw this as incentive to buy the game on it's own.\n\nSo my playthrough was on the hard difficulty.\n\nGraphically the game looks fine, however I won't say there aren't faults. There are some real glaring issues with screen tearing at points. I notably remember it was pretty bad during the development on Ceceille Reef and when you are about to fight the Claws of Valmar. Don't get me wrong, these are small issues that I'm sure will be fixed at a later patch.\n\nThe voices are good, I always loved Cam Clarke as Ryudo and especially Jennifer Hale as Elena. The acting is hammy at points but it's a cheesy story, so it's not unwelcome. The music from Noriyuki Iwadare was always one of the selling points of the game, I always had a soft spot for the final boss music. Which leads me onto the next point.\n\nThe difficulty on the hard mode, well for 90% of the game, it's quite unlikely you will notice much difference, regular enemies are still one-shottable from AoE spells if you tune your skills for them. Most bosses aren't really too much different.\nThere are exceptions however which I won't divulge here. I'd like to keep this spoiler free if possible.\n\nThe plot of the game was always one of the high-points of the game. It quite literally is good vs evil, perfectly straightforward without feeling convoluted. There is always a goal in mind which you push towards. However that leads me to a slight grievance. The game is very linear, it doesn't allow for much deviation from the story route. Not like it's a bad thing really as the plot is interesting and if it's your first time playing it I reckon it will keep you captivated the whole time anyway.\n\nThere are some gameplay issues with FMV's as some of the moves/spells incorporate that and it can cause frame delays. I think it's been fixed for the most part with the last patch but I completed the game on patch 1.01 and it hadn't yet. I remember the last boss fight being notably bad for it with 15 - 20 second delays on ending an animation and returning to the fight.\n\nThe developers seem to have a passion for the game which is a good thing as they are actively fixing bugs that are reported on the forums here on Steam. I'm enthusiastic that by the time the game goes on sale again alot of the little problems will have been dealt with. The dream is essentially having this be as good as the original Dreamcast version with the hard mode thrown in for good measure. I have faith that the devs will get this done, it will just take time. Patience while the kinks are worked out is the way to go.\n\nPros:\n+ Best battle system in any RPG.\n+ Story is really enthralling. If you have never cleared this, buy it for this reason alone\n+ Characters are great, very relatable\n+ Music and Voice acting is really good\n+ Active development team actually listens to the fans and fixes problems\n+ Achievements add a bit more to the game. (I could have thought of a good few more though lol)\n\nCons:\n- Graphical tears and other issues involving FMV's can be aggravating\n- Graphics are 15 years old so might be unappealing to some of the newer gamers\n- Heard of game crashes, I never experienced them myself but I have heard others complain about it\n- For the most part Hard isn't really any harder but when it is, the game lets you know swiftly\n- If you don't deviate at all from the story and streamline the game, it only takes about 20 hours to finish\n\nIn conclusion the game has had problems on launch but I don't expect any gamebreakers to be around for longer than a month or two. If you haven't played this game before, BUY IT. The story and characters are some of the richest in any RPG ever. If you have played it before, play it if only for the hard mode. Swag points for completing it on hard after all.\n\nThanks for reading.","September 6, 2015","true","27.4"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","28","32","0","3"

The port runs at 30FPS however this is not a massive hindrance to gameplay. There does appear to be some teething issues with the port for people running the game on slightly older hardware, though they appear to be manageable for the most part. GungHo are actively fixing bugs that are present in a timely manner.\n\nAs for the game itself, Grandia II is a very engaging RPG. An engaging story that has you playing as a young Geohound (an atheistic mercenary) named Ryudo who is hired by Granas (a religious group) to escort Elena, a Songstress. The voice work is solid, if not quite cheesy at times; it reminds me of old Saturday morning cartoons in style. Japanese voices have been included in this port, though as a non-speaker I feel like I couldn't comment on delivery of their lines.\n\nBored of taking turns of just getting hit, and attacking? Grandia II's battle system is possibly one of the most refined battle systems ever conceived in a JRPG. The battle system feels like a more refined ATB system from older Final Fantasy titles. All battle participants are on a timeline, moving towards making commands, and executing them. This system allows players to manipulate the timeline using various moves such as doing a critical attack on an opponent to delay (& knock back) their next attack. However be careful, as many opponents can do the same to Ryudo & pals.\n\nNoriyuki Iwadare reprises his role as the lead composer of the soundtrack of Grandia. Like the original Grandia, Iwadare has created some fantastic passages of music that will have you humming to for a long time to come. In my opinion Iwadare has a knack for creating some of the most exhilarating, upbeat music that can really give you a kick up the backside.\n\nTo conclude, Grandia II is a masterpiece of its time. Whilst the visuals haven't aged as well as the original Grandia's sprite work, the presentation, gameplay & story more than make up for it. Grandia II is well worthy of a place in your Steam game library.","August 25, 2015","true","25.2"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","25","27","2","4"

This port is also extremely well done,  I highly recommend this to anyone, especially to people who have never played the original.   Grandia II is one of the very best Dreamcast games and is worth your time and money.\n\nThis is a classic JRPG that even with its old age, this is still one of the very best in the genre and many current generation of gamers never got to experience the original back in the dreamcast days,  if you're one of those who never got to experience the Grandia series then your in for one huge treat with Grandia II.\n\nThe story starts out with Ryudo, the geohound taking on oddjobs - think mercenary for hire and as the story progresses you will learn more about the battles between light and darkness long ago, add in a couple of plot twists and some endearing characters who join your party then its off to save the world from impending disaster.\n\nBattles are pseudo-turn based with an active meter indicting who's turn is next, but with a flare of strategy as your turn can be delayed, or even cancelled if your not careful with your battle choices, however - you can do the very same to your opponents and learning these tricks is key to winning, especially during some tricky boss battles.\n\nEach character who joins has their typical unique character skills, and magic can be shared by the use of mana eggs - like with most JRPGs,  skill points are earned each battle and can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new skills/spells.  Whilst there is a minor grind if you obviously want to get every spell/skill maximised but the pace is fairly fast so for the most part, any SP grinding isn't usually a problem.\n\nThe graphics are obviously dated, but this remaster honestly does a fairly good job in updating the graphics and provides more options than the previous windows version ever did, just remember though that this game is quite old so don't expect cutting edge graphics, or highly detailed cut scenes.\n\nThe soundtrack is legendary,  some of the very best battle music ever created, awesome electronica style with hard rock edge.  Even after your 1000th battle, the battle and boss music never gets old.  The rest of the soundtrack is equally good.  I'd like to say some bad things about the game, but honestly - there really isn't any per say.   Okay, a couple of boss battles have somewhat 'cheap' mechanics but can easily be beaten with some perseverance.\n\n+ Good Battles\n+ Good Story\n+ Good Characters\n+ Good Soundtrack\n+ Good Skill/Magic System\n\n+/- Outdated Graphics","August 24, 2015","true","6.8"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

And in-game voice acting? cool, I thought ;)\n\nStory and characters delivered as well. This is just one of these old-school classics which might not look all that today, but for its time was a good reason to own a dreamcast.\n\nOnly negative thing with this "Anniversary edition" is that it lack native widescreen support, runs at 30 framerate (...yes I know its turn based combat, so not the biggest issue but still) and for some reason my controller doesnt work with this game- yet runs for every other steam game. (EDITED) it works now, the controller. perfectly.\n\nBut this game works more than well with keyboard anyway, especially since the combat is menu based anyway and thus d-pads/keys works great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2manyedges/recommended/330390/","2manyedges","SuperFightingRobot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2manyedges/","90 products in account","I've been playing JRPGs for a very long time, growing up on games like Final Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG. For some odd reason though, I never got around to playing Grandia 2, not when it was on the Dreamcast, and not when it was ported to the PS2. But now, thanks to GungHo, I finally get to play it (the going prices for the PS2 and DC versions are insanely high). So keep in mind, this review will be from the perspective of someone who's never played the game before, and therefore has no nostalgic attachment to it.\n\nCharacters: given that this is a JRPG with a fairly standard story (save the world from a giant evil, etc) it's up to the characters to make this a game worth playing. Fortunately, the game does an admirable job at this. The main character, Ryudo, is especially interesting, given that he's not just an unwilling hero, but kind of a jerk as well. Another character, Roan, manages to break out of the "annoying, obligatory child" category by actually being intelligent. You also get a cool lion-man (think Kimahri from FFX, except useful and talkative) and a sexy demon lady in your party, among others. Basically, the characters are pretty neat and I liked them.\n\nDesign: design plays a big part in these games, from character art to enemy designs. The characters themselves, as well as many of the towns and locations, have sort of a Chrono Cross vibe to them. The enemy designs range from decent to outright awesome, with the story bosses especially standing out (they look like something straight out of Parasite Eve). Unfortunately, the regular enemies suffer from the same problem that many JRPGs and MMOs have; namely, there are very few different types of enemies and the game instead relies on constant palette-swapping to make them "different." Even the mini bosses suffer from this design flaw.\n\nGameplay: gameplay, ultimately, is what really makes or breaks a JRPG (any game, really), and this game's battle system passes with flying colors. At first glance, it looks like your standard turn-based system with regular attacks, magic, skills and items. But this system, I feel, is what Final Fantasy games tried for years to achieve with their "active time battle" system and failed to do. Honestly it's a little hard to descbribe in words, you're better off looking up a gameplay video on youtube to see how it works. I will say though, this is the first turn-based game I've seen where stats like "agility" and "speed" actually do something other than just affect your chance to dodge and hit. It's a very engaging combat system and a whole lot of fun. All your characters are able to fulfill multiple roles as well (think FFVII), so your heavy hitters can fill a support role if need be, and your white mage is actually an effective attacker (in fact, later in the game she becomes a huge damage dealer). Attacks themselves, especially the skills and magic, look great (many of them use flashy FMVs).\n\nLevel Design: this is one area where the game becomes lacking, especially in the dungeons. Every dungeon is filled with monotonous, twisting corridors and everything looks the same. I can overlook boring dungeons, but the camera angle in the game makes them infuriating. It sits straight overhead and you're able to see very little of what's around or ahead of you. I can't even count how many times I got lost in dungeons, simply because every room and tunnel looked the exact same as the last, and because I couldn't see enough of my surroundings to tell which way I had come from. This also makes navigating certain towns annoying, as you can't see anything more than your immediate surroundings and most of the buildings look the same.\n\nMusic and Sound: this too is another aspect of the game that's underwhelimg. On its own, most of the music is good, but in-game there are two major problems. The first is that a lot of times, the music just feels plain inappropriate for the current situation. The other problem is that there are relatively few music tracks, so most of them are recycled to the point where it just gets old. But maybe I've just been spoiled by composers like Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda. The other main issue I have is the sound effects, specifically those of enemies. They range from decent to infuriatingly annoying, and I don't know who thought they were good enough to make it to the final game. The sound effects for your attacks and magic, on the other hand, are all really good. As for the voice actors themselves, they're...alright. Sometimes they'll be good, and other times they're cringe-worthy. They never reach the level of FFX's infamous laughing scene though, so it's tolerable.\n\nThe Port Itself: I rarely see a developer work this hard and this quickly on patching a game, especially not a port of a 15 year old game. Within a week of the game's release, GungHo had already released one major patch, and over the next couple weeks released even more large patches. These patches fixed not only issues that arose from porting a console game to the PC, but old issues that were never resolved. In my entire playthrough I encountered very few bugs, and the game crashed a total of two times, which is a better track record than many PC games. The devs listen to the fanbase and actively participate in the Steam forums, responding to people and updating them on their progress. These guys definitely deserve your money for how hard they've worked on this game.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Grandia 2 is a solid JRPG. The level design and camera work are lacking, and the music gets old pretty fast, but the interesting characters and the fantastic battle system make up for it. This, along with GungHo's dedication to making this a great port and the low price, definitely make the game worth buying.","September 13, 2015","true","37.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Why other JRPG's have not implemented something like it is baffling.\n\nThe battles in Grandia 2 allow you so much control where you do more than just soak up and dish out damage and take a potion every now and then.\n\nAs you and your foes do not take turns in a linear manner. All battles take place in a very simple but dynamic sequence of events on a 3D battlefield. One where you can minimize damage with proper defense, to being able to evade your enemy's attack with clever movement, and even being able to completey cancel an enemy's impending attack if you time and choose your attacks with some thought.\n\nAnd most of all, it is very simple but hard to master. Once you get the hang of it before you know it you'll be feeling like a master and looking forward to every battle in the game unlike in most other JRPG's.\n\nThere is no grind to speak of. It's a lot of fun.\n\nFor this reason alone, even though the Story is great and will hook you into the game very fast, no body should miss this game, whether it be a JRPG fan or even for people who usually don't like this Genre. It's that good.\n\nPort wise it's great. You can play at 1080p. The performance is great. The textures have been slightly tweaked to make them more presentable. I'm surprised at how well this game holds up today. You can map your keys however you want on either a controller or mouse and keyboard.\n\nI recommend this game to any person looking for a RPG, even for people who usually don't like JRPG's.","August 29, 2015","true","63.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Двумя годами позже сделали порт на PlayStation-2 и PC. Именно на PS-2 я и познакомился со второй частью Грандии. К сожалению, полностью пройти её в то время мне так и не удалось и на то были свои причины, но зато теперь появилась прекрасная возможность наверстать упущенное здесь, в Steam.\n\nНемного о самой игре...\nСобытия разворачиваются спустя тысячи лет после битвы Богов Света и Тьмы. Тяжёлые последствия для человечества и планеты позади, люди через церковь обрели силы жить дальше.\nМы начинаем своё путешествие главным героем Ryudo - храбрым семнадцатилетним парнем, с в хорошем смысле дерзким чувством юмора, наёмником из гильдии "Geohounds", который берётся за разного рода работу в округе. Вскоре он встречает церковную певицу Елену и соглашается стать её телохранителем. Вместе им предстоит совершить невероятное приключение, встречая на своём пути новых друзей и врагов, дружбу и предательство, щедрость и зависть, правду и ложь. В общём всё то, что так прекрасно сочетается в jRPG.\nКаждый персонаж колоритен, индивидуален, со своей философией жизни.\nИнтересный сюжет.\nУникальная боевая система, гармонично сочетающая в себе смесь пошаговости принятия действий и передвижения по полю боя.\nЗапоминающийся саундтрек.\n\nЧто касается Steam-версии...\nПорт осуществлён более, чем прилично! За время установки и начала игры не испытал никаких проблем.\nFPS не проседает, ничего не притормаживает и не подвисает.\nТекстуры сглажены лучше, чем на PS-2.\nДобавлены разного рода стимовские плюшки (ачивки, карточки) и Hard Mode.\nУправление отзывчивое, причём геймпад у меня не экс-боксовский.\nВполне адекватная цена для такой игры.\n\nВердикт - 10 из 10 для ценителей жемчужин jRPG-жанра.\nНе зря по разным версиям её называют одной из лучших игр на Дримкаст.\n\nP.S. Dear Square Enix, I hope, that... someday... you will release in Steam my favourite game of all time - Chrono Trigger.\nSincerely, Dimension Traveler.","August 24, 2015","true","4.5"," 85 of 149 people (57%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","57","85","149","12","12"

It is a JRPG with active battle elements and a 3D field of combat which give it a unique edge, even for those not seeking its retro appeal. The story is a bit cliche start to finish, although it does offer a fair bit of entertainment and the voiceacting is good (both versions). The only downfalls to this game are that it is, for all intents and purposes a lazy port, 30fps locked, minimal settings for the game itself, and is much more playable with a controller (so much so that after fumbling around with mouse and keyboard I gave up and plugged a controller in).

Grandia II was the very first JRPG I ever played (the old PC port) and I stuck with playing these types of games ever since. My opinion of the game is quite certainly heavily influenced by feelings of nostalgia...\n\nThat said, I'd still recommend playing this game, with some caveats:\n\n- The game is extremely linear. There are no sidequests to speak of and you basically play along a straight line. Backtracking is also usually not possible, so it's quite easy to miss a few things. This is common in JRPGs and I don't really mind, but other people might.\n- Character development follows the established tropes in JRPGs very closely. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but don't expect a whole lot of character depth.\n-  Same goes for the story. It isn't terribly original and not exactly ground-breaking storytelling. That doesn't mean that it is bad by any means, mind you.\n- In "normal" mode the game isn't too much of a challenge. On the plus side, heavy grinding really isn't necessary, the game is perfectly beatable in a straight playthrough.\n- The graphics are outdated. They do look better than ever in this port, but they nevertheless clearly show their age. 3D games from earlier eras of gaming generally don't age well and Grandia II is sadly no exception (keep in mind that this is a port, not a remake!).\n- The port does suffer from a number of bugs. I can't really comment on most of them, since I (for whatever reason) did not experience any game-breaking bugs or glitches. The developers did release some patches since the game went online, so there might still be some more fixes coming in the future.\n\nThe main attaction of Grandia II is - as many commenters already wrote - the stellar battle system. It's basically one of a kind in JRPGs and mixes elements of action and turn-based combat in an extremely engaging way. The Grandia series as a whole has still no match in this regard and - to be perfectly honest - it has been practically the sole reason for me to go ahead and re-play this game on Steam.\n\nFor those who are interested: Grandia I is available on the PlayStation Network while Grandia III, which has a much weaker story and extremely cheesy characters, but the most refined battle system of the series, has sadly only ever been released on the PlayStation 2 in the US.","September 3, 2015","true","27.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Great gameplay and revitalized graphics make this one a must play IF you can manage to eliminate crashing!\n\n* Below is the original NEGATIVE review *\n\n(Review based on Windows 10 experience)\n\nLet me preface by saying I was very excited to pick this up on Steam as I hadn't had the opportunity to play it previously.\n\nThe first 2 times I loaded the game and played I had zero issues and found it very enjoyable. The 3rd time, and every subsequent time after the game just crashes, in a wide variety of ways.  Sometimes I'll enter a battle and the game will just go back to the start screen instead of the battle, other times I'll finish the battle and then the game will just completely crash and want to send an error report.\n\nThese crashes happen so frequently that I refuse to waste my time repeating the same game segments over and over only for the game to crap its pants before I have the chance to save, or live in constant fear that I'm going to lose a ton of progress. This, of course, has to start happening after I've played long enough that I can no longer refund it. Judging by other reviews, I'm not the only person having these issues.

If you're looking for a good JRPG on Steam, this is your holy grail. Extremely fun battle system and character upgrade mechanics, great story with well-developed and likeable characters, and overall just a fantastic game. Nice features for the rerelease too, such as the hard mode, graphics options, button mapping, and a Japanese voice track option. I've been a gamer for over 25 years and Grandia II easily makes my top 20 greatest games of all time list. If you are a JRPG fan this is a must-buy, don't even think about it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thibbycat/recommended/330390/","Thibbycat","ThatFreakingCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thibbycat/","130 products in account","Most people getting this game probably played either the old PC port, or the Dreamcast port. I'm going to be writing this review as a Dreamcast player, and spot out the differences I noticed pretty much immediately when playing the port.\n\n-Sound:\n\nThis is a very bizarre one. This port runs much faster than the DC port due to its ability to load content without needing to read from a disk. As such, the game runs 'so' fast, that it plays sounds before it normally would in the dreamcast version.\n\nWhile a minor difference, for example. During the victory pose/screen, Ryudo spins his blade, and shoves it into the ground. In the DC version, he spouts his famous, "You better practice if you want to beat me!" /after/ his pose. However in this steam port, he shouts his victory cry the moment the battle is over.\n\nMagic attacks are incredibly quick, since the game doesn't need to load the pre-rendered AVI files used in magic like Burnflame, Zap, etc. This also means sometimes sound ques overlap each other because of how quickly spells are popping out.\n\nFootsteps: The footsteps... good god what did they do here? For some reason, the footsteps in this game have an incredibly loud volume when not washed out by voice acting or music. When the game is quiet, you get to hear the joy of boots stomping on the ground all day. It's very jarring. Not sure why this is the case.\n\nMusic: For some reason the game does not 'loop' music. Because of this, sound-tracks end and start up again. Another bizarre and jarring aspect when you're in the middle of an intense bossfight, and suddenly the music stops, only to start again from the beginning like you're listening to Windows Media Player. What happened here?\n\nVoice Acting: Ah, what a plus. I feel like the voice acting is much more clear in this version. A lot of battle dialogue is a lot more easier to hear through all the battle music and sound effects. Nothing feels compressed here, and it's nice to listen to the acting as if I was right there in the studio with them. Good stuff. You also get the option for Japanese voice acting! Though I've always been a fan of the English dub. Go nuts if you like Japanese dubs better.\n---\n\nGameplay:\n\nBattles load 'incredibly' quick in this Steam port. In DC, the screen would fade to black, load for a second, before loading your battle. This port will quickly transport you into battle before you have a chance to even realize you have managed to make an initiation, or if you were surprised. I ended up getting used to this, in fact I embrace it. It makes the game flow a lot faster, rather than waiting for stuff to load all the time. Saving the game is instantaneous as well. Nice stuff there.\n\nWhile this doesn't seem to be for everyone, but for me? The keyboard controls did not even 'work'. No matter which macro I mapped, the 'up' function never worked, meaning I could not play the game. After putting a Microsoft controller into the USB port, I was able to play just fine with a controller. Still, forcing me to use a controller is not cool. Fix the keyboard issue. I've seen discussions on Steam about this problem. When the controls 'do' work, everything is responsive as it should be.\n\n----\n\nPort quality/Graphics:\n\nThe graphics did get a pretty noticable update. Textures are cleaner, and they even added a really cool shading effect. While the game still looks dated, it has that nostolgic look that has aged relatively well. Even with the mouth-less faces in-world, I still feel like I'm playing a very polished, very charming JRPG that no other RPG has really tried to do quite like the Grandia series.\n\nUnfortunately these updated graphics come with some very odd bugs. Occassionally textures will swap, or fail to be present altogether. I've had times where I'd open the menu screen, and see large gobs of textures blocking my HP and gold numbers. Unpausing and repausing the menu fixed it, but it can get pretty jarring when odd textures start popping up at odd times. It's not game-breaking, but I've never had an issue like that on the DC port.\n\nThere's up to 8x Anti-Aliasing, V-sync, and a 'ton' of resolutions. Nothing 4k or bonkers like that, so chill your bricks. This game is old, and you're lucky to get any ratio that's not larger than 4:3. I actually don't play the game full screen, because I wouldn't get much better full screen, and it doesn't take up enough resources to slow my computer down. In fact, clicking outside your window locks the game entirely until you click back 'in' the window, resuming the game without any damage or crashing. ... Works great if you're in convorsation with someone by an instant messanger! You can even resize the window to your liking if the resolution you picked is not to your liking.\n\n----\n\nOverall:\n\nBe ready to put a bit of work into getting this port to work. A shame it wasn't perfect right out of the download box, but... I was able to work. It seems the developers were also taking precautions and patching problems on release as well, so if you still are having issues, give it some time. Kids that haven't witnessed this game on Dreamcast need to play this game. Those who did play it need to relive it.\n\nOnce you do get it to work? You'll get used to the weird quirks compared to the DC port, and I feel like the good does outweigh the awkward.\n\nAnd if you don't like it? It's back to skipping down Lollipop Lane for you, kid.","August 24, 2015","true","16.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Having wanted a solid JRPG to play for a while this seemed like a good chance to play an old classic I missed. The port was actually pretty bad when i started with it, but within' a week or two they fixed most of the crashing bugs and some atypical issues, and reset the audio files to a more modern grade and proper looping. In my three weeks out due to moving they even patched up some move bugs like Tio's 4th skill to work properly. Overall they went from poor launch to a solid port and keep working on it people see issues so thumbs up for that.\nNot much needed for me to say on the game, cult classic that I agree holds firmly to it's titles. The story was a bit cliche' and the characters kinda progress a little abruptly scene to scene but was enjoyable and well written none the less. The graphics were really nice and largely charming for their own visual style. The music was overall pretty good and had some stand out themes that i really took to memorizing the 'Dangerous Zone' or The town themes. The Combat was a nice backbone to the game giving it a tactical style ATB centered arround exploiting and guarding against openings duration action wind-up. The combat wasn't really hard at all but bosses and later game management left a satifying challenge and story to it and a nice variety of foes to kept it interesting through and through.\nOverall ,minus waiting out the bugs from the port which have been mostly rectified pretty promptly, this was a great game and worth while for anybody that likes JRPGs.","October 6, 2015","true","32.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You just basically follow the linear storyline with VERY RESTRICTED EXPLORATION.\n- Maybe this is just my opinion, but even in its HD version, the visual still looks pretty ugly to me.\n- Some skills have annoying, ugly, unskippable animation that hurt my eyes. It's understandable because this game is basically a remastered version of an old game. It still uses the same animation from ages ago.\n- This game doesn't support wide screen, but it's understandable.\n\nOverall, Grandia 2 Anniversary Edition is a good JRPG. This game might be considered as one of the best on its era. What about now? It has aged well. But even so, it's still a good game with more improvements. The developer themselves have shown their care about the fans by fixing early glitches and bugs. It runs very well now.\n\nI'll give this game an 8/10. A good addition for JRPG fans library.\n\n","December 20, 2015","true","52.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I know there has been some ire about re-releasing old games on Steam.  However this remaster is GOOD.  Like really good.  This game was ahead of its time on the PS2 and Dreamcast,and its graphics still hold up to this day.  I do remember some of the puzzling of this game back from when I couldnt stop playing my PS2 version.\n\nI initially purchased the game for nostalgia value.  I have said repeatedly that Grandia and Grandia 2 are the best JRPGs in the business.  Even to this day.  I hold it in higher regard than Final Fantasy however its all up to taste.  So I am very biased in favor of this game.\n\nThe characters are memorable,they evolve and have depth.  So many games have such formulaic characters that refuse to change and fit into just one stereotype.  This one I actually care about the characters.  And that includes the background characters.\n\nThe combat system feels like your typical turn based JRPG.  The controls for me are a little unintuitive,however after playing it does become natural.\n\nDont let my playtime fool you, I leave the game on so I can pick it up in small parts.  If I recall correctly, I'm about 1/3 of the way through the game.  So I would consider this game, if you're a completionist and a world explorer... I would say this game would be about 20 hours of enjoyment.  This game makes me want to explore its world,   Exploration usually leads to more loot in the form of gold,usable items for combat,or even weapons/armor.\n\nOne thing I did notice.  Very early in the game in the mountains,  I encountered a fairly annoying audio bug.  I had to take off my headset and missed some dialogue in this section.  The problem went away when I left that zone.\n\nI like the way this game pauses if you tab out of it.  I do this frequently, and I'm returned to my game.  Just as I left it from the tab out.  Combat wont progress without your input and even on some of the denser parts, you may want to tab out of your game while the combat happens.  I would have liked to have seen a way to speed up combat, or to be able to tab out of the game during combat sequences.  I wouldnt have used it, I just would think for some it would be a nice feature.\n\nAll in all, I love this game.  I rave to anyone who would listen that I love this game.  And I'm so glad its back.","August 28, 2015","true","152.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Also, in the beginning of the game I encountered a bug in the first fight with Millenia. She is supposed to cast Zap and kill you, but she never does.  She just keeps casting the attack down spell until her mana runs out, and then proceeds to physical attack you until you die, which gives you a game over.\n\nApparently, this bug has to do with the tutorial NPC.

Plus, the slightly improved textures look pretty good. But, the game does not go too far with the graphical overhaul because the developers wanted to keep the feel of the original intact.

In some cutscenes part of the screen was cut off where effects would not be shown and in a few areas sound effects would not stop playing when they should. Also, in one area, while walking around the map my speakers started screeching over and over again until I got into a battle.\n\nThere was also one time when the game went back to the title screen when I entered a battle.

The original Grandia recieved high praise for introducing the ATB battle system - an RPG battle system where a meter is displayed at the bottom of your screen , leading characters up to their "ACT" points , and then allowing you to command them . -  to a genre that - at the time - lacked instinct and time management . Not only that , but the game also introduced the concept of movement and placement to its battle system - characters moved based on the actions you command them to do , including having an option to simply "move" as an alternate to defending , this would allow players to have characters get out of range when anticipating enemy attacks , get into better position to use their own attack , or to just run really ... whatever . Point is , it added space and active time to turn based battles , making players feel MUCH more involved in their battles and making every move count . Players could also select enemies during battle and see their stats by default ( mind you these default stat menu's look really nice ... I mean not even just for it's time , I love em . ) , and also at times their upcoming moves allowing players to anticipate whats to come , and more importantly - in how much time .\n\nThis installment does a lot of things right , though the story SLIGHTLY generic ( Good vs, Evil , yada yada ) , the gameplay is fast with no random encounters ( as enemies are displayed on the field , allowing you to opt to fight them or not . ) , a simple and to the point level up system ( cause honestly , I hate it when developers try to be too creative . ) , a pretty generic but fun loving cast of characters , and SUPER , COOL , BOSSES .\n\nIn this game 'Valmar' is the dark antagonist of the game and essentially the literal god of Evil . Now while that's cool and all , the spawn of Valmar look like stuff straight out of your nightmares ( ever fought the organs of the F***ing devil ? It gets real pretty quick . )  , and fighting the bosses through the game as a kid led to countless " Ohhhhh S*** " moments , something ESSENTIAL for all RPGs . On the other hand , the party of Ryudo and friends ( your party ) , from their character design , and plot , come off as slightly generic . This ISN'T totally a bad thing though , I mean , they're lovable , as each of their characters fit into the story well , compliment each other in dialogue , and are all unique in terms of battle .\n\nAn RPG I like to play when I want to get away from RPGs , it is extremely simple in formula , but still different and unique in play . A game I personally feel has been overlooked over the years and am glad is available on steam , allowing gamers who missed this experience to get a hold of it , and for many like me to relive a fond classic .","January 6","true","42.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This game had a rocky release on steam with a few gamebreaking bugs, crashes, audio problems, etc. The game has been patched multiple times now and seems to be about as perfect as it's going to get.\n\nThis port is amazing. GungHo has done a great job with it. Every texture is improved and looks vibrant & crisp. The sound quality is improved and an option to change English/Japanese dubbing has been added as well. Combat can now be played at 60 frames per second which was not possible in the Dreamcast or PS2 versions and it's truly something to be seen.\n\nGungHo should be looked up to as an example of how to do PC ports of old games correctly with this entry.","February 2","true","48.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It starts out as a pretty lighthearted adventure story, but quickly turns into a drama with a dark underlying theme. It features one of, if not the best battle system of all time, featuring a crucial active time component, which allows you to cancel or delay enemy attacks, always requiring you to take your time to think about the next move and to cleverly position your characters on the battle field.\n\nThe individual Grandia games within the series have no internal connection whatsoever, no overarching stories and no recurring characters, only some very very minor references, similar to the Final Fantasy series. So, you do not need to play Grandia 1 in order to enjoy this game.\n\nI finished the game on patch 1.04, which seemed to have fixed most of the game breaking bugs. Some minor sound issues and  a couple of random crashes were still bothering me, though. Still, the dev team is doing an exellent job in staying in touch with the community and trying to fix all the bugs. If you're hesitant to buy the game because of the technical issues, I advise you to keep an eye on the stickied posts on the forum.","September 23, 2015","true","65.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do I recommend the game to others? Sure. The visuals have been bumped up, ever so slightly but sometimes it looks choppy as you would expect from a Dreamcast game upscaled to HD. The English acting can sometimes be cringeworthy but I enjoy it for nostalgia reasons. The gameplay is fun and unlike a lot of games today, requires a little bit of thought against tougher opponents. I am not far into the game but I did play an earlier version of the game, PS2 I believe it was. Don't buy this game with the hope of a fresh new style of gameplay. This game is going to cater to those who want to take a trip down nostalgia lane(In terms of gameplay) or fans of the game series itself. I think the port is great. I did have a bit of trouble with the controller but that could be because I use a PS4 controller so the inputs might be a bit odd. I did fix that issue though and even if I didn't fix it I wouldn't put the game down for that reason as it is just as easy to play with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nPretty decent. 8/10","September 3, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Originally an exclusive to the ill-fated Dreamcast, then reappearing as a an unoptimized port on PS2 and PC. It's good to finally see Grandia II come back to PC and look better than ever. I spent many hours over the years playing this game and this is definitely the best way to play it. Shame it doesn't come with the sweet soundtrack the Dreamcast version did. So how does it stack up?\n\nGrandia II is standard JRPG fare. Just done exceptionally well. You get attached to the characters, the dialog is fantastic, serious when it needs to be, heartfelt at times, and hilarious more often than you would think. You'll follow Ryudo, a Geohound (bounty hunter), on his quest to protect a nagging princess for money. What starts off as a simple job becomes you and your newfound friends in a war against God and the Devil.\n\nLet's talk a bit about the gameplay. Which is one of my favorite aspects of this. It works by having a bar in the righthand side of the screen, Your party and the enemy party share this bar, your party and the enemy will wait 3/4 of the way through it and then you can select an action. From here you can select a combo attack (standard attack), critical attack (a single hit that has a Cancel effect), spells, and special moves. Once you've selected your choice, your character will take action. Immediately if a Combo or Critical is selected, or if a Spell or Special is selected, you will need to charge it up. During this time is where the Critical attack comes in handy with it's cancel effect. If enemies are charging up a devestating special, land a Critical, and stop them in their tracks. The enemy will be forced to stop and have to wait to start charging their attack again. This comes in handy and rewards you for having good timing by locking your enemies down.\n\nYou'll also find a standard levelling system with EXP gained at the end of each battle. However, in addition to money you also get Special and Magic coins. These you can spend to level up individual skills and spells for your party. Each character has a set of specials that can be levelled up five times. At the max level, the specials become much quicker to cast, lowering your chance of them being cancelled during battle. Your spells are used by equipping an Egg to a character. These eggs can be swapped between any character and will contain an assortment of different spells. Each spell can also be levelled up to 5 for quicker cast times. This gives you the freedom to prioritize how you want your characters to play out. In addition to specials and spells, you will obtain Skill books in the game. These books, allow you to level up buffs that you can equip to your party members. The Skill books will also use your Special and Magic coins so make sure you use them wisely\n\nThis being a remastered version, you would think the graphics would be a bit more touched up than they are. Textures remain largely the same, characters still don't have mouths, it still looks like an older game. I'm currently playing this on a Surface Book with i7/dGPU. Even well over 1080p, the game does run very well, 30fps locked overworld, 60fps battles. Shadows have been overhauled for this release and are considerably more accurate than the Dreamcast/PS2 versions. Up to 8x AntiAliasing is available as well. All things considered, it looks good for what it is.\n\nOn the technical side, there have been some issues. The game sometimes doesn't like controllers. Personally had issues getting an Xbox One controller to work on it originally. I ended up having to reinstall the drivers for the controller and it now works as it should. There have been times where I've had the audio glitch out for a brief moment. In my 16 hours so far, maybe only a couple times. Gung-Ho has been good about getting the game patched up and I don't expect many issues to linger.\n\nAll in all. If you like JRPG's, you really can't go wrong with Grandia II. It's not the longest game ever. My original playtime on Dreamcast when I was 13 was clocked in around 25-30 hours. Regardless of length, you're getting a great story, a fun battle system with quite a bit of customization, in a great presentation. This game has always been a bit of an overlooked gem and I really hope with this release it gets the attention it deserves.","December 22, 2015","true","34.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Of course, there are going to be crashes and bugs (do yourself a favor and turn off the 60 fps in combat as that will really slow everything down). The most irriatating part of the game is whenever there is dialog with voiceover as the sound gets way ahead of the very,very slow text so you are just waiting for the text to finish with no options to advance.\n\nDespite the shortcomings, this game is a reminder of the golden age of RPGs with a good story, memorable characters and engaging combat.

The story is captivating, the music is forever memorable (I have listened to the soundtrack for almost 15 years), and the gameplay more fun than other turn-based combat games.\n\nThe 1st time I played Grandia II from beginning to end was on my SEGA Dreamcast, and since that time it has remained my favorite game. After the Dreamcast era ended, I tried playing it through the original PC port, but it was never technically easy. The 2nd time I played Grandia II from beginning to end was on Windows Vista; the game was buggy but with effor I managed to get it working. The 3rd time was on my Windows 7 PC, which was even harder to get running (I had to use help from online communities to get the codecs installed, video files copied from the CDs to their correct directories, and download additional files online to get the game working), but I was eventually able to play the game again from beginning to end. I never lost any of my love for this game.\n\nNow, all of this has become so much easier since Grandia II has been updated for modern PCs. This is my 4th time playing Grandia II from beginning to end, and the experience has never been better. I urge the developers to continue to support this game, bringing 4K resolution, 60 FPS support, widescreen support and the ability to run this game as universal app for ALL Windows 10 devices (desktops, tablets, phones and Xbox One, etc.).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Johnnykey/recommended/330390/","Johnnykey","Johnnykey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Johnnykey/","590 products in account","First of all, this is one of the best jRPGs… forget jRPGs… one of the best GAMES ever made in the world, period.\nBut on Steam? It’s the BEST jRPG, by FAR.\n\nThis is a re-port of what you might have played before on the Dreamcast, and it’s supposed to bring you the legit Dreamcast version experience. It does that pretty well with some tolerable flaws.\nI’ll break my review down in two sections, if you’ve played the original Dreamcast version, go right along, otherwise if you’re wondering why I said this is the best jRPG and stuff, skip to the bottom section.\n\n(Review as a Port)\nREAD THIS IF YOU’VE PLAYED THE ORIGINAL DREAMCAST VERSION:\nThis was written based off the 1.06 update.\nThis version has some worse aspects and better ones, and I personally concluded that it retains about 95% of the original DC experience (IMO the PS2 version has about 75% and the old PC port about 80% in comparison).\n\n-THE BAD-\nIn comparison to the DC version (mostly bad aspects):\n\n-	BATTLES\nRuns flawlessly smooth at 60 fps, normal attack voices are present (otherwise I wouldn’t even have finished this version). Some very very few effects are missing and there are small sound cuts on spells, however it only applies to spell sounds and never to character voices.\n-	DUNGEON/TOWN EXPLORING\nWhen roaming around on some dungeons and inside houses, it has some fps drops of about 5~10 fps (so to about 20~25 fps since outside battles the game always runs at 30 fps). It’s not a big deal and it doesn’t affect the gameplay at all.\n-	CUTSCENES\nCutscenes have a slight desynch and the longer they last (as a single cutscene), the worse it gets. This is not a big deal, most cutscenes are fine and personally I was only bothered with 5~7 cutscenes total in the entire game, in which I recommend rewatching them on youtube later.\nEDIT: This only applies to when playing the game with japanese voices, it's totally in sync with english voices.\n\n-THE GOOD-\nSo what’s BETTER in this version?\nCleaner and better-defined textures, very nice shadow effects, FullHD resolution, individual volume adjusters (including for the steps that used to be loud in the DC version), dual language, and Hard mode. Widescreen can’t quite be mentioned as a plus as it only stretches the screen, but it looks fine enough and I find it worth using. This is the definitive/best port of the DC version with some aspects that are better, and others worse.\n\nHard mode makes normal enemies tougher and hit harder but they’re still easy overall, Hard mode is most noticeable on bosses and makes the game quite better overall. You will most likely get a game over on endgame bosses unless you’re properly prepared. Buffs/debuffs gain a lot more value in here as well as the ability to switch equips/eggs during battle. Although I do find that some bosses have too much HP in Hard mode, overall it makes this (otherwise very easy) game even better overall.\n\nSo, IF you wanna replay this ridiculously good game and still own a Dreamcast and have a handy 4:3 SDTV near you, you might wanna ponder on which one to play, depending if you can tolerate the imperfections of this awesome-but-not-perfect PC port.\nIf you don’t have a DC anymore, don’t bother buying one, buy this version!\n\n(Review as a Game)\nREAD THIS IF YOU DIDN’T PLAY THE ORIGINAL DREAMCAST VERSION:\nSo like I said before, it’s one of the best jRPGs ever made. It’s on par with the huge titles that are Star Ocean 3 and 4, Grandia 3 and a couple of other few games.\nFirst of all, this game, along with the rest of the Grandia franchise, features the best battle system ever made in a JRPG, called Ultimate Action Battle System. It’s best to describe it as a mixture of Final Fantasy/Chrono Trigger/Lunar with Star Ocean/Tales of. It mixes the solid (and yet stiff) turn-based elements with the fast, dynamic and fun action elements. It accomplishes the battle system perfection that Final Fantasy games wish they EVER had (FFXIII surely tried and failed miserably at it), and what Chrono Trigger and Lunar (Lunar franchise is also from GAME ARTS) did try to achieve and partially did.\n\nThat said, the Grandia franchise despite not having relevant sale figures to boast about, it eats the “most successful jRPG franchise” Final Fantasy for breakfast.\nComparing games that came out at similar dates/generations: Grandia 1 > Final Fantasy 7, Grandia 2 > Final Fantasy X (and I love FFX), and Grandia 3 > Final Fantasy XII.\n\nI only mentioned the battle system so far, and although being a very core aspect of a jRPG, the good points don’t stop there.\nBesides the battle system, here’s what Grandia games (excluding Xtreme) share among them:\n\n-	Fun and interesting interaction with NPCs: in many jRPGs it’s boring to check and talk to NPCs, but not here. Characters freely speak often, sometimes throw a pun, etc.\n-	Big interaction among core characters and big character development, also meal moments where you can learn a lot about them.\n-	Amazing soundtracks by composer Noriyuki Iwadare that in his own way is on par with the “giants” Nobuo Uematsu (FF music) and *cough* the gaming music god Motoi Sakuraba (Star Ocean, Tales of and a BUNCH of other japanese games’ music)\n-	There are no party reserves. Your party has a max of 4 characters that will rotate according to events in the story. Some leave and others join in. This actually makes for stronger and more plot-driven ‘moments’ in the story (as well as a bigger sense of ‘adventure’), giving more replay value to a game.\n-	No need for guides, just play and enjoy. Although there’s no backtracking (on Grandia 1 and 2) and there are missable items, if you explore well enough you can get everything on your own. They’re simple and linear but not boring at the same time. Grandia 2 has a couple of optional Mana Eggs and Skill Books, but they’re not hard to find them at all. And if you’re gonna use a guide, a simple quick look is all it will require.\n\nSo, back to Grandia 2, although I prefer Grandia 1 in other aspects (character development) and Grandia 3 overall (combat, customization, character design), Grandia 2 is the best in the franchise in regards to story/plot imho. The story is amazing, it’s a pity though that cutscenes are desynched in audio/video for the Japanese voices and not “perfect” like in the original NTSC-J Dreamcast version, of which I still own an original copy.\nIt has a fun and diverse build customization along Grandia’s battle system that will much more often yield rewarding results rather than bad, thanks to how balanced this game is.\nI often felt a bit lost in customization during my Hard mode run as there are so many ways to have a strong party, some of which may involve making a tanker, dodger+counter, high STR with +hitcount or MAG with high ACT stat with warp or a quick runner to make criticals cancel more smoothly. You can also level up specifically what you want at your own discression, making the game really dynamic and still enjoyable even if you’re replaying it.\nI highly recommend this game to both jRPG newbies (the game is VERY user-friendly in Normal mode because it’s really easy) and veterans that despite not having much of a challenge except for endgame bosses in Hard mode, they’ll enjoy the hell out of this game.\n\nDid I mention that the game has some songs in Portuguese (not brazilian) and that I happen to be a Portuguese guy? I didn't, but that’s just a coincidence. :)\n\nI’ll tell you what.\nAs a human being, I’m bound to perish at some point in my life. And if by then I ever have the time to think about the most memorable moments of my life, among them I’ll most certainly look back intensely at this game. That’s HOW GOOD this game is! And I can’t stress this enough!!\nGo play it and see for yourself.","October 27, 2015","true","52.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

I guess.... The second installment [in this case, Grandia II] is mind blowing and the 3rd one falls flat and plummets the entire franchise, and everything they built up to this point, in to obscurity.\n\nThis is one of the top tier RPG's made in the history of man, it's up there with Final Fantasy 6 and 7, Skies of Arcadia, Tales of Destiny, Dragon Quest 8... etc. If you haven't experienced it, even in it's outdated and poor Dreamcast port quality, you're sorely missing out.\n\nThis was one of the first RPG's to have really clean, crisp 3D graphics, some fully voice acted scenes that gave life and personality to it's characters and a battle system that is fun, casual and can also be really deep. The story is drivel and cliche but it tells that tired old tale of good vs evil very well and at the time really pushed the religious envelope.\n","September 11, 2015","true","28.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","7","12","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redsupersonicninja/recommended/330390/","redsupersonicninja","Johnny Takigero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redsupersonicninja/","908 products in account","My recommendation for this is quite mixed. For one thing this game is still an excellent JRPG. A thrilling story that lasts over 24 hours filled with many twists and turns and not much in the way of filler with characters that along the journey will make you laugh and cry. The battles are in a kind of psydo-turn based system where you wait for the characters to be able to receive commands and then do the action you requested. It's a very well implemented system although it favours speed more than anything so make sure you upgrade that. The remake brings a new hard mode, HD resolutions and has patched in 60 FPS. So if that's interesting to you, that'll be some good news.\n\nHOWEVER! ...As a remake, this remake could do better. For one thing there are many sound issues. For instance there was an FMV that supposed to have had the big bad taunting people as they initiate their plans, however what I got were the sounds of the game's great outdoors. Also there's plenty of locations for the game to crash which isn't that good. Sure the added Hard mode is nice and all but the many problems with this remake does make it hard to fully recommend. It's not as bad as the previous PC port, but that's not saying much.\n\nOverall if you can put up with a few major porting errors you will find a very enjoyable game and comes highly recommended.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saphirkatze/recommended/330390/","saphirkatze","Saphirkatze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saphirkatze/","46 products in account","tl;dr: Grandia II is one of the greatest RPGs I ever played.\n\nThe story features a young man, Ryudo, and his talking bird Skye who earn their money by doing all kinds of dirty work that involves killing monsters. One day they get the mission to escort a girl, Elena, to a tower so she can renew the seal on some ancient evil. The sealing ceremony fails and Elena gets posessed by the Wings of Valmar. Ryudo gets another job - to escort Elena to the Pope so he can destroy the Wings.\n\nYou progress linear through the world. There are cities with NPCs to talk to (their lines change according to the progress of the story), houses to visit and to restock your supplies. Between two cities you'll have a forest or mountain path with monsters and items. In the cities there are dungeons with bosses. Those dungeons often feature some small puzzles. Once you leave a city, there won't be a reason to return however (I guess it makes sense in the context of the story, an ancient evil doesn't want to wait for you to finish catching goldfishes).\n\nThe battle system is absolutely great imo. There is an action time bar that includes your characters as well as the monsters. Once a character hits the COM/ACT separator, you'll have to select his move. You can choose from a normal and a critical attack (the critical attack will throw an enemy back in the ATB which can be handy when you see that they're ready to cast a spell/make a strong attack), a special attack (uses SP and is unique to a character), a magic spell (uses MP and a Mana Egg*) or an item. You can also skip a move and defend or change your character's position on the battlefield. *Mana Eggs contain a set of magic spells and can be equipped, so it's up to you to decide who is to use what kinds of spells.\n\nThe graphics look dated even in the special edition and the game doesn't support 16:9 ratio, so keep that in mind if that's important to you. This port also has a few small visual glitches. By now they probably patched away any bigger ones (another good thing about this port, they actually worked on some improvements after releasing it. Unlike... other companies.).\n\nThe music is absolutely great and creates atmosphere.\n\nIn summary, if you enjoy RPGs and aren't a graphics snob, give Grandia II a shot. It's a great game!\n\n","December 10, 2015","true","55.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Outside of Skies of Arcadia and the Personna games this was on my list. The game is true to its Dreamcast version, some have have run itno the odd bug but I have not ( and I have a older PC) I am not going to explain the whole story or charecters as you can use google for that or read other more profesional reviews here on steam.\n\nAll I will say is if you love classic turn based-semi action based JRPGS this is a must have for your collection, up there with Trails in the Sky, Valkryia chronicles, and the Agaerest Generations series. Now if we onlt could convince the devs to port over the Disgae and Persona series.\n\nThe dev's and publisher are on the group pages pretty often and they have released v 1.03 patch just yesterday.  Some games come out with issues and the devs barely even ackowledge them, this dev is not like that. if you are  fan of classic JRPG's this is a must have for any library","August 29, 2015","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlaneShifter/recommended/330390/","PlaneShifter","PlaneShifter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlaneShifter/","147 products in account","Here is a review from someone that have never played this game before:\n\nFirst of all, I have played Grandia 1 as well and you do not need to have played that game in order to undersatand this one. They are actually completely unlinked games in the style of the Final Fantasy series, I can't even recall any obvious simiralities, but it has been quite a while since I played the first Grandia.\n\nThis game is extremely linear. There are no side quests or anything. You get the main history or nothing. I do not think I missed anything because I am the kind of player that needs to speak to everyone and invade every house every time I hit a new town. Is this good or bad? You tell me, this is a matter of opinion.\n\nThe characters are quite interesting, each in their way, and the main ones have a pretty good development.\nThe history is good as well. Plenty of turns, ups and downs that makes sense and wraps up well, mysteries that keep you engaged, and a few surprises. You only get the cheesy over emotional parts with existencial speeches at the end. It mainly revolves around religion and its effects over people.\n\nFor the combat, the game uses a middle ground between real time and turn based system where you can see when each character or enemy will act, this is interesting for you to choose the action your active character will take, as the game has an assortment of moves and habilities that cause less damage but can cancel or delay an enemy action, thus, decision making in the game is actually interesting. I also need to point out that this is the only JRPG ever that I found the defend command useful.\nI found the combat system extremely satisfying, even if a bit easy. I had a character die outside of scripted battles only once near the end, but I was playing on normal and there is a hard difficulty. The way the save points work in this game also makes combat easier since you can fully restore yourself for free everytime you reach one, that just made me spam area of efect spells and habilities.\n\nYou cannot customize the character party, wich can have up to 4 members. It changes as the history demands.\n\nThere are 3 different form of XP in this game: your regular experience, Special Coins, and Magic Coins. Experience ups the characters base stats. No customization here as it is normal in JRPGs. Special Coins lets you purchase or upgrade the character specific special habilities and Magic Coins do the same for magic.\nMagic is kept in eggs. Eggs can have any assortment of spells and can be equiped in any character, who will have the egg's spells available to be cast in combat.\nThe game also has habilities books (I can't recall the actual name of them) where you can buy passive bonuses with either Special or Magic Coins. These bonuses can be individually equiped into any character.\n\nDungeons are usually simple, with exceptions later on the game. It lacks a map system, wich makes exploring said dungeons quite annoying, but it has a compass that points you to the next objective. It helps a little. I'd still prefer a map.\n\nThe stronger spells suffer from unnecessary long animations. Nothing as bad as Final Fantasy 7 but can still be annoying. But when you have a spell that sends a dragon made of electricity into your enemies I can give it some leeway.\n\nAnd heck, this review is cold. I guess the game failed to impress me. That does not mean I did not enjoy it. It just means I have seen better. Still a great game for fans of JRPGs, and a good pick for those just getting into the genre.","September 21, 2015","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some very minor tweaks, such as replacing the character's blob shadows with dynamic projected shadows, but these fit exactly into the original environment art's pre-baked shadows so well that it's almost like a restoration.\n\nWhile it would be nice if 16:9 widescreen support was added, or the 30 FPS cap removed, the fact that this is essentially the Dreamcast code running on PC outweighs having those bonuses. In the age of remakes, "remasters" that diminish the original game's developers accomplishments, having this version on Steam has a feeling of a museum piece, a true classic of the genre shown publically again the way it was always designed.\n\nFor those who are buying this again, the fact that it allows for the use of original Dreamcast VMU save data is another great bonus. I personally restarted and played the first four hours last year, and I was able to use those save games and continue my progress from the Dreamcast version seamlessly.","August 26, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then you already know.  Grandia 2 is an excellent game that utilizes the ATB combat system with the ability to cancel movements.  You may be familiar with this method in Child of Light (and to a lesser degree Final Fantasy X-2) if you haven't played Grandia games before.  So yes, combat-wise, the game is very much on point and addictive as hell.\n\nOf course, the cast, story, environments, music, production values, voiceovers, dialogue, and virutally everything else is amazing as well.  It has aged a bit, but the additional resolutions, controller support, and achievements should more than make up for that for most people.  Still not sure?  Then get it on sale.  The bottom line is if you're a JRPG lover like me, there is absolutely no reason to not have this in your inventory.","December 31, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Will it be as good as I remember? Are there any completely frustrating sections that I've conveniently forgotten about?\n\nIt turns out the thing I had forgotten was actually how great a game Grandia II is.\n\nI'm not going to rave about the brilliant combat system or ace soundtrack. I will however mention a couple of little things, nothing major, just some nice touches that give the game that little bit extra:\n\n- Meal sequences. Main characters sitting, eating and talking. They might be discussing the village they're staying in or skirt around some recent happening in the plot. It doesn't matter, but it does help to flesh the characters out a bit and make them more than simply mobile plot transporters.\n- Town NPCs. The fact that, when you approach a town NPC, they'll say something and an MC will respond to it. So you get a full (albeit limited) conversation instead of simply hearing half of one (i.e. generally whatever the NPC says).","January 30","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emprenos/recommended/330390/","emprenos","Scavenger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emprenos/","125 products in account","Ah Grandia II. One of my very few JRPG experiences growing up. Obviously when the news of it being re-released for the PC on Steam, I was very, very happy. It took me awhile to actually get to playing and finishing the game though and I still love the game so much. Full review ahead, with a summary right at the bottom.\n\nCOMBAT\n---------\nPersonally to me, Grandia II is made by its battle system. It's active turn-based, I believe the term is called. The most fun in the game is just playing around with the moves/spells and at times, think on your feet to avoid taking damage or a certain death. Cancelling action is very fun and satisfying when you manage to really just end a battle without expending too much MP or SP nor taking any damage. The combat definitely makes the game, and I played it on Hard, certain boss fights would warrant a different approach of battling rather than the conventional full-offensive style I liked, which brings freshness to the battles and makes the bosses feel very different. if not annoying. Almost every spell available are very useful and some more situational than others. For example, certain monsters has a higher resistance towards an element, so you'll have to figure out what works best in those situations. I'll say that I really do enjoy the combat.\n---------\nRating : 5/5\n\nCharacters\n-----------\nGrandia II has a good variety of different characters and each of them has a story to tell. Character development is a focus in the game, I would say. Ryudo, Elena, Millenia, Roan, Mareg and Tio are all very nicely written characters, each with their own plot development and the way they're used in battle is also different in certain aspects, that they feel unique, if not irreplaceable.\n---------\nRating : 4.5/5\n\nStoryline\n---------\nThe game might have a very cliche "Battle between Good and Evil" general overview, but what makes it special is the fragment stories told within the game. Some of the stories over the course of the game can be heart-breaking, while some can be very...lovely. The story ultimately teaches not to follow a faith blindly, and not to be bound by the threads of fate, and be your own master, living the life you want to live. Which I find to be a very good lesson in life. That's not to say that Grandia II doesn't suffer some problems. I, for one, felt that the ending was very strange. For the most parts, the story is good, if not a tad bit predictable, at this day and age, but that doesn't make it bad. The way they wrote some of the stories are very human and relatable.\n---------\nRating : 4/5\n\nSummary\n----------\nI will say that throughout these many years since the game's release, Grandia II still stands as a very entertaining JRPG, if only for the combat system. The story adds to the experience even more and I believe that Grandia II is a game that has aged very well over the years.\n---------\nFinal Rating : 4.5/5","January 10","true","45.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's amazing classics like these that motivated me to go out and try my own hand at the JRPG genre.  I'm super excited to see Grandia 2 come out on steam and a chance to play it over again.\n\nSo far the bit I've played seems to be a  stable port, and the art style, though enhanced a little bit, remains true to the original, unlike the strange Final Fantasy 7 port.  This port also is an actual remastering, which means they made some small adjsutmetns to the original game like the addition of a hard mode for those looking for a unique challenge.\n\nIf you can enjoy the aged 3D graphics, amazing music, and you like classic JRPG combat and gameplay, then I think you'll really enjoy Grandia 2 Remastered.\n\nP.S.

The fact that this is the third time I've bought the game says something.\n\nThe good:\n\n-The graphics still hold up for being a 15 year old game.\n-The story is pretty good but nothing super amazing.\n-The music is excellent and the games soundtrack has always been one of my favorites.\n-The combat system is still the most unique and fun one I've encountered (this is the standard combat in the Grandia series)\n-New features have been added such as battles in 60fps and a hard difficulty.\n\nThe bad:\n\n-The game has a lot of audio bugs at the moment. Nothing really bad, but annoying at times.\n-Crashes happen, but not too much.\n-Game is a bit easy unless you play on hard.\n\nDespite the current issues (which are being fixed) I certainly reccomend this game to anyone who likes rpgs.","September 7, 2015","true","27.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The sound options are basically made so that instead of the development team putting all the sounds back to the way they were in the original, the player has to do it themselves. I believe that's the definition of lazy.\n\nGrandia II is a great game on the Dreamcast. On the PC, not so much.\n\nThe short version: Don't buy it until it's properly fixed, it's simply not worth it.\n\nThe long version:\n\nThe work done on the textures is great and really revitalize graphics that haven't aged all that well; assuming you can ignore pieces of the UI. The Game Compass for example has improved textures but has artifacting that cannot be removed through AA. Gung Ho remade the textures to fit the old resolution and simply scaled it up.\n\nThat aside, it unfortunately comes down to moment to moment audio issues that completely ruin the experience of the game. Music from the soundtrack doesn't fade properly and loops. Music is present where it never was before. Spell sounds are cut off or not present. Voice lines are often drowned out by sound effects as simple as a burning fire or background music. Audio in this port is a complete and utter mess and this alone is quite a strike against it. With this games star voice actors and amazing soundtrack a good chunk of the experience this game offered is ruined or completely missing.\n\nTo top it all off, there are game breaking bugs that seem to be present with some users. Some of these are old and remeniscent of the original PC port, while others are entirely new.\n\nThe developers have put out two patches so far (rather quickly) to fix 2 bugs, but the list of bugs is a mile long and there's no current indication as to how long it will take to fix; if they even plan to fix everything. With the games sales not too high it's hard to know just how committed this developer will be to fixing up the port.\n\nI have to sadly recommend that anyone interested in the game pass on this port. Until there are serious patches made that fix a majority of the issues this port is simply not worth the frustration. If you happen to have a Dreamcast you'll get more bang for your buck purchasing the Dreamcast version than you will buying the port in this current state.","August 29, 2015","false","6.5"," 75 of 148 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","75","148","3","7"

This guy has and that game was Grandia II!\n\nGrandia II is a bonafide five star RPG developed by Game Arts.  Everything about Grandia II is straight from the top drawer; the captivating story, the charming characters, the colourful artwork and music, and the best battle system to ever grace the RPG genre.  With Anniversary Edition introducing support for modern resolutions and frame rates, there has never been a better time to experience this absolute gem.\n\nGrandia II follows a cast of stereotypical RPG characters entangled in a classic tale of good vs evil.  The mix of light hearted humour and dark themes create a perfect platform for the excellent character development that takes the player on a rollercoaster ride of entertainment and emotions.\n\nGameplay is smooth and seamless, complimented by a beautiful albeit limited soundtrack and charming sfx that really set the tone, creating a wonderfully alluring atmosphere unique to each location.  The battle system is a stroke of genius, incorporating a strategic factor into the active turn based system that introduces a unique twist in thought and planning to a somewhat stale format.\n\nGrandia II is far and away the best of the trilogy, a pure joy to play and one of the best RPGs ever made.\n\nPlay it.

All the sounds and voices themselves are badly balanced; they have updated recently to allow you to make adjustments to individual parameters but it is still not a fix.

I can confirm that this is the case, and it was the most fun I've had with JRPG combat in a long, long time, although the game is very easy once you know what you are doing (even on hard mode).

Even if it's far from perfect.\nThis company is amazing thus far. Not only do they LISTEN, but they actually have a presence and put an obvious effort to communicate with the userbase.\nThey have patched out a majority of problem this game has had! And in an incredibly quick turn around at that.\n\nI hope they decide to do Mobile/XBO/PS4 ports, so they can justify extra work to fix the Sound issues and back port it here.\n\n______________________________________\nPros   GungHo is flipping awesome! If this is the level of support to expect in the future. COUNT ME EXCITED. Actual communication and no PR double speak crap.\nMSAA Support\nAbility to use Saves from Emulators and real Dreamcasts!\n60FPS battles!\nArbitrary Resolution Support. If it isn't in the launcher, simply type it in. And it should work. If not you may need to set your deskop to that res first. Though last I checked it works without doing so.\nKey and Gamepad remapping!\nHard Mode!\nPretty much all of the game assets are out in the open allowing us to mod the game very easily for increased asset quality!\nTo that point, I made an OST Mod that replaces almost all of the game's music with vastly higher quality versions! https://steamcommunity.com/app/330390/discussions/0/357284767230214962/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=673761272\n\nEssentially major bug free now.\nImproved Lighting,shading model, character textures and added Shadows make the game look just that much more Gorgeous for a Dreamcast game. See Comparisons here > http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=179004905&postcount=330____________________________________________\nCons  Event Timing - This is a fairly big problem IMHO. Having just played the intro to the game, pretty much anything that is supposed to be timed with music is dead wrong. The intro sequence itself cuts to different parts of music jarringly rather than being perfectly choreographed to the music.\nI linked to this video before https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ugIIqI5Zp0 showing how it should be timed on the DC.\nSpecifically, Elena singing in the church as an example. Look at how the animation is timed with her singing and she stops before she speaks.\nNow here is how it plays out in this version.\nhttps://copy.com/unZTg7pU6EjGrUP9 (Link will be dead by May)\nIt's to me a big problem that puts a strike against what is becoming the best version of the game.\n\nFor what it's worth, ONLY the DC game correctly syncs 100% of everything. Even the old PC version doesn't correctly sync everything.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaolOuJ8sT0\n(You can also see it had the same Audio cutting out/off problems this version had initially)\n\nAccording to a member of GungHo I spoke to, the Source Code they recieved was Hard Coded to 25FPS. Which is baffling. I don't understand it.\nEmulators report the PAL version running in PAL480i50 at 25FPS.; Running in 480p VGA, it runs PAL60 and reports 30FPS and looks a lot smoother than at 25FPS (It is a very visible difference).\n\nPlaying the NTSC PS2 version on a 60hzCRT, very clearly when it isn't stuttering while loading data off the disc or slowing down massively. It's running at 30FPS.\nRotating the camera at full speed, there is the normal 30hz on 60hz double image and no stuttering or judder as there would be if it's running at 25FPS (Since there would be a timing mis match. 25 doesn't divide into 60 evenly)\nMaybe the game was coded at 25FPS for performance reasons and then sped up to run at 30FPS somehow? I don't know, it's all very bizarre.\n\n\n4:3 resolution support doesn't seem to work - Selecting 1024x768, gives me 1365x767 in game. And no matter what manner of trickery I try to do, no 4:3 resolutions work as intended. Or just switch to full screen resolutions. Unselecting "Keep Aspect Ratio" makes it funkier!\nUsing 800x600 with and without KAR looks like this.\nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/143060\n\nSound mixing can be hit and miss. And is far too loud by default.\nI don't recall what it was like with the older versions of the game. But the Stereo Panning here just isn't very good. And what is a carry over from older versions is the sound balance. Even with the adjustments in the launcher. It's not quite as good as it could be. But it is of it's time in this department. At least we can make the absurdly loud SFX quieter.\n\nAudio Bit Rates for this port are much much lower than the first PC port.\navg Bit Rate in Anniversary Edition are around 90kbs in 22.05Khz .Ogg Stereo.\n\nWhere as, in the OG PC port, it uses constant Bit Rates of ~353 Kbps 22.05Khz PCM Mono.\n\nGame has issues with non perfect 16:9 ARs - It doesn't like un-perfect 16:9 1.7777777777777777777777777777778 resolutions. 1366x768 is 1.7786458333333333333333333333333, so the game automatically uses 1365x767 (Rounded down from 1365x767.8125) which is a perfect 16:9 instead causing the picture to be soft and ugly.\n\nFMVs for Spell overlays and CG movies are all still super low res and low bitrate. It's not something that could be helped unfortunately unless they were to recreate them from scratch or were able to find the original render data and make use of it. And given the number of copies sold of the game. This might not have been a worthwhile effort.\n\nCG cutscenes (.MKV container)are variable in resolution, but almost always sub 480p in the range of 320xW in MPEG-4/AVC\n\nSpells are in ye-old MPEG-1 format.\n\nMy only two wishes at this point are that they fix the Event Timing issues and 60FPS outside of battle can be achieved! It's not going to happen, but that's ok.\nMaybe someday!","December 21, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What games "of today" even have those?\n+ Lots of cool items will keep you wondering which one to equip, esspecially at the endgame\n+ Exploration is rewarded with items. You are rewarded for not simply running from A to B, and exploring the area\n+ Pretty good story and ending, although, a little bit cheezy\n+ Lots of great characters with totally different personalities\n+ Hard difficulty is challenging, esspecially at the endgame\n+ Unique battle/skill/magic system\n+ Modding potential?\n\n- UI could have had higher resolution. One user already released an HD mod to fix this. This should have been a developers job\n- The game uses "movies" to tell the story and to display some skills, but the resolution is pretty bad\n- The game is very linear and that may be a turn off to some (can't explore areas, unless you progress the story)\n- A few more scenes could have been voice-acted. It would've helped the overall feel of the game/story\n- The game doesn't actually support widescreen (you can use high resolution, though)\n- Seems to be problems with some gamepads (I didn't have any, personally, though)\n- Probably uncomfortable to play without gamepad\n- Some bugs are not yet fixed\n\nVerdict of part 1:\n\nWorth buying, if you feel like taking it slow, getting to know what's going on in each town/area, exploring and looking for items/treasures. It's a classic rpg sort-of-HD remake. If you would like to play something, that's similar to psx/psone era games, then get it!\n\nPart 2:\n\n+ Better graphics than prequel\n+ Improved battle system\n+ Improved leveling/exp system (in prequel, it was a pain to level up the characters)\n+ More minigames\n\n- Overall lesser experience than the prequel (less towns, npcs, areas, monsters, etc)\n- Dungeons are way too predictable and mostly uninspired\n- Uses overall gear with the same effects as in the prequel\n- Characters could've had a few more skills. Only Millenia is the exception to this\n- Overall magic is the same as in prequel, nothing new was introduced, except that zap! now causes stun and poison deals damage\n\nVerdict of part 2:\n\nOverall a worse game, but still worth playing. If not for anything else, then to, at least, remember, how awesome was the prequel. In fact, the prequel was so good, that they used it's main OST when the credits were rolling.

Usually with games from my past, I learn pretty fast that my love for a game is based solely on nostalgia and that the game hasn't aged well. This is not the case with Grandia II. For me, it's still as fun to play as it was 15 years ago.\n\nI find the gameplay fun as well as the story interesting. The graphics still hold up pretty well and updates have been made to make them look better. There is a hard mode which, satisfies when the normal playthrough just isn't enough. Also for me there have been no crashes, however I have heard some people have experienced a few.\n\nIssues that were prevalent in the original release such as the audio voices being drowned out by the music have been fixed with updates allowing you to toggle with the voices, music and sound fx levels. Some people may be disappointed that there are no side quests really and avoiding encounters can be detrimental to you , especially in the later game as you need as high a level as you can get.\n\nI have had issues with the music.

There's quite a bit of strategy that makes battles more advantageous, but that doesn't mean you can't casually play as well. The moves are all flashy, and some of them even have 2D animation cutscenes.\n\nThe story is a little cliche, but this is an old game.

If you turn off 60 fps feature it still has slow down for zoning and starting battle encounters. I waited months after this HD port came out when found of these issues they patched it and they're still there...what. the. f*ck. seriously\n\nthe positives i can say is the HD graphics are very clean and touched up and the game itself has aged  very well to this day since it first came out in 2000","March 13","false","13.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The characters are streotypical and bland. The battle system is prosaic and passe. The graphics were good for the Dreamcast, which means bubkis in 2015, and high resolution and anti-aliasing do little to hide the poor textgure quality and simple models. The voice acting is weak. The level design is very simple. The port is lazy, with no mouse support and no rethinking of the controls for PC.\n\nBut does any of that matter when the game is so damn FUN? It's more than nostalgia -- this game is genuinely well designed; the pinacle of all the JRPG cliches coming togetehr to make a game that's charming and well designed. The simple combat system belies some serious depth and the straightforward story is presented well. In 2015, this type of game might seem irrelevant -- and perhaps it is -- but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable as all hell.","September 14, 2015","true","15.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

A real gem from the dream cast era, that had a cool, innovative for the time combat system, great animation, and excellent writing.  And without question, the best moment of this new anniversary edition is when you - in tears of frustration from on reinstalling drivers, dealing with broken controls, and constant game crashes - give up, dig your old PS2 out of storage, plug it in, and play Grandia II.  Because at that moment, you'll be playing the game, AND know full well that steam will be there to give you a refund for this miserable, broken, unplayable excuse for a port.\n\nSeriously:\n* XBox one controllers cause the camera to rotate constantly, only stoppable by unplugging the controller.\n* Thankfully I didn't have sound issues, but lots of other people did.\n* Entering the combat screen for me immediately reset the game to the title screen without saving.\n* I never even got that far, but if you talk to the combat tutorial guy in the first town, then the first boss becomes bugged and you have to restart the game.\n\nSome day they might fix these, and I guess it would be a great buy if that happened, but it's already had like 4 patches since release and it's still completely broken.

So when i bought this edition i heard that it would contain a hard mode and so slightly better rendured models and some better looking shadows ,which it did no complains there. However i quickly started to notice how many sound bites were either cut off such as the save point recover sound or the appearence of ladder sounds/action icon sounds . When i finished my first random encounter i   am familiar with Ryudo's signature "You better practice if u wanna beat me!" but i couldnt hear it very well because the sound effects were muffling his speech which was very annoying and kills my excitement of winning a battle at the exp screen . I also noticed that they took out the sound u hear when you use a healing potion or "heal" ,when the droplets fall on your character. I made it to my first major voice acted cutscene when u first meet millenia and i was dissapointed to see that the text was having trouble catching up with the voices which bogged down the sequences of the cutscene . This is a amazing game that unfortunately has been ported horribly on the ps2 and now steam .

So instead of digging out the old ps2 i spent a few dollars on the pc version. Well, now I remember why I never finished it. I loved grandia 1, but by the time I had grandia 2 in my hands I was old enough that I really could no longer appreciate horrible writing. This game is full of stupid characters and stupid dialogue. It seems to me that I had originally progressed very far in the game before the story finally made me put it aside because as I was replaying it I seemed to know what was going to happen. Then again, maybe that was just boring, predictable, and awful storytelling that allowed me to predict stuff I hadn't seen. Either way, I gritted my teeth and finally finished it.

I cannot recommend this game.\n\n- Theres nothing to explore in town. There are no treasure chests or closets to open. There are no hidden items. The non-story related houses are not worth exploring since there is no one in there or someone with nothing interesting to say.\n- Even if you reach the next town, it never makes you feel "Finally! I made it!". The trips feels so short. The world is also extremely small.\n- You can see enemy hp so you always know when the enemy will die. Makes game less intense.\n- Bosses are too easy. Game is easy compared to lots of JRPGs in general.\n- The critical system in battle is cool, but everything else about the combat system is too basic and predictable due to the timer bar at bottom of screen. No situation where you will need to take some chances.\n- Camera is so zoomed up It's hard to see around you.\n- Don't get much sense of adventure since everywhere is just a short dungeon or a village.\n- Characters are boring and lifeless. There is also no way to speak to them or ask for help (Probably because you won't need help since you always know where to go next). They join you too easily too.\n- Dungeons/Maps are so linear. Its like walking in a straight line there is no feel of exploration and no way to get lost.\n- You don't feel much accomplishment from leveling up.\n- Weapons/Armors at shops are so cheap and provide only a small boost so carrying money feels useless.\n- Music is not catchy. Grandia 1 music sounds a lot better.\n- Very little variation in monsters and bosses\n- Story that feels like its some kind of epic story idea coming from a teenager. Tries to put in some unnecessary drama and ended up predictable and boring.\n\nThe only good part is that its an old rpg that got rereleased on pc and its cheap.\n\nIt doesn't make sense how some people can call this game the best jrpg unless this is the only jrpg they have played.","August 29, 2015","false","25.8"," 7 of 35 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","7","35","0","0"

Top three cross platform with Legend of Dragoon and Final Fantasy 8 (Sorry 7 lovers).\n\nThe characters are well written, and surprisingly well voice acted for the time.\n\nThe graphics weren't anything special, but then not much was in the early 2000's.\n\nThe music was fantastic, I still listen the cd that came with the Dreamcast version when I'm feeling nostalgic.\n\nThe story is tried and true Good VS. Evil, with a deadly sins, Sci-fi twist that blew my mind the first playthrough.\n\nGrandia got a lot of attention back in the day for its different take on the ATB Gauge, 1-upping early final fantasy games.\n\nThe Mana Eggs were reminiscent of Materia I suppose but it felt like each character had one tailor made for them, and when you have an ability thats called Boom, levels up to Ba-Boom, then levels up again to KA-BOOM, its very satisfying.\n\nNostalgia aside, this game's mechanics and story hold up very well after a little more that a decade.  This game is a must play for anyone who likes 90's rpgs, who likes good story in their games, and who like to feel a little awesome while teleporting around a battlefield doing moves like Sky-Dragon Slash and KA-BOOM./","August 25, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously, if you never played this game and wonder why many people fall in love with J-RPG in the old times, pick it now!\n\nThe Pros:\n\n+ Gameplay. I really love the semi-turn based style. In a world of video game today where everyone wants their turn right away, It gives me time to think as much as I want (just like other jRPG, when you choose attack/skill/items, the world freeze), yet it still gives me the random factor like counter-attack and positioning. The boss battle basically you and your party tries to 'cancel' boss turn as much as you can before it shoots something dangerous.\n\n+ Graphic. While it's obviously not Mass Effect level, this edition gives nice retouch and crispier 3D. They even have anti-aliasing and 60 fps battle.\n\n+ Character. Your main hero is Ryudo, a geohound (or mercs). Beside his skilled swordmanship, he also has some good sarcastic remarks on people. He's like your Fallout 4 character but pressing the sarcastic option almost all the time. Millenia is a hot-headed, ♥♥♥♥♥y, and flirty. Imagine the banter between the two. Also, like many j-RPG tropes, your party are a misfits of people of many races with different personalities.\n\n+ Story is pretty epic and quite wild, although at sometimes, you'll say "yep, just like I guess, he's the bad guy". Well, it's not j-RPG if it doesn't have some classic j-rpg tropes.\n\n+ Sound. It's clean and clear. The soundtrack won't winning award anytime soon, but it's not bad either. I quite like the soundtrack battle when our party were ambushed and some peaceful moments we had.\n\nThe cons:\n\n- AI. Okay, honestly it's okay. The enemies will also think like what you thinking in this game. They also will try to circling you, making your characters gather up in one place, then dropped some AoE damaging spells or pick the weakest member like your priest/healer/magician. Buuut, after you have a skill book that makes one character became the center of attention, the AI will become stupid and an easy picking because they will attack the person who held that skill book 100% of the time. Just buff him with def/hp/vit stats and he will be your impenetrable tank. Even bosses.\n\n- Controls. Get a freaking controller. The keyboard control scheme is just bad. Not the dev fault though, this game was released on console first. Seriously, use a controller. Also the camera is the hardest enemy to kill here.\n\n- Animation.  After some time, you'll wish you can skip the animation and straight to the numbers. Also, they didn't update the FMV parts. Man, seriously? Widescreen 1080p monitor and you got 800x600 2D animation sequence stretched to 1920x1080 resolution? You can imagine how blurry it is.\n\n- Replayability. Well, it's a J-RPG, you can only replay it with hard mode (although you can start with hard mode right away from new game). But maybe worth it if you missed a thing or two in your first playthrough. Otherwise, like many old j-rpg, you played once, you already know everything. No branching storyline, no morally questioning choices, it's like reading a story book.\n\nDo you recommend this game? Oh yes, despite the flaws brought from original and overall the design flaws in old J-RPG, I very much recommended this game. And Oh, If any game designer wants to learn a thing or two about j-rpg history, this is one of the gem you should look.\n\n\nI gave it an 8/10.","February 13","true","34.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I were to play this game back in the day, I would have probably enjoyed it.\n\nBut you have to keep the retro aspect in mind at all times. JRPG games were different back then, and this game is very average in many areas. I thought the story was way too generic, and combat is absurdly easy once you figure out what to do. I even put the game on its Hard difficulty, yet I barely felt challenged throughout 99 percent of the adventure.\n\nQuite frankly, the most aggravating thing about combat itself was not the difficulty but the fact that some of the animations for attacks/spells took too long. Yes, it's a small nitpick, but I found myself trying to finish fights as fast as possible so I wouldn't have to subject myself to long animations being played over and over. On top of that, the game developers were lazy and literally recycled animations, even going as far as using different names for the same animations to think the player could be fooled, somehow.\n\nAgain, the game is very average. It won't wow you or anything like that. I wouldn't even call this a gem. It's just very middle-of-the-road, even for its time. If I had to complain about something else, I think this port is really bugged in stupid areas. For instance, there was apparently more  (mediocre-at-best) voice acting, but there were parts where the audio was either absent or decided to work half of the time instead of every instance where it was supposed to occur. Very lame if you ask me.\n\nRegardless, if you want to play a retro JRPG for some reason like I felt like doing when I bought this game randomly a few weeks back, this game will give you your fix. Don't expect much, and you won't be disappointed as a result.","April 3","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really think the game stands up well to time but there are some things that make it nearly a miss. First you will notice the graphics are not updated across the board there are some icons and backgrounds that are low resolution. Luckily the world looks very nice and the low polygons are offset by nice texture maps.\n\nThe party of characters is smallish 3 or 4 usually at a time, and no switching I believe just auto party formed as the story goes and changes. But there is alot of story in the world and there are alot of interesting things happening in the world.\n\nThe music is good too, its not the best but none of the tracks are very grating or annoying. Its nice to play a game that also has a some what serious tone to it at times. Its talks alot about how people treat others and let narrowmindedness take over from fear.\n\nMinus' in my book are the text moves at a stuttering pace, very tedious at times. The world is zoomed in alot and you don't see alot of the area around you. There are some sort of slow battle animations it make the game feel dated.\n\nGraphics: 9 (this includes overall feel and stlye as well as resolutions)\nSound: 8 (the sounds are effects and voice acting)\nMusic: 9 (music in gameplay)\nGamePlay: 8 (battle system and menu traversal)\nStory: 8 (the world and the games central themes)","October 10, 2015","true","51.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I fully reccomend this to anyone who has even a passing interest in the genre, if only to experience what I consider to be the absolute pinnacle of JRPG turn based combat.","August 24, 2015","true","54.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The battle system in particular is still one of the best around, and hasn't been emulated until 2014's Child of Light (another great game, by the way). My only problems with this game are all technical:\n\n-The SFX volume is way too loud, and they don't play correctly (like footsteps for example).\n-There's an annoying delay that occurs after you cast a big spell (the ones that utilize FMV); at first, I thought the game had locked up because nothing was happening for several seconds after a spell had finished animating.\n-The music doesn't loop like it did in the Dreamcast version\n-The sweep animation that plays before the start of battle is gone\n-The "Whisper to the Stars" skill is bugged. It does nothing at the moment.\n-HUD (icons, portraits, text) is low-res.\n-Certain FMV cutscenes are dark; you only get audio.\n-Some in-game events are bugged in that they start over from the beginning just before moving on to the next one.\n\nI really wish more developers took more time to polish up their console ports so we don't have these technical issues. I would have liked more modern features, such as the ability to skip spell animations. Hard mode is nice, but it doesn't do much more than give small buffs to the enemies (devs need to make hard mode interesting for a change!). The problems I mentioned never occurred in the Dreamcast original (not sure about the PS2 version or the earlier PC version). Grandia 2 is a great game that's been given a less than perfect port, but I still recommend playing it if you don't mind some bugs.

Experiencing it again felt wonderful, and despite Grandia's age, the gameplay was fun and performed well.\n\nIf I had to pick one thing that Grandia did best, I'd say its story. The story felt about the right length, had captivating dialogue and scenes, surprising twists, and characters that you can really get attached to (for better or worse).\n\nMy biggest complaint would have to be that even in Hard mode, the game is not very difficult. The bosses are the only cause for concern, and most of them aren't too hard either. The few that would defeat my party had mechanics that, once experienced the first time, were relatively simple to work around and otherwise fight like normal.

Now that isn't neccessarily a bad thing as long as the improvements that have been made are welcome, and for me they very much are.\n\nFirst and foremost the resolutions on offer are adequate, and for those wanting more you can always edit the .ini to give you more, however having said that, in my view it is a 4:3 game and so should be played in that aspect, instead of stretching it out to a format it was never intended to be played at.\n\nThe sound is however where I do have a few issues. The sound of Ryudo's footsteps is extremely loud, so much so that it feels like a woodpecker is eating my ears as he walks across the screen. Also, when you meet one of the main characters the 'mix' is so bad you can barely make out what they are saying, even at relatively high volumes. Then there is that moment after a battle when you receive your dosh, yes the lovely sound of those coins hitting your wallet, except it is AWFUL, each coin landing grates as it is so terrible.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, none of what I have written above is a total spoiler for me personally, but I do feel that GunHo's QA team need to get in someone who's hearing has not been impaired by the excessive volumes of their personal music player of choice.\n\nThat is not to say that I am ungrateful either, this port gives me the convenience of having one of my favorite JRPG's in my Steam library, and saves me digging out the Dreamcast, or firing up the emulator, so I am happy, and maybe we'll even see a patch or two in the future. Furthermore given the easily accessability of the core files, I'd fully expect fans to fix some of the sound issues if nothing is forthcoming from GungHo.\n\nIn closing I would like to say that I definately recommend this game to anyone and everyone, and I can only hope that we see more from GungHo. Grandia I, would be top of my list, closely followed by Lunar. In fact let's hope that this is just the tip of the iceberg and that other developers will dust of their back catalogues and let the fans have what they so desperately crave!!","August 26, 2015","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I fully reccomend this to anyone who has even a passing interest in the genre, if only to experience what I consider to be the absolute pinnacle of JRPG turn based combat.","August 24, 2015","true","54.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My then-girlfriend surprised me with a game, she said she thought I would like it just by looking at the cover art. She was right!\n\nIt's hard to put into words why I like this game. The story is not that great, your typical JRPG run-of-the-mill story you find used over and over, with their variance on it. I think what I really loved so much about the game was the character development. Every good JRPG has it and they do it well, but this game REALLY caught my attention with it. There were times when I played and I thought to myself, "Wow, I love the direction they're going", with either one character or the other.\n\nAnother thing I loved is, it's a 4-person party. I looooove 4-person party JRPGs. Really allows for some great boss fights. But what I TRULY love is, the game doesn't give you extra characters. You can never swap characters out; the four that run with you, are with you unless the game substitutes them out for someone else. I believe there's a total of 6 different characters in the game, they're all really diverse and unique, they bring their own element to the fights.\n\nYou level up like usual, collecting four types of currency; EXP, gold, SC & MC. Gold buys your usual things; armor and weapons, items. SC are Special Coins, they are used to purchase and upgrade your Special Attacks, which consume SP, the green meter under your HP & MP bars. MC are Magic Coins, they work similar to SC except they unlock Magic skills on the Magic Eggs you will acquire throughout the game.\n\nThere are numerous other reviews there that go more in-depth about this game & its playstyle, what it does, etc.. I'm just here to say THANK YOU for bringing this game to Steam. I am so overjoyed to sit down and play this game again, relive some of the wonderful moments the game brings and enjoy a wonderful JRPG on Steam.\n\nIf you enjoy JRPGs, I would heavily suggest this game. :)","August 24, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was one of my all time favorite titles on the Dreamcast and probably one of my top 5 favorite JRPGs in general.\n\nThe OST is great and very memorable. The English voiceacting may be a little rough by today's standards, but nostalgia blinders kind of let me see past it. I'm interested to try the japaenese voices though. Currently there's a glitch with a very high pitched noise at random times. Considering the game hasn't even been out 24 hours yet, I'm hoping it gets fixed soon.\n\nThe battle system is probably one of the best known features of the game and is one of the best for a turn based game.\n\nThe graphics are pretty much what you'd expect from a port of a 15 year old game. I like that they've bumped the resolution, but the FMV sequences and some of the background textures are still pretty fuzzy.\n\nOverall would definitely recommend as long as you realize what you're getting into. The game is a port. Not a remake or a remaster. Some small improvements have been made, but overall it's still basically the same game that was on the Dreamcast so long ago.","August 24, 2015","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Top three cross platform with Legend of Dragoon and Final Fantasy 8 (Sorry 7 lovers).\n\nThe characters are well written, and surprisingly well voice acted for the time.\n\nThe graphics weren't anything special, but then not much was in the early 2000's.\n\nThe music was fantastic, I still listen the cd that came with the Dreamcast version when I'm feeling nostalgic.\n\nThe story is tried and true Good VS. Evil, with a deadly sins, Sci-fi twist that blew my mind the first playthrough.\n\nGrandia got a lot of attention back in the day for its different take on the ATB Gauge, 1-upping early final fantasy games.\n\nThe Mana Eggs were reminiscent of Materia I suppose but it felt like each character had one tailor made for them, and when you have an ability thats called Boom, levels up to Ba-Boom, then levels up again to KA-BOOM, its very satisfying.\n\nNostalgia aside, this game's mechanics and story hold up very well after a little more that a decade.  This game is a must play for anyone who likes 90's rpgs, who likes good story in their games, and who like to feel a little awesome while teleporting around a battlefield doing moves like Sky-Dragon Slash and KA-BOOM./","August 25, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've never played any Grandia titles but I have played several JRPG's and RPG's alike, so my review is not nostalgia based.  GRAPHICS  are actually nice for a remaster of a game thats almost 15 years old, no complaints, the motions are a little choppy but were talking about a Dreamcast port here. Overall at 1080p locked at 30fps with 8x MXAA I'm satisfied.  SOUND  in this game is a tough one. I LOVE THE BATTLE THEME it fits right into the action of the battles, general music is nicely written and interesting. SFX shows its age out of everything the most in this game, with clunky, metallic footsteps that sound f*cking ancient.  GAMEPLAY  in one word is refreshing. Simplistic and addictive turnbased fights with action in between turns. Satisfying JRPG awesomeness in every turn, nice loot system and decent level system. A wonky part of the game is the camera which does get pretty annoying but it's still workable. I have yet to see what this game fully offers obviously but initial impressions are a nice suprise.  CONFIGURATION  isn't the best but it works. My 360 controller I bought for windows works perfectly I think it's worth a shot at the price on sale, if you like older Final Fantasy like myself, you can hop right in  with no problem and be satisfyed. It takes a certain gamer to appreciate a classic like this.","August 25, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You battle in a circular arena with each encounter. Your party consists of up to 4 people. The idea is that normal attacks can be performed immediately, magic and specials take a bit to charge up, and critical hits can be performed to cancel an opponent’s action. Specials and magic can affect multiple targets based on where they are standing on the field in relation to you. This means that in a crowded field of 8 characters, you will be scanning over each one to see what they plan on doing for their next turn, then acting in accordance with what you predict will happen. It’s very involved and more fun than any other traditional RPG I’ve played. (but if you need a break, you can set the playable characters to AI.) -story took me 36 hours or so.\n\nStory:\nGrandia II has a powerful story with some good heart wrenching emotional moments. I’ve heard reports of players crying over events, and  I don’t dare spoil a single one of them. Through there are some less than graceful bits and I’ll admit to not having strong attachments to a couple of the characters. But once you get in a ways, it really does take your heart with it. Unlike most RPG’s i’ve played, it actually has a very personal and interesting take on the religion of the world. But by far the most gripping part for me is the influence of the game’s devil “Valmar” on the people’s lives: both widespread and on individuals.\n\n\nMusic:\nThere are 46 songs on the soundtrack. Among them are touching sombre melodies. Some powerful and sad hymn sounding tunes. And there are a handful of exciting action tracks as well, none of which grate despite how much fighting you do. However, there are a couple strange upbeat tracks that do get a bit overplayed in the overworld. All in all though, the music has a lot to offer and enhances most moments in the game very, very nicely.\n\nArt:\nThough it may not look like much today, there are vast texturing improvements over the original version. It doesn’t break your suspension of disbelief, but by today’s standards it isn’t anything spectacular.\n\nPort:\nThis may be a port, but fear not! The developers have been actively patching flaws found in the game. My game crashed once during my playthrough, but that issue has since been patched!\n\nTips:\nThis game was released in 2000, it’s really hard not to spoil yourself on story elements, so tread lightly.\n\nYour party members change as the game progresses, but do not be afraid to spend skill points on characters that might not stay with you forever. The game has a way of making up for this.\n\nYou can adjust individual audio properties by running the setup before game launch. There are some really overpowered sounds, so I encourage you to play with that.\n\n\nYou will encounter a place called The Hut of Trials in the story. Be sure to return there as soon as you can. It’s a grind, but  It unlocks some amazing items as well as an achievement. You will only have access to this place for a short time.\n\nSummary:\nGrandia II May have a couple things wrong, but everything it gets right is a total bullseye. Easily worth full price and just maybe a little place in your heart.","September 16, 2015","true","40.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was ecstatic to find out that this game would be coming out on steam.  I loved the battle system which is really unique compared to other turn based systems. It uses a timer-like bar that indicates when your character is able to make his or her move.  I love the ability to cancel out the enemies moves and have them reset their position on this bar.\n\nThe story is your typical jrpg stuff where it is the end of the world and a group of people have to combine their efforts to save the world from destruction.  The characters and their interactions are a joy to watch.  There is some romance in the game as well but don't expect too much from that.  The visuals reflect the age of the game and it must be noted that this game is not a HD remaster. In fact, its more of a port with the added bonus of having dual audio tracks and a hard mode added to the game.  In summary, I recommend this game if you are a JRPG fan and miss the old school turn based gaming that used to be so prevalent back in the ps2 era.  Moreover, if you would like to see more JRPG games sold on steam, I recommend to support these companies so that it gives them an incentive to bring the other games over to Steam.   I am pleased that games like Trails in the Sky, Valkyria Chronicles and Grandia II have been added to the Steam store and I hope this is a sign of more JRPGs to come.","August 26, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played the ps2 port, emulated, and the dreamcast version. Obviously, dreamcast is the best platform to play it on. It's playing an all time favorite with sharper images (I played on a crt as even with an adapter on a panel doesn't do that much for it); I love seeing textures and patterns technology prevented me from seeing in the past. My favorite part, and the best part of the port, has been the ability to play it in japanese. To be fair; I'm a borderline weeaboo, but at the same time I don't have to hear god damn Roan's voice. I do miss Cam Clark's voice.\n\nThis IS, without a doubt, the best port I've played. It's a favorite so I collected the games and paraphernalia when I was younger.\n\nThe audio is kind of buggy, but not too bad. There are some bizarre sound effects during battle, but only occasionally and not during boss fights. The voice to sound effect volume aren't adjustable either; The voices are too low in japanese compared to the volume of the sound effects coupled with the music. Speaking of music I have a superficial issue where the tracks start and end. There is a short silence between the beginning and end. Its not too bad, but considering how short the tracks are it can sound a bit repetitive.\n\nThe only graphical issues I've encountered are during battle when single target spells are cast. The lighting isn't smooth filling the battle arena, but I haven't experienced this during boss battles. You see what shound be soft lighting fading the further from the light source as a solid rectangle on the ground, luckily it doesn't just remove the texture all together like the ps2 port.\n\nIn whole Grandia II Anniversary Edition is a game you won't regret buying if you love classic jrps.\n\nThis is my review only so far. I've only reached the cliffs, as to not spoil anything.\nI'll probably update my review the further I get through the game, and hopefully when more patches have been released.","August 29, 2015","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's now 2015, and it still manages to be one of, if not the best, RPG battle systems the genre has to offer, perhaps only outdone by the subsequent releases in the series. Just thought I would get that out of the way. If the game had no other positive aspects, it would still at least lay claim to that lofty accolade pretty effortlessly.\n\nThe rest of the game has not aged as gracefully as the battle system, however.\n\nFirst of all, the PC port is solid. It started off rough, but GungHo has done a pretty great job of releasing quick patches and fixes to the point now that it has ALMOST become the definitive edition of the game. There are still some audio and graphical hitches here and there and at least once during my close to 40 hours playing, the game shut down after a random battle (and I'm told that this might be more common for other people than it was for me).\n\nStability aside, this port also has a hard mode that brings it closer to what the difficulty should have been to begin with, though honestly I still had very little trouble in general. Oh, and it's NOT widescreen. This doesn't bother me so much personally, as I usually play these re-releases for the nostalgia anyway. So the closer it is to the original, the better. I can't imagine it would have been too terribly hard to implement, though, so at least the option would have been nice. And don't set your expectations too high for the so-called "improved visuals." All it is is a few randomly selected textures that have been cleaned up and some wonky lighting and shadows thrown in for no apparent reason (it's not as distracting as I make it sound).\n\nWhat really set me back a bit was the story itself. It gets a lot...cheesier near the end than I remember. To be fair, though, I was an angsty teen the first time I went through it. It almost feels like two different teams wrote the dialogue for the game. On the one hand, you have the casual banter with your party and townsfolk that is very well done. Ryudo in particular makes a few comments throughout the game that feel genuinely clever and play into his persona quite well.  In fact, the best characterization in general I feel is done through this casual dialogue, which makes me wonder if the localization team was given a bit more leeway with their translations when it was not necessarily story-sensitive dialogue.\n\nThen you have the...I don't know, "main story" dialogue in cutscenes that tends to get ridiculously cheesy and cringe worthy. Let me put it this way, if you were playing a drinking game near the end of the game for every time someone said "heart," you would die of alcohol poisoning within the first cutscene you hit. Then add to that some really random "power-of-the-heart" jumps in logic (like, where the hell did Ryudo get that sword!?), and the total story package seems just a little less impactful for me than it did fifteen years ago. Still, it's almost always light and happy, so I can't rag on it too much. The sense of adventure is there most of the time, though it loses out to the original in that aspect when it instead attempts to philosophize about the human spirit.\n\n....I hope that didn't scare anyone away. The characters are still overall interesting and funny and entertaining, and I still wholeheartedly recommend the game. More than anything, though, it makes me wish some development team (with a great writing staff) would pick the property back up and give us a number 4. It's a dirty shame this battle system is going to waste.","October 18, 2015","true","36.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What more could you want out of an RPG?\n\nDespite It's linearity Grandia 2 has so much attention to detail, particularly with NPC's and dialogue. Grandia 2 is very dialogue heavy but it's dialogue is what makes it such a stand-out title amongst other JRPG's. Unlike standard JRPG's where the NPC's talk to you and you walk away, Grandia 2 makes the NPC's relevant by adding character interaction whilst talking to them as opposed to them talking to what might as well be a brick wall. This gives more life to the world and more personality to the characters and setting. It's a truly unique experience that cannot be missed.\n\nThe combat is slightly imbalanced at times but is pretty enjoyable and has a few innovative ideas to spice it up. I reccommend playing on the game's hard difficulty though as Normal is a tad easy. Hard makes it so that you actually need to use some strategy if you want to progress smoothly. The battle music is easily the most awesome battle music i've ever heard in a videogame (the music that plays in the trailer). The rest of the soundtrack is also great, it gives off this 80's vibe which adds even more personality to the game. There's just something so quirky about the soundtrack and the narrative that makes it really alluring to play.\n\nThe visuals in the original were admittedly pretty mediocre, not because of the art design, mainly because of the quality. That is fine tuned considerably in this version and the world looks bright and colorful, it might not be everyones cup of tea but it's definitely nice to look at in this version.\n\nAll in all, this is an underrated classic and is my second favourite JRPG of all time for a reason. You should seriously pick this up and surprise yourself with this gem if you consider yourself a fan of this genre.\n\nNote: There are a few crashing issues post battle, best way to avoid them is to not skip the xp screen. This may be patched later.","August 24, 2015","true","59.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really think the game stands up well to time but there are some things that make it nearly a miss. First you will notice the graphics are not updated across the board there are some icons and backgrounds that are low resolution. Luckily the world looks very nice and the low polygons are offset by nice texture maps.\n\nThe party of characters is smallish 3 or 4 usually at a time, and no switching I believe just auto party formed as the story goes and changes. But there is alot of story in the world and there are alot of interesting things happening in the world.\n\nThe music is good too, its not the best but none of the tracks are very grating or annoying. Its nice to play a game that also has a some what serious tone to it at times. Its talks alot about how people treat others and let narrowmindedness take over from fear.\n\nMinus' in my book are the text moves at a stuttering pace, very tedious at times. The world is zoomed in alot and you don't see alot of the area around you. There are some sort of slow battle animations it make the game feel dated.\n\nGraphics: 9 (this includes overall feel and stlye as well as resolutions)\nSound: 8 (the sounds are effects and voice acting)\nMusic: 9 (music in gameplay)\nGamePlay: 8 (battle system and menu traversal)\nStory: 8 (the world and the games central themes)","October 10, 2015","true","51.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

TLDR Pros/Cons near the bottom-\n\nThe story is a straight forward, though perhaps a bit generic in some regards. Like a lot of J-RPGs the main character, Ryudo, is a bit of a dark hero where he's crude and blunt with people to begin with but over time grows more mature and attached to the people around him. There's some small twists in the story, but if you're paying attention and think about it a little as things go on, you'll probably see them coming. Character wise you're followers are at least mildly interesting, namely Millennia in my opinion who I think really steals the show in this game. She's fun and colorful and interacts with several individuals in interesting ways. So as far as story, don't expect too much in terms of depth but but the characters are what make it stand out against the background.\n\nThe combat system has aged fairly well considering it's been 15 years since the release on dreamcast and has some decent depth to it even in this day in age for RPGs. There's some thinking and combo set ups to make certain things more effective which can be really cool. However, as you get further in levels some of these elements become less important as you outscale the enemies or can one-shot multiple enemies with some skill or magic attacks. Boss fights in this game is the real golden zone for tense combat where being tactical is a bit more important and relatively constant through the game. Hard mode which was added to this port further pushes for this and at times I found myself using stuff I didn’t need to bother with before. If you're looking for some fair but difficult bosses, go ahead and play hardmode, just be warned that until you get a second party member that things might be a bit more difficult.\n\nGraphically, the game is alright. It's 15 years old so I cant say I would expect too much, BUT the textures have been very nicely improved with this release. Detail is much more notable on character design and colors are more flushed out which is very nice. There's some issues with the game's resolution as it only is in 4:3 unless you force the aspect ratio to change which will skew the character models. There's some tearing that happens occasionally which is annoying, but for the most part is fairly solid. Music in this game is a bit of a mixed bag. There’s times where is rather good, others that’s generic and other times leaves something to be desired even if it is old. There’s just a lot of music in here that’s simply not memorable at all. Game length however is pretty good. Depending on what you decide to do this game can last anywhere between 20-30 hours which for the price isn’t too bad. When on sale I would say that it is very well worth the money.\n\nNow let's talk about the port. This is where I would like to give SkyLabs the credit that's due to them. At launch, this game had a laundry list of issues going on with it. Some of them just annoying, some of them that actually broke the game and made progress impossible or flat out kill you. However, these guys have been amazingly faithful to this game and has fixed tons of these problems and also added many of the things I wanted in features. Lots of resolution options even up to 4K, 60 FPS battles (which is huge), audio sliders, rebindable keys, gamepad support and audio language options (English/Japanese). 60 FPS battles is particularly what sold me on these guys in my opinion because it picks up the combat speed just a little bit so it doesn’t feel as long, but also makes it run so much smoother. Currently this function doesn’t seem to play well with windowed mode but this may be my own issue, fullscreen works with it just fine. One thing I would love see though is a fullscreen windowed option, but hopefully we see this in the future. On the bad side, the game still has a few crashing and audio issues that have caused me to leave it alone for a while before returning to it because I was annoyed with it.\nOverall, I’m glad I’ve bought this game. It’s been a nice nostalgia trip, but even as a game still holds itself up well. If you’re into J-RPG style games like final fantasy it’s certainly worth picking up.\n\nTLDR\npros\n+Great combat system\n+Interesting characters and places\n+Decent game length for the price 20-30 hours\n+Fair and difficult boss fights on hardmode\n+VERY faithful patching\n+60 FPS combat for a formerly 30FPS game\n+Retextured into higher resolution\n\nCons\n-Fairly generic story, though charming at times\n-Music not so great at times\n-Easy non-boss enemies\n-Couple of technical issues still exist (likely to be fixed)\n-No Fullscreen Windowed\n\nIn all, Grandia II is a great addition to an RPG lineup if you’re looking for something more mechanically deep than in story. Short of the small issues with the game I would recommend it, especially if the game goes on a sale.","September 11, 2015","true","42.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I can easily forgive that since it's an old game. Also shows a little linearity, but it doesn't detract from the interesting combat or customization system. After having beaten the game, I feel rather lukewarm about it, but it's a good lukewarm, since there's nothing really bad about the game. The story didn't do anything for me, but it's really charming and I have to admit that they did a good job on it. I love a good story that's entertaining and a change-up of the norm.

My then-girlfriend surprised me with a game, she said she thought I would like it just by looking at the cover art. She was right!\n\nIt's hard to put into words why I like this game. The story is not that great, your typical JRPG run-of-the-mill story you find used over and over, with their variance on it. I think what I really loved so much about the game was the character development. Every good JRPG has it and they do it well, but this game REALLY caught my attention with it. There were times when I played and I thought to myself, "Wow, I love the direction they're going", with either one character or the other.\n\nAnother thing I loved is, it's a 4-person party. I looooove 4-person party JRPGs. Really allows for some great boss fights. But what I TRULY love is, the game doesn't give you extra characters. You can never swap characters out; the four that run with you, are with you unless the game substitutes them out for someone else. I believe there's a total of 6 different characters in the game, they're all really diverse and unique, they bring their own element to the fights.\n\nYou level up like usual, collecting four types of currency; EXP, gold, SC & MC. Gold buys your usual things; armor and weapons, items. SC are Special Coins, they are used to purchase and upgrade your Special Attacks, which consume SP, the green meter under your HP & MP bars. MC are Magic Coins, they work similar to SC except they unlock Magic skills on the Magic Eggs you will acquire throughout the game.\n\nThere are numerous other reviews there that go more in-depth about this game & its playstyle, what it does, etc.. I'm just here to say THANK YOU for bringing this game to Steam. I am so overjoyed to sit down and play this game again, relive some of the wonderful moments the game brings and enjoy a wonderful JRPG on Steam.\n\nIf you enjoy JRPGs, I would heavily suggest this game. :)","August 24, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was one of my all time favorite titles on the Dreamcast and probably one of my top 5 favorite JRPGs in general.\n\nThe OST is great and very memorable. The English voiceacting may be a little rough by today's standards, but nostalgia blinders kind of let me see past it. I'm interested to try the japaenese voices though. Currently there's a glitch with a very high pitched noise at random times. Considering the game hasn't even been out 24 hours yet, I'm hoping it gets fixed soon.\n\nThe battle system is probably one of the best known features of the game and is one of the best for a turn based game.\n\nThe graphics are pretty much what you'd expect from a port of a 15 year old game. I like that they've bumped the resolution, but the FMV sequences and some of the background textures are still pretty fuzzy.\n\nOverall would definitely recommend as long as you realize what you're getting into. The game is a port. Not a remake or a remaster. Some small improvements have been made, but overall it's still basically the same game that was on the Dreamcast so long ago.","August 24, 2015","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It uses a timer-like bar that indicates when your character is able to make his or her move.  I love the ability to cancel out the enemies moves and have them reset their position on this bar.\n\nThe story is your typical jrpg stuff where it is the end of the world and a group of people have to combine their efforts to save the world from destruction.  The characters and their interactions are a joy to watch.  There is some romance in the game as well but don't expect too much from that.  The visuals reflect the age of the game and it must be noted that this game is not a HD remaster. In fact, its more of a port with the added bonus of having dual audio tracks and a hard mode added to the game.  In summary, I recommend this game if you are a JRPG fan and miss the old school turn based gaming that used to be so prevalent back in the ps2 era.  Moreover, if you would like to see more JRPG games sold on steam, I recommend to support these companies so that it gives them an incentive to bring the other games over to Steam.   I am pleased that games like Trails in the Sky, Valkyria Chronicles and Grandia II have been added to the Steam store and I hope this is a sign of more JRPGs to come.","August 26, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the story can be a bit cringey at times, and the voice acting a bit off. The message the game conveys and the battle system make this extremely forgivable. A combat system that rewards skill and timing which allows players to truly take advantage of the depth in the game. There are some glitches present in the game at this time but ultimately that’s just a small dent in a truly unforgettable experience.","August 26, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't beat the game yet but it seems to streamline you through the story,  seems very linear.  The story however is very well written.\nI think there were many missed opportunites in this game it seems.  I see so many places where they could have made something into a side quest or an optional boss, but nothing.\n\nThe combat is interesting and once I got used to playing it was fun for the most part, especially bosses.\n\nOverall I don't see the hype I've seen everyone have for this game however I would still recommend it if for no other reason than because of the story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/koesir/recommended/330390/","koesir","Terrysa Kiris-POWAAAAAH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/koesir/","15 products in account","Just bought this on CNY sales, and daaamn it takes me back to 2002, the first time I played this. Seriously, if you never played this game and wonder why many people fall in love with J-RPG in the old times, pick it now!\n\nThe Pros:\n\n+ Gameplay. I really love the semi-turn based style. In a world of video game today where everyone wants their turn right away, It gives me time to think as much as I want (just like other jRPG, when you choose attack/skill/items, the world freeze), yet it still gives me the random factor like counter-attack and positioning. The boss battle basically you and your party tries to 'cancel' boss turn as much as you can before it shoots something dangerous.\n\n+ Graphic. While it's obviously not Mass Effect level, this edition gives nice retouch and crispier 3D. They even have anti-aliasing and 60 fps battle.\n\n+ Character. Your main hero is Ryudo, a geohound (or mercs). Beside his skilled swordmanship, he also has some good sarcastic remarks on people. He's like your Fallout 4 character but pressing the sarcastic option almost all the time. Millenia is a hot-headed, ♥♥♥♥♥y, and flirty. Imagine the banter between the two. Also, like many j-RPG tropes, your party are a misfits of people of many races with different personalities.\n\n+ Story is pretty epic and quite wild, although at sometimes, you'll say "yep, just like I guess, he's the bad guy". Well, it's not j-RPG if it doesn't have some classic j-rpg tropes.\n\n+ Sound. It's clean and clear. The soundtrack won't winning award anytime soon, but it's not bad either. I quite like the soundtrack battle when our party were ambushed and some peaceful moments we had.\n\nThe cons:\n\n- AI. Okay, honestly it's okay. The enemies will also think like what you thinking in this game. They also will try to circling you, making your characters gather up in one place, then dropped some AoE damaging spells or pick the weakest member like your priest/healer/magician. Buuut, after you have a skill book that makes one character became the center of attention, the AI will become stupid and an easy picking because they will attack the person who held that skill book 100% of the time. Just buff him with def/hp/vit stats and he will be your impenetrable tank. Even bosses.\n\n- Controls. Get a freaking controller. The keyboard control scheme is just bad. Not the dev fault though, this game was released on console first. Seriously, use a controller. Also the camera is the hardest enemy to kill here.\n\n- Animation.  After some time, you'll wish you can skip the animation and straight to the numbers. Also, they didn't update the FMV parts. Man, seriously? Widescreen 1080p monitor and you got 800x600 2D animation sequence stretched to 1920x1080 resolution? You can imagine how blurry it is.\n\n- Replayability. Well, it's a J-RPG, you can only replay it with hard mode (although you can start with hard mode right away from new game). But maybe worth it if you missed a thing or two in your first playthrough. Otherwise, like many old j-rpg, you played once, you already know everything. No branching storyline, no morally questioning choices, it's like reading a story book.\n\nDo you recommend this game? Oh yes, despite the flaws brought from original and overall the design flaws in old J-RPG, I very much recommended this game. And Oh, If any game designer wants to learn a thing or two about j-rpg history, this is one of the gem you should look.\n\n\nI gave it an 8/10.","February 13","true","34.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is so amazing and beautifully composed. If you are a really big fan of nostalgia and older style rpgs then I'd say get this and give it a shot. The combat system is very unique and is really easy to pick up. Playign through this version was a ton of fun and literally took me about 26 hours.

The story is a very strong point, coupled with a unique battle system and skill/moves/magic learning system that takes time and effort to master (I loved this aspect). This game will satisfy those who want unique characters with good development and carefully chosen times for social reward. The plot is dark, edgy, good, and has its very deep moments.\n\nRegarding linearity, it is not quite open world and the game makes it very clear where you should go next (which is good at times because the story is quite engaging). Sounds linear, but the game offers so much freedom with how you want to set up your character, so you don't feel as tied down overall as you would expect.\n\nThe downsides:\nNot many but it suffers from just being a port, rather than a full remake. The polished character models, buildings, and 60FPS battles are nice, but it still feels like a slight chore to have to navigate through towns and dungeons with the camera zoomed in as close to the character as it is. However, this is nitpicking and barely hinders playability. Also, like any old full 3D console JRPG, some of the special moves and spells take a while to watch and you can't skip them.\n\nVerdict: Most definitely play if you are a fan of the genre, or are looking for a great game in the genre. Should take between 30-35 hours to beat. I have played many in the genre, and I thoroughly enjoyed this title. No clue why I overlooked it until this year.\n\n8.5/10\nHappy playing.","October 24, 2015","true","44.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And by "typical" I mean ultra cliche. So two gods have a fight and only the love of humanity can save the world *groan!* There are pretty good features to the game, like the turn-based fighting style was done in a unique way (for when it came out in 2000) and the character diversity is interesting. However, there are some glitches that need to be worked on, there are holes in the plot that are never revisited, and there are parts that are so outrageously annoying, that I actually turned off the sound to my game.\nThe bosses are a lot of fun to fight. They provide a decent challenge but ultimately nothing you can't handle and every dungeon map is unique. Also, there is no need for grinding and that's kind of a double-edge sword. It eliminates circling around a map looking for monsters to kill, but it takes away any motivation to strengthen my characters because it's done for me. So this game might as well be a game about fighting bosses.\nAs far as graphics are concerned, it's fine for when it released on Dreamcast in 2000, but it's embarassing for August 2015.\n"So, Chiropraptor, is it a buy?"\nI would say, put it on your wishlist,buy it on sale, and save your money.\nUltimately, I'm going to recommend it, but I'll give it a 5/10","January 15","true","40.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So how does this game stand up over the tests of time?\n\nThe graphics are nothing special. I don't really use it as a negative on the game is it would be very unfair to compare graphics from 15 years ago to graphics today. The airwork for the characters, however, is pretty good. It gives a better idea of the character's feelings during the various events in the game.\n\nAs for voice acting, The English voiceacting isn't horrible, especially considering that many games at the time's voice acting was cringe worthy. It is rather odd that some scenes that you would expect there to be voice acting there isn't while other scenes that you would think no voice acting is needed it is present.\n\nAs for the mechanics. The combat system in this game is wonderful. If you simply go by the screenshots you may think it is more or less just turn based combat, which I know many people don't care for these days. However, there is a twist to this. The games action bar adds to some tactics where you, or your enemy, can prevent certain attacks from ever going off.If an enemy is attacking you, unless its magic, they often have to line up your character before the attack goes off. If it is magic, you can use move canceling abilities to cancel the attack and move them close to the beginning of the action timer. I myself have managed to use this in such a way that a boss was never able to get a single attack off on me.\n\nThe leveling system initially is exactly what you would expect. Characters level and their stats go up. You then level their personal skills with what the game calls skill coins, which first unlocks the ability, and then strenghens and speeds up the ability. However, in addition to this you have mana eggs and skill books. Mana eggs are how you give each character their spells and you level the eggs much in the same way as the characters skills, only with magic coins. The same deal works with spells, you first unlock them, then level them increasing power and speed.\n\nLastly there are skill books. These are how you really power up your characters. Ranging from HP/MP to spell strength of certain types to how fast your character can make another move means you can really customize your team.\n\nFor the story, it is more or less your standard JRPG of save the world. It has a few twists and overall it is a enjoyable experience. The characters are likeable and only at times do I find them annoying. The game lasted me roughly 33 hours, which was right around how long it needed to last.\n\nThe game has a few minor bugs here and there but it has a few bigger ones. A bigger one being some mini games, such as the arm wrestling one, worked differently on the Dreamcast controls as far as I'm aware and at first seemed impossible to beat. It isn't game breaking and can still be won if you look up guides steam. A bigger one is random crashes. Now this only happened twice my entire playthrough but if you get this game it would be wise to save when you can. I lost about half an hour of work because of one of these crashes, but while frustrating, it isn't game breaking.\n\nOverall the game is an enjoyable playthrough of older JRPGs. The story isn't going to leave you jaw dropped, but it is still fairly enjoyable.","January 11","true","36.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's more of that PS1 - PS2 era JRPG. the music, battle system and dialogue are all amazing. This is the first JRPG in a long time that I'm annoyed that I have to stop playing because I have to make dinner!","January 30","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I can say without rose tinted glasses that this is one damn good RPG, with neat if slightly forgettable music with unique instrumentation ( I can't recall the boss theme, but the dungeon theme and mook battle theme stick in there, but the town theme gets replaced with one of the themes from Tales of Hearts R for my recall for some strange reason), colourful texture work, 60fps battles that look pretty neat, and that old JRPG trope of flashy attacks that take too long. We Knights of the Round now. The voice work is pretty damn good, the VO Director was Kris Zimmerman which means you'll be hearing Colonel speaking sass in Liquid's ear, you'll be protecting Naomi Hunter from the forces of evil within her (foreshadowing too many years in the making? I think so), and you'll also witness the brotherly rivalry between Solidus and Liquid.\n\nEntirely worth a full price purchase, and HIGHLY recommended at discount.","April 10","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While you can play this game with a keyboard and mouse I do recommend playing with a controller.\n\nIf you like old school turn-based JRPGs this game is for you!
