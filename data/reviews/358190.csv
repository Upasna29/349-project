"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crysisheld/recommended/358190/","crysisheld","ThatsMeTYLER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crysisheld/","306 products in account","Hi there,\n\nFirst time I saw this game was back in 1994 when I got my first PC and was a little over DOOMED as I played DOOM and DOOM2 excessively! OK then how do I came up with this game when everybody played DOOM and DOOM2?\n\nSimple story:  I had a friend who gave me a Shareware CD which was quite common that time so if you grew up in the late 80´s and early 90´s like I did you know what I mean. I was browsing this CD with demos of System Shock, Wolfenstein, Raptor and a game that was called Blake Stone. I liked the screenshots - well you got me the colorful screenshots these amazing bright colors of that game got me hooked!\n\nOn Steam you can either get Blake Stone with the 3D Reamls Anthology or the Apogee Throwback Pack which is not as expensive but only has features 4 games instead of 32.\n\nSteam version runs with DOSBox and they configured it quite well so you should not have any problems to run this game.   The game itself is devided into 6 episodes the first one is the original shareware episode the other five episodes were only available if you bought the full registered version of the game - so here they are. It took me about one hour to complete the first episode and compared to the other episodes the levels in episode one are pretty small. If you are a secret hunter you need a lot of time but it really makes fun to searching every wall for a secret door!\n\nBeware! Since this game uses an enhanced Wolfenstein engine there are only 90 degrees walls but and enemies look a bit... well it´s retro so never mind!!\n\nUnlike Wolfenstein3D this game features textured floors and ceilings much more different enemies and last but not least bosses at the end of each episode. The fighting pattern of the enemies is nearly the same like in Wolfenstein and there are also a lot of items you can collect to get a Rocky-Mountain high score.\n\nSo if you like real old school shooters this one is a must have in your STEAM library.\n\nFeel free to join the Retro Games 80´s, 90´s Group on Steam\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/retrogames8090#curation","May 10, 2015","true","4.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/358190/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold is a FPS that runs on Wolfenstein 3D (or similar) engine that was released in 1993. Like everybody likes to mentioned: a week before Doom release. It had a shareware release with only first episode playable, out of six. Yea, bigger than usual demos.\n\nPretty much no complaints about how it was handled for Steam. It runs on quite a fine DOSBox in it's original form. You will notice that game mentions comic introduction in manual. You can find pdf file of manual in game's folder.\n\nThe game's presentation is standard Wolfenstein 3D fare. You get your usual menu, you get small instruction, you get to even choose 6 episodes and 4 difficulty levels.\nStory is quite simple. You are secret agent. And you have to stop Goldfire, director/scientist who wants to take over Earth and known universe with his army of puny mutants, while getting funding with his technology of replicating gold. And he already released mutants out in all the buildings and locations that he own. He also has tons of human guards too, and they don't mind the mutants in same rooms. And yes, he escapes 6 times in a row, but at least there is a bit more plot than in Wolf3D.\nMusic is a jolly soundblaster. Quite funky, mostly fits for exploration of mazes. Pretty good stuff. But it gets repeated often, it's not enough for 60+ levels. Actually, you will even hear main theme used for one of the missions.\nSome voices are silly though.\n\nGraphically Blake Stone looks pretty. It even got support for floor and ceiling texture. Not only that, but it got "lighting" option, which works like a "dark fog" - stuff that is far from you will appear darker. All of it combined gives Blake Stone some smooth appearance without feeling that something is lacking. On bad sides, all the mutants have animation only for once side. I could see that developers probably ran out of memory, seeing how it has more details than Wolf3D, once again.\nYep, going to compare game to Wolf3D quite a lot.\n\nThe gameplay on first look is quite usual 1-plane FPS. You explore maze, you find secrets by cluelessly abusing walls, you shoot down every baddie. You collect ammo and weapons. And you collect keycards. There are few differences though.\n\nWeapons. They aren't exactly balanced around each other much, it's just "shoot faster" with two exclusions to rule. The first weapon is silenced plasma pistol or something. It has unlimited ammo but slow fire rate. But it's also silent, will not awake nearby opponents. Game does give you few situations where it can be put to a good use. It also got some sort of limited-range rocket launcher, which blows things in primitive explosion, nice addition. It also can shoot said plasma balls as fast as game's minigun, making every boss sad.\n\nThen this game has an automap feature, that you look at in stats screen. It shows locked doors and even keycards that you missed as red dots too. Improves maze enjoyment.\nOh, and you use elevator in which you start to progress between levels. You just have to find red access card to get to the next floor. You can revisit previous levels.\n\nEven more, the game's level are being inhabited by bio-technicians, which add to variety. They can be either hostile or informants. You can interact with them. If they are hostile, then they will either start chase you if you fire weapon nearby, or if you poke them, or if you poke them twice. In latter case, which means that they don't want to interact with you, you can kill them freely too. Informants on other hand will help you. They will give you random useless information ("doors with red color are locked") or give you ammo or food token. You should poke them few times to make them give you all their resources. Shooting them will lower your score.\nOh, and if stats screen shows "informants alive" as "N/A", then feel free to shoot everything.\n\nTalking of interaction, levels are filled with food dispensers on walls, that you can poke. Taking food token, they will restore a portion of your health.\nThere are objects that you can destroy too, like boxes or something explosive, sometimes revealing supplies or even key. Or if it's enemy container, like egg, you can shoot it to reveal enemy sometimes. Do it if you are going for 100% stats.\n\nGoldfire, main villain of the game, can randomly teleport in nearby you at seemingly random times in any levels. I am not really sure whether it's actually random or not, but he will be chasing you down. It's very easy to take him down, making him teleport away (while fixing his tie despite having bullets/plasma coming at him), He still makes you look after you back.\n\nBut despite all of those nice addition, the game is still repetitive, especially if you try to play all 6 episodes in a single day. It doesn't have goodly done combat system to it, like say, in Doom. There is almost no big differences between episodes, just different levels and bosses. The bosses still suck too, being easily taken down by spam, having only projectile attack that you can hide from easily as well. Goldfire puts a better fight in boss levels as miniboss.\nAt least enemies are varied, but don't really change what you do. As a small detail, guards can run out of ammo. If they do, they will start to just run around randomly like chicken.\n\nThere is also big issues with difficulty. When playing it on the second skill (maybe it's "normal") the game overall is quite easy, with occasional difficult spots. Nothing outright frustrating. But once you set a higher difficulty, you will notice one huge problems: some tough enemies don't show pain often. You can't stun lock them by shooting into face. If you get around corner and meet tough human, chances are is that he may die even if you start shooting first. Silent pistol-thing also may become more useless.\n\nBut despite repetitiveness, the game pulls enough of little details and features, that give this Wolf3D era game enough of variety and brain to make it interesting. It's not blast to play, but it manages to give just enough of fun to raise it above Wolfenstein 3D blank. So you can try this curious title. On normal difficulty. Then forget about it.","May 16, 2015","true","9.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","1"

I played this before I played Wolfenstein 3D and I have to say I prefer Blake Stone.  It's a classic pixelated FPS with a bunch of dumb puzzles and dumber enemies, but it's a nice trip down memory lane and might give younger gamers a glimpse into what us old timers had to play when we were young.","February 23","true","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"
