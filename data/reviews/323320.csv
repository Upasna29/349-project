"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/recommended/323320/","misspauling","Cade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/","586 products in account","A stealth release outta nowhere by a small team working within Ubisoft to create good games (maybe a rebel group making non-buggy games without tons of DLC and giant day one patches?),  Grow Home slipped under many people's radar, perhaps overshadowed by bigger games released around the same time. That's unfortunate, because Grow Home is a fantastic 3D platformer (a mostly-dead genre treading water with few and far between indie releases) that does basically everything right. I'd hesitate to call it a masterpiece, but the core mechanics, (simple) story, and charming aesthetic (not to mention the absurdly low price) easily bump it into the everyone-should-give-this-a-try tier. Let's break it down.\n\nGameplay\nA smaller game like this, with no budget to craft twenty hours of cutscenes and grandiose sweeping plots full of twists and turns, lives and dies on gameplay alone. Fortunately, in this area, Grow Home excels. The game starts you off simply: left trigger to grab with your left hand, right trigger to grab with your right. After a few shaky climbs up cliffs, you start to get the hang of it, and soon you're flinging yourself from cliff to cliff like a robotic monkey, champion of your domain. This progresses slightly over the course of the game, with temporary slow hovering powerups giving way to crazy hang-glider-esque leaves that let you soar straight down at dizzying speeds then up into a triumphant crescendo, finally culminating in a rocket pack that lets you control your ascent and descent, but with small amounts of (thankfully automatically recharging) fuel. The climbing is fantastic, putting the likes of Nathan Drake and Lara Croft to shame, instead aiming for and reaching the lofty heights of Shadow of the Colossus's excellent system. Unlike SOTC, though, this game isn't too much of a challenge, and with no stamina meter to speak of you're rarely in *too* much danger.\n\nThe central progression mechanic involves growing stalks off of a large plant, riding them like missiles into glowing green energy rock in order to make the central plant grow larger. It doesn't sound fun, and indeed I had more fun with the collect-a-thon style crystal hunt, but it's serviceable and it's always frustrating (in a good way) when you have to grow more stalks off of a stalk that *just* didn't reach its target.\n\nGraphics\nGrow Home's artstyle is fantastic, a flat-textured, low-poly aesthetic full of whimsy and charm, with silly-looking creatures and exotic-looking plants everywhere you look. These flora and fauna are occasionally functional, but a lot of the scenery is just that. The lighting looks beautiful, and standing on an asteroid seventeen hundred meters in the air, staring up into the sky and then looking down at the ocean and all the vines below you is a breathtaking experience.\n\nSound\nWith little in the way of music to speak of, Grow Home's weakest area is this by far. The creature noises, ambient sounds, and occasional hint of music are fine, but nothing I would call outstanding by any means.\n\nOther thoughts\nWith little in the way of replayability and a very short time to finish the game (though add a few hours on for getting every collectible, including (light ending spoiler)  the eight star seeds after the credits roll , Grow Home might not be for everyone. If you want a fun, upbeat experience with no combat to worry about and little story to wrap your head around, give it a shot. It's a delightful little game in a rare genre, and it's absolutely worth your time - provided you don't mind that time being a little short. The price point is fair for the amount of game you get, I think, and I'd easily recommend it at full price -- but waiting for a sale might be smart if you're the type who prefers to get dozens of hours of gameplay for their money.\n\nBonus: If you hate uPlay and think that Ubisoft game = have to deal with secondary launcher, fret not. Grow Home doesn't use uPlay and operates like any other game on Steam.\n\nClosing remarks\nGrow Home is excellent, and I hope this team delivers even more exciting experiences, with or without Ubisoft. The central mechanic is so good I'd play similar games in other scenarios (EVA spaceship repair sim? Please? Co-op? Someone hire me to design that).\n\nHighly recommended.","February 15, 2015","true","8.5"," 379 of 389 people (97%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","97","379","389","72","3"

B.U.D starts his journey empty-handed, low on juice and faced with a burdensome task: grow a single plant all the way up into the stratosphere to collect the seeds it produces in order to save his home planet.\n\nDelightedly, playing Grow Home is not a burdernsome task in the slightest and I found myself quickly tearing through the game until nothing was left to achieve. Grow Home brings everything that matters.\n\nStory\nStory? Oh yeah. You gotta climb a plant and something something... Jetpacks and Leafgliders something something save your planet...\n\nGameplay\nThis is where Grow Home scores all of its points. Like, literally all 10 of them. From the instant that B.U.D is in your control, you feel it. The awkward, lumbering, procedurally-animated mess of fun that is B.U.D's mobility instantly sinks into you and you can't help but smile just a little bit as he trips and stumbles around. Then, after rolling down a cliffside and short-circuiting in the mountain's surrounding waters, you smile a lot.\n\nYou start with limited abilities: jumping, climbing and... tumbling (not convinced that this is actually an ability). After a few unavoidably chuckle-worthy mistakes, the game develops into something intuitive and simple. Using the controller's shoulder buttons as left and right claws, B.U.D can climb any surface and start to crawl his way up the Star Plant. The feeling of freedom delivered by B.U.D's mobility is simply excellent, allowing you to gradually move more fluidly and quickly as you upgrade the clumsy robot's abilities.\n\nThroughout your vertical expedition, you'll encounter a fun mix of strange creatures, mysterious caves, vibrant vegetation and shiny minerals on unique floating islands. A quickly-revolving day-and-night cycle further accents and dynamically changes the colorful areas as you scrutinize them for gems; glowing crystals that are used to upgrade B.U.D's capabilities, including a jetpack amongst  a couple of other useful tweaks.\n\nYour ultimate goal is to grow plants (you literally drive plant stems forward as they grow miraculously fast from under you) into the surrounding islands in order to feed the lands' mineral energy to the central Star Plant, grow it to fruition and harvest its star seeds.\n\nAudio\nWith a simple ambient soundtrack, the expected sound effects and the occasional beep boop sound expresed by B.U.D, the audio compliments the game at all times. I really don't have anything negative to say about the audio. That said, nothing really stood out either, it just worked its charm obscurely while I enjoyed a fine slice of good video game.\n\nTechnical\nGrow Home offers every basic customization option you've come to expect from a game. The game runs smoothly at all times and, for the 6-hour long 100% complete expedition I ate through, I encountered no outstanding bugs or technical issues with the game. It just works so well.\n\nThe TL;DR\nThe ride is short, but the drive is pretty wild. I haven't played a game that just felt this good in the longest of times. I thought about taking a notch out from the score for the rather small amount of content to dig into, but taking the game's very fair price into consideration, I couldn't do it.\n\nPlay Grow Home now. Oh, and use a controller. It's awesome.","August 23, 2015","true","6.1"," 132 of 142 people (93%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","93","132","142","18","0"

A happy, relaxing, challenging but not punishing game that firmly adheres to the school of "even failing should be fun."\n\nHiding underneath the cutesy and cheerful surface is some solid game design. Simple and polished, providing you with various ways to achieve your objectives, giving you clear goals, never overloading you.\n\nThe game is very physical. (Some are even calling it sexual, and while I see where they're coming from I can also see some obsessions here.) What I mean by physical is that it all has to do with how you interact with this little alien world with your robot body, and how you grow this giant plant, guiding offshoot after offshoot, creating bridges and walkways.\n\nAs you grow your way up back to your spaceship, the game gives you a very simple and immediate way to see your progess in the game, by just looking at how much you've grown the plant. It's so clever, so... simple, again.\n\nAnd let's talk about the sound design. The giant plant sings like a whale. Trees sway and tinkle like wind chimes. Cacti and bushes rattle like bean-filled toys. I found around half the game's secrets just by listening to the tell-tale sounds they emit. No wonder there's no music except in the menus; sound is a very important and well developed element.\n\nAt first you have to rely on your climbing, trampolining, and balancing skills to navigate the world you're building. As you progress and unlock more abilities, you feel more in control, and you have more options to get everywhere as fast or as slow as you want. The game's always relaxing, but it still manages to make you feel like you're improving and gaining more control. By the time you near the end, you're the master of your environment.\n\nNo game is perfect - this one is pretty close, but let me mention the things that bugged me. BUD is endearingly clumsy, due to the game's procedural animation that allows you more flexible climbing. But sometimes he's just too unpredictable and loose.\nThe game tells you when you launch it that a controller is recommended. It works fine with KB&M, but I can see why they recommend a controller: walking BUD around with analog controls allows for way more precision and less accidents. Climbing is easier. Gliding is much more enjoyable.\n\nMy other nitpick has to do with the inverted vertical axis when growing a plant shoot or gliding. An option to set that would be welcome, although I admit I got used to it and would probably have a hard time going back. But still, options are nice.\n\nOne more thing, it would be nice to have separate save slots. Now that I finished the game, I would like to preserve this "complete" save slot, while also starting a new game.\n\nThe character animations in the game may be procedural, but the world isn't. And I like it this way. I like the clever placement of secrets, the carefully designed islands and caves. But at the same time I want more, so I hope the developers release more worlds as DLC. I would be happy to pay for them.\n\nSee if you can get all the achievements. I don't usually care much about them, but in this game I have the urge to 100% it, because they are all reasonable and because it's so much fun to play.\n\nAn enthusiastic recommendation from me on this one.","March 2, 2015","true","22.4"," 91 of 92 people (99%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","99","91","92","5","0"

How do you do this you ask? Well, you have two claw-like hands that can cling to anything and a giant vine, that can sprout little vines that you can control. You try to plug these into little glow-islands that float, and then it makes the big vine grow. Even though that may sound repetitive and/boring, it is not- under any extent. Keep reading to find out why. c:\n\nGAMEPLAY 8/10\n\nYou play as B.U.D, and as stated before, use claws and vines to go home and reach greater heights. Climbing functions in the same way that I Am Bread works, with a two hands seperatly controlled and seperately made to grip. One thing that really shines about this game is the physics, as bud's movements aren't scripted and are procedural. Step in some water and you'll start slipping, or hit the ground hard and you'll come stumbling to a halt. You use a multitude of plant-based gadgets to aid you in your climb, and these range from flower parachutes to leaf hang-gliders. Another prospect of the game is finding Crystals, spread out across  the vertical landscape. As you find these, you'll unlock more abilities from a character zoom function to a super-powered jetpack. One of the best parts of the game is to get really elevated and jump off, falling until you deploy a parachute a mile down. The games height is 1.2 miles, (2000 feet) and is open for you to sprawl giant vines across every inch of it, All of the games functionalitys fit together so perfectly that this feels like a game that was meant to be from the start.\n\nGRAPHICS & SOUND 9/10\n\nI can't even get started on the graphics. Bright, vivid colors and amazing landscapes will make you gape in wonder as you stare at the pristine heights waiting to be climbed. This game really proves to you that you don't need insanely textured ANYTHING to still have beautiful and charming graphics. You'll be amazed when the sun rises and adds more stunning colors, and when the sun sets and bud's headlights flick on, illuminating the certain part of the vine you've been climbing all day.\nSound is just as perfect, fitting the current peaceful situation with harmonic tunes, also encouraging you to stop and marvel at your sorroundings.\n\nPHYSICS 9/10\nPhysics are great, and everything reacts as it should with weight and velocity. (No cardboard physcis here, don't worry.)\nEverything reacts as it should, such as pulling smaller rocks is quicker then larger ones, and falling faster or slower will determine just how far your pieces explode when you hit the ground or vine.\n\nVERDICT\n\nGrow Home is an absolutely stunning and charming game, that brings everything together in a glorious fashion.\nPick this title up as soon as you get the chance, and enjoy.\nFINAL SCORE- 9/10\n\n~Potato Walrus\nEDIT: Updated for current gameplay.","February 4, 2015","true","3.1"," 83 of 91 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","83","91","6","0"

The world is truly impressive in matters of scale, style and atmosphere. You control B.U.D., a tiny (and quite clumsy) robot whose job is to grow a huge plant. Growing the plant isn't nearly as boring as I thought it would be, it can be quite a challenge, actually. You also collect crystals along the way. These crystals unlock abilities for B.U.D. when collecting enough, a jetpack being one of the earlier abilities. Overall, the game feels great. You control each arm independently, but their only purpose is to grab onto things, which makes the game much easier to play than, say, Octodad. Jumping and walking are slightly too awkward in my opinion. Jumping isn't precise and might have you fall to your doom. Walking in Gow Home is a clumsy task, as B.U.D. steps on his feet and slides around a little bit, which can also make you fall off an edge. There aren't ennemies yet, but I hope I find some, which would up the variety just a bit. The polygon-based art style is a marvel to look at, surprisingly, which seem to work also thanks to a nice soundtrack.\nAwesome game overall. A step in the right direction for next-gen 3D patformers. If more developpers could follow Grow Home's ingenious level design, it could mark the beginning of an era of original and cool video games ideas.","February 4, 2015","true","8.5"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","67","77","7","0"

The planet you come from is in danger and the only way to save it is to harvest the seeds of an alien plant. Well it’s not as easy as it sounds. BUD only has basic equipment, he can’t do much other than climb, and since the plant is on the surface and your ship is a couple of thousand meters up, you’re going to have to work for it. You soon realise the only way to get back up there and collect the seeds is to start growing the plant as high as you can, collecting a few things along the way to help you out.\n\nGrow Home came out of nowhere for me last February and despite knowing nothing about it, I decided to get it straight after it launched. What I found myself playing ended up being, without a doubt, the most relaxing and unfalteringly fun game I’ve played, I’ve even gone as far as calling it my personal game of the year 2015 simply because I enjoyed it so much.\n\nSo what makes Grow Home so damn good?\n\nAs ever, it all starts with the game’s visuals. The visuals certainly aren’t the most important part of a game but I think we can all agree that they are probably the first thing you’ll notice. Grow Home is absolutely gorgeous thanks to its unique and incredibly vibrant art style. BUD, as well as all of the flora and fauna in the game also look great, fitting in perfectly with the world you find yourself playing around in. On the subject of BUD’s appearance, there are some different skins for you to customise him with though a couple of them have to be unlocked by story progress rather than having them at the start. Backtracking slightly, thanks to how good the game looks, Grow Home is a great game for people who enjoy taking screenshots in the game. It’s made easy thanks to the game having no UI when you’re playing it but as you can see from the store page screenshots it is possible to get some beautiful screenshots and you don’t really have to put much effort into it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=387077302\n\nStory would, however, be quite a strong word. While there is an overarching storyline to the game it never feels like it’s really there, though I think that’s a good thing in Grow Home’s case. Sure you’re always working towards the goal of your spaceship but you can take your time getting there and pretty much do what you want when you want, within the limits of the game of course. The story gives the gameplay purpose but it definitely isn’t the main event.\n\nThe gameplay is what really makes this game great. As soon as you take your first step you become acquainted with BUD’s “procedural animation”. Like it says on the store page, this makes climbing in the game “unique and unrestricted”. Now what it really means is that the protagonist is damn adorable as he stumbles around hopelessly in such a way that’s endearing and not even slightly frustrating. Yeah this movement system means you’re going to end up toppling off of a plant a fair few times when you’re playing but that’s half the fun. Falling off and getting back up again. Did I mention BUD looks really cute when he stumbles off of something? Because he looks really cute when he stumbles off of something!\n\nSo before you can witness BUD’s adorably falling from a plant stem you’re going to have to grow the plant and this is what you’ll spend most of your time doing. Once you grab on to whatever bud (that’s plant bud not robot BUD) you simply press a button and it starts growing, you then have some control over where it goes but it will try and lead you in every direction under the sun. While this may not sound like the most interesting thing ever it’s actually a lot of fun, especially if you try and make cool structures with the plant rather than simply grow to beat the game. Also the plant can be grown to look like it’s flipping someone off, so that’s cool!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388093180\n\nThere are other things to do in the world though and while they’re most just for achievements I found it enjoyable just go through the game finding everything (enough to 100% the game which is a rarity for me). There are quite a few different flora and fauna to find and if you can find them all then there’s an achievement in it for ya! There are also one hundred (though if I remember correctly, we came to the conclusion in the forums that there are actually more) crystals dotted around the map which, when collected, unlock new stuff in-game as well as achievements.\n\nGrow Home is also great in the sound department. The soundtrack is super relaxing and fits in well with the game as a whole. For those of you who like to buy game soundtracks, you get it for free with Grow Home so I guess that’s a bonus. The game’s sound effects are also nice, especially the BUD sounds when you’re in a cave, there’s a nice echo effect.\n\nA couple more positive things to mention before I finally get onto the negatives. Grow Home has a full day and night cycle, not a ground-breaking feature but it does make exploration a little more interesting, creates some great screenshot opportunities too. The game’s map is pretty big and it took me about six hours to beat the story, the other six hours was spent getting all the achievements. The last thing is more of a neutral point but Grow Home, despite being published by Ubisoft, doesn’t require Uplay.\n\nNow on to my only negative, there’s not enough game here! I don’t mean for the price, the game is great value for money. What I mean is that there’s simply not enough for those of us who really love the game, it would have been great to see modding tools or more official maps to extend the game further but I guess we can’t have everything.\n\nVerdict\nBeautiful. Relaxing. Unadulterated fun. Grow Home is a fantastic game and is easily one of my all-time favourites. There are few games I’ve enjoyed as much as I enjoyed playing Grow Home. Whether you want to unwind after a tough day’s work or you want to hop in and snap some nice screenshots, Grow Home is as good a choice as any. I can’t recommend it enough.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","February 13","true","13.1"," 62 of 74 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","62","74","0","8"

No DLC. No over-designed in-game economies or resources to manage, with microtransactions ontop of that. None of that. This is a game that once you turn it on, and load up your save, you're in until you quit.\n\nThe game is a canvas for player expression. Grow Star Plants to spell stuff in the sky. Dive 2000m in a freefall, then deploy your Glide Leaf to soar through a rock arch, before landing on a beach. Climb back up 2000m if you feel like it. (The climbing controls are great, by the way. Being able to shift your weight to get better hand holds, hang upside down, and generally climb anywhere you want feels fantastic and liberating.)\n\nAside from some goofy animation hiccups -- like BUD tumbling, rolling momentarily as a literal cluster of appendages before recovering to his regular running animation -- the game is a sight to behold. I'd actually chalk up some of the animation mishaps as part of BUD's charm, part of his character.\n\nThe sound is also a treat. The ambient tones, punctuated with fantastic sounds like old 56k router dialtones and whale songs, make for a very unique soundscape. Very relaxing. Once you've accomplished a lot of the game's main goals, it's also interesting to turn the game's music down and substitute in your own music. (It feels great to skydive to prog rock, for example.) If you're someone who enjoys Freeride modes in games like SKATE or SSX, you'll love getting into a zen state and jumping, climbing, falling, and gliding around in Grow Home with no particular goal in mind -- all while enjoying your own custom sountrack. It's medidative, if I had to use one word.\n\nThere's a lot of main objectives to the core gameplay I've not mentioned, but that's not because I felt it's not worth mentioning. Sure, that content is great, and makes up the structured play in Grow Home, but I ultimately found that I had more fun making my own fun, expressing myself in the myriad ways possible in Grow Home. Hopefully you'll have as much fun discovering them as I did.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDisclosure: I work at a Ubisoft studio, but not Reflections. I had no part in developing this game. This is an honest review from someone who enjoys this game a tonne.","February 9, 2015","true","4.7"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","43","46","0","2"

It exudes happiness and positive vibes, all clothed in a charming, cartoon-like character and innocence. It's easily accessible to casuals, but still has enough to be entertaining to old-school platformer veterans. And it's eight bucks!\n\nI would almost call this more of a sandbox-y "beanstalk simulator" than an actual "game". Your goal is incredibly simple: Keep growing your plant up, and up, and into space! No rushing, no resource management, and no real obstacles to overcome. All you have to worry about is you and your trusty plant. The closest thing to a 'failure state' in this game is accidentally falling from a high place on your plant and having to climb back up. While this can be slightly annoying at first, you will find new methods and tools for traversing the world as you progress through the game, which help make these little accidents feel like much less of a set-back.\n\nHonestly, if you saw the trailer for this game and it made you smile: THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.","February 22, 2015","true","9.6"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","87","46","53","16","2"

And all the animation is procedural which, would look really goofy with a human character unless they really really refined it, so that's why they made you a goofy robot probably. It's physical humour, almost, which the SKATE series has kind of accidentally nailed with it's INCREDIBLY BIZZARE physics engine that allows the game to transcend skateboarding. But uh, that's another story for another time. Anyway this game rules, it's basically everything i've wanted in a platforming game since Mario 64- Not more plot, not more cutscenes, not more GUNSS, just more fun and engaging and enjoyable pure platforming action, and as in this game, free climbing and super rad cool polygonal artsy graphics with the sound of soothing waves and the breeze in your metal ears. Be a kid again and climb you some rocks, even if the camera is a bit wonky sometimes! I kinda theorize that maybe this game came from Ubisoft testing out a new ♥♥♥ Creed climbing system? Which is great because I really don't like ♥♥♥ Creed but I really like this! The controls are really simple but, intutive and easy to grasp, they reccomend a gamepad but honestly the mouse + keyboard controls work just fine. Plus it's only like 8 dollars? I've accidentally dropped more money than that on a windy day. Check it out, if you like climbing rocks and accidentally drowning happy robots.\n\n","February 4, 2015","true","3.0"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","84","43","51","24","0"

It is a game in which you are given a clear goal: to Grow. It doesn't tell you precisely where to go, or how to do it, but rather gives you the tools and the knowledge to forge your own path going forwards. This is brilliant, and leads to an especially interactive experience.\n\nTL/DR; 10/10 for me. Fantastic platformer at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.\n\nThe graphics are extremely simplistic, but Grow Home remains beautiful all the same; a testament to the fact that you don't need 4k textures and ridiculous amounts of special effects to make a game visually appealing. Rather, Grow Home employs strikingly vibrant colors, minimal post effects, and an incredibly imaginative art style to make what might be one of the most inspired and magnificent game worlds I've seen in a long time.\n\nNot much can be said about the presentation. Grow Home is minimal in most ways, which isn't a bad thing. The UI is simple; it shows only what needs to be shown. The menus (what little there are) are easy enough to navigate. Nothing to complain about but nothing too spectacular.\n\nOf course, the gameplay is where Grow Home shines most (I'm a sucker for physics based games). Using an arsenal of unlockable abilities and the plantlife all throughout the world, you play as BUD (Botanical Utility Droid). BUD's movement is very clunky and odd, and that's okay. You walk normally with the left stick or WASD, and use the left trigger/leftbumper/LMB and right trigger/right bumper/RMB to controls BUD's left and right hands respectively, climbing about the terrain and collecting objects/growing your massive plant. This is the meat of the game. BUD's movement is procedurally animated, which means you won't see the same thing over and over again. Everything from walk cycles to freefalling is all done on the fly, and it makes for a really neat experience.\n\nYou also have a few special abilities, like jumping (hah), and even a limited jetpack. Each of the abilities and unique plantlife found in the game have very clear-cut uses, but can also be used in different and surprising ways, thanks largely in-part to the procedural animation. For example, early on you gain the ability to use a flower as a sort of umbrella-parachute with which you can glide for a short amount of time. One time just as it ran out, I grabbed on with both hands and used the petal-less stem to float a few more inches forwards, helping me to get to my destination. This was very cool, and really wowed me for a moment. I can't wait to discover other uses for each tool available in the game.\n\nThe sound design is very good. Once again, things are minimal. BUD's "voice" is very robotic and charming, and most plants/animals make their own sounds, and they're all very well done and fit well within the game world. The music is ambient and helps to set the mood, which is very carefree and relaxed.\n\nOverall, Grow Home is a love letter to platformers, but manages to be very modern and fresh. You jump, climb, collect things and complete objectives to further the story. I imagine it's not a very long game, but I can see some amount of replayablity for certain if you like the mechanics. 2015 is shaping up to be a great year for gamers.\n","February 4, 2015","true","1.5"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","42","52","4","3"

There are few things to do and interact with around the environment to gain achievements and give some reply value. There are 100 crystals that you can search for and collect that will ultimately upgrade the robot BUD you are controlling. You only need 60 crystals to complete the game with ease, however, the remaining can add more.\n\nThe climbing control mechanics is a nice change and welcome in my case.

There are gliding mechanics in the game too.\n\nThe physics control such as the center of mass and momentum can use a little more work, but none the less, it is satisfying for a game with this price.\n\nThis is a short review for a short game that I highly recommend if you like the art just from looking at the screenshots.\n\nI recommend Grow Home for an enjoyable 3 hours of exploration and growing experince of a casual game.\n","February 18, 2015","true","3.7"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

I was in the mood for something 'different' and boy did this scratch that itch.  From the absolutely gorgeous textureless polygons to the insane controlls, this game was seriously impressive from beginning to end, despite its relatively low key debut.\n\nThe graphics though really seriously wowed me.  I distinctly remember a very brief window in games just before 3dfx cards hit, where games like su-27 flanker tried these really simple, vivid, textureless polygons came and really looked amazing for it.  Sure once 3D accelerated cards hit, textures took over and ruled the day, but I've always thought that the really clean and almost cartoon like pure polygons could be used to great effect, and man does Grow Home prove that in spades.\n\nI almost want to call this game 'indie' given its just really off the wall concepts and beautiful abstract visuals, but I'm not entirely sure anything from a publisher as big as Ubisoft can truly carry that moniker.  None the less, its sheer wonder, exploration, and strangeness remind me of Fez, Braid, Bastion, etc far more than they do of any big studio AAA title.\n\nA game controller is strongly reccomended, this thing is weird and wonderful but its already a handful *with* a good solid gamepad, I shudder to think how it would run without one.\n\nIt took me around 6 hours to beat it (and 90% complete it), and honestly I think the length is just about right given its relatively modest price and really unique experience.

A very cleverly crafted environment, that responds to your actions and choices.     Gameplay  7  I was strangely enthralled by Grow Home's gameplay mechanics. Lots of the game involves climbing, which is done by controlling each of B.U.D's (the robot) arms indivudually. No, this isn't like octodad where you're screaming at him to do the right thing, this is simply a well thought out use of controls to help you feel more connected to the game. You gather crystals as you go, which unlock abilities for B.U.D to use, all of which help that much more. Don't worry, it is fairly easy to spot these crystals. Though getting to some of them can be a difficult task. A short game if you shoot straight for the end-goal (Around 2 hours), but you can easily add a few hours on by exploring the environment.    Story  5  You're a robot, climbing a plant back to your spaceship and harvesting seeds. That's about all that is here for you story wise. However, this game isn't about the end, it's about the journey getting there.    Multiplayer  N/A  No multiplayer here.

Overall  6.3/10  A very pleasant surprise from Ubisoft, Grow Home is certainly a beautiful homage to platformers, and well worth checking out, especially for the low price point. Though you probably won't be coming back to it over and over, the refreshing gameplay and art-style almost beg for this game to be played by everyone at least once.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","February 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 99 of 160 people (62%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","62","99","160","11","3"

What happens when a big developer like Ubisoft Reflections uses its assets to make a game that is quite different from their normal line up? Well, you'd get Grow Home, a delightfully quaint title about a little Robot named B.U.D. (Botanical Utility Droid), who is trying to oxygenate his home world by growing and climbing the Star Seed in order to harvest its seeds.\n\nGrow Home is a brightly colored game with low-polygon minimalistic graphics that never once takes away from the world of this odd little planet. The music is simplistic and otherworldly, giving one the sense that they are indeed on some sort of alien world with the tiny robot. There are only three tracks but they never drone on forever, it just sounds like it's part of the background in a good way. The player can run around his open world, doing whatever they want within B.U.D.'s current capabilities. The player uses the little robot's hands to climb up big things and can gather small things from the world, like flowers that help you fall slower and leaf hand gliders that allow you to soar across the planet for as long as you hold on. While this isn't necessary, if B.U.D. collects crystals that are scattered all across the world, it'll give B.U.D. a jetpack boost. Whenever you collect a certain number, the amount of time you can hover or fly around gets doubled. It's a brief power up, but used in conjunction with the other items it makes the experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nFull Review[www.noobfeed.com]","September 9, 2015","true","8.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

To be precise, you grow a colossal plant from the surface, all the way up to your idle spaceship. Simply hop onto a red-ended "branch" of the plant and let it grow out, and even decide which direction it grows in on-the-fly. Your objective is to connect the plant to certian floating islands, so it may feed from their energy.\n\nAlong the way, you'll encounter glowing blue crystals, 100 of them to be exact. Collecting these crystals will earn you upgrades for your character, making it easier to traverse around the whimiscal environment. Be mindful, however! Sans just spotting them with your eyes, the only clue you get is a distinct shimmering sound when one is near. Making the journey to collect these is fun in itself.\n\nThat's basically it, and that's certainly not a bad thing. Grow Home shines in it's simplicity of gameplay and graphical design, jam-packed full of charm. There are some other things to discover, but I wouldn't want to spoil the fun. With a personal playtime clocked in at 4 hours, I felt the asking price was indeed worth it, and there's still some stuff left for me to find!\n\nTotally worth playing, and family friendly.

Get this game, if you're like me with an inner child that yearns for nostalgic gameplay.

He doesn't say much and yet has so much charm and personality.  The gameplay is absolutely fantastic.   For example, side quests such as collecting crystals along the way will give you power-ups such as a jet-pack.  It gives you a sense of accomplishment that makes you feel you earned it.  There are caves, parachute flowers, adorable animals and a clever save system to go along with it.\n\nThe controls are a bit hard to grasp at first, but it'll come easy as you go on.

The main focus of the game is its excellent climbing mechanic, where you can control each of your character's hands with seperate buttons. This can be used to climb and pull objects, and is very effective in making you feel as if you've overcome a mountain every time you reach a new island.\n\nHowever, even if it showcases some excellent game mechanics, a great graphical style and very unique gameplay, I recommend this game with an EXTREMELY large pinch of salt; it is a very well designed 2-3 hour long tech demo. The journey is over all too quickly, and the different elements of it are never explored to their full potential. Overall, It has left me with a very disappointed feeling. I'm hoping that the developers continue adding to this game through updates or as a sequel, or even an entirely new game, with a larger world and more challenges to overcome. Although, this is Ubisoft we're talking about, so I'm not holding out much hope.\n\nBuy it on offer, and have a blast with what there is to play.","February 4, 2015","true","9.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","18","20","3","0"

I didn't expect this one... what a beautiful game! And look where it's coming from: Reflections... the old British company. When you are over 30, you'll know them since "the good old days"...\nThey made such great titles like the "Shadow of the Beast" series or "Brian the lion" on the Amiga. They gave us "Destruction Derby" on PC and consoles... the "Driver" games... "The Crew"... and now this little gem : "Grow Home"\n\nShort story short: You are a little robot which was sent on a mission to grow a "Jack and the Beanstalk" type Plant on a foreign Planet. Why? Because of the plant seeds which will be used to grow the plant on Earth to re-oxygenate our planet. Once grown up to 2000m, the plant begins to bloom and you can retrieve the seeds and leave the Planet.\n\nNot very much, aye? But it is a great trip until there! You'll climb hills, search for crystals which will give you new abilities, explore hidden caves, you'll do skydiving, free-falling, free-climbing and paragliding. You will be terrorizing sheep... you'll be eaten by a big Venus flytrap and you will grow the giant "Beanstalk" by connecting its "branches" with freefloating Islands, which are filled with some kind of energy to feed the plant and let it grow. And of course: you'll climb it.\n\nReflections achieved something with this game, which other companies don't even try. Instead of giving you the next Shooter-, Racing-, Sports- or other mainstream game which have all one thing in common: violence and/or competition, they will give you something for your soul. This game is only about exploration, wonder, cuteness and tranquility. We have already enough violence and competition in reality.\n\nSo this is really a great game... for the young and the mature, but there are not only good things. The bad thing is the length of the game. You will need 3-5 hours to complete the game, depending on your play-style. But it's cheap and fits the playtime/value. We have seen worse and I won't mention names... *whisper*whisper...COD...whisper*\n\nI really hope that Reflections will give us some good DLC with new Planets... otherwise I have to play this game again and again.\n\nDefinitely worth a buy!","February 6, 2015","true","17.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","19","22","6","0"

So Ignore the fact that it only took me 3.1 hours to beat because it's not about going from point A to point B, it's about the journey and exploration in between (if that makes sense). But with that said i do have one small negative which is the climbing. It was so frustratingly hard my first few attempts at getting B.U.D up a platform, which by the way you use both the left and right triggers literally as an extension of B.U.D's arm, that once you reached an altitude high enough accidentally losing grip will result in you falling to the beginning and/or sometimes dying. I say sometimes because there are flowers and oversize leaves you can pick up along the way to help break the fall, in addition you have teleportation points that you find and unlock to get around quickly if you happen to fall.

As BUD, you'll climb the plant and direct its sprouts toward minerals to support growth. You'll also climb rocks, trees, pretty much any solid surface you can get your little red hands on.\n\nThis is a little bit reductive, but maybe think Pixeljunk Eden + Shadow of the Colossus + GIRP +... Mario Galaxy?\n\nThe climbing function is very well-implemented. If one hand has a solid hold on something, you can lean in a direction and get a hold with your other hand. Repeat as necessary to go whichever direction you want. At various stages of your ascent, you'll find red pods which, when activated, will act as a combination spawn point/teleporter/specimen analyzer.\n\nYou'll probably fall. A lot. Like, really a lot. That's why finding the teleporters is a big help. You can also find & carry flowers to give you limited slow-fall or find leaves to use as a hang glider. Being able to control your descent can make a huge difference in how much ground you'll have to make up later, plus gliding on the leaf is just fun as heck once you get the hang of it.\n\nIn addition to helping the plant grow, you can also seek out the little crystals scattered all over the map. Reaching certain collection miilestones will give you upgrades, which will in turn make it easier to ascend in support of your main goal.\n\nControlling BUD can be somewhat hectic at times. Due to the unique method of animation, you can steer BUD around pretty reliably, but it may sometimes appear as though you're controlling a drunk ragdoll.  Camera control is important, because you won't grab onto a surface if the camera isn't focusing on it. I had some technical issues with the Steam controller, most of which occurred during sessions when I plugged the controller in after the game had already been launched.\n\nIt's not a long game. Diligent players can knock it out in a few short hours. Collectors & achievement hunters will need a bit longer, but none of the objectives or achievements are unfair or grindy (I received several achievements +/- a few minutes of finishing the post-credits objective, even though I didn't think I was close to earning any of them).\n\nIf you've watched the trailer and it caught your interest at all, just go for it.\n\nmeep / 10","May 1","true","12.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

Sometimes I just want a cool game that is short and charming and priced appropriately. Grow Home is that game. We completed the game in around 3 or 4 hours and had a blast playing it the entire time. We can still go back and collect crystals which unlock new abilities. Finding all of these crystals will increase your playtime.\n\nGrow Home succeeds by never trying to be more than it is. I have fond memories of the N64 system and this game feels like a throwback to the good ole days. A polygon heavy stylized game with modern day lighting effects. The main character B.U.D. is a charming little dude and using a physics based movement system keeps controling him entertaining through the entire game. The game consists of growing a Star Plant from the ground all the way up into the sky where your ship is located. The game plays in a vertical layout which is also a nice change of pace. Failing and falling from the Star Plant when you are extremely high in the air feels great. Teleporters to find and flowers and leaves that help you glide eliminate any frustrating experience the game may have had.\n\nI paid $8 for this game which around the cost of renting a movie.

The basic gameplay involves climbing by alternating the mouse buttons (or triggers, if you're using a gamepad) to control your hands, and you grow your plant to reach higher areas by grabbing onto stems of it and riding them into power sources. There are minor goals like collecting crystals throughout the area which give you upgrades like a jetpack, and you can catalogue the various plants and animals of the game by dragging them to teleporter checkpoints, but the main goal of the game is just getting your plant to grow to its top. There's something strangely cathartic about winding your plant upwards, especially when you start getting to the higher regions and can look down and see the twisted mess you've made on your way up and how far you've come. If you ignore the side content the game lasts 2 to 3 hours, but you could probably add on another hour or two at least from the optional bits if you want to. If you're looking for a game with a lot of substance or action to it, you should probably look elsewhere. But if you're just in the mood for a way to spend an evening relaxing and growing an enormous plant, Grow Home is a fine way to do that.","February 3","true","2.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dpfl/recommended/323320/","Dpfl","sharktemplar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dpfl/","76 products in account","So some of you may have notice some Game Grump videos coming out in the Steam Train branch for Grow Home, and after I saw what you could do in the game I wanted to buy it for myself. It most certainly did not disappoint. Everything it allows you to do is satisfying. The 100% crystal upgrade feels very worth the trouble finding every last crystal. The parachuting mechanics are lovely and work exactly like you'd expect. There are a few very subtle annoyances with the controls but that is rather to be expected with a game that prioritizes in procedural animations. For instance, when walking along a vine you've created, jumping or jetpacking off of it at too subtle an angle actually doesn't work, it forces your character B.U.D. to stay directly above the vine to ensure he lands back on it. This is frustrating sometimes if you get a really sturdy feel for how to control your character and want to get off of a vine with a jetpack but do not jump directly off of the side. I've even had this strange wind-force push my character to a specific side of my screen when I was jetpacking well above the vine that would try to ensure my landing on it.\n\nBut other than what are some obviously intentional (albeit not-so-polished) movement systems to help less experienced players not take tremendous falls that impede progress considering you will be walking along skinny vines so often in the game, the game left me wanting more. SO much more.\n\nI can faithfully say that if the game had more content (like, vastly more) I'd pay up to 30 bucks for this sucker if you could do things like go to different planets or grow vines off into the distance and discover fascinating new sets of islands or humongous floating creatures that would be in and of themselves their own experience in the game to traverse/interact with on such a scale.\n\nThe game would sooner break believable animation movement than get the player stuck or have a mechanic not work the way it is trying to be used. The focus on what the player gets to do over anything else such as graphics (thus the low-poly count) and procedural animations is a lovely reminder of why this game is unique. It might seem like an Indie title with those 8 dollars and a rather simple-looking idea for the entirety of the game to be built around, but just how much you get to do with that idea is plenty enough for it to be worth it.\n\nI bought the game and played it start to finish in 4 hours, but keep in mind a new player would take a little bit longer than this as I had a running start after watching Ross and Arin play this initially and bring my attention to it from Steam Train on Game Grumps. However that being said, the game still feels like it needs more and everybody in its community can feel this. It has far too much potential to be left categorized as a 'one-and-done' experience, which unfortunately it is at the moment. Once you finish it, odds are you will never touch it again until they update. This why I am hoping and praying they will realize just how much you could do with a game like this if it got enough attention and care with its development, and they hunker down and continually grow Grow Home into something beautiful.\n\nWhile the likelihood for this is rather slim, at the very least it seems like they are giving enough attention to update it as I hear a new update of some sort if coming within the week (of this review being posted).\n\nI do not however believe they have the capability to pull off too much more than they already have, and may unfortunately be limited to simply adding more of the same thing already available in the game's initial experience (but hopefully not in the form of DLC they want more money for, though keep in mind, this is technically Ubisoft we're talking about) because during a few cutscenes in the game, I noticed my fps drop quite noticably, meaning they are clearly ALREADY rather close to the limits of what they've built on the Unity engine here. This is a crying shame because it will probably discourage new radical ways to play the game from being considered/developed such as a massive underwater segment in the game which could be a whole new experience, or slap a massive sky whale off in the distance to tease the completionists into reaching and taming or something. Big amazing things like this that might even come with whole new mechanics to unlock would definitely sky-rocket the game's value if it could indeed be pulled off, which again, I sadly doubt.\n\nOverall, you'll get more immersed and hooked than you'd think, I guarantee it. Anybody who loves the "go here, go there, go anywhere" feel that so few video games can pull off without feeling like a chore in the long run will absolutely LOVE this game. Give it a try, but brace for the subtle disappointment when you hit the phase of "what next? I want more!" and realize there isn't anymore and probably won't be beyond the types of things you've already done and mastered in Grow Home.","February 16, 2015","true","11.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/franazzledazzle/recommended/323320/","franazzledazzle","Thanatos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/franazzledazzle/","138 products in account","Definitely a diamond in the rough from a Ubisoft studio. This game deserves a 10/10 just for not being a buggy, bloated mess like virtually everything else Ubisoft has vomited out over the past years (IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED UPLAY!!!). There isn't much to say about it that won't take away from the experience. The main point is exploration, so if the idea of wandering around a large area looking for treasures bores or bothers you, avoid this game at all costs. Otherwise, it's a fantastic game with a nice atmosphere and a great sense of humor. Overall, it feels like a lot of care went into it, despite some flaws.\n\nFor one, there's no ambient music, which can be a good thing or a bad thing. There's plenty of sound though, so it's not like you'll just play for hours in total silence. The main character, B.U.D, has a large range of vocal tics and acknowledgements and the environmental SFX is very nice, so there's never really a moment in the game where the lack of music is a detractor. Everything sounds pretty much how you'd expect it to sound, and there are a large number of audible cues to point you in the right direction as far as looking for the treasures goes, like finding crystals and star seeds.\n\nThe graphics are a hit or miss. It has a stylized artstyle but everything is very polygonal, to the point that "PSX-era" is an apt comparison. I don't think it works against the game, however, mostly because there's a lot of climbing involved and complex, bump-mapped textures would likely impede progress. The lighting is fairly good, although I think they could have put some more work into differentiating the colors. Sometimes surfaces reflect the sunlight as the exact same color as the crystals, which can create some minor frustration when you're hunting them down. Another issue is with the crystals themselves, in that they're a neutral shade of pale blue rather than something more stand-out or eyecatching like red or purple. It's not a huge issue, but it's something I would have done differently were I the director.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's very basic and focused, and I love it. They picked a few things and did them very well, rather than trying to give the player a billion different tools and giving them limited utility. There are pretty much three things the player can do: grab, jump, and use one of two items. Later on the player unlocks a jetpack which adds more mobility to the character, which is a nice way of expanding the gameplay, although it never becomes the least bit complex. The most frustrating aspect is the camera, which has a tendency to get hung up when the player is standing against walls or making sharp turns in the air.\n\nThe only major issue with it is the length, which really can't be criticized for an $8 game. Another problem is that the rewards for finding all of the collectables, I.E. the alternate skins, aren't particularly satisfying, because you'll only have them when you've fully explored the world and have nothing else to do with them. Other than that, I honestly hope they add more content or some kind of workshop, because this game has mountains of potential. It's a novel and relaxing game to sit down and play a few hours if you need a break from everything else. 8/10 mang.","February 21, 2015","true","6.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The checkpoints are vital, for otherwise you would have to climb a long way up when you fall. The computer that talks to you; M.U.M is amusing.

The gameplay is just as unique, interesting and alien as the world and its inhabitants, and it's a very refreshing, charming game that makes me feel at ease while having simple plain old fashioned fun.\n\nHighlights\nThe best and worst parts of Grow Home come from the same design choice of simplicity. It's clear that this game was never intended to be a triple A title, and was pushed by the Publisher to be a short spin-off experimental title that wasn't given much of a budget. Despite that, the Reflections team came back with an incredibly polished and charming gem of a game that exceeded all expectations.\n\n* The limb movement on BUD,coupled with the excellent controls have been done really well and makes it look like true movement and feel very responsive to interaction while still feeling charming and childlike.\n* Intelligent use of power crystals unlocking new abilities give weight to exploration. The Data Bank and its achievement also help to bolster the exploration.\n* It's worth mentioning that this game doesn't require the Uplay DRM to play.\n\nMistakes\nThe simple focused nature of the games' design benefits from not having forced replay elements added and it will honestly feel like money well spent if you enjoy the experience and gameplay, but Grow Home is still short and will probably leave you wanting more. An obvious solution would've been a mutliplayer component, and procedural level creation could've added a huge amount of replay value to this game. Other than this, though, there are no real issues that take away from the game as a whole, and other than a mildly annoying glitch effect on the title screen, very few UI or technical issues to speak of too.\n\nRecommendations\nAvailable on Steam for just £5.99/7.99€/$7.99, Grow Home has a very fair price tag. When played purely for story and end-goal it'll clock in at around 3 hours play time, and while replay value is limited, completionists and explorers can expect more than 10 hours and achievement hunters (there are some pretty good achievements and one pretty annoying and very difficult one) can expect even more. This is one of the few games on Steam I'm happy to recommend at full price.\n\n* BUD has two skins to unlock; the Ninja Skin Unlocked after finishing the game by collecting all the Star Seeds and the Native Skin Unlocked by filing everything in the Data Bank. Skins can be changed from the Settings menu on the title screen.\n* There's a fantastic review of the mechanics given by a senior designer on Grow Home available here[www.gamasutra.com]\n* While stated on the loadin that a Controller is preferred, playing with a Keyboard felt equally good and natural for me","July 3, 2015","true","6.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You get to explore and look for caves and plants and animals  as you progress through the game, you gain new abilities which assist you in this task.  instead of just walking everywhere, you have to use the triggers on your controller to grab hold of the walls/vines/rocks and pull yourself up.\nThings I didn't like:\nYou move like a drunken robot ninja monkey\nI guess this is worth playing, but after stumbling around and almost falling off a ledge 400 times, it starts to get frustrating.  I suppose if I keep at it, I'll be able to adapt, but in long stretches it's just not that cool.\n\nOverall I'd say buy this game if it's on sale.  I have heard it's very short, which may be a blessing in disguise since I'm finding the movement/control aspect to be the worst.\n\nOh yeah I forgot to mention the best thing about it: It's an Ubisoft game but you don't have to launch that stupid Uplay client just to play it.","June 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

A little short, maybe.. but for the price, it's worth the amount of fun I've had playing it.  There are quite a lot of little islands to check out, with the incentive of finding all the crystals scattered around the world so you can unlock all the upgrades for your character.  The graphics style make the game pretty to look at, in an adorable, cartoonish way.  It's very atmospheric, and even a little creepy at times.\n\nThere is a clear goal, but plenty of room to branch out (literally) and explore along the way.  I haven't finished the game yet, at the time I'm writing this review.. I've been taking my time to explore and experiment.

The short version is that I think this game is pretty great.\n\nIf you're comfortable with the game system being a bit loose, than you should have no trouble with the controls of this game. If other titles like Goat Simulator are in your wheelhouse than you'll feel right at home here. It isn't that the controls are bad, they are just designed to be loose in order to allow the player to interact with the environment in ways the developer didn't necessarily expect.\n\nI don't know how long it is, but my impression is that you could probably get through the core of the game pretty quickly. It's clearly designed for you to enjoy just messing around in the world and exploring all of the little areas the developers have tucked into it. Much in the same manner as something like Proteus, but in this case there is more active interaction required.\n\nIt made me smile from the moment it started up and I got a look at the menu's and the fun (but slight) soundtrack they put into it. I would *never* have expected something like this from the people that made Driver... but it's enjoyable, and fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KamexRyu/recommended/323320/","KamexRyu","KamexRyu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KamexRyu/","30 products in account","Grow Home presents a bright colourful experience in an interesting and vibrant world. However, I feel the charm of the aesthetic wears off quickly and the core gameplay is not worth your time.\n\nThe game recommends a gamepad but from my experience keyboard and mouse work just fine. B.U.D (the character you control) is made purposefully to control poorly such as tumbling in the direction it travels in making it difficult to change direction. This makes sense but also makes it annoying to control. B.U.D will automatically walk up and down small slopes, regardless if that results in falling down. On the other hand, the grip mechanic is quite nice, using a button to use each hand. This is required for climbing which is the main mechanic of the game. It is required for making virtually anything in the game happen. Whether it be, activating checkpoints, identifying wildlife or collecting one of the 100 crystals (which are effectively the measure of game completion). The grabbing mechanic works well but it feels unnecessary in some of the places where it is used. In most games being near the parachute flowers would be enough to collect them but in Grow Home, you have to grab and pluck them off the ground in order to acquire them. For some, this level of interactivity is welcomed and enjoyable but i found it became tedious very quickly.\n\nBefore acquiring the jetpack, climbing is the main way to traverse terrain vertically. It is difficult to criticise the climbing mechanic as, even though it can take time, it is dependent on the surface being climbed and how you go about it. Climbing presents a unique problem for each player to find their own way of doing. You could try to find the way up the surface that presents the least resistance to your motion or you could take the quickest route. You could try alternating hands quickly or alternate at a slower rate. As another solution, you could find a pattern of presses that works best for the surface at hand. Finding a nice way to climb up a certain rock face or vine feels fun at first, but as most of the game becomes slowly climbing up vines to create more sprouts, it becomes less enjoyable.\n\nThe game unlocks power ups as you progress through. This starts with jumping and another camera mode and then all the subsequent power ups revolve around the jet pack. The jet pack is an alternative to climbing but it can prove ineffective in climbing up vines for example, which is what I found myself doing most of the time. When B.U.D has no forward momentum, the jet pack has little effect in gaining height. On the whole, using the jet pack is fun but only has the opportunity to meet its potential when traversing land, which is in my experience, not what most of the gameplay is.\n\nThe exploration element of the game is easily its strongest suit. To find all the crystals, you have to explore all parts of the various islands you'll find. It's fun to discover various hidden caves where it appeared nothing was present and then search for the crystals found inside. It feels like exploration is meant to be the meat of the game but unfortunately, this doesn't appear to be the case.\n\nEasily the biggest problem with the game in my opinion is the star shoot. It is a giant beanstalk which grows by connecting its various offshoots to power rocks which are glowing islands in the sky. Until you reach the first large floating island this is fine. However, after that point, you have to grow the offshoots yourself. You can control the growth of the offshoots using WASD or the control stick and each offshoot is meant to have its own sprouts that can grow further which is required in order to meet the next level of power rocks. While you will have many sprouts available low to the ground, the higher you go, fewer sprouts spawn, often leaving you at a dead end to start from elsewhere. This wastes a huge amount of time for something which is incredibly boring. It is essentially filler content to increase the expected time for completion. Falling off a far out branch leads to even more time being wasted and it all feels like a grind. I can't express how frustrating this mechanic is as the rest of the game is mostly enjoyable and this acts a way of stopping progress for a long time. Growing the shoots can get to be quite a mess when you have too many. There isn't a way to remove existing shoots and according to what I have read (but not experienced myself), it is possible to block off teleporters with the vines which would make it even more frustrating in navigating the world. This problem is augmented by the fact that there appears to be only one save file so this damage would be irreversible, the only alternative being starting a new game or just dealing with it.\n\nOverall, Grow Home is a good looking game with some fun mechanics but has one system which completely ruins the game for me. The exploration is fun but plays second fiddle to expanding the star shoot which slows the whole game down and, combined with the awkward way the character controls in, makes Grow Home a frustrating experience.\n","February 18","false","3.4"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","16","27","0","0"

Mission control (M.O.M.) has provided you with portals along the way, giving you the possibility to send home samples. Your mission starts on a small, beautiful, sunshine island, entirely surrounded by an ocean. Far above in the sky you can make out more islands, but strangely floating in the air. Beside your task to investigate flora and fauna you have to grow a plant into the sky to reach all distant floating isles until eventually you will reach space and find your way back to your space ship. A bigger plant on the first island has a number of sprouts. You can grow them into the air for some distance. Every new branch you grow provides more sprouts that you can grow again.\n\nWhat sounds like a rather strange layout for a game is actually very enjoyable and a great experience. There are few games I have played that were as much fun as 'Grow Home'. It's addictive and funny and I very much recommend playing this game. This game is a hidden gem.\n\nPros:\n- fun, cute, lovely\n- base jumping\n- parachuting with daisies\n- gliding with leaves\n- climbing\n- rpg elements, improve B.U.D. (your robot) by searching for batteries\n- good music\n\nCons:\n- graphics are a little simple but suit the game well\n\nPS: 'Grow Home' is designed to be played with a controller. I am not sure if this game is as much fun with keyboard and mouse so I limit my recommendation to playing it with a controller.","January 11","true","14.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","3"

It's a colorful title where the main objective has you growing a plant all the way up into space where your ship rests. Along the way you can collect crystals to upgrade your character, tackle a small side mission, and upon beating the game, look forward to some post-game content. Some of the achievements are also interesting and function like a mini-challenge for the player. In its current state, you can expect around 6-7 hours of play time if you collect everything. Also, no Uplay.\n\nThe game's charm comes from its characters, colors, and wildlife. B.U.D., the robot, is a bit of klutz and will inevitably run into walls or smash into things as you make the ascent. His ragdoll animations can produce some funny results and react to everything you do with him be it grabbing, falling, jumping, or turning around (his head turns before the rest of his body does). Should you really screw up and trap B.U.D. somewhere, then robot suicide will provide a way out. You can visit any of your grave sites so long as you still playing the same session. You can also mess around with any of the big-eyed wildlife you find which was made more plentiful with the recent patch. The jetpack you unlock can be used to drop sheep (meeps in-game?) off wherever you want, such as a cave or from the top of the map. The art style is simple and functional which helps to save frames since you can grow as many stalks as you want. The lighting is what gives the game more depth due to the day and night cycle.\n\nB.U.D. moves with momentum and purpose. He takes a couple of steps to come to a complete stop and may even need to roll a bit if you're moving very fast. This becomes an important consideration when climbing and performing risky maneuvers. Jumping from a stalk to a bouncy leaf could result in a very long fall to the ground should you not grab onto something. It takes some time to adjust, but once you realize you are controlling a lovable goof, navigating the world becomes easier. Teleporters mitigate the shame of falling down as you unlock them at various heights. The climbing, one of the main mechanics, is extremely functional and pretty much does what you want it to do. Left bumper works the left hand and right bumper works the right hand. The only difficulty comes with climbing under things so be sure to move the camera around unless you like looking through terrain.\n\nGrowing buds allows players to creatively reach new heights and gives a sense of accomplishment. It's the main draw of the game besides the sky diving aspect and both are fun every time. You can direct them however you want, but progress requires going up. Also, the fact that at any time you can look at how you explored the world and progressed is something special and makes me think, “Look at this wonderful mess I made.” You can choose whether you want to grow the Star Shoots in as efficient a way as possible, making straight lines towards all the islands, or create a wild monstrosity, filling the world with this massive plant. Be wary of growing an excessive amount of star shoots if you have a weaker computer because you will gradually lose frames the more you grow.\n\nHopefully, if you like the look of the game and find the gameplay intriguing, you'll give it a chance. It's a compact experience that should not disappoint.","March 7, 2015","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/recommended/323320/","lesalanos","Trip Hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/","382 products in account","An admission: I can't find the last three star bits power crystals and I'm thinking of using a guide to get them. And yes this game does remind me of Super Mario Galaxy in several ways, hence my genuine error just there.\n\nI won't beat about the bush. I love Grow Home. It has made me squeal girlishly with delight more times than perhaps any game I've ever played, and I'm a twenty eight year old heterosexual man with a flourishing beard, and not naturally given to any emotional displays at all. I just couldn't help it with this game.\n\nProduced by a small team under the name Ubisoft Reflections, Grow Home surprised us all a few days ago by appearing from nowhere, with very little fanfare, costing not much at all to buy, and being incredibly adorable. Credit where it's due to Ubisoft for helping a game like this germinate (sorry). Not every game has to be a forty hour tedium-athon, which they have recognised, so well done.\n\nThe premise is very, very simple. You control BUD, a "gardening robot" who has been sent on a mission by MOM (yes, really) to cultivate a particular plant called a Star Plant, and eventually get the seeds when it blooms. What this means for you as a player is lots of climbing and jumping, as you scale the ever-growing plant and help it to keep on growing up and up. It always blooms at the 2000m mark. Graphically, things are presented with the broadstrokes. A strip of grass is represented by a flat strip of green on the ground, and animals are comprised of chunky geometric shapes, which seem bound to each other as if by magnets.\n\nBUD himself is a funny little chap. With his glowing, saucer eyes and his floppy, spindly limbs, he's immediately memorable, like something from a pixar film, and is enormously expressive without ever saying a word. Some people have compared controlling him to being akin to Surgeon Simulator, or I Am Bread, which is to say deliberately difficult in order to frustrate and amuse the player. Now, this isn't fair. At first, it seems like BUD has a mind of his own, reeling like a drunken bending unit, and he'll frequently get caught on the scenery or stagger headfirst off the end of a cliff. He does have weight and momentum when moving, and the procedural animation controlling his movements makes him seem a bit clumsy. You'll quickly adapt, though, and within an hour or two, you'll find yourself more than capable of moving, jumping and climbing.\n\nSpeaking of climbing, you'll be doing a lot of it. As I pointed out, the ultimate objective of the game lies in growing the plant ever upwards, so you'd better be able to scale it. On a gamepad this can be achieved by alternating the left and right triggers, or the bumpers if you prefer. The left one controls BUD's left hand, logically enough, and the right one affects the other. If you engage it, BUD squeezes his little pincers and grabs on the nearest surface, handily indicated by a coloured ring at the point of contact. He won't let go until you do, or until something forcibly seperates hand from object, which is not a common occurence. With this system, you can climb a sheer cliff face, or hang desperately from a rotating asteroid, or drag a frightened sheep into a deep lake from which it will never escape. As with so many things in this game, it's joyously simple and tactile to use: an idea which is easy to grasp (again, sorry) and provides lovely feedback to the player.\n\nWhen you're not actively growing the plant, you'll be exploring the floating islands around and between which it grows. These are absolutely covered in secrets - from caves containing unique plants and creatures, to springy mushroom groves and cacti which fall apart if you bump them hard enough. Simply moving around them and seeing the sights is reward enough in itself, but there's another incentive in the form of power crystals, 100 to collect, which unlock extra abilities for you when certain milestones are reached. I won't spoil them, but they're all great fun, so snatch them up when you hear the telltale shimmering sound which means one is nearby.\n\nI don't want to spoil any more, so I'll just finish by urging you to play this game. Sit down with a kid - preferably a family member - and gawp in wide eyed wonderment at this delightful creation. If you don't gurgle with joy, you're dead inside.","February 16, 2015","true","12.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

As weird as it sounds, there's something about this game that made me actually want to spend the extra time to unlock all the achievements (maybe the fact that there are only 26 of them), and never want to stop playing no matter how frustrating a certain part suddenly became. Something that I have NEVER experienced while playing any other game. For being a game that doesn't have a lot to it, there sure seemed like there was a lot to it. Not to mention the innate charm of B.U.D., a character I guarantee you'll never forget. The world feels expansive when you look up from the very bottom and can't even see the top, and finally reaching the asteroid belt is such an awesome feeling. To jump between moving asteroids, risking falling all the way back to the ground to get that next crystal, Hell, even taking the time to find all the crystals was an unexpectedly fun adventure (albeit frustrating at times). The game was less about actually growing the Star Plant to me and more about just exploring and seeing what kind of fun ♥♥♥♥ I can do. Even though the game is very casual, as dying doesn't affect your game in any way, it is still challenging and a complete blast to play (I recommend playing in the dark, over-the-ear headphones, and sitting approx. 2 inches away from the screen for FULL IMMERSION), and I would easily recommend this game to anyone who has ever felt the desire to explore a strange, new world, or just climb to the top of something and jump off. Highly recommended to ANYONE that has a spare $8, you will NOT regret it.","May 16, 2015","true","9.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The trailer represents this game pretty well.\n\nImagine learning to walk, this joyous amazing new thing, only to find that you'll never actually be better at it and forever re7arded. You can eventually teleport and do other unlockable skills, but the base running/climbing is made in such a way that you have to manually get better at it. This is a good thing because it means you improve at your own pace.\n\nMy only critisisms are:\n-I kind of wish it wasnt such a lonely world. It's weird to say that because that IS the lore and entire feel of the game.\n-It makes me want more than I'm afraid it will be able to offer, content wise. I dont KNOW for sure, I just have a feeling at this time.\n-The physics can be difficult or unpredictable. For example, bunny hopping accelerates you really quickly, but some floating rocks are super difficult to stand on because they slowly drop.\n\nThe game suggests using a controller, but I've had absolutely no issue with mouse and keyboard.\n\nExtra points for the music, ambience, and unique and consistent artstyle.","February 25, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The world is colourful and a joy to look at, especially when you reach high altitudes and can look down on how far you have come.\n\nBUD's movement mechanics are "fumbling" at best, and can be frustrating at worst. Luckily, it does not take too long to get a feeling for the momentum and movement physics. Climbing is straightforward and works well, and is much more predictable than the walking and jumping physics. The jetpack and glide leaf really open up the environment, allowing you to travel between vines with ease.\n\nThe slight frustration caused by the movement mechanics are easily outweighted by the simple fun provided by the rest of the game.","October 19, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After being hypnotized by the teaser trailer the day before, I bought this game without seeing many reviews and zero gameplay, something I never do. For the hour and the half I played, I did not even look at the time nor did I care. This is one of the most innovative and unique games I have ever played.\n\nIn any game that allows you to jump, a lot of people, if not all, have the inert urge to climb things. It is apart of our exploration psychology. This game delivers with a real feel of height, close calls, and epic skydiving.  This is one of those beautiful simplistic games that doesnt tell you much, but just lets you do your own thing. So without any further explanation, I highly recommend you starve yourself of one meal and buy this game.","February 4, 2015","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

One is that while movement in this game almost always appears clumsy (in an incredibly adorable way), it very rarely feels clumsy. Your character (B.U.D.) will trip and fall and step on his own head as you walk and climb, but you're always moving in your intended direction. Climbing is also effortless, as attempting to hold onto a spot out of reach will pull your character toward it.\n\nYou also have a pretty clear objective in the game, and there's a good sense of forward (upward?) momentum. You climb higher, unlock new abilities, find new and more interesting plants and animals. At the same time, there's a ton to play with that has nothing to do with your objective. Throw sheep off cliffs, throw plants off cliffs, throw plants off cliffs at sheep, throw yourself from space to the bottom of the world onto a sheep. There's also a bird, and I love him.\n\nBut yeah, the game is simply joyous. I say, play it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT0LezTR7SiNwyHJ1d01t9TPrCb4WmPdc","February 6, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The Cell Shaded graphics look absolutely fantastic, and remind me of Wind Waker dearly. The controls are pretty simple, but I would reccomend playing with a controller (I found it a bit fiddly with a mouse and keyboard). The proceedingly generated movement animation works a lot of the time, but can glitch a bit when you are climbing at a strange angle. The game is fairly easy once you get the hang of it, but it is best played (IMO) when you are tired, and can't be bothered for some twitchy Counterstrike. Stick on some calm background music (or listen to the game's soundtrack, which is very soothing) and this game is very calming.\n\nThere is a fair bit of content for the money. You could probably complete the main quest in an hour if you tried as fast as possible, but you would be missing so much more. By collecting gems, you can unlock new abilities (One complaint I have with this is that the first ability unlocked is a better in game camera, WTF? That should be there from the start). There are also tasks after you have finished the main mission as well. I would like to see some community made maps and hopefully some more content from the devs, but I am struggling for complaints about the game now.\n\nGo Buy It!

It's so lighthearted, cheery, and FUN that I can't believe this was published by Ubisoft. I highly recommend this for anyone looking to take a break from gritty, realistic, violent, and dark games, or really just anyone in general. It has some flaws, to be sure, but I'd love to see a sequel that improves upon the few failings that it has.\n\nPositives:\n-Fantastic and unique platforming\n-Growing a massive tree lets you build the level as you play it\n-The art style is simplistic, expressive, and pleasant to look at\n-The lighting is fantastic\n-M.O.M\n-The most fun I've had climbing in a game\n-It's so much fun to play in general\n-It can be completed in under 3 hours\n\nNegatives\n-Leveling system feels tacked on. It's not terrible but it should either be improved or removed\n-No map/icons means that it's extremely difficult to find all 100 collectible crystals and the 8 collectible seeds.\n-Atmosphere decreases(tougher gliding) but gravity doesn't as you go higher up (makes platforming feel sluggish). This is only really a problem towards the very end of the first part of the game, but it's still a problem.\n-Glide Flower is superseded completely by Glide Leaf. System should be improved or removed\n-Climbing is occasionally wonky\n-Short length may be a turn off to some people\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game. I hope that there is a sequel, but I'd even be happy with just this.

Basically the main gameplay surrounds the character B.U.D climbing his way around a giant plant and connecting this plant to floating sky islands to make the plant grow bigger (weird I know) anyway, this whole adventure is also accompanied by some neat little upgrades you can snag with the crystals laying around which will help you on your way and will distract you from the main goal if it gets a bit tedious. Making such a serene game with such simple rules and yet executing it so well is something that this game accomplishes in droves, have fun playing and watching little B.U.D get himself into all sorts of weird positions with the animation style they have gone for, which is basically just let physics take over and it is quite funny at times to see him bend over backwards after hitting a floating island too hard.

Left and right triggers control B.U.D's ability to latch onto the the world around him, and once you get used to the mechanic you'll be scaling the environment like a pro.\n\nWhen I laid down my money on this I thought it would be a couple of hours distraction, but I was shocked to realise that nearly 6 hours of my time felt like almost nothing. My only wish is that there was more, but that's not really a criticism.","June 18, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art style it awesome and the game idea is as creative as ever. The gameplay has somewhat octo-dad controlls that are hard to get used to, But once you got the controlls down, you play as a skilled ninja thats flies around the map.\n\nThe game is really short tho, took me 7 hrs to get 25/26 acheivements, missing the "climb 10,000m". The story alone is about 1-2 hrs long, what would really make the game better is another map, maybe 3-5 maps would really top the game off, with different things on each map. Shame its only 1 map , it really brings the game down.\n\nI'll rate it a 7/10","June 26, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalegreen/recommended/323320/","dalegreen","Greeny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalegreen/","224 products in account","*Skip to the bottom of the review for Tl:dr*\n\nGrow home is a charming platformer from Reflections, a Ubisoft Studio. Released on Steam in February, it was received to high praise almost unanimously. I gave it a download this weekend, and now feel compelled to talk about the charming platformer.\n\nGrow Home reminded me of Wall-E. You play as a lonely droid, BUD (Botanical Utility Droid), and MOM (missed what that stands for) drops you down onto a new planet. Your task is now to explore the planet’s biosphere and climb your way back to the mother ship by growing the star plant.\n\nThe world centres around a large plant which has off-shoots with red flowers. By climbing up onto these you can make them grow, extending the size and reach of the main plant. Spread around the world are floating land masses, some of which have glowing green bottoms. These provide power, and it’s your task to grow the off-shoots into these to receive their power. Doing this X times will cause the main plant to grow another stage, moving you ever-closer to the mothership.\n\nIt’s a simple premise, which could feel repetitive if not done correctly, but the charm of the world and novel controls negate that. The character controls somewhat like a ragdoll; it’s very reminiscent I Am Bread. You control each arm of the character with a different trigger, and direct him with the analogue stick. It feels great when you get into a nice rhythm, working your way up towards the mothership, but it does have a minor camera issue. For the most part the camera works great, but I did find myself sometimes babysitting it as the structure around me grew more complex. The game recommends using the gamepad, and I listened, so all my comments should be disregarded for keyboard controls as I’m sure it feels very different.\n\nAt various heights throughout the level there are teleporters to be found. These allow you fast-travel between land masses at different heights. There’s also no punishment for dying. BUD dies from substantial fall damage, however if you do so you’re simply returned to the last teleporter you used. These two things mean there’s no punishment for exploring and taking risks. If you want to attempt a crazy jump between branches you can. If you don’t make it you can try again. I love this about the game. It encourages exploration and doing crazy things, ready for when you make mistakes.\n\nThe main objective of the game is to grow the main plant and reach the mothership, but there’s lots to do in the world around you besides that. Throughout the world there are a number animals and plants to be found, some that require a lot of exploration to find! A running task is to find them all and bring them to a teleporter so MOM can scan them. Doing so will net you a new skin for BUD; there are other skins that can be unlocked by completing other tasks.\n\nThere are also 100 crystals spread through the level. Some of these are really hard to find, and I found ~85 before resorting to a guide! Collecting these will unlock updates to BUD, giving you greater control over his movement. For example, when you reach around 60 crystals, you unlock a jetpack that gives you significantly more movement control.\n\nOne of the main things I love about Grow Home is the environment itself. Low poly isn’t for everyone, but, when done right, minimalistic environment just look amazing. If ever I’d want to show somewhat what low poly should look like I’d point them towards Grow Home. It has so much charm and whimsy with the bright simple colours and shapes. Pair that with the underlying ambient soundtrack and it’s just an awesome environment.\n\nI do feel though that the relationship the player has with BUD could be greater. He is a cute little robot, but it doesn’t really go deeper than that. Like I mentioned earlier, it reminds me strongly of Wall-E, but you feel a lot more for Wall-E; you are always really routing for him. I didn’t feel that with BUD. He was merely a tool, a cute one, but nonetheless a tool in which I moved around the environment. I felt really warm and in-touch with the environment, but no so much BUD.\n\nTl:dr – Grow Home is a charming platformer, with quirky controls and lovable protagonist. While short, and not without its minor issues such as camera control, its price and charisma overshadow these minor shortcomings to provide a wonderfully whimsical experience.\n\nRating - 9/10\n\nVisit http://www.indiegamers.co.uk for more indie game news and reviews.","May 25, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dbyrdman93/recommended/323320/","Dbyrdman93","Razor Prime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dbyrdman93/","223 products in account","I bought this game pretty much on visuals alone. I know it's not normally the best way to judge whether or not to purchase a game, but sometimes I just want something pretty to look at for an hour or so and Grow Home definitely did not dissapoint. The game was so charming I'd find myself no longer trying to grab collectibles or grow the plant and finish the game but rather gliding around taking in the sites and views. If Grow Home were ever to be made into a multi-staged game of short levels but with more content I'd buy it in a heartbeat.\n\nThe game only has about 7 hours of gameplay, and that's if you want to get all the achievements. Many people could probably finish it faster than that, but like I said I got sidetracked. I typically wait until games cost about $1 per hour of gameplay, more or less depending upon the game's reviws. I bought this game real cheap during the summer sale, but I'd pay the full price to experience it for the first time all over again.\n\nThe controls are intentionally clunky and sometimes downright frustrating, but I'm pretty sure that's the point. The crystals aren't easy to track, but not impossible to find. I got to 99/100 before breaking down and checking out a guide, only to realize I simply didn't sweep the last area well enough. Otherwise, it was fairly easy to grab everything without missing any.\n\nAll in all, I'd give the game an 8.5/10.","June 21, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I spend too much time on the internet with y'all circljerking ourselves into misery.  I've definitely forgotten some of the raw joy & wonder games used to bring me. "OH woe is me" to be a 20something white guy. #firstworld♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Regardless of how low the priority of my gaming prejudices are in the grand scheme of things this game is worth your time.\n\nGrow Home was such a lovely, peaceful, and FUN experience.  It sucked me right back to playing Super Mario 64 for the first time & getting the flying cap.  Grow Home looks way better with a similar aesthetic.  It has a very "Nintendo lite" visual style that is beautiful, simple, and lovely. The game play is a take on Mount Your Friends and Ocoto Dad though they are much more simple, easy, and effective to use.  Rarely did I feel let down and the few times I did, I was probably just "flying" too fast to grab onto anything (shouldn't a robot traveling at terminal velocity be able to grab something & come to a safe & complete stop?).  Anyways, My 2+ hours in the game so far have been fantastic. Once I "beat" the game I unlocked other objectives to do in the world but alas there is only one Star Plant and so to have the MOST fun again I'd have to start over.  That being said, I'm looking forward to collecting all 8 Star Seeds.   I think what is most impressive about Grow Home is the sense of scale.  When you finally reach your ship, there is extreme pleasure from diving off and falling to the ground below, through this colossal plant that YOU grew in all those crazy directions.  "oh hey, I totally remember falling off that" *as you sail by at terminal velocity*.  By this ♥♥♥♥ing game, it'll sooth your fevered brow.\n\nYes it's lean on game-play modes, levels, characters, enemies, weapons, etc. But that isn't the point.  This isn't about depth of features but depth of that intangible, that "X-Factor" if you will.  This is definitely one of those experiential games, though it's game-play elevates it far about most of it's ilk (i'm looking at you Myst).  The experience was fantastic and the game-play was too.  Both aspects won't soon be forgotten by this gamer. I remember what games felt like when I was 8, it's been a long time since a game made me feel anything that deep & close to home.","June 12, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think im happy with the overall experience, it was definitely worth of picking up from discount sale. Though i dont feel urge to play it again any time soon. It is one of those one time experiences.\n\nRelatively easy to do all the achievements, though couple of em arent too fun. Like "Flower Power" where you need to keep consuming fall flowers. No way you are gonna use 50 flowers during normal gameplay, you will get permanent flight long before reaching that number, so you will end up staying at one spot consuming flowers one after another just to satisfy the achievement goal, and that is slow. And very boring. And the fact that achievements dont have counters to let you know how long of torture you have left makes it feel bit worse yet.\n\nOther such achievement is "Climby, Climby Robot", where you need to keep climbing the world from bottom to top long after you have done everything worth doing in this game. You will end up doing this just for sake of 100% the game. I know that was my motivation.","September 12, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Grow Home is serene, peaceful, and engaging. Discovering new areas and exploring the environment are quite a joy. The main character controls in wonky way that somehow adds more charm to the game rather than frustrates it. The game is a real take-it-at-your-own-pace affair, no need to rush to the next objective, but you can press on ahead quickly enough if you so desire to do so.\n\nSomewhat bizarrely, this game is made by Ubisoft. Which is weird, because it is nothing like any other Ubisoft game I have ever dealt with. It has no microtransactions, no Uplay, no massive open world full of repetitive side-missions, and no thosands of developers creating a two-hour-long credits sequence. In addition, not only is the PC version not a buggy piece of crap, there wasn't even a console release of the game until half a year later. This game feels like an indie game in all the right ways, even if it did come from Ubisoft.\n\nThe only shame is that the game is so short.

Peaceful ambience during gameplay which sadly isn't included in the OST. Sound effects work very well with the game's aesthetic.\n\nGameplay: Once the plot was established and I was comfortable with the controls (which did not take long at all), I felt totally immersed, all the way till the end.  Exploring feels great and I really felt like I earned the upgrades (which are super useful). You have the freedom to progress at your own pace and failure is not punished. Excellent map design with lots of nooks and crannies to explore. If the map was a procedurally generated planet I'd probably never stop playing it. Wonky and adorable physics. Camera works well but I wasn't totally happy with it. Controller recommended.\n\nPerformance: You could run it on integrated graphics with low FPS, but I wouldn't recommend it. GPU requirements aren't much. It would probably run better if it was written an updated version of Unity but it's fine. The game doesn't support it, but you can run it in borderless window mode with third party tools like Borderless Gaming. In-game options are adequate for a PC game.\n\nMiscellaneous: M.O.M. from Grow Home and Toriel from Undertale are possibly the best game moms ever.\n\nConclusion: One of the few games that just made me feel good and provided an unforgettable experience in spite of its short gameplay.\n\nI cannot wait to play this again in a year or 2 and be lost in its whimsy all over again.","January 25","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The flat-shading and bright colors help make the game stand out graphically as the intrepid Bud just keeps climbing and climbing.  Jump, climb, float and fly, until finally you Grow Home.\n\nGrow Home is a little Shadow of the Colossus, a little Tail of the Sun, and a whole lotta heart.  Bright colors and lovely vistas keep your rapt attention as you climb higher and higher, collecting gadgets to help you raise this little sapling into a plant that stretches out into the stratosphere.\n\nWhile the game is relatively short (ironic given the insane heights you eventually climb to), this helps the game in the long run; rather than let the game run its course and go stale as it drags on and on, the game ends pretty swiftly.  It can be tough to buy into a game that generally lasts about three hours without collectables, but so long as you’re aware of what you pay for, I think it’s easy to find a lot of enjoyment in this fun adventure.","January 5","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He can climb, jump and move really clumsy... You start on an island and you have to gather crystals to gain your abilities back and you have to grow a plant to reach MOM's spaceship.\n\nThe game is very fun and the robot is hilarious with the way he moves, albeit being a bit frustating to control as a result of this. It's all for the best though, this game is great as is and I enjoyed it alot. The platforming is not too easy, you need to really learn how to control BUD and you need to be careful while climbing.\n\nIt should take you a good 5 to 7 hours to finish the game, which is quite resonable. I recommend you to try it out as I don't want to spoil anything about the game, even though there's not much story involved. If you like platforming and cute little robots though, this game is definitely for you!","May 27","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a shorter game if you just do the Starplant Goals, but if you collect everything, and examine everything/get the bios, this game is hours of fun.

Your goal is a direct one: grow a flower up into space by climbing on and guiding its various limbs to floating islands in the sky. And while it's not a dense, complex, or especially diverse experience, the journey you will embark on to accomplish your goal is anything but boring.\n\nThe climbing mechanic while a bit tedious at first, soon becomes second nature. And once other platforming mechanics are introduced, traversal becomes a breeze and at many points even enjoyable and satisfying. As you move higher the environments will begin to change in subtle but interesting ways, thus affecting how you move and slightly altering the game's difficulty. At times the climbing can be tense, especially if you haven't activated a teleporter in some time as falling means you will need to start over from the last one. And because of this design choice, the spaces between teleporters actually resemble and function as interconnected levels. The entire journey is a bit slow going, but as I looked up into space and realized I was getting closer and closer to the ship, I couldn't help but become excited and proud of how far I had come.\n\nIt is acutely innocent in its design and its tone is best described as a medium between cheerful and relaxing. The ambient sound design and minimalistic polygonal graphics are not only easy on the senses but also characterize the world as being clean and untouched. M.O.M., your guide throughout the journey, is charmingly written and is often humorous in her observations. Most times she resembles a caring mother who is proud of your accomplishments and at others, a close friend who can't help but laugh when you hurt yourself.\n\nIn addition to the completing the main objective, you also have the option of collecting power crystals and scanning the various plant and animal species found throughout the game. Both of these tasks can be a bit tricky and time consuming but provide useful upgrades or additional commentary. And by completing all three objectives you can be sure you'll have gotten your money's worth out of this incredibly charming game.","June 3","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game didn't have much of a gigantic release, like the other games I mentioned, but it definitely desreves one. Grow home is a game you can complete in 3 or 4 hours at regular, and is about a robot named B.U.D trying to grow a plant large enough to get to the mothership he was sent out of. I reccomend using a controller for this game, due to the fact that the game is confusing to control with a keyboard and mouse. There is in-game skins you can give to B.U.D, allowing you to change his color/ style, yet I like the original skin the best because the alternate skins seem a little bit wierd, rushed, or bland. Besides its problems, which are mostly small features and difficult to reach places on the map, its a fun game with high replay value. My rating? 8.5/10,\nIf it had full ragdoll it would be 9.25/10","December 20, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

You play as a robot named BUD & your goal is to collect a Star Seed.  The Catch?  You have to grow a ginormous plant first in order to get one.  Your guide throughout this adventure is MOM, an interactive AI of sorts that comments on what you're doing & gives you hints along the way.  That's really all their is to it.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay is as basic as it gets.  You move, you jump, & you collect upgrade crystals to enhance your abilities.  You also can climb nearly any surface by using the L&R triggers to latch onto them.  It involves constantly swapping between the two triggers, which can get a bit monotonous at times.  The upgrade crystals are almost mandatory as well.  You need to gather at least some of them before you can even jump or zoom out the camera.  Eventually you get a jetpack & this helps the most throughout the entire game.  Getting at least 80 crystals to fully upgrade the jetpack is highly recommended.  There are 100 crystals in total & the last upgrade is given when you collect them all, the last being infinite jetpack which is more fun than it sounds. This seems a bit game breaking but you can't really get all 100 until you've been through about 95% of the game so it feels like an accomplishment once you nab it. It also serves as an easier way to finish anything you might've skipped or missed.  I'll admit, once I got all 100 gems I spent at least an hour just flying around goofing off & that alone was pretty fun.\n\nThe movement & jumping can be floaty at best & wonky at worst.  This game is physics based so there is a momentum system that can work with or against you & when it's against you oh man is it against you.  It doesn't happen often but when it does it feels like you're fighting the controls like you're on a mechanical bull ride & trying to steer it properly through a rapid river.  This is especially apparant when trying to grow out the stems in order to reach new floating islands.  When you grow a stem you can steer it in roughly the right direction but sometimes it will just flat out ignore you & go where ever it wants.  Thus, leading to you having to grow out another stem in the process.    As you grow out more stems & leach more green energy from the earth your main plant grows until when you finally reach the very top it sprouts & gives seeds.  You need at least one of these seeds to complete your main objective, afterwards the credits roll & you get a new objective to gather 8 more seeds which have been dispersed throughout the level.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with this game however isn't the awkward floaty controls, mind you that's still an annoying issue.  It's how easy it is to lose your sense of direction.  There is absolutely no compass or map system in the game so you can't tell which way is North, South, East or West.  This gets especially frustrating at high altitudes where there are little to no landmarks to make visual paths & you need to head in certain directions for certain objectives but have no clue where exactly that one floating island you need is located.  They really should have added a compass or map of some kind just so you know which direction you're facing.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphical presentation is very unique & stylized.  It's all very pleasing to the eye, imo.  The game is polygonal but not in such a way where it's distasteful.  It reminds me of early PSX games like Spyro or Crash Bandicoot.  Everything looks great overall.  Kudos to the designers on this one.\n\nPerformance Issues\n\nAfter playing the game for some time I've noticed that after creating many more branches stemming from this large super tree, the game starts to lag considerably.  I've gone from a solid 40-60FPS to a grinding 20-30's on my current save file.  And with the controls being so awkward you need every little frame you can get, so if you're on a lower end PC like I am you might want to avoid this serious mistake I've made with growing too many branches.\n\nOVERALL\n\nOverall, the game is fun & has a bargain price.  I got around 8 or so hours out of it to complete the game 100% on my first play through, not counting achievements.  Control & technical  problems aside, it's a very fun game in a genre that is much overlooked in today's industry.  I hope to see more games like this in the future.","December 23, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're sick of every game being just a derivative of some other game you've already played one hundred times before, then I recommend grabbing this one if you'd like a rare breath of fresh air.\n\nMain objective is simple:\n1) Climb the trunk to reach the buds and grow them into branches that reach out to the crystals in order to make the trunk grow taller.\n2) Climb the now-taller trunk even higher and repeat step 1.\n3) Grow the trunk all the way to outer space.\n\nSide objectives:\n1) Collect the crystals hidden all over the islands to power up some simple robot abilities.\n2) Collect specimens and load them into the teleporter/analyzer for research.\n\nThat's really all there is to it. On paper it sounds like nothing, but the climbing mechanic is so unique and growing the stalks is so original that it's just plain enthralling somehow.\n\nOn my own scale below, I give this weird little game the full seven:\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.\n6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out—especially if discounted.\n4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.\n2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.\n1) Avoid at all costs.","December 5, 2015","true","7.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chupey/recommended/323320/","Chupey","pH. Chupey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chupey/","460 products in account","This game feels highly overrated. The gameplay doesn\'t feel good, which is a shame because you only have 4 controls; jumping, a flower parachute, left hand and right hand. The jumping feels super floaty and I always have to near instantly use my parachute to get going in the original direction I intended. Running around also feels awkward because of the odd way the character moves, I can only really describe it as feeling like walking in syrup.\n\nYou spend most of the game climbing, and I feel this is where the game shoots itself in the foot. Firstly, the climb is boring and repetitive as all you have to is alternate between two buttons while holding forward. I\'m shocked to find myself preferring the climbing methods of games like Assassin\'s Creed, as while those games have very simplistic climbing controls, they don\'t force you to monotonously press the game two buttons over and over, metre over metre.\nThe biggest issue I have with the climbing is how moving the camera to look around and the frankly beautiful and very stylised scenery is difficult to do while moving. I wanted to break up the boring gameplay by being sucked into this wonderful world but upon turning the camera my character begins to fall. You are forced to stare at this little robot, who takes up far too much of the screen, as he climbs this solid green beanstalk and nothing else. Jump pads to help somewhat to alleviate this but that doesn\'t stop the controls and gameplay feeling so unpleasant.\n\nI\'m incredibly disappointed with this charming looking game. There\'s not much in here for gameplay nor story, and both failed to pull me in enough to want to ever revisit this. All it really did was make me want to play Shadow of the Collossus.","June 1","false","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The entire game rests on the intentionally wobbly jumping of the robot.  The camera is all over the place to the pont that the camera will be clipping thru walls.  Put those 2 things together and you will be jumping to your death.  For me, that got old fast since the levels are intensely vertical.  Why the upvote?  I can see how the challenge would appeal to some to get to the top of the levels.  For me, I want a game with precise controls.

Just a fact.\n\nGrow Home does not fail in this. And that's good, because 95% of the game will involve you climbing something.\n\nThis procedurally animated offering from Ubisoft leaves you wondering two things...\n\n1) What exactly IS procedurally animated?\n2) Why is jamming the business end of a plant in to floating rocks such an appealing way to waste a few hours?\n\nThe answer to the first question, if Grow Home is to be believed, is a robot that is entirely too awkward to have passed any level of design and specification checks during it's development.\n\nThe result, in game, is a robot that controls like a drunk toddler. This is not an impediment to be taken lightly since your overall goal will probably leave you running around on narrow platforms 2 kilometers above the surface!\n\nThe answer to the second question is... honestly... I have no idea.\n\nGrow Home is bright, attractive, and beautifully executed. The restart points are just common enough that you don't get too frustrated by a long fall, but far enough apart that the 10 minute climb you just attempted and failed at the last second is certainly describable as some level of challenging.\n\nThe robot... B.U.D... you see, he's a plant-nurturing robot... get it? Nevermind... moving on, is dropped on a planet with very little power, the ability to acquire abilities in a number of ways and the instruction to make a star flower grow to 2,000 meters.\n\nI suppose there is a reason for this - but BUD doesn't really care.\n\nBUD can pick up power crystals - which turns out ot be a currency system to unlock new abilities!\n\nHe can also acquire some items to aid him in his quest. Or, mitigate the penalties of failing to control him during highwire movements high above the surface. Either way, useful thingies.\n\nAnd then there is the climbing...\n\nLots and lots of climbing.\n\nAnd Climbing...\n\nM.U.M. will offer you plenty of encouragement, so that's an incentive for ya!\n\nThis $8 dollar game is well worth a look - especially if sticking to bricks and rotating a floating dodo is your thing.","February 10, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Minrad/recommended/323320/","Minrad","Минрад","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Minrad/","187 products in account","In any platforming game the most important part of the game is the controls. And in this game they are horrible. You attempt to move up a slope and the robot starts sliding; you try to jump and go airborne and discover you can't jump off a certain slope. You attempt to use a leaf to glide back to where you were, and the leaf randomly twirls off and floats to the ground, leaving you to spend a minute at terminal velocity deciding if you'd rather shatter on the dirt, break up on the planet, or drown in the ocean.\n\nAgain, the main issue is that the controls are so bad they actively draw you out of the game as you struggle to make the robot do something as simple as move up a ten degree incline, and in a game where the objective is "climb really high" this is a serious problem. It's like trying to play a 2D Mario game using the controls of QWOP, instead of simply moving left and right and jumping you're left flopping around until a goomba gets you. The experience playing this game is indeed quite similar; and even if you manage to get past the controls, you're left with a very shallow, hollow game.\n\nThe floating islands have very little to actually explore on them, and the only thing you're actually incentivized to explore is to collect little crystal doodads that eventually give you a jet pack, and then they barely upgrade the capacity on it. The jet pack is good for moving a few meters vertically at most, and is mostly useful for just increasing your horizontal movement, which is just awkward when you'd expect the point of a jetpack to be flying around. I couldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to spend the extra half an hour getting to 100 crystals to see if it gave an unlimited jetpack, but by that point you would have explored every area and seen all the amazing polygonal rock clusters up close and personal, so who cares?\n\nSo to sum up you have terrible controls, no actual gameplay, and a story that can be summarized in one word, let alone taking up an entire sentence. Even when you get the plant to the space ship, you're left feeling unrewarded, unless maybe you wanted to beat the game to make a number go up on your Steam profile, in which case you'd feel relief at not being stuck in this terrible title.","February 11","false","2.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","3"

But, graphics and animations don't make a game. I purchased this game solely because of its cheap price and good reviews.\n\nI don't regret my decision one bit. This game is so unique. The robot, bud and his silly animations and sounds are cute. Your "mother" constantly gives you positive reinforcement... although usually after plummetting 1500 meters do your death.\n\nI'm afraid of heights so it was exciting doing the platforming and cliffhanging part. Which is essentially the entire game. I know it's just a cartoon-like lowgrade graphics game, but you'll scream out loud once you've missed a vine trying to make a daring leap.\n\n10/10 2015 Cliffhanger Simulator","March 2, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game asks the player to find some way from point A to point B and lacks any sort of immersion-breaking barriers like invisible walls. The game has some ostensibly finicky mechanics that have a learning curve, but are very robust once you actually master them. Collecting everything in the game wasn't immensely rewarding or necessary to complete the game, but I don't think that really matters much, because I found the act and challenge of collecting them very intrinsically satisfying. My only real complaint is that I think, of the six hours I've spent playing at the time of this review, I spent probably half of the time searching for the last 1% completion I needed, which can get tedious if you're really obsessed with getting everything. I think it's worth stressing the importance of having your speakers turned up, in order to take advantage of the game's subtle audio clues. That said, I found the game very enjoyable for what it was, and well worth the $10.","February 5, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The objective of this game is to explore and grow the star flower to earth by using the roots and attaching to differnt planets life resources. So far i give this a solid 9/10 mainly because i think BUD could be a little less clunky but the beautiful atmosphere and wonderful music make the game very peaceful and relaxing after a long day or if you just want to get away from the stress of some first person shooters.\n\nWatch my walkthrough here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa2yZ8NhVh0","February 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/recommended/323320/","DoctorTeo","Doctor Teo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/","613 products in account","Grow Home: Ubisoft's little indie-like darling; since it's finally hit the Humble Bundle, this little unknown game is going to get in the hands of many more people. Now then, the question: is Grow Home worth playing?\n\nBUD, the adorable little robot, has one goal: to collect the seeds from a giant plant which will only bloom once it reaches space. To do so, he must nurture this incredible plant, guiding its growth and feeding it.\n\nThis game was Ubisoft's take on procedural animation - you, the player, control BUD's arms as he climbs, jumps, and stumbles his way up the giant plant. The plant itself grows in different directions based on how you control its nutrient-suckers, and you can create walkways and climbing walls for you to fall on or climb back up if you slip.\n\nThis little game oozes with charm. The world is minimalistic and colorful, the music is soothing, and BUD is adorable (if clumsy). Even if the game isn't a true sandbox, it's certainly a fun little playground to jump around in. While the controls are hard to get used to and can feel rather clunky at times even with a controller, the act of manually climbing a towering structure feels much more deliberate and compelling than just pushing the up button in an Assassin's Creed game.\n\nIf you got this game for free or as part of a bundle, I recommend taking a look - it's a more laid back and relaxing title that's only a few hours long, and it's one of Ubisoft's more imaginative titles. As for whether it's worth buying outright, that depends; I bought it for $5 on a sale myself and, even though I only played for a few hours, I still thought it was worth it.","February 2","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

During the course of this you will explore the relatively small but detailed environment of floating isles, discovering new flora and fauna and finding out new snippets of information on everything by scanning things. You'll unlock new abilities through collecting energy crystals.\n\nThings that make this game worth playing+ An excellent freeform grab system, allowing you to control both your arms separately. Carry things, climb a mountain or do skydiving while grappling with sheep.\n+ Nice exploration. Great attention to detail and plenty of secrets.\n+ Good freedom of movement using grab, jump platforms and a few special items through a beatiful environment.\n+ Charming looks; not everyone enjoys it but personally I found the game gorgeous.\n\nThings that aren't so great- It's short: In about 4 hours I'd managed to see most of what the game has to offer, save for finishing all the achievements.\n- Hunting for the last few crystals is frustrating as the game doesn't give you hints about their location. Luckily searching for animals and plants is easier as tips are provided.\n\n\nAll in all it's a short but good game worth the asking price, especially since it is part of the 1€  Humble Bundle at the moment.","February 7","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And while Grow Home's traversal mechanics are interesting, and have a great deal of potential... they are insufficiently polished to be very enjoyable, and the tedious level design only exacerbates the problem. If I'm not having fun the first time I climb up a very tall vine to collect a glowing jewel, I'm not going to have much fun the 42nd time, either.\n\nGrow Home also runs into the same problem every other physics-based platformer runs into: physics-based platforming simply isn't very enjoyable due to the lack of precision and control the player is able to exert over his or her avatar. If "B.U.D.'s" movements were a bit more refined--if he could come to a stop more quickly and more precisely, if he could affect his descent with more accuracy, and project his leaps with more control... Grow Home would be a much better game.\n\nI'll keep a hopeful eye out for a sequel to Grow Home, or any other game that attempts to iterate on it--but by itself, this game is more a novelty than anything else: something to examine for a few minutes and marvel at, and then set aside.","January 3","false","0.2"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","20","42","0","6"

Adventuring around (or rather up) the landscape. Collecting trinkets that you find (crystals), and questing to grow that little plant once found in a boot, to the height of a mountain.\n\nBUD (the protagonist) moves hilariously, using physics rather than animations to move; meaning if you change your mind on the direction your going, he sways about like a drunk, clambering over to the direction you've decided. Despite this, the controls are very instinctive (at least on a gamepad). It's great fun, and rarely a nuisance.

The biggest problem I had with the game was its physics engine.  As you can see by the picture of B.U.D., the game's protagonist, the character the player controls is very top-heavy.  This leads to a lot of situations in which Bud will land on a platform, be carried by his momentum, and end up running right off the platform you intended to be on.  While this makes sense scientifically, it can lead to a lot of frustrastion.  Another problem I have with the game's physics accuracy is the grip function.  While you are trying to climb up or over obstacles while holding on to something, the effects of gravity will often act on the held item, which will cause you to drop it.  This leads to even more frustrating moments when you have to try climbing over the same ledge multiple times or even having to restart your game when you drop your item hundreds of meters into the ocean.  Jumping itself can also cause annoyances because the plane that you think you are jumping on doesn't always match up with the plane the game thinks you are jumping on.  There were enough frustrating moments like these that make me not want to recommend this game to anyone.","June 19, 2015","false","7.6"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","8","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/323320/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Grow Home is a 3D platforming game which centers around being a small robot who slowly climbs up a vine, guiding its growth into crystals to allow it to grow yet higher, so he can get back to his space ship and go home. With extremely loose controls, a dodgy camera, tedious mechanics, and no depth, this is a game to avoid, feeling more like a school project than a finished game.\n\nStory\n\nThere is very little story to the game; there are a few bits of flavor text here and there, and MOM – either an AI of some sort, or a fellow being who is elsewhere in the universe – occasionally gives you hints or makes “wry” (non-voice acted) remarks on your progress.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game centers about climbing around the game world, slowly growing your vine upwards. To grow the vine, you must crawl up the vine to various red flowers, which you can then command to grow outwards. Each of these will sprout bouncy leaves, to help you ascend a bit faster, and additional red flowers, to allow you to grow additional vines. There are 100 small crystals hidden around the various floating islands in the game, and collecting those power up your robot’s jetpack; there are also large crystal islands, which you must direct the growth of the vines into in order to grow the main vine higher and burst through various barriers and reach the top of the map. There are also a number of things you can drag into your various telepods – locations you can teleport back to when you die – which unlock entries in a data bank.\nThat is literally 100% of the gameplay, and it is very dull. The controls for your robot are terrible, and carrying things around is extremely tedious, as you can easily drop them while doing other tasks. Climbing is an arduous process of alternating clicks of the shoulder buttons, and is made all the worse when the surface is uneven. Jumping and using your jetpack feels a little better, but is still very awkward, and it is easy to miss jumps and fall to your doom. A few pick-upable items – a flower which slows your descent, and a glide leaf which lets you glide around like on a hangglider – do little to spruce up the gameplay.\nAll in all, the game is a very tedious process of ascending the vine and growing it outwards, then upwards, then outwards again; less than half an hour into the game, you have seen everything it has to offer. If you don’t bother to collect the collectables, you could easily beat the entire game in an hour, and you’d still think it was too long. Collecting the collectables is tedious – most of environmental items you collect for the databank aren’t too bad, but a few have to be lugged large distances while suffering from the dodgy controls.\nThe small crystals, on the other hand, are extremely tedious to find; the only hint to their presence is an audio cue when the camera is close to them, which means that at the end of the game, if you’re missing any crystals, finding the rest of them is a matter of pure chance. Many are hidden in places which aren’t readily visible while gliding around, making this primarily a job for consulting a FAQ – if you were bothered to do it, which you really shouldn’t bother to do.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game has graphics which would have been an embarrassment in the Playstation 1 era; they’re ugly and unappealing, and the creatures in the game look terrible. The only thing which looks at all passable is the world from great elevation; it slowly becomes increasingly spherical around the horizon, and from a great distance, the vines and islands look somewhat visually appealing. Unfortunately, you will spend very little of the game admiring this, and most of the game looking at low-resolution textures and extremely blocky polygonal vines.\nI will, however, give the game credit for one thing - it is one of the very few games which gave me an actual sense of vertigo while navigating the environment.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nThere is absolutely no reason whatsoever to spend your time, let alone your money, on this game. If it was a school project, I might be impressed, but as an actual commercial release, it is just not up to snuff. It is boring, tedious, repetitive, and yet manages to annoy you even though the entire game is likely to take no more than a few hours to complete.\nSave your money and your time and do other things.","July 14, 2015","false","6.5"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","0"

I played with both keyboard/mouse and gamepad. I already know there is very little content and total gameplay, which I could live with if it weren't for trying to control a character that feels like it is in low-gravity and on ice. I'm also not the hugest fan of the climbing mechanic. I mean its ok, but not enough here to build a whole game on.\n\nIs this what happens when AAA companies try to dabble in indie-level game production? I mean its not terrible, and the core idea is ok, but this is more of a proof-of-concept than  some brilliant sleeper hit.\n\nBecause the climbing mechanic is front-and-center, the rest of the platforming elements suffered from many gaps that were too big/awkward to jump, and many knee-high ledges that I had to fumble over to get onto.\n\nI will also mention that despite what it looks like, it takes a decent machine to run on full graphics. I played on 'low' setting on my laptop, and on highest on my gaming rig.\n\nWatch some gameplay first, and be aware that there isn't much here as far as replay value.

But the 44 minutes I played game, was one of the ragiest 44 minutes of my life, the only time i got ragier in a game was when i couldn't get a single ♥♥♥♥ing horse in red dead redemption, and that was years ago. Now I hardly ever rage at games, if I get stuck i look on the internet, but this I can't fix, and it is deliberate problem, in most people's eyes it isn't a problem but in my eyes it is.\n\nThe controls are waaaaaaaaaaaaaay to over the top, I know it's meant to be like that but it's a serious problem in a game which has you scramble around high up ledges and small spaces the entire game. A billion times I'm walking to get a crystal thing next to the edge of a floating island, and I stop telling the guy to move so I don't fall off and because he went on just that little bit further and I fell of and died in the ocean after a ten minute climb to said island. Another thing was that even though the grab distance was in range and it was a flat vertical face, when I switched to the other arm it doesn't bloody work so I fall and die. Another thing was that when I grab onto the sticky outy pant growy bits and make it start growing, even if I'm holding on I just get flung off and die for the 50th time.\n\nThe last problem I had with this game is what made me write this review and delete the game was when the game tabbed out because another window opened the game glitched out and crashed when I tried to reopen it because of resolution errors, when I reopened the game and clicked play, it put me right at the beginning because there was no autosave, when I found out that I had to restart the entire game, thats what made me say "♥♥♥♥ THIS" and write this review.\n\nNow I'm gonna eat a sandwich and forget about this crap game.","July 28, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

The experience feels really threadbare in terms of mechanics. The climbing is really repetitive and gets boring quick, and if you fall off on your way up, prepare for quite a while of backtracking. The gameplay is just "left trigger, A, right trigger, A". Most of the islands are very small and are made of assets you have already seen; while I wont deny that those assets are visually appealing, I personally believe that the aesthetics of a game should not make or break it. Because of the way the character is "proceedurally animated", he ends up stumbling around and falling off of things alot. I expected this game to be like 3D starseed pilgrim, but I got more 3D girp. The short length isn't that much of a problem, some of my favorite games are under 3 hours long (See: Hotline Miami). The story is pretty generic. All in all, this game may be for you if you like artsy games based more on visuals than gameplay, but I feel like my money could have been spent better elsewhere.\n\n[EDIT 2/5/15] Fixed some weird gramatical errors.

Target aquired.\nThis game may have awesome graphics, design, music, and exploration controls, but the worst aspect of it from what I can tell is that the growing controls are hard to use for me, when it was my first time playing through the game. The game only wants you to use the normal moving controls (WASD) to grow a sprout when using a keyboard. That is not what I expect at all to use when I grow a sprout. And to make it miles more worse, growing sprouts is part of the main premise of the game! WTF, Reflections?! That's an instant fail, if you ask me! My suggestion in a future update is that you add a second recommended control method: mouse to steer, W to speed up, and D to slow down and stop. So I would not recommend you play this game until the release of the update if you're a fan of Grow Home. Well, looks like it's DK time...and you know what that means, BUD.

Oh and grab some seeds and bring it to Earth or whatever.\n\nOn a more serious note your goal in the game is to grow a Star Plant large enough so you can harvest it’s seeds to bring back to Earth. Which you can do by connecting a Star Shoot into floating islands called energy rocks surrounding the large plant.\n\nAs this game is a platformer your main activities will consist of figuring out how to get to point A to point B to achieve your objectives. Though that may prove difficult at first since B.U.D is a heavy character with a lot of momentum and you will find yourself fighting with the controls like in games such as QWOP or Surgeon Simulator. But once you learn how to properly manipulate B.U.D you will find an incredibly enjoyable time as you jump, bounce, and climb your way up that would make Jack proud.\n\nLittered throughout the level are multiple crystals that I recommend finding as you unlock more abilities the more you find. They are in no way necessary needed to complete the game but let me just say one word: jetpack.\n\nThe game has a voxel like aesthetic that it uses to full effect and just radiates charm. And though I’m not normally a graphics minded person, the graphics is what peaked my interest of the game. Music wise the game didn’t have much to offer but what I heard was pleasing to hear. Difficulty wise the game isn’t too punishing as long as you activated various teleporters scattered throughout the game that act as your checkpoints if you die or can use if you need to travel back somewhere quickly.\n\nOverall I would say this game was incredibly fun and a great game for all ages though it may be a bit short (unless you decide to do the bonus objective after you beat the game the first time) and even though Ubisoft hasn’t been very up to par lately, if you’re into a casual platformer that’s a lot of fun then this game is a must buy at $8.\n\nHere's a link to my video review, it ended up far longer than I intended, I had a lot more fun than I anticipated: http://youtu.be/wXcWDS3ULFs","February 5, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people say that Ubisoft is generally becoming the new EA.\nBut I'll say one thing for Ubisoft: Paradoxically, they make their own indie games like Child of Light, Valiant Hearts and arguably Rayman Origins/Legends. Grow Home is the latest indie game by Ubisoft.\n\nGrow Home is an exploration game that manages to not be a walking simulator. You play as a robot who is send to a small island on a planet far far away. On that island is a flower which you have to make grow up into the sky like a giant beanstalk so that it blooms up which in turn allows you to collect its seeds.\nTo make the flower grow, you have to make one of its buds grow and navigate it into one of the countless floating islands. That's what makes the game so interesting: It is organic. It's like a 3D platformer where you make up the levels while you play.\nThe (floating) islands also make up exploration places: there are upgrade crystals to find, checkpoints to unlock and secrets to find.\n\nI had a lot of fun with Grow Home. 8€ is an absolutely fair price for the game.","February 6, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Found it to be a fun and different game, reminds me of old games but is nothing like them.  The climbing mechanic works just fine with a mouse using the left mouse for left hand and right mouse for (you guessed it) right hand.\nThere were a lot of mechanics in the game unexplained, mostly to do with the various plants (possibly animals too?) around.  Some bounded you a bit, others might eat you.  I have no clue what other ones were supposed to do.  One type can fling you places, i had a bug where I was flung off the map.  Even that was fun.\nPros:\n-Interesting gameplay.  You can play very simply and put one hand in front of the other or perform acrobatic feats (mostly unintentionally).\n-The physics of it felt consistent.\n-Cool style.\nCons:\n-ANNOYING constant noise making.  It seems the game fears any moment of silents and fills it with nonstop electronic noises.  I thought it was the music but turning the music down didn't seem to help.\n-Is that it?  One level?  It took me maybe 2.5-3 hours to beat it just strolling along, I could see it being less than 2 hours of play for many.  I started a new game, it appears to be the exact same layout.  That will get old REAL fast meaning replay value is very low.\n\nOverall a fun little game for an afternoon.","February 6, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you progress, you'll gain powers and use these little red sprout things to climb higher, eventually reaching floating islands and waterfalls that look straight out of a painting.\n\nThere really isn't any music, only ambient sounds. B.U.D. makes little bleeps and bloops, you'll hear the wind blowing through the air as you hanglide (or skydive if you fall), or the sounds of a floating waterfall. All beautiful, and make it worth it to play it with the sound instead of listening to music.\n\nAll in all the game is really amazing. I can tell it's going to be short.  I've only had it for 2 days, but feel like I'm reaching the end. However, I hope more that this is a stepping stone, so other developers see that 3D platformers are still a viable option.\n\nMaybe in the coming years, Grow Home and more beautiful platformers like this one will take the place on Gamestop shelves, where all the bleak FPS games used to sit.","February 6, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You climb. You jump. You ragdoll your way through minimilistic 3-D worlds in search of crystals while growing a starseed to bring back to your ship. That's it! And yet, with such a simplistic objective and design, I can't help but find myself enjoying every moment I play this game, be it for the satisfying task of exploration, the fun and quirky utility plants (flower-ups) to the cavern systems and crystal hunting that makes this game truly a gem. For $7.99 USD, it's a great buy, though I'd recommend you pick it up while on sale.\n\nTo note, the controls can be a bit quirky, and the camera is generally unobtrusive - you don't have to fight it very often unless you're in a really tight and overall bad location. There are no actual "enemies" but plenty of ambient creatures and plants, and plenty of ways to die, though there are plenty of checkpoints scattered about at different levels. Robots can drown, what? Overall, I'd recommend this game if you're looking for somethign that's relaxing enough to pass some time, but involved enough to make you think and consider how to approach different tasks.\n\nAs a future note -I hope this game receives updates with additional levels. I've only played for a few hours now and am still in the first (perhaps only?) world, but for replayability's sake, I hope that more stages are added with different locations, biomes and creatures becuase this is a world I love to explore, and would like to do so more.","February 16, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everybody who says this game is extremely easy to get into is right.\n\nBut I have to complain about something, and so I'll get on my soapbox: you really do not need to have an overlay that appears before every game telling the player that the game is best played with a certain type of control scheme. First of all,  everyone knows you can play games with controllers. Steam bends over backwards to let you know that you can play games with controllers. Second, you're wrong if the player is bad with a certain control scheme. For example, I found this game much more enjoyable using my mouse, since I wasn't running around alternately looking at the sky and the ground. So don't waste my time!\n\nBut I like this game a lot.

If you want a truly immersive experience, I recommend a Xbox 360 controller or other controllers for consoles. This game is spectacular and I have never seen anything like it. The best thing about this game is that it is in early access, meaning that I can see it grow into something even more spectacular. The game is worth much more money than it is right now and makes you destined for exploration. I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. The flora and fauna are very interesting (and let's face it the Glide Leaf is probably the best thing ever). There is humor in the game and many cool things to explore.

I've found everything, unlocked all the skins, completed all of the sidequests. And yet, I feel quite contented with my purchase!\n\nGrow Home is a charming game in my opinion. The character is unusually clumbsy, silent, and mostly likable. Movement is an unexpected challenge because you're given the freedom to literally go anywhere you want - and yet getting BUD to move in the right direction at the right time can be stressful. He bumbles and fumbles and sometimes falls over completely. With a little practice, however, he is more than capable for the task ahead. In fact, I found a certain satisfaction in learning and discovering more advanced movement combinations and shortcuts - your mileage may vary.\n\nThe game is short, as stated before - and there's no getting away from that. In my first playthrough I completed everything in the game within 4 hours. Subsequent playthroughs have been accomplished within an hour if you skip the "fluff". Even still, I find myself going back for more. The new skins that you unlock are useable on further playthroughs and make an appreciable difference in the way the game plays out while adding some visual variety. Moreover, the world is just an enjoyable place to explore.\n\nGraphically, there's little worry about performance and very few options to change. You're given the choice of VSync, Fullscreen, and "Quality". That's it. The game does not support AA in any form without adding a launch command to run the game in DirectX 11 (runs natively in 9). Also, there's no AF because there are no textures... Let that sink in for a minute...\n\nThe long-short: if you want to support a creative team and you enjoy games where the objective and reward is in the exploration and journey, you'll likely really enjoy Grow Home. At $7.99, I think the price is reasonable for the hours of entertainment it has provided me. Hats off to Ubisoft for an enjoyable title without all of the issues some of their more recent releases have had.","February 27, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I did have a great time. It's a niche game for sure, which is why I think I enjoyed it. Focuses more on atmosphere, sense of scale, collecting and most of all exploring.\n\nThe mechanics are great, and feel both refined and a little ridiculous at the same time. Minimal design, but cute and simple. Adds to the beauty of the game. No convolution and everything blends in just the right ways.\n\nIt's fun and probably for everyone. I think the gamer enthusiast can play this and have just as great a time as your mom.\nVery fun and recommended whole heartedly, especially for the price.","February 4, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Excellent.\n\nGrow Home one of the most relaxing games I've played in a long time. A combination of incredibly composed music;  striking yet simple visuals that don't give me too much to focus on at the same time, a simple mechanism to control BUD and the freedom to explore the world the way I want too.\n\nThis is the big winner for me, it's my game. It's a game that I play in the role of the central character and not the other way round (which most other games tend to be these days). I can go look anywhere I want, I can do the main quest of the game if I want or I can throw rocks off the sides of bigger rocks if I want.\n\nThat level of freedom, which is rare in modern games these days, is what's great about Grow Home.

Oh and grab some seeds and bring it to Earth or whatever.\n\nOn a more serious note your goal in the game is to grow a Star Plant large enough so you can harvest it’s seeds to bring back to Earth. Which you can do by connecting a Star Shoot into floating islands called energy rocks surrounding the large plant.\n\nAs this game is a platformer your main activities will consist of figuring out how to get to point A to point B to achieve your objectives. Though that may prove difficult at first since B.U.D is a heavy character with a lot of momentum and you will find yourself fighting with the controls like in games such as QWOP or Surgeon Simulator. But once you learn how to properly manipulate B.U.D you will find an incredibly enjoyable time as you jump, bounce, and climb your way up that would make Jack proud.\n\nLittered throughout the level are multiple crystals that I recommend finding as you unlock more abilities the more you find. They are in no way necessary needed to complete the game but let me just say one word: jetpack.\n\nThe game has a voxel like aesthetic that it uses to full effect and just radiates charm. And though I’m not normally a graphics minded person, the graphics is what peaked my interest of the game. Music wise the game didn’t have much to offer but what I heard was pleasing to hear. Difficulty wise the game isn’t too punishing as long as you activated various teleporters scattered throughout the game that act as your checkpoints if you die or can use if you need to travel back somewhere quickly.\n\nOverall I would say this game was incredibly fun and a great game for all ages though it may be a bit short (unless you decide to do the bonus objective after you beat the game the first time) and even though Ubisoft hasn’t been very up to par lately, if you’re into a casual platformer that’s a lot of fun then this game is a must buy at $8.\n\nHere's a link to my video review, it ended up far longer than I intended, I had a lot more fun than I anticipated: http://youtu.be/wXcWDS3ULFs","February 5, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people say that Ubisoft is generally becoming the new EA.\nBut I'll say one thing for Ubisoft: Paradoxically, they make their own indie games like Child of Light, Valiant Hearts and arguably Rayman Origins/Legends. Grow Home is the latest indie game by Ubisoft.\n\nGrow Home is an exploration game that manages to not be a walking simulator. You play as a robot who is send to a small island on a planet far far away. On that island is a flower which you have to make grow up into the sky like a giant beanstalk so that it blooms up which in turn allows you to collect its seeds.\nTo make the flower grow, you have to make one of its buds grow and navigate it into one of the countless floating islands. That's what makes the game so interesting: It is organic. It's like a 3D platformer where you make up the levels while you play.\nThe (floating) islands also make up exploration places: there are upgrade crystals to find, checkpoints to unlock and secrets to find.\n\nI had a lot of fun with Grow Home. 8€ is an absolutely fair price for the game.","February 6, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, on to the review\n\nFirst off, sound and graphics.  The sound is actually quite an important part of the game, as minerals can be found using the sound they make. The music is cheerful, lighthearted, and fits the game well. Next, graphics. As you can see, the graphics are just amazing. Multiple times I've just climbed to a high point and looked around. Seriously, the art style is just amazing\n\nNow, on to gameplay, which is going to be the biggest part of this review, obviously. The gameplay is slow paced, relaxing, and the only time I've been even slightly frustrated is when I couldn't get this one crystal, and even that wasn't bad and didn't last for long. The gameplay focuses on two main things; climbing, and exploration, although exploration is entirely optional, but makes the game much more enjoyable in my opinion. The basic premise is that you climb using the triggers(on a gamepad, which this game was obviously designed for and much better to play with), or with lmb and rmb for keyboard/mouse. You get things along the way like a little flower parachute and a leaf glider, which is actually quite fun to use. You get upgrades by finding and collecting minerals, and from 20-60 it is a jetpack/upgrades, which is extremely helpful. If you have 60 crystals and a jetpack you can literally fly by using the jetpack to gain altitude, which is amazing fun. There's a lot more mechanics and a lot of different strategies people will find and use, but the basic premise is climbing upwards, and exploring for crystals to upgrade. Overall, with some time getting achievements and collecting most mineral crystals, the game should last 4-6 hours. if you want to just blaze through it, that isn't really the way to play, as the game would last you 2 or 3 hours maximum, which is why exploration, while technically optional, is worth it to get the full experience\n\nNow, my overall opinion. This game is amazing, and I've had some of the most fun playing it than I've had in a while. The gameplay is relaxing, the sights are beautiful, the world large and fun to explore, and the music delightfully cheerful. All in all, I'd give this game a 9 out of 10. It suffers from a lack of co-op, which would be amazing, and it can get a bit tedious at times looking for those last few crystals, but overall, I highly recommend it, and I'd get it as soon as possible.\n\nAnd this concludes my review of the game. It's a bit skewed by my personal opinion and preferences, but that's to be expected. Anyways, until next time","February 7, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This ambient intro though fails to capture the grandeur of riding bean stalks into the sky or the consistent tension between getting there and falling. In other words it should have introduced the grapple sequence and then have you do some clambering with vertigo inducing tendencies early. Regardless if you stick with it it has a lot of ideas. It's kinda like a n64 game that somehow never made it out during the Banjo-Kazooie period. The game is about exploration. See that floating island over there? if you can manage to stay you can grow a few buds out into branches and make it over there. Then there is the island's challenge for whatever goodie it holds. Grow Home is short. I'd estimate 3-5 hours and maybe 6 for all the trophies. It feels like a student project, it has little blemishes, cameras that wonk out or animations that seem buggy. It's the type of thing you might download from a kickstarter campaign, but that said it's also a proof of concept worth owning. So few 3D platformers dot the landscape of games these days and one with the precision and know how of this one much less with mechanical inventions that are way off the beaten track are far and few between, but even if Grow Home had met the n64 deadline it would have been a sleep like Space Station Silicon Valley. It's a unique game and the curious must play it there is nothing like reaching that flower in space and looking down on the patchwork of vines and branches that you conjured to get up there, however it lacks mechanics that invigorate the way Mario did or the insanity of Psychonauts it's much more of an ambient experience. Still I'm tempting to go back just to try some of the challenges that make up it's achievements. Grow Home is one of those game that's a trip, less a new genre more something that's design that will make you think differently about the nature of platform games.

The climbing mechanic may be at the core of it's gameplay but the real beauty is in it's hidden caves and 'drunk-baby' like movement. It provides a good challenge with plenty of reward (without spoiling anything)\nMany of the reviews here state that there isn't much past the initial climb and collecting all 100 gems doesn't interest them, but the real joy comes from trying to complete this 100%\nThe only real downside to this game is that it isn't long enough, not in the "it's too short and isn't worth the money" way, more the "this game is so good there needs to be more" way.\nThe game is an absolute delight and perfect for the price. 9/10","February 7, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, on to the review\n\nFirst off, sound and graphics.  The sound is actually quite an important part of the game, as minerals can be found using the sound they make. The music is cheerful, lighthearted, and fits the game well. Next, graphics. As you can see, the graphics are just amazing. Multiple times I've just climbed to a high point and looked around. Seriously, the art style is just amazing\n\nNow, on to gameplay, which is going to be the biggest part of this review, obviously. The gameplay is slow paced, relaxing, and the only time I've been even slightly frustrated is when I couldn't get this one crystal, and even that wasn't bad and didn't last for long. The gameplay focuses on two main things; climbing, and exploration, although exploration is entirely optional, but makes the game much more enjoyable in my opinion. The basic premise is that you climb using the triggers(on a gamepad, which this game was obviously designed for and much better to play with), or with lmb and rmb for keyboard/mouse. You get things along the way like a little flower parachute and a leaf glider, which is actually quite fun to use. You get upgrades by finding and collecting minerals, and from 20-60 it is a jetpack/upgrades, which is extremely helpful. If you have 60 crystals and a jetpack you can literally fly by using the jetpack to gain altitude, which is amazing fun. There's a lot more mechanics and a lot of different strategies people will find and use, but the basic premise is climbing upwards, and exploring for crystals to upgrade. Overall, with some time getting achievements and collecting most mineral crystals, the game should last 4-6 hours. if you want to just blaze through it, that isn't really the way to play, as the game would last you 2 or 3 hours maximum, which is why exploration, while technically optional, is worth it to get the full experience\n\nNow, my overall opinion. This game is amazing, and I've had some of the most fun playing it than I've had in a while. The gameplay is relaxing, the sights are beautiful, the world large and fun to explore, and the music delightfully cheerful. All in all, I'd give this game a 9 out of 10. It suffers from a lack of co-op, which would be amazing, and it can get a bit tedious at times looking for those last few crystals, but overall, I highly recommend it, and I'd get it as soon as possible.\n\nAnd this concludes my review of the game. It's a bit skewed by my personal opinion and preferences, but that's to be expected. Anyways, until next time","February 7, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You climb. You jump. You ragdoll your way through minimilistic 3-D worlds in search of crystals while growing a starseed to bring back to your ship. That's it! And yet, with such a simplistic objective and design, I can't help but find myself enjoying every moment I play this game, be it for the satisfying task of exploration, the fun and quirky utility plants (flower-ups) to the cavern systems and crystal hunting that makes this game truly a gem. For $7.99 USD, it's a great buy, though I'd recommend you pick it up while on sale.\n\nTo note, the controls can be a bit quirky, and the camera is generally unobtrusive - you don't have to fight it very often unless you're in a really tight and overall bad location. There are no actual "enemies" but plenty of ambient creatures and plants, and plenty of ways to die, though there are plenty of checkpoints scattered about at different levels. Robots can drown, what? Overall, I'd recommend this game if you're looking for somethign that's relaxing enough to pass some time, but involved enough to make you think and consider how to approach different tasks.\n\nAs a future note -I hope this game receives updates with additional levels. I've only played for a few hours now and am still in the first (perhaps only?) world, but for replayability's sake, I hope that more stages are added with different locations, biomes and creatures becuase this is a world I love to explore, and would like to do so more.","February 16, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everybody who says this game is extremely easy to get into is right.\n\nBut I have to complain about something, and so I'll get on my soapbox: you really do not need to have an overlay that appears before every game telling the player that the game is best played with a certain type of control scheme. First of all,  everyone knows you can play games with controllers. Steam bends over backwards to let you know that you can play games with controllers. Second, you're wrong if the player is bad with a certain control scheme. For example, I found this game much more enjoyable using my mouse, since I wasn't running around alternately looking at the sky and the ground. So don't waste my time!\n\nBut I like this game a lot.

A well-made package that I cannot equate to anything with a similar background.\n\nThere are no boundaries within the shore-line, and above that is all fair game within a ridiculously large radius from the starting point. The objective is incredibly simple, but requires time and effort to achieve. Everything you manipulate is free-form, so the world is a tightly constructed skeleton to the explorational options you can experiment with. There are practical unlockables that help you reach your objectives over time. Quite a few surprises even.\n\nThese things all matter to a certain kind of people though: The people who want to discover. There is no battle to be won, no story to elaborate, or even a huge variety of different items to collect. Useful flora; interesting fauna; a couple of kinds of scattered, but greatly enticing, collectables; and a really big plant to grow home with, unique to you.\n\nBig Pros:\n-Style, graphically and mechanically.\n-Wonder that doesn't wear thin until the very end.\n-Everything does what you tell it to, never have I blamed a mistake on the game.\n-Very simple controls that handle like a dream.\n\nCons:\n-Procedural animation that gets janky with it, most of the time it is funny anyway.\n-The only thing left to chance is the once-in-a-blue-moon leaf falling beneath your feet.\n-So few things we can play are so inspired like this.\n-Gets a bit ruined if you watch other people play it first.\n\n3/3 would give to everyone I know if they even hinted at asking for it.","February 16, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays like it should and like you want it to. Mastering the left / right controls on a controller took me about three or four minutes and after that it was beautiful. Sound design is great. It never gets in the way and facilitates the right mood throughout. There is a lack of story to the game, but I feel like like plays to its good side. It is challenging, but not hard. It is pretty, but not graphically demanding. Above everything else it is fun. With a willful suspension of disbelief I was a monkey like robot for three hours. There are only a couple bad things I can point to in such a simple fun games. First would be the camera clipping through walls. This doesn't happen often, but when it does it can be catastrophic. Second would be the occasional complete miss for no reason. The game makes a noise confirming when you are latched on to a surface. One in every hundred thousand latch-ons fails and sends you straight back to the bottom. Beside these minor complaints I could not recommend this game more highly to get rid of a couple hours and brighten your day. The only thing holding the score down is the limited run time and the forgivable mistakes in a game made by eight people. 8/10 buy it, buy it now.","February 13, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rachek128/recommended/323320/","Rachek128","Rachek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rachek128/","143 products in account","For someone acrophobic (that's a fear of heights, for those not blessed with it) while climbing and crawling on near vertical surfaces, thousands of feet in the air, with a robot that tends to stumble and stagger at the best of times like he's taken one too many shots of the good stuff, this game is an adrenaline-fueled exploration in facing ones fears.\n\nIt's also refreshingly simple while being entirely captivating. I could not stop climbing, at least until I made it just shy of the top, mis-judged a jump, and proceeded to fall quite spectacularly. I may, in fact, still be falling by the time you read this since I don't plan on stopping any time soon.\n\nI've seen a few climbing games with independently controlled hands, and most amount to a series of quicktime events synchronized to repetitive animations, but the procedural animations here are mostly fluid and elegant. I say mostly due to the occasions where BUD has managed to contort himself upside down, legs akimbo, while firmly gripping the ground (it must have been a particularly fine vintage.)\n\nI don't see much replay value beyond the completionist in me wanting to collect every last crystal. Still, I dare say I have plenty of time. It's quite a long way to the bottom.","February 17, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are sometimes a bit shakey when you're growing the "beanstock."\n\nIt's like playing Chibi-Robo if anyone still remembers what that is like (Not a Ubisoft game). The character you play as is a cute red robot and he does little tedious tasks such as growing a HUGE plant all by himself.\n\nThere are multiple ways to accomplish your goals; you can grow around, through, or anyway you feel possible. The game is not too bad challenging if you play with the gamepad. You have many, many ways of tranportation in this parkour game: Flying, walking, running, or growing your way around.\n\nThis game is surprisingly addicting EVEN AFTER THE MAIN MISSION!

Normally I like bashing ubisoft for making the same game year after the year, but Grow home has changed this,\n\nGrow Home is best summerized with the word "Serinity". It lets you forget your own world and immerses you in a gorgous, wonderful canvas.\n\nI could go on and on, so to keep things short I'll list the good and bad here:\n\nGOOD:\n- Beautiful lightning. When the sun sets or dawns, the scenario around you changes almost like a living painting.\n- Delightful climbing mechanics. If it has a surface, you can climb it. Hang in one arm at the bottom of a floating island.\n- Freedom. Not only can you climb everywhere, but you can create new "bridges" by growing the star plant. New vines has new buds, giving you unlimited freedom to shape the world and go where you want.\n- Best interface ever! There isn't one. 100% clutterfree screen. Enjoy the view and your game.\n- Super easy to learn.\n- Skill plays a role. Unlike many other games, skill plays a role at how well you can move around the world. This gives you an increasing sense of freedom as you gain confidence in your climbing skills.\n- Simple, warm humor. No forced meme's here. Just an A.I called M.O.M who gives you a smile at all the right moments.\n- Meaningfull upgrades to your character. As you collect crystals, you get small upgrades that feels worthwhile and empowering.\n- Relaxing ambient background music. This game is the best stress killer ever.\n- Exciting tension. You constantly need to stay on your toes or you'll fall. This creates excitement all the way to your stomach.\n- Explore. It's a simple and beautiful world with lots of small floating islands, with caves, funges and cute/creepy animals.\n\nBAD:\n- Too few levels. It took me 7 hours to complete *EVERYTHING* in the game, except for some steam achievements. That length is perfect for one level, but a little short for a whole game. MORE PLEASE! I'LL HAPPILY PAY!\n- Boring reward for completing the last challenge. I won't spoil, but I had hoped for something more than... that.\n\nAll in all the price you pay is close to nothing compared to the adventure you get in return. This is ubisofts mario and they have done a hell of a good job.\n\nSo all there is to say: MORE LEVELS UBISOFT! PLEASE!!\n\n","February 21, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where shall I start? I'll go with the art design first: Wonderful, despite the game not having the most detailed models the game looks great. The low model quality was either put in for technical reasons(the draw distance is lets you see pretty much the entire map) or for nostalgia. Either way I love it.\n\nThe next thing is the controls. Walking around is the standard WASD controls until you start climbing. You can hold on to objects with your left or right and which are both controlled by their respective left or right mouse buttons(or triggers if your using a controller). When you boot up the game it says the game is best played with a controller but I play the entire thing beginning to end with a mouse and ran into no problems.\n\nNext is the level design. This game is very much based around exploration. Throughout the game you can collect power crystals which will power up your robot depending on how many you have(it unlocks the upgrades automatically). Some crystals are there for you to see clear as day but others depend on you looking in every nook and cranny discovering other amusing secrets as well. As you get closer to the crystals you'll hear a shimmering sound.\n\nThere is little to no story(from what I can gather.) You're a robot tasked with getting the seeds of the star plant to save earth. To get the seeds you must grow the plant until it blooms at 2000 meters up. Thats pretty much it.\n\nThe music is nice and peaceful, nothing too exciting but it keeps the game from feeling too lonely.\n\nThe one criticism I could give this game is the length. I beat the game in like 3 hours while only taking a little extra time to find some of the crystals. A speed runner could probably beat the game in 1-2 hours, a person going for 100% could probably beat it in 6-7 hours. I feel like the $8 price tag gives you your money's worth but who knows, maybe you'll want to wait until its on sale.\n\nThis game has filled a niche for me I never even knew I wanted. I crave to play a game like this that can deliver the same wonder and fun that this has in the same way an addict craves his next shot. If you know of one I'd love to know but I'm yet to find it. The year has only just begun but this is already a strong contender for my GOTY.","February 21, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elSticko/recommended/323320/","elSticko","Mother Hen Poulet elSticko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elSticko/","952 products in account","I've just completed "it"... ill get to that... what "it" actually is.\n\nFirst, id like to start by congratulating Ubisoft for the first time since Rayman Origins, this is what happens when you set a small group of passionate people loose to run wild. Leashes and chains never produce great work.\n\nFundamentally "it" is a 3D platformer, a genre that doesn't seem to get enough attention as of late. Usually when i hear of a modern 3D platformer, I think of rehashed Mario games and terrible animated film tie-ins, Your choice is Nintendo or bust. Then comes along Grow Home, RKOing outtanowhere, when you find a video for the first time (Yes Ubisoft, ON YOUTUBE, you know, where you get truck loads of advertising for minimal cost, kinda feels like no one has told you triple A lot yet) "it" looks janky, the animations are odd but... the colours\n\nStarting to look almost fun, this little poorly animated stick robot runs about clinging on to walls and abusing physics;\n"So now he's riding a plant?! alright... grab my wallet"\n\n"It" does not disappoint.\n\nThe Central Mechanic is arguably simplicity. Using a controller: right/left sticks move/look,  jump on A, item on Y, non-pause menu selecting on X, pretty average and simple. Now we have the shoulder buttons, Hand right on RT and RB, hand left on LT and LB, with this you can grab on to almost any surface or object, simple.\n\nAfter a little time with "it" you begin to realize the possibilities created by hand control, exploring its uses in a variety of ways, you discover this simple 3D platformer is actually a rich 3rd person free running/climbing/falling adventure, it's unbelievable. You can wall run, then learn to use one arm to grab and pendulum yourself upwards a little, put them together and you'll be running horizontal along steep cliffs faster than you could ever climb across, that just one example. You can flip in the air, you can control flight with your jetpack, you can jump climb. 9 hours in and I'm still learning new things regularly, all with one simple control scheme and one simple little robot on one simple little mission. But Ill move on to other things as i would not want to spoil the exploration part of "it"\n\nGraphically its simple, until seen in action. Blocky objects, blocky terrain, blocky robot, blocky chickens, everything is pointy, bright, colourful and made of triangles, its all very Vectrex (give yourself a medal for getting that one,) bad lighting, bad shading, it goes on. But taking a step back suddenly it all fits, it looks... f*ck, "it" looks good! Plants sway and ping around when grabbed,  B.U.D, our little simpleton robot is animated on the fly. Legs dangling, arms flailing madness, he is adorable. The faint glow and hum of collectables is both useful and beautiful. Simple to no soundtrack, a static feed back loop, crashing rocks, grabbing hands and the occasional animal noise is all your ears have for company ... "it" is gorgeous in its simplicity.\n\nThen there's the giant plant, vine slowly ascending. this plant is the reason i use the term "it", because "It" isn't quite a game. "It" is a masterpiece begging for our own personal signatures.\n\nSee you all 20 kilometers up","March 2, 2015","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I somewhat took a liking to its art style and found the basic gameplay idea fairly intriguing, so I went ahead and bought the game.\nAnd man, the game is really really fun and definitely something different. While being published by Ubisoft there is no need for UPlay and it also has steam achievement support (unlike certain other ubisoft games).\n\nSo in the game you play a little robot called BUD which is supposed to explore new planets and also make its way home to its mothership. To do so he has to make this huge plant grow even bigger, so he eventually and literally grows his way home.\n\nIt's a really nifty and fun game and certainly worth it's price if you're up for some exploring.\n\nI am also doing a little series about the game on youtube (mind you I am just starting out, so the overall quality of my videos is probably not sooo good... but I'm trying to improve!), and I think the following video captures the spirit of the game quite nicely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK0MzzVFxGc","February 14, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mostly because I enjoy exploring and collecting, along with a decent story. It features a very well executed climbing system but does get a bit jaunty at times, although it adds alot of fun and the character, BUD's unpredicable and finicky movements make it fun to traverse the bright and low-poly world. This game however is unique as most games have you explore across certain area(s) but this makes you explore upward into the sky, and most of the time you make your own paths around completely blank parts of the sky by linking and creating paths yourself from the main plant by jumping red stems which you can ride around and control their growth. The goal is to grow the main plant up to the mothership (M.O.M) to blossom it and retrieve a 'star seed' to take back home. To do this you must control and drive these red stems into floating islands throbbing with energy to leech out of and aid growth of the main plant.\nDuring all of this, there are 100 collectable glowing energy crystals scattered throughout the game which with every 20, 40 and so on of these gives you progressively better and more unique items and abilities.\nAs a conclusion, I recommend this game to fans of exploration and ones looking for a more unique and new experience.\n8.7/10","February 14, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a rather different game from Ubi's usual output that doesn't follow a formula, wasn't made by a team of thousands and actually tries to do some new things.\n\nOh and it's a proper Steam game with no Uplay at all.\n\nAll in all, probably the best Ubisoft game of the year. :)\n\nBut yeah, it's really good, check it out.","February 14, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed the atmosphere and the idea that while some aspects of the game are the same for everyone, each player builds their own world while growing a giant plant to the mothership.

Its cartoony and is a great break from the dark or shooter atmosphere of most games. Its very simplistic but makes up for the lack of objectives with a short but interesting plot and lots of fun! Its pretty short and can be beaten in a day but there is so much to do and explore that you'll be playing long after you comeplete the game.

You are a robot which is put on an alien planet in order to grow a plant to 2000 meters. And that's about it. The game is simple and the story is kept to a bare minimum but it's really relaxing. The game play revolves around climbing, floating, and jet packing.\n\nThat being said, the controls are a bit floaty and you never feel like you have total control over the character. There was a time I got stuck in the terrain which was weird.\n\nOverall, it’s a really good game and fun to play.
