From the moment I started playing Bit Shifter, my mind felt like it was playing a classic N64 game but on my PC. It should be noted I mean that in the most praising of terms. The graphics, the gameplay, the controls, all feel wonderful and fun in this hybrid of Action/Strategy game. The mission is simple, clean out the virus by battling your way across the battlefield using soldiers, turrets, and other power ups such as bombs. Your soldiers clean the virus but cannot defend themselves, which leaves only you and towers to defend them. Needless to say Bit Shifter is a game that constantly keeps you busy. You're always fighting a battle on multiple encroaching fronts, this is what makes the game exciting and difficult. Throw in some bonus levels such as a collectathon and occasional boss fights and this game captures everything I would want in a game. It should be noted that for an Early Access game, Bit Shifter is very well put together and hardly has any bugs to speak of. This means the game has more room to grow in the features department, adding hopefully a little bit more complexity. Maybe different ship types, deeper customization, multiplayer, soldier types, more enemies, more powers. These idea would take already a great game and bring it up even higher. That being said, if you bought the game now and it never changed, that would be perfectly okay. The game is simple to grasp and becomes exciting and hectic fairly quickly. So if you are in the market for some fun, quick action that has a good mix of retro and modern designs. Check out Bit Shifter.\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/hQoZMYzw-6Y\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","November 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

How well does it hold up?\n\nSurprisingly well actually, for an early access game anyhow.\n\nSo what is bit shifter. Well, imagine a world where everything is a pc part, program or tech pun(Reboot if you will). Now imaging you are a firefighting drop ship constantly flying around dealing with varius "fires" in the form of a Virus. On a base level, this seems very very simple, but it's really not. See your ship itself is  faily poor at dealing with these fires, but some of the equipment you carry with you are exceptional at dealing with this fire. One of those are little robots called bits that are exceptional at cleaning up the fire.\n\nBit Shifter is a game of pacing and resource management more so than anything. Anticipating where virus will spread to and stopping it before it makes you lose the level(by reaching  a massive river of data). Having your bitsa at the right place at the right time as well as having the right gear is very important.\n\nSo, what's wrong or needs fixed?\n\nWell, the options menu is a  bit on the lacking side. The game supports a wide array of resulotion options  as well as draw distance, but nothing else. However it does have a colorblind mode, which I'm sure folks will appreciate. Maybe add more video options down the line would be nice. There is also some kind of  window minimizing UI bug in the game currently, but it only really occurs at the end of stages or when messing with options. The team is  currently trying to fix it.\n\nThe sound track is hit or miss, it doesn't personally bother me but techno/dubstep like beats is not everyones flavor of tea. Personal mileage may vary.\n\nThe game has entirely rebind-able keyboard controls and to its credit they work exceptionally well. However the only game pad it seems to support right now is the 360 pad, which is not rebind-able. The game also does not seem to support Logitech game pads at the moment as both of  mine had an absolute fit when using them IE buttons not working and the analog stick suddenly becoming the fire control. I would like to see more gamepad controls in the future, possibly more supported gamepads since I have dainty little girl hands and hate the over-sized behemoth that is the 360 pad with every fiber of my being.\n\nSo other nitpicks; the game looks fairly dated, but that is to be expected since well, indie game. The game looks like it would easily run on someones phone or a late ps1/early ps2 game. It doesn't really bother me  since I review far uglier games on a daily basis and the graphics are at least very clean. They don't get in the way of you doing your job and glitches are infrequent(such as bits walking through buildings for example).\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is  the lack of variety in enemies. The enemy that you will encounter the most are these little robot octorocks (at least that's what I call them) That spawn along the the path the virus takes/will take and attempt to shoot you down. On some stages these alone will be the bane of your existence, especially when in clusters of 4 or more. Other times not so much. They don't shoot all that fast, you can strafe slower than molasses on a  cold day and still dodge most of their fire and the damage they do when harassing your bits is pitiful; almost to the point where you can cheese them entirely by just fire and forgetting your bits, then swooping in and refiring them when they are damaged.\n\nThe game could definitely use some air to air harassment, say a corrupted scandisk(your ships name, told you it was punny) that attacks you on sight and harasses your bits. Making bis a little less godly might help as well since they can take an absolute mauling and still do their job incredibly well, often cleaning up large chunks of virus before the Stormtrooper aimlike octorocks eventually knock them over.\n\nMy other minor problem is the game is  on the short side, 20 stages and 1 boss stage which clocks in at around 3 hours on normal and maybe 5 to 8 hours on the hardest difficulty depending on personal operator headspace.\n\nSo is it worth your time and money is the real question. Well, yes. Personally the novel idea alone nearly carries the whole game in itself. The game is  not  perfect by any means, but it doesn't have to be. Fast paced gameplay, varied levels, personal gear loadouts and  collectible stuff for the super completionist out there all make for an enjoyable is a bit short experience.\n\nI will say this though, it's a damn solid first try by this development team and easily light years ahead of all the zombie apocalypse crafting survival "we buy/steal our assets!" crap that SOMEHOW keeps getting through greenlight ahead of far more novel and original games.\n\nThe developer has also stated they are planning on adding more content to the game and I'm intrigued as to where the game will go from here, but even now, it's a very solid  first try.\n\nPs: I did a video review which you can find here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPwywbzFaZE however be warned that I am very thorough with my reviews and may take a bit longer on the options menu than most.","November 2, 2015","true","2.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The "Virus Warning" is an alarm sound that comes up with an icon, one that appears at the location the Virus will infect the Data Stream at. If the Virus spreads to the Data Stream, it's game over.\nSo, I'd quickly go over to the warning location, and fend off the Virus. Me doing this when I get the Virus Warning at the location I was originally at.\nI had to really learn how to zigzag my strategy, and keep bursts short.\n\nThe game has unlockable lore which is amusing. It has some explanations of different Logic Gates, in accordance to an electronic/robotic society.\n\nI hope this game does well, and that they'll keep improving it.\n\nI had done mainly the highest difficulty, so my perspective is one of the game being intense.\nOn the lower difficulties, the arcade factor of this game really stands out, and is less strategy demanding.\n\nI had only upgraded my Weapon Power, and my favorite strategy was to only get the Turrets.\nI enjoy abusing minor features, and that's simply my play style.\n\nI don't need to upgrade my shields if I simply better my dodging ability.\nSo, I went for killing enemies in less hits.\n\nThat's it on my end.","November 2, 2015","true","10.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You are "Flash Bios", a pilot that must fight the virus in a series of increasingly harder missions while flying a "scandisc" (ship), with the primary goal of preventing the virus from reaching the main data stream.  One of your primary resources are your deployable "bits" that fight the virus on the battleground of the circuit board while you fight using a growing arsenal of other tools aboard your ship while supporting and defending your bits.\n\nMany games that came through greenlight have a good concept, but even after evolving never reach beyond "amateur" quality.  Bit Shifter easily exceeds that status, having solid core gameplay elements and the relatively well polished feel that is causing some players to mention their favorite N64 or Playstation games.  Plastic Games started with a goal closer to the retro look and feel of 16 bit gaming.  The current state has gone beyond that look, but still maintains a somewhat retro look and feel.\n\nI have not completed the game, and may eventually update my review with a simple list of pros and cons, but so far it's just been a fun pastime.  As the game is still in early access I will post a couple of other constructive observations.  For one, the music is alright, but I would enjoy some options.  The controls work well for me, but as a mouse and keyboard player I am not entirely comfortable with flying my ship in the default settings.  Most notably I would  recommend players resetting the up (space bar) and down (Q) keybinds.\n\nI sometimes experience a slight but noticeable "hang" in the loading screens before a mission, and the developer quickly responded to my bug report to indicate that they are aware of this.  It has not been a game killer at all.  I have completed 17 missions thus far during several game sessions, and on one occasion the screen did hang and crashed me to desktop, but this has never occurred within an actual mission, where I've yet to have any issues.\n\nI have so far found the game play to be relatively simple in depth, but as I said, good action/strat fun of an old school type, and I've already played this game longer than most any green light graduate.  Well done Plastic Games, keep up the good work!","November 4, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heartsensei/recommended/393170/","heartsensei","BrainBoy20","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heartsensei/","126 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThank you for downloading the Bit Shifter Antivirus program. We will begin your comprehensive PC sweep in a few moments... Welcome to this little gem called Bit Shifter. This is a 3D RTS with RPG elements and a simple concept. You take bits, and you shift them. The only thing complicating this is a virus that spreads across the code in an effort to corrupt the primary data streams. It also produces tumor-like octopod offshoots, and other such organic unpleasantness, that blast your bits to pieces. Thankfully, your bits come with AOE anti-virus programs for just such an occasion. You, also, pilot the scandisc which can cut and paste the anti-virus programs around the source code and can delete small portions itself. It also downloads additional tools and updates as the scandisc removes bugs. The code that shows the scandisc in action is a little rough, but it can be described as retro with some organic technology mixed in. Finally, the scandisc even plays a wonderful techno soundtrack when it annihilates some nasty code. Overall, I rate Bit Shifter highly and deem it worth it's 15 dollar price point. However, the sale was a nice hook.","April 5","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
