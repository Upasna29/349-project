Even thought I had whishlisted it for a long time and expected a lot.\n\nThe beginning starts quite well. The base of the plot is well... not very original but one can feel it could get interesting.\n\nAlso, the graphics isn't bad -- even though everything is 1024 capped with 4/3 aspect ratio, but I don't mind.\n\nBut then you start to notice the very bad voice acting, the clumsy gameplay where you basically have to go back and forth in countless areas just to get an item that you couldn't pick earlier...\n\nTalk to this guy, go there, pick item, come back to the guy, new dialog is unlocked, etc.\nAlright that's like the basics of adventures games, but for this game this is really a waste of time.\nAll of that is made to make the game longer. Really.\n\nThe gameplay was so pointless that at the middle of the game I started to use a walkthrough just to PLAY the game instead of wandering aimlessly everywhere just to find a piece of paper or a piece of grass (yeah, true story) or whatnot. I just wanted the story to continue.\n\nAlso, the closer you get towards the end of the game and the less detailed everythings gets.\nYou cannot click on random stuff anymore and have your character comment on it, or having nice description of the surrounding. I believe even the music is gone too near the end. Even though it wasn't that great in the first chapters, it was still a little bit immersive.\n\nAnd, when the end of the game comes, we can saddly notice that everything has been rushed. The story falls appart and then comes dissapointement.\n\nHowever there are some dialogues and comments that are kinda funny.\nThere is a little bit of humour in that game that will make you laugh for sure.\n\nBut yeah... no I cannot recommend this game.","January 11, 2014","false","9.2"," 172 of 193 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","172","193","0","1"

Really? That was it? WTF!" That's pretty much the reaction you'll have at the end of the game. The story isn't very engaging and by the time you get any sort of meat to sink your teeth into, it ends. You get a few solid plot nuggets throughout the game which ultimately go unresolved leaving you unsatisfied and wondering what the point of it all was in the first place. Honestly, it feels as though they had unfinished 3 plot concepts squished them together and hoped for the best.\n\nWell, at least it was a challenge and fun to play right? Nope... It encapsulates one of the most reviled characteristics of the classic point and click adventure games. In order to progress through an obvious puzzle you first have to interact with something 10 screens away so that the option then becomes available. The constant backtracking, the inability to collect stuff without you'll obviously need before interacting with something unnecessary and the occasional pixel hunt make the game play nearly insufferable.\n\nThe sad thing is, despite the game having a largely unfinished feel... Actually, I think it's safe to say it is unfinished. The art work is actually pretty good. Some of the sub plots are fairly dark and interesting, even though most of the story is just hinted at, and no real plot is there. This game could have really had potential but it is ultimately doomed by a clear disinterest in actually finishing it.\n","April 6, 2014","false","8.1"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","44","57","0","1"

The story and the atmosphere are both good, although I have to agree with other reviewers that there are some elements that seem unfinished (pretty sure more was meant to happen with  the cat outside the apartment , for example). I liked the setting of a dystopian Prague, since I also know and like the city. The voice acting is decent. but as others have said,  the game's ending leaves many questions unanswered  and this is a slight disappointment.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend it for the atmosphere, decent graphics and decent voice acting.

I thought the graphics were great. Dystopian society story, love it! Voice acting was annoying at times but not too terrible. The reason this game gets the thumbs down is the ending. The story is really interesting, the climax is exciting, and then the ending....just kills it. It feels as if the company ran out of budget and couldn't flesh out the story any more, because after you are really getting into the the story and uncovering lots of stuff, the ending basically tells you, "well thats all we can do for now, we better disappear before the bad guys discover us." Thats it. It screams sequel! Sadly, I don't think a sequel has been announced so this game is a gigantic cliffhanger.

Firstly, the game crashes a lot. This can be remedied by running in as an admin, but the game will still however crash sometimes during cutscenes (which it did  during the bloody ending credts).\n\nSome puzzles are nonsensical (the very first for example) and  a lot of the time lacks any clear hints about what you need to do. This could be down to a poor translation, but some of the solutions are just down to bad game design. Does the story make up for this?\nNo....Not even a little.\nTheres an interesting Distopian setting presented here, but its wasted on a plot that travels so fast, that the story itself isnt even fleshed out. There was a twist at one point, that Im guessing was supposed to be dramatic, but as a player you werent given enough background to actually care. As other reviewers have mentioned, the game end on an abrupt note, and feels very unfinished. If the plot was good, I would complain, but I was just happy it was over.\n\nGraphics and voice acting can always be forgiven, bad puzzles and narrative however, cannot.\n\nAvoid, and go play a game published by Wadget Eye instead","November 4, 2015","false","8.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Playing it I often had the feeling that the game could have been much more than what it eventually became.\n\nTechnically, it isn't perfectly top notch, but solid. Character animations and voice acting are at times a little wooden, but that isn't a huge problem; the animations are about on par for an adventure, the English dubbed voice action leaves a bit to be desired, which is a bit of a missed chance.\nArtistically there is a huge plus in terms of the scenes. Even with very few characters the scenes come to life with detail. From derelict slums to high class modern facilities the artwork is convincing and draws one in. Unfortunately the writing of the story itself isn't on the same level, in my opinion: the story leaves very little room to actually explore the interesting world of AlternativA, the plot points sometimes feel a little bit forced (if not to say in some cases: random). Slight spoiler:  Also the ending leaves a lot of open questions and unresolved issues\nGameplay-wise AlternativA unfortunately drops the ball. Some puzzles are logical and straight-forward, some a little tricky. Annoyingly, though, they quite often involve a lot of pixel-hunting. More than once I have been thinking of solutions to problems, which eventually came down to 'pick up the exact object you are looking for that happens to be lying on the floor with no satisfactory explanation'. Another gameplay problem is how one is often forced to traverse back and forth between the scenes. The scenes may be beautiful, but crossing through six screens just for a single line of dialogue before you go back six screens is just a nuisance.\n\nIn conclusion AlternativA is not remarkable game set in a remarkable and original world. I can't recommend it due to its flaws, but it is worth looking at nonetheless.","January 5, 2015","false","6.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

During some points of the dialog, you can literally hear the actors beginnning to smack their lips in order to start the sentence. Similarily, the plot is virtually non-existent, and you spend the entire game searching for one specific piece of plot. There is no character development whatsoever, with all of the characters being static. Finally, the actual gameplay elements of this point-and-click "adventure" game are lacking. Specifically, there are specific actions that you cannot perform unless you examine a particular object before hand, causing you to backtrack in a very linear manner. Not to mention that the graphics look like they are from 2002 because of the limitations from the engine the game uses.\n\nThe bottom line: view some of the screenshots people have posted in order to get a feel for the aesthetics, but don't buy the game.","March 19, 2014","false","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Often, you will not be able to interact with an item until you look at it first, or until you examine something else nearby, or until your character decides they now have a story-based reason to pick it up.  It makes sense from a realism perspective - normal people don't carry around extra junk just because it may come in handy later - but from a gameplay perspective it makes for a lot of pointless backtracking and frustration.  I almost couldn't get past the start of the game because I missed examining the right barrel.  If you are careful and attentive, though, you shouldn't have too much trouble.\n- One or two of the puzzle solutions make no sense, even in hindsight.  Just try everything in your inventory, and eventually something will work.\n- A few times during the game, your character does not have quite enough information to complete the task at hand, and you will need to resort to wasting time with trial and error until you get it right.\n- At one point during a dream sequence, my game glitched and the screen went black for several minutes.  After trying a few things, I found that pressing ESC allowed me to jump past the glitch and continue on.\n- The subtitles are sometimes drastically different from what is being spoken by the characters.  Also, can we talk about the terrible Spanish?\n\nThe ugly:\n- The ending feels rushed, contrived, and vacuous compared to the rest of the game.  You could tell there was so much more they wanted to do with the story, but they simply didn't have time to implement it.  The game really needed another chapter, or a sequel, to finish what they started.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential, and I think it's a shame that they didn't take the time to playtest it a bit more, to fully develop the story's conclusion, and to have an editor give it a final once-over.  Honestly, with a bit more TLC, most of the problems could have easily been resolved, and I would have given it high marks across the board.  As is, I would have to give it an overall rating of 6.5/10.","December 4, 2014","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The plot is set at a futuristic-corporate world where there are two major companies, and "The State". The protagonist finds himself involved in a conspiracy that somehow relates to his past.\nThe plot and characters are not particulary interesting, and at times even weak. The puzzles are either too easy, or make no sense. At other times, much pixel hunting is involved.\nWithout spoiling the "end", AlternativA's end cuts the plot in several too short scenes that doesn't really give an appropriate (or sensible) ending. It ends with half a plot, with gaping holes, and nothing is explained.\nAll in all, weak story, weak gameplay. Half-decent atmosphere.\nNot recommended","March 12, 2015","false","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It had great potential and the graphics were OK for a point-and-click game.  I just couldn't get over the fact that everything you do feels like a time sink.  Everything happens a bunch of screens away requiring you to travel from one screen to the next, then back, and back, and there and somewhere else then back to where you started to get past a certain point.  Then you start again with the next puzzle.  It became tedious and boring.","February 6, 2015","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has soooo many bugs and flaws.  The game crashed a number of times.  On one occasion the character walked off into the distance and vanished into the backdrop!\n\nAnyway, here's a breakdown:\n\nStory.\n\nThe tone of the story is quite dark and depressing as is much of the post apocalyptic setting.  The plot is heavy and a challenge to keep up with with precious few lighter moments.\n\nVisuals\n\nOverall not bad.  Locations nice and detailed.  Character animation isn't great and makes you wince when they move in an unnatural way.\n\nGenerally, the game accurately filled the widescreen resolution.  However, despite playing with the inbuilt game settings the start menu didn't and I couldn't be sure if this was just by design.\n\nThe cut sequences were glitchy.  A few times, the horizontal black bars that indicate you're leaving gameplay and entering a cut sequence actually got in the way of the video and also didn't fill the screen correctly.\n\nGameplay.\n\nItems to interact with are kept limited to avoid pixel hunting which is appreciated.  However, the flow of the game is hindered by non linear decision making.  For example, if you know what the next move is and you attempt to do it the game will stop you until you've read your PDA entry that acknowdeges you REALLY REALLY know what the next move is........ very frustrating at first until you know that's how the game works.  On the flip side, at the end of the game you're given the challenge of choosing a search word in a database without the aid of your PDA which contains all your notes and personal database............... come on!  If like me you've played the game over several sessions, a memory aid would be appreciated.\n\nVoice acting.\n\nMediocre....... but I've heard worse.\n\nWhen, oh when, will developers realise that a game can stand or fall on the strength of its voice actors being in the same sound recording studio at the same time reading the same script together, reacting to each other's tone, body language, etc.  Otherwise, all you get is very disjointed monologuing (is that even a word??), as per this game.\n\nI'm sorry to put such a downer on this one.  I do try hard to reflect the positives but unfortunately there just isn't enough to get excited about here.","February 18, 2015","false","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one would have been okay without it (if you don't mind making poorer something already quite poor) as the quality of voice acting is a disservice to the overall quality.\n\nI tried to finish it but gave up due to lack of interest, I couldn't even bring myself to watching a walkthrough to rocket through the game or even to know how it ends.\n\nSorry but that's a 30/100 here","October 18, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be warned that this game feels unfinished and there are major consistency issues with quality of puzzles and story pace . Also there are glitches that can potentially force you to start over if you not doing objectives in a certain order .\n\nIt could have been a great game but it just feels like they did not have the funds to do it right . I enjoyed it but you have to play it with very forgiving attitude . I am sure people were angry buying this game for $20 but if you get it under $4 its not that bad .\n\nThe best part of this game is definitely visual design which is why I bought this game despite low user scrore . I like the fixed backgrounds which reminds me old Resident Evil games .For what it is the game does look above average considering that most point click games are limited to 2D and have no trailers .\n\nUnfortunatly the voice acting (translation) of main character is out of place and ruins the tension in atmosphere which hurts this game more than anything else .Its hard to appreciate dark tone of the game when main character's voice lacks emotional range . Although some of the other characters are voiced much better and I have enjoyed few moments .\n\nI have to say that overall interface and controls are pretty decent .  You may run into few instances where action detection is a bit off but for the most I have no problem with the way game plays .\n\nPuzzles are resonably enjoyable . There were a few really stupid solutions that didn't make sense but there are some creative choices as well that made me feel rewarded . However because game feels somewhat rushed I think it makes it harder to appreciate the story .\n\nGame also features dead ends where you can die by picking wrong text answers and if you want make it harder you can play on harder mode that limits your tries . Sometimes you may want to pick wrong answer just to see what happens ;)\n\nOverall I think game is decent (just not $10+ decent) . Most people will probably hate it but if you open minded gamer you might notice some inretesting and creative ideas .\n\nScore : 6/10 . It had some potential but overall the pace of the story,glitches and rushed parts made it feel like unfinished mess .","May 13","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
