The game breaks entirely by day 31, and even though I had only made one film by that point, I really was not totally upset by not having to play any more. The game lacks any real feedback on what makes good combinations for the most part and the lack of customisation is extremely disappointing. For example, I decide to make a film set in the Stone Age, but there are no Stone Age themed characters. Then at day 31, the game shows a pop-up that regenerates infinitely. It is quite incredible how disappointing this turned out to be. Then there is the fact that the game required me to install an additional application just to run which I was not expecting and it is extremely poorly translated in places. These issues and the droning music barely seem worth mentioning in comparison to the abject awfulness of the main game. Spend that money on almost anything else.","April 2, 2015","false","2.2"," 48 of 63 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","48","63","0","1"

Unfortunatly when starting it says to put your name in player 1 i do that and i cant see what im typing untill i hit enter then it shows the name. so i start the game and inside the game when i try to look through menu's ect or pick from the list to put people or things in the movie i cant read anything in the bubbles where the options should be they are blank. so i have to pick blind? and an then maybe see what i have picked after its to late. this makes the game uplayable.  anyone know how to fix that?\n\nhmm toying around with things i went to the steam file an loaded it up in the win mode it give and can actually see the text unfortunatly its in window mode and id rather play in full screen. but yes mine also wouldnt go past day 31 either","April 2, 2015","false","4.9"," 48 of 69 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","48","69","6","3"

First of all, I'm fan of tycoons, strategies and simulation games. I have never disliked a tycoon game before.\nBut this one, it just doensn't have a clear goal. You must choose scene after scene (there are a lot of them) prep it all, but the results are the same if you did it on the auto mode, pick only the first and last scene and let it roll.\nThere's no fun or strategy in that. If I could, I would try to get a refund for the first time in my life. Yes, it's that bad.","June 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has a very interesting premise: you're a director and you need to claw your way to the top of the Hollywood hierarchy, but it doesn't deliver. I've only played for a short time but in that short time, it has become obvious that the gameplay is repetitive, unexciting and dull. Your money is better spent on Video Game Tycoon or another more interactive tycoon game.","May 26, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It does not work properly and not one patch since his release. Single german developer who we talked with when the game released, has apparently decided to take the money he made and ran or take a permanent ♥♥♥♥ on society and fans.  Either way, the only safe assumption since it sold very well, and since... critckets or farts in the wind... is all we know.... he had a great thing, and kind of as it stands now in 11/14/2015 total garbage now. So this guy is in need of a good fonging!\nNever even completed the English translations either. Sad again.
