You cannot gain an in-game advantage by paying $$$. Half of the catalog can be earned without paying real money by levelling up your classes and doing achievements.\n\n"Long waiting times in lobby, takes forever to find/start a match"\nThis problem has been solved in the latest patch with the addition of an actual matchmaking system. The lobby now has a time limit (Forced start after 4 min).\n\n"This game requires voice chat."\nThere is a voice and signal command system accessed by pressing the V key that allows you to give a variety of commands spoken by voice actors. Voice chat is no longer required, especially if you are an Engineer or Gunner as you most of the time you receive commands instead of giving them.\n\n"New players are stomped by experienced players."\nTrue. However there are new player-only matches that cannot be entered by experienced players. New players are automatically put into these matches, although they may opt out of them. Also, the new matchmaking system is effective in avoiding stomp matches as long as there are enough players online.\n\n"Balanced matches are hard to find."\nThis problem has been solved in the latest patch with the addition of an actual matchmaking system, except when there are less than 50 players online.\n\n"Poor graphics."\nIt's actually quite good for Unity graphics. There is 12x AA, water reflections, real-time shadows, dynamic lighting and a post-processing filter available.\n\n"Laggy FPS."\nThis is usually caused by unexpected bugs in new patches that are quickly fixed.\n\n"Laggy Ping."\nLow ping is not required to play this game since it is not a twitch shooter. I live in Hong Kong and regularly play with no issues on US servers (150ms ping) and EU servers (350ms+ ping).\n\n"Huge rebalancing between patches."\nUPDATE 1.4.1: Flamer/Carronade nerf (Most frustrating/Most OP gun) :) No huge rebalancing (only slight) for other stuff. Meta shift because of Stamina and not because of nerf/buff.\n\n"Shallow game, no strategy or skill required."\nThis is like saying Counter-Strike is shallow and requires no strategy or skill because it is a game about shooting back at enemies on de_dust2. In fact Guns of Icarus not only has a lot of high-level strategic depth, it also gives many opportunities for players to show off and excel with their mechanical skills. Examples of high-level play include ship positioning, flanking, ship loadouts, and min/maxing of engineering efficiency and gun damage. Examples of mechanical skills include engineering parkour tricks, reactionary piloting, and using hard-to-aim or long-range guns.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK9hOU92chE\n\n\nThe game's long-time competitive community (going all the way back to beta) is a testament to the depth that this game actually has.\n\n"Lack of new gameplay content."\nUPDATE 1.4.1: New gun, STAMINA SYSTEM!, Steam Workshop hooked up. CO-OP MODE IN PLAYTESTING, IT'S LEGIT BOYZ!\n\n"Game gets boring."\nIf you like the game, appreciate its strategic depth, play with the mindset of improving yourself or simply find and play with friends, you'll discover this game's longevity in the same way people have played Counter-Strike or DotA for a decade.\n\n"The community is horrible."\nThis question needs to be answered in two parts: trolls and the actual community:\n\n1) Trolls are introduced every time this game is on sale. Since they only buy the game to troll around, they leave after a week or two to troll the next multiplayer game on sale.\n\n2) I won't deny that a sizeable portion of this community is made up of largely veterans, or that a precious few veterans can get extremely elitist, abusive and salty towards new players. However these people are quite rare and are drowned out by a mass of helpful and friendly players that are happy to help cooperative newbies.\n\n"The game is dead (no one playing)."\nhttp://steamcharts.com/app/209080\nConcurrent players (off sale) peak at around 300. Most players play in American and European timezones. UPDATE 1.4.1: Still hitting 300-400 on weekends, 250+ on weekdays.\n\n"No Australian servers."\nUPDATE JUNE 2015: Oceania Servers are REAL now!\n\n\n"No co-op/VS bots mode."\nThis is in the works for 2015. The co-op mode has already been demoed at PAX 2014 as recently as September. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACr0aUNSXoY UPDATE 1.4.1: IT'S IN PLAYTESTING, HYPE\n\nNow for the review:\n\nWhat should I know before playing: This game requires a lot of teamwork. Individual skill is rarely enough to win a match. Not listening to the captain's order or recommendations, running around the ship instead of cooperating with your fellow crew and leaving your allies to die while you try and fly past the edge of the map is not fun for anyone. It will only cause your ship to die over and over again while your team loses in five minutes.\n\nThis game has a steep learning curve. While most of the game's basic knowledge can be grasped within a few matches, the intricacies of piloting, the efficiencies of engineering and the specifics of gunning will take you many deaths and many losses to get good at. Very few people have truly mastered everything the game has to offer even with thousands of matches in game (UPDATE 1.4.1 myself included, hit 2466 matches, I'm a god Engi but can improve pilot/gun).\n\n\nWhat's really good in this game: The requirement for teamwork combined with the setting and competitiveness of airships haphazardly wrecking each other makes for some truly magical highlight moments, as well as providing an environment that fosters communication and encourages friendships.\n\nThe game's high skill ceiling allows for continuous self improvement. It feels great to discover something new about the game, learn ways of maximising the efficiency of your ship, or find out how to beat a specific strategy and apply this knowledge in the next matches you play. As you cleverly circle into a Pyramidion's blind spot while you maintain your gun arcs, you smile as your recall how, once upon a time, you didn't know how to accel/decel (R/F btw).\n\nJK it isn't that romantic. In reality you'll just suffocate yourself laughing while you crush an enemy ship into a building as your teammate is burning them into a crisp.\n\nThe huge amount of possible combinations of ships and weapons makes sure that, most of the time, no two consecutive matches will have the exact same ships in play. Also, you can experiment with new load outs or strategies and feel awesome when they work.\n\n\nWhat's meh: Dealing with unresponsive teammates. In game that relies so heavily on teamwork, having crew members that refuse to change classes, take stupid loadouts and then steal the gunner's gun can get extremely frustrating.\n\nCrazy King. Crazy King games... UPDATE 1.4.1: Mode reworked, not a stallfest anymore, kills count for points, if u have more ships u can cap the point instead of having to kill all enemies.\n\nFlamethrowers. Playing with flamethrowers... UPDATE 1.4.1: Flamer nerf+Extinguisher buff+Carronade nerf, not frustrating anymore.\n\nAnalogy using another game: FTL, but your crew are real people.\n\nWould I recommend: 11/10 would fly again, especially once you make some in-game friends.\n\nThere is simply no where else to get Guns of Icarus Online's unique blend of teamwork, strategy, airship flying and crazy highlight moments.","December 20, 2014","true","910.5"," 897 of 920 people (98%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","98","897","920","54","34"

No matter how obvious I make my intentions, he insists on firing at random objects, be it a neutral bridge, a mountain, or our ally. I feel he's doing this in a petty attempt at attention.\n\nMy senior engineer will not repair a damn thing, and is passing off bad habits to the rookie. He insists on repairing guns we never use, refuses to put out fires, and never rebuilds the engines that he's let fall into disarray. I'm beggining to wonder if the man suffers from some undiagnosed mental illness.\n\nThe rookie, for his part, knows absolutely nothing.\n\nGunner's Log: Day 63\nMy captain is a horrible pilot, and never brings me in range of my targets, then insists that it is a result of my horrible aim and lack of attention. I'm half tempted to attempt a mutiny, to overthrow her tyrranical rule, but I know the engineers are too weak willed for such a task.\n\nOur senior engineer seems content to stare at our engines while they are on fire, rather than attempt to extinguish them, and it is horribly annoying. I'm getting the feeling that he doesn't wish to fly on this vessel, and is attempting to bring us all down with it.\n\nAs for the rookie, I'm getting extremely tired of having to reload my ammunition because he's replaced it with some obscure new bullet type.\n\nSenior Engineer's Log: Day 63\nMy captain is driving me insane. She has no empathy, and refuses to give me a commendation for my hard work. She expects me to be at every position at once, and will not hear it when I suggest we attempt to retreat for a few moments to repair our ship.\n\nThe gunner is being a jerk, as usual. He still doesn't believe that my fire extinguisher is broken, and won't stay at his gun while he has a perfectly good shot at the enemy. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ needs to stay at his own station, before he breaks something while attempting to fix it.\n\nThe rookie is useless. He never listens, and insists on trying to use guns that could not possibly be aimed at our opponents. Why am I always stuck with the incompetent crews?\n\nNovice Engineer's Log: Day 63\nAfter careful observation, I've concluded that nobody on this crew knows a damn thing about their job.","June 25, 2015","true","24.9"," 707 of 728 people (97%) found this review helpful 970 people found this review funny","97","707","728","970","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monstru_pufos/recommended/209080/","monstru_pufos","Il Mostro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monstru_pufos/","237 products in account","This game taught me one thing: Metacritic score is bullcr@p! It's an absolute gem with more than 95% of the reviews being positive, and what score do the critics give? 62/100? Are you serious?\n\nYes, it's still not as polished as TF2, let's say. Yes, it's somehow harder to wrap around it, to understand the mechanics (rather unique). Yes, there are bugs and there is an in-game store (purchases are purely cosmetic - like other games like TF2, CS:GO, DOTA2, etc.). But the GAMEPLAY is amazing.\n\nYou'll definetly need a microphone. You'll need good communication skills and hope to get an experienced captain (or become one). And then, you're set to go. It's loads of fun and it's worth it, both your time and money.\n\nPlay as one of these three classes : navigator (captain) - one per ship; engineer or gunner. Four guys on the same ship (captain's choice) form a crew. You'll repair and rebuild components, you'll shoot down other ships or just speed past them, you'll flank, you'll use flamethrowers and mines, you'll develop strategies with your allies and have the time of your life doing so. Even if you lose, cause defeat IS imminent. But when you taste the success, oh it will be SWEET!\n\nI see people giving negative reviews, but they've played for 1 or 2 hours. It took me 1 hour to finish the tutorial and 2-3 more hours to understand the game playing novice games. Yes, if there's no communication between crew, it's just a game where you run on the deck, hit things with your wrench and put out fires. The whole thing comes alive when you're communicating, when you're making strategies. It's that thrill when you're an engineer and your haul is down, but instead of repairing it you take the cannon and shoot the enemy, knowing you'll be able to bring him down first. It's that split-second decision that makes it thrilling. It's that pre-buffing that you put on your weapon that makes the difference. It's that able stearing that lets you evade or flank, hide just enough to repair or get on your enemy's blind spot with a flamethrower. And yes, you won't understand all these things after 3-4 hours of playing. There's a learning curve, but in the end it's worth it!\n\nAlso, people complaining about the "latest" Matchmaking system - it has been changed. Developers are trying to listen to the players and the community is fun and friendly (for the most part).\n\nSome later edits:\n1. Don't buy this game for your 4yo son / daughter. It actually requires some maturity and sense of responsability to be played. Please, just don't. Rather play it yourself.\n2. NO SPEAK ENGLISH - NO GOOD! Find someone that speaks your language to play with, don't jump into a random ship with people who can't understand you and who you can't understand and start wondering why you're losing all the matches.\n3. Respect more experienced players. If you're level 1-7, and all the enemy ships are high-level, you might lose the game for your team. It's frustrating for you and is frustrating for your teammates. Try to hop into balanced games for the best experience.\n4. Just wanted to say last Satuday I had the best time I've ever had on my computer, and it was playing this game. If you manage to make some friends in-game, chances are you'll bump into cool and funny guys. It's both the in-game jokes and the funny, weird ship-loadouts and strategies that shouldn't work yet they do that will make you not to want to go to bed (even if it's 5AM and you're working the next day).","October 24, 2014","true","741.8"," 774 of 806 people (96%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","96","774","806","40","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/recommended/209080/","femboyancy","♥Prince Vaxi♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/","510 products in account","Guns of Icarus Online, is by far one of the most promising games I've seen in several months.\n\nThe game takes place in a charming Steam Punk-ish, apparently post-nuclear world, where the few fractured remnants of the human race are battling for territory, and resources. The primary means of transportation over a barren, unforgiving world, littered with wrecks and ruins from an age long past, is by a type of Zepplin battleships, which are built out of spare parts and scraps from various wrecks found on the surface. The ones you experience in Guns of Icarus Online, are the military types, armed to the teeth with innovative, obviously home made weaponry, featuring lots of Gear wheels, and some greasy, messy technology.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe Gameplay, as far as I've experience, are primarily a type of Death Match. In a 2v2 match, where two ships are paired against another pair, and a 3v3, same thing, but much more expansive and difficult combat.\nThere are multiple ships to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses...Small and light? Large and Heavy? Armed to the teeth? Favoring defense? Somewhere in between? It all depends on the specific captains style, which is where the really exciting part of this game comes in.\n\nThis game is entirely unwinable without team work, and here's why:\n\nEach ship has a crew of 4 total players.\n\nThe standard layout of a ship's crew is as follows:\n1 Sailor(Commander)\nThis person is the Captain of the ship. He controls where the ship goes, at what speed, when, and how they attack, if they attack at all, and when its time to get the heck out. They also coordinate with other team captains to launch flank assaults. They order the rest of the crew, such as what parts of the ship needs repairs the most, and what guns should be manned in preparation for a broadside. The Commander is the backbone of the ship, and sports several utility/maneuvering abilities that can do everything from speed up the ship, to increase evasion and defenses(However, this wears on ship parts, and threatens to cripple the ship if used recklessly, demanding a Commander to be clever in his ability usage, to avoid stressing his crew)\n\n2 Engineers\nThe Engineer is the heart of the ship. Without engineers, the ship would rapidly become a floating heap of scrap metal, and fall apart within a few volleys of enemy fire. An engineer is the only means to which a ship can take a gigantic beating, and still remain functional. They also sport the ability to put out fires, and buffing the equipment temporarily to give defense boosts, minor speed boosts, and damage increase, depending on the parts they buff. An engineer needs to keep an incredibly cool head in a firefight, and always heed the call of his commander, lest he misses a vital repair on a ship part. Due to each part having a cooldown timer after being worked on, an engineer needs to be a professional 'schedule' keeper, and be able to keep a steady, constant rhythm to go from part to part to part, fixing them as required, and knowing when to break the schedule in favor of higher priority pieces(1 engine going out with 2 working, is not more important than a leaking balloon...Cause you drop to your death....)\n\n1 Gunner\nGunners are the tooth, claw, and nail of a ship. These battlehardened warriors of the clouds are the only means to laugh in the face of an enemy's fire and shoot back with a mighty old "IS THAT ALL YE GOT!?". They're hardened, vicious, merciless killers, who favor sitting down at a weapon station, and using their expert aim, and large arsenal of ammunition types, to unleash hell on their ship's enemies. A gunner's primary job is being entirely offensive, though they are equipped with a spanner in case their weapon should be destroyed, allowing them to atleast make it operational until an engineer comes around to bring it to full potential. A Gunner's best moment is when they know what ammo type to use in what situation, to out-damage their opponents with clever, innovative use of their chosen weaponry.\n\nThese together, make a ship, and the most cordinated, best tactically skilled ship comes out on top. It is 4 players, being forced to corporate as 1, collective player, fighting against another behemoth of a collective of players. Imagine the Commander being the brain, and the engineers/gunners being arms, legs, etc.\nThe game permits clans, even preset crews that you can join a match with, to create not just a single crew, but an entire navy, that you can take into battle.\n\nYou are of course fully capable of customizing your character(Or your ship, should you wish to be captain!), choosing which gender, what hairstyle, what ethnicity, and what fashion statement you wish them to display; Are you a noble sailor of the high clouds? Favoring honor and good sportsmanship, who dresses in proper naval uniform and behaves like a true man/woman of the royal navy? Or are you a pirate, the scoundrel of the skies? Do you dress in rough leather, cover your face in masks, and sport threatening hairstyles, spiked helmets, and a Jolly Rodger? or something completely your own concept!? It is up to your own personality, and more items are added regularly, to both customize ship AND character as you wish! (Dyes(for characters) and paints(For ships) are available as well!)\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics 'could' be better, but they are still very poweful, and are very demanding, even on the higher end rigs. My best advice, if you're having lag issues, is to turn off Post Processing, it increases your framerate dramatically, without losing too much fancy looks.\n\nAlso, you'll lag when there's fire. Get used to it!\n\nCommunity\nThis game's community demands to be of a different caliber than your average MMO. Due to the high level of maturity, and ability to take orders, as well as the demand for being able to have an ability to take the game seriously when fighting starts, the players who are trolling/refuse to accept orders, or simply do poorly and decide to screw around rather than play the game, thereby ruining the fun for the others? These people don't last long, as griefing/trolling is considered extremely tabboo in this game. Due to this, the game's community sports a far higher number of reasonable, mature, adult individuals, who are courteous, and friendly.\n\nDevelopers:\nMuse has gained a new level of respect from me. They are engaging, and listen to the playerbase, without mindlessly giving into them. They have fun-loving, but still mature and talented employees, who consistently log ONTO the game, and permit people to not only hang out with them, but to even play the game with them! They are even offering events where you can test yourself against them for a chance to win free stuff, should you beat them!\n\nProgression:\nProgression in this game is quite strange. First of all...Levels? After level 4, levels no longer matter! Between level 1 and 3, you are a 'novice' player, which means some harder aspects of the game are turned off, to avoid you making progression impossible for you(Such as customizing weapon setups, and some harder to use ships). Upon reaching level 4 with ANY type of crew, be it sailor, gunner, OR engineer? These limits are lifted, and the game opens up its highest difficulty in all its splendor.\nHowever, after you exit Novice mode? Levels are no longer anything but a bragging rights number. There are no skill trees, which set you apart from others by building the 'best build' for whatever patch you play in. THere's no 'gear' that makes your ship better or worse than the other, depending on what they have equipped. The only means of 'progression' you have? Is your own skill, your own experience, your own capabilities. You rely ENTIRELY on -yourself-, not a 'talent tree' or 'hot bar' with 'specced skills'.\nThis is all why, this game is worth it. Come play it with me, come serve me aboard my ship, and I'll see if you're worthy of serving under me ;3","May 20, 2014","true","28.4"," 234 of 246 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","234","246","0","19"

When I play with my clanmates,  and we get matched up against other clans of equal footing, its indescribable.  Sticking through the learning curve and getting to that lvl of play takes honest time effort and repition.\n\nWhen I play for fun ( which is all I do nowadays ) I find that matchmaking is underperforming, claiming that a hidden MMR rating is used to match me up against people that have had this game for a couple days, whereas I've put over 1000 hours into this game.

There is none or near enough as to make no difference.\n\nIf you buy the game, find a clan of people that seem friendly and play often. and just learn the game from them.  There are weekly and bi weekly tournaments that are streamed on Twitch, Community fights VS the Developers where the winners get FREE item choice from the store ( pretty awesome tbh )\n\nAlmost forgot the steam workshop, where player created items are hand picked by the community to appear in game, if your creative. You could put your hand to work designing cosmetic items that could charge for or let go up for free. Its your choice.  In my opinion the process of created work waiting review VS getting it into the game takes way too long. Some of these created icons look simply A-M-A-Z-I-N-G and need to be in the game right meow.\n\nGonna wrap this up before I start rambling.\n\nTLDR:\n-New players are going to suck for a DAMN LONG time unless you get knowledge from higher lvl players.\n-Hard to enjoy on your own, que with friends.\n-This games community is the best I have ever encountered in 14 years of video gaming. ( besides new players spamming dumb ♥♥♥♥ in global, I promise you they are the minority )\n-Easy to learn, difficult to master mechanics, ( when charged ammo is better in a mortar then greased )\n-Community events out the ♥♥♥. Get free stuff.\n-The top tier of gameplay is deeply rewarding on a personal lvl, and the memories of your triumphs will go with you to the grave.\n\nThis is just my TWO SILVER CENTS. that I decided to leave because I hate seeing stupid reviews saying Oh dis gaem is best buy it!","June 5, 2015","true","871.3"," 215 of 226 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","215","226","10","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/209080/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","952 products in account","Guns of Icarus Online is a different type of FPS. It is warfare in the sky between ships that resemble pirate ships (somewhat). Ships battling other ships, all being held up by hot air balloons. Steampunk at its' rawest.\n\nLet's summerize the classes:\n\n-------First: The Gunner, the one who operates the main offensive guns on the ship.\n\n-------Second: The Engineer, the one who goes around the whole ship repairing each part of the ship (Hull, Engines, Guns, Balloon, etc...).\n\n-------Third: The Pilot, the one who maneuvers the ship forwards/backwards up/down, and who usually captains the crew. (Though the pilot doesnt neccesarily need to be the captain; a gunner could be the captain telling the other players what to do, including the pilot).\n\n\nWith all this being said, there are a few options for different types of gameplay. I prefer to be a gunner. But if you're the type who doesn't think they're very good at shooting accurately, there's the option of being an engineer or a pilot. Being an engineer is probably the most demanding job on the whole ship, which is why there's usually one Pilot, two Engineers, and one Gunner. Most of the friends I regularly play with prefer to be engineers, they are never idle, always doing something (unless the ship isn't engaged in battle and is fully repaired).\n\nIf you do not like the stress of having to run around in first-person/third-person keeping everything in good condition, or if you don't like having to have the burden of being the one who HAS to take down that other ship before it takes your ship down, then you're probably going to choose the pilot.\n\nThe Pilot is in control of a lot during battle, he has to keep the ship in the right position for The Gunner to be able to turn the guns enough that the other ship is within range, but he also has to move around in a way that makes it hard for the other ship to shoot at you. Personally, if I didn't mainly play a gunner I would probably play the pilot. Being in control of the ship is really cool, and fun, very fun (and hard as hell).\n\nThe gamplay is pretty amazing to say the least. The three-dimensional battlegrounds make for very interesting use of the Unity Engine. The crews are made up of four. Games can be score based or time based, with different modes (King of the Hill, Crazy King, Deathmatch). Battles consist of Team Red and Team Blue, and go from 1 ship vs 1 ship to 4 ships vs 4. That's 32 players.\n\nSo if you enjoy a variation from the mainstream/generic FPS, one that involves a warm online community that is friendly and active and willing to teach, and if you enjoy interacting with real people across the world through your mic, this is definitely a game for you.\n\nJust go buy it. Right now, you will not be dissapointed, there's something in here for everyone.","December 24, 2013","true","333.5"," 139 of 151 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","139","151","0","0"

I've seen users band together to improve this by creating their own rules such as escort missions (agreeing beforehand that the loser will surrender). Hopefully the new Adventure mode will remedy some of this.\n= The lobbies can take awhile to fill. This is getting better, though.\n\nCons:\n- Lag spikes are a problem, especially when your ship is an inferno. OTOH, you can use this to your advantage by setting other ships on fire (Captain: "Quick! Reduce their framerate!")\n- Very very rarely you run into the type of player who thinks they literally are an airship admiral and cuss out their crew accordingly.","January 20, 2015","true","117.6"," 123 of 130 people (95%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","95","123","130","51","1"

The pilot needs to know when the gunner doesn't have a clear shot, engineers need to be alerted to critically-damaged sections of your ship and everyone needs to let everyone else know where the enemy is.\n\nOnce you get past that; the game is a sheer blast to play!  Hammering an enemy vessel with rockets and seeing his engines and balloon fail, knowing that he'll be dead in the air until his engineers fix everything and giving you a chance to reload and come around for another pass.  The whole team frantically trying to keep the engines and balloon running as the pilot tries to get you the hell out of dodge.  An excuse to shout things like "Enemy off the port bow!" in accents and with overacting that would make BRIAN BLESSED seem sedate!

The learning curve for Guns of Icarus is quite steep, but once you get the hang on it you will be able to enjoy the tactical depth and the rich variety this game has got to offer to its full extend. I for one can state that Guns of Icarus is the best game I've ever played since I've picked up videogaming about two decades ago.\n\nI think what I like most about this title is the strong Teamplay focus. Guns of Icarus encourages you to run the ship like a well oiled machine by coordinating yourself with your fellow crewmates. As communication is the key to success in this game, a large fraction of the player base talks via microphone or is at least active in text-chat. As everyone on your ship is forced to play WITH you for the better or the worse, tips and gameplay-relevant info is commonly shared through these channels. Perhaps as a result of this GoIO has got the friendliest and most communicative game-community I've ever encountered.\n\nAnother aspect I really like about this game is the rich variety of loadout option you've got for your ships. Right from the start everyone has got access to a large arsenal of ships and weapons which can be combined by the captains as they see fit. Depending on your own fleets loadouts and the  enemy fleet you encounter, you have have to adjust your playstyle, which ensures the game stays interesting in the long run. Sometimes the best way to engage an enemy is a straight rush to their position to force them into close and personal brawl engagements. In other Situations such tactics are doomed to fail and you might want to to stay back isntead as you've got the upperhand on mid or long range engagements. Sometimes it's a good choice to pick weapons which allow to kill your opponents as quick as possible. In other situations you might want to mix in a ship which is really good at taking out key components like weapons or balloons instead, even if this implies it isn't as good at delivering the killing blow.\n\nTo enjoy Guns of Icarus you will need to be able to understand spoken english. As mentioned previously, communication is a key-element of this game and english is the lingua franca. There are a few sub communities which speak different languages, but if you want to hop into the game without previously setting something up, it's very unlikely you will find a ship which is filled with french/german/russian speaking people.","November 15, 2014","true","096.1"," 107 of 113 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","107","113","4","0"

Well lets start with, this game is PvP orientated, but, levels mean nothing, just how much experience you have, the kit everyone has access to is all the same, it's just how well you use it that counts!\nThe biggest part of using your kit, is team work!\nEach ship can have a crew of 4 people, Pilot who is often the captain and three crew members (2 engineers and a gunner) and its the crews job to keep that ship up, Voice comms is pretty much a must, unless you're an awesome typist or learn the ingame key bindings! Then there is the added bonus, team captains can communicate in battle, allowing for battle tactics to be planned out!\nThis means more ofen than not, clans will dominate the game due to using the same tactics, discussed before the battle. There is no OP weapon or OP ship, just Team work and good communications! If someone is dieing too quick, someone was doing something wrong, or people were not communicating well! Remember, too much communication can be a bad thing too sometimes! :)\n\nThe best part of it all, the community is mostly awesome guys and girls with very few bad eggs. Often the bad eggs are solo players who don't like to play their part, or want all the credit and as you can imagine, they'll not get far in this game! :o\n\nMy personal experience in this game, I started as an engineer as it's often needed and reletively easy to pick up, but during one battle our ship captain went afk so I took the helm while our main engineer gave me an emergency flight school, in the middle of a fire fight! The fight was tough, tensions were high on all our team as I learnt my way around the helm of someone elses ship, but in the end, we succeeded! We played two more rounds together that night and now, thanks to that one guy, I have about 8 people who request me to pilot ships for them and their friends to be the final componant of a good crew! Last night by request to be a pilot of the crew and we had a 7 match win streak out of 8 matches! A captain is nothing without his crew, so don't treat 'em mean!\n\nThe gameplay mechanics take a bit of learning! Read through the tutorials carefully and don't be scared to let your crew know you're new and may needs tips when you come to join fights! You'll be surprised how many people will go out of their way to teach new players how to do well!\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nWhy are you not playing it already?!\n\nStop twiddling those thumbs lad! There's a war to be won! Pack your goggles and bow-tie, Pick up that spanner, hammer and spyglass! It's time for some adventures! Tales of daring do! Tally Ho!\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Note: Still playing after nearly 900 hours and still thoroughly enjoying it!","October 28, 2014","true","196.3"," 97 of 109 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","97","109","8","5"

This ship is slow, tanking yet effective at disabling with 4 heavy weapon, this ship can be used in many combinations with heavy weapons, you just need to practice and test them all.\n\nSquid - To Squid or not to Kid? that is the question right? Maybe not but this ship is neither a Kid or  Squid... Fact. This is a fast, maneuverable ship which can be greatly used for disabling!\n\nGoldfish - erm... not a very menacing name compared to other ships? what does it do? What this ship lacks in a fearful name, it makes up for in power, do not be deceived by appearances, this ship looks beautiful and has a heavy weapon on the front. This ship is great for dealing a knockout punch with the front gun and then a few side swings with side guns to finish the opponent. A Great ship for new players.\n\nThats alot of ships? anymore? Let me finish! There is one more\n\nJunker - woah... sounds a little... bad. This ship is a very good support vessel, with 2 standard guns either side and 1 standard gun on the front, this ship can be greatly used to provide support for other ships or to be used to unleash hard hitting attacks on enemies!\n\nok... thats all the ships...\n\nThats cool, what about guns? maps? and Tools?\n\nWell my friend, that the beauty of this game? There are many forms of information within the game which will help answer any question. There are a metaphorical tonne of books in the game to have a read for some lore or statistics related to guns, Maps and ships!\n\nOther than that there are also yellow people!\n\nWhat?\n\nI mean Community Ambassadors! These are people of volunteer as part of the community to provide help for everyone in game, regardless of level and such. You can ask anyone with a yellow name for help and they will assist you!\n\nAre there any other people?\n\nYes! There are blue people... Colourful.... Blue people are Moderators who, just like Community Ambassadors or CA's for short, will be able to help you. they will also do their best, just as the CA's do, to make the community, a great community.\n\nI love the Guns Of Icarus Community. I have been apart of it for over a year now, I am also now a Community Ambassador. Find me in Game under the alias - The Mann and I will provide you as much help as I can provide.\n\nTo all those reading this and thinking... am I insane? Well... you will need to find me in the skies to find out.\n\nTo conclude... Guns Of Icarus is a great, developing game and I am sure, you will enjoy it too.\n\nSee you in the skies my friends and foes.","September 2, 2015","true","851.6"," 78 of 82 people (95%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","95","78","82","13","5"

It seems like competition and rankings is all they're about now. Getting in a matchmaker, being thrown out there against a couple of faceless opponents you're never gonna see again, have a minute or two to pick your champ/hero/loadout/whatever, go. No wonder communities go to ♥♥♥♥ if you don't even have a moment to think about the fact that those other players are actual human beings.\n\nBut GoI? It's just different. And I couldn't even exactly tell people why, at least not without wasting a couple of paragraphs overanalyzing every single aspect of the game and my own personality. Somehow it manages to take away all the angst, salt and frustration that usually comes with multiplayer (well... most of the time). Instead of always competing in some sort of league where everyone is his own overzealous soccer mom, it feels more like a nice evening at a board game bar, playing with some friendly strangers, not so much against them.\nGuns of Icarus is something that very few multiplayer games can call themselves in my opinion. A thing I can only describe as "comfy". Something I haven't experienced like that since way back when I would spend my whole time playing WCIII fun maps with random people and I'm so glad to have found a game that could give me that again.\n\nIf recent multiplayer experiences just don't really seem to do it for you anymore absolutely give this game a try! Maybe It's just what you need!","November 20, 2015","true","753.0"," 68 of 69 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","68","69","0","0"

While there are three base classes the community has made subclasses like the gunineer which is a engineer that uses guns more then repairs or the metamidion which is a pyramidon that is designed to kill ships increadibly quickly with a chaingun and mortor combo.\n\nCharacter and ship customisation\n\nOnce you start the game up you wont have much in terms of customisation of your appeal but you can unlock most of it by playing classes and ranking them up to unlock pieces for free, while you can buy most of these with real life money from what i'v seen most items can be unlocked in time, in terms of ship though you have the same issue only from what i'v seen so far no ship customisation item can be unlocked for free. i want to also make this point clear, everything ingame that you unlock are purely cosmetic.\n\nthe community\n\nThe guns of icarus community is by far one of my favorites, will many great clans for both the competitive and casual gamer, I have fond memorys of a certain clan where i met so many awesome people, the GOIO community is by far one of the best communities i have ever seen in gaming.\n\nGame mode varity\n\nAs it stands theres only the standard team death match where your team has to get a certain amount of kills before, a king of the hill mode where you have to capture a point and hold it to get points killing ships also gets points for your team and a crazy king mode where the capture point is constantly moving. though i mainly play deathmatch i have never had a game that left me bored and wanting more. i always stopped playing this game satisfied.\n\nConclusion\n\nGuns of icarus is a really great game, the community will always welcome new players and not berate you for making mistakes and finding a clan that suits your style of play even if your a competitive player or looking for a little bit of fun in your spare time. for now i'll leave with this closing remark, Munkers are so much fun","October 5, 2014","true","220.5"," 75 of 88 people (85%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","85","75","88","46","1"

All in awesome steampunk fashion!\n4 man crews, 7 different ships, 17(ever expanding) weapons to outfit them.\nFlamethrowers and mortars and mines, oh my! Ships that range from hulky Galleon tanks, to fast and nimble Squids. Come in loud and proud, or pester the enemy to death. There's a good variety to have fun with.\n\nA simple concept, it's easy to learn but hard to master. It's class based: pilot/engineer/gunner.\n\nShips have predefined weapon placements, but you're free to select what weapons to fit(depending on if its a heavy or light weapons spot).\n-Pilots do nothing but fly and bark orders! :D\n-An Engineers job consists of repairing/rebuilding/extinguishing fires/upgrading components, and sometimes spotting hostiles.\n-The Gunners class is self-explanatory, but will often overlap with Engineers duty. But, it's unique because youre allowed to choose 3 different ammo types, which can be invaluable if you learn how to use them.\n+Now all classes have stamina that give them unique abiities!\n\nThere are several components aboard evey ship; balloons, engines, weapons, and the hull. They can all be damaged and destroyed by an enemy. You learn what parts are priorities, or when you need to shoot instead of repair. It's very important to know what weapon and ammo type to use at any given time. This is the skill of the game, this will all ultimately decide the fate of a battle.\nWhen it all works out, it's an experience that leaves you feeling satisfied.\n\nThe weapons are all fantastic and totally diverse. Some will trade off raw power to be better equipped at taking out certain components, so you have to feel them out and equip your ship accordingly.\nThere is almost nothing more gratifying than hosing down an enemy ship with flamethrowers and just watching them BUUUURRRNNN!\nAlthough, seeing an enemies futilile attempt at burning yours after youve chem-sprayed, is even more rewarding... The Hwacha in particuliar is pretty frikken awesome too ; ) The weapons are just flat-out fun to use. Which is great, because that's what the whole game revolves around - shooting down your enemy.\n\n\nCooperation is crucial, however, not always necessary if you have a competent crew. Coordination is also key.\nIf you can get together some friends, it can make for some incredibly fun battles, some of the best you can have online imo. I mean, who doesnt like being the crew of a well-oiled killing machine!? The game is very balanced, and the only thing that is OP is communication.\n\nGraphics arent too great, sometimes they're kinda lackluster. The audio is pretty well done, with just some minor gripes here and there. All-in-all, for $3 it's a fkn steal. I never pay full price, but this game is worth a lot more than a few dollars.\n\nIf you havent tried it, DO IT! everyone at least likes it for a little while.\nIf you havent played in a while, come back and see the new changes. Theyve added a lot!\nNow with steam workshop!!","January 3, 2015","true","622.1"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","57","63","6","2"

A crew of players on an airship with many other crews on other airships of both friend and foe. You fight with various manned guns placed on the ship; damaging the enemys' guns, engines, balloon, hull and armor while keeping your own repaired when you can.\n\nThere's strategy, there's teamwork, there's action. Most of all it's a fresh idea! Don't get me wrong I have nothing against other shooters, but this game does something new;something new is incredibly more worthwhile then another game of something that's already been made when it's good.\n\nSadly this game is on a list of games that's amazing and deserves a lot of attention from many but just doesn't get it. It manages about 300 players at peak times on a weekend right now. While the game is loaded with clans eager to include you to their fleet the game doesn't offer much for the casual player.\n\nThe lobby in this game is more than a bit sluggish if I'm honest. Everyone can see everyone else's ship and weapon loadouts. So both sides constantly change their loadouts to be the counter to the opponent's loadout. So it's like watching people play "Paper Rock Scissors" but they're allowed to change their decisions and see what the opponent is using. ...for literally ten minutes I usually wait on the captains over this - usually only stopping because the room ran out of time. This is really the only thing I find glaring about this game; the lobby.\n\nThere's been word for a while about this game getting a Coop and adventure mode. While it isn't out yet that does sound like something that'll get a heavy activity boost.

Guns of Icarus is an incredibly unique game that is best played with friends.   You won't find another game quite like this one.\n\nNow why am I not recommending this game?\n\nGuns of Icarus Online launched three and a half years ago.  With that time, Muse has introduced one new ship, a couple of maps, and as of patch 1.46, another PvP mode.  Oh and cosmetics for ships.  They have been very focused on the tutorial system, which is great to bring in new players, but offers no longetevity of play.\n\nI understand that Muse is not a triple A developer and Guns of Icarus is an indie game, but development time has been at an absolutely agonizingly slow pace.  They spent a good amount of money hiring youtubers to play their game which brought in a surge of players for all of a month before the active player count crashed again.  Muse also incorporates cosmetics on a regular basis, which is a great way to nickle and dime the player base, but doesn't add any new content to play.\n\nThis game still has huge potential and I hope that Muse can turn it around with the release of the Alliance DLC, but as of now, I would not recommend picking up this game.\n\nEDIT 6/1/2016\nIn response to some of the comments and hate mail that I've received:\n\nThe game being three and a half years old does not constitute my opinion on this game.\n\nI'll say it again: I love this game.  I've shared many fun hours with friends playing it.\n\nI am disappointed with the game because it has vast amounts of potential that I don't think have been realized yet.  The Alliance DLC gives me a lot of hope for the game and when it releases, I may change my recommendation.\n\nI'll even break it down into a list form:\n\nPROS\nUnique, team based play\nActive developer involvement\nBalanced and varied ship and gun types\nSteam workshop items included in the game\nCONS\nLack of new ships, maps, and game modes since launch\nVery small player base\nUnbalanced matchmaking (often due to small player base)\nIn response to Keyvias:\nI have definitely gotten my money's worth from the game.  Almost 200 hours of game time for a $10 investment is a fantastic return for entertainment.  I feel like the game has not lived up to it's potential, yet. Integrating new ships and maps at a steady pace (even through paid DLC) would keep the current player base active and help attract new consumers.\n\nThe clan that I was a part of had a solid 50 active members at its peak, but people stopped playing because the game never changed.  The joke we had was: "Hey who wants to play deathmatch on Dunes for a couple hours?" because that option came up almost everytime we voted.   When the Mobius and later Hades cannon were released, we were very enthusiastic and people started playing again.  There was more variety to play and the game didn't feel so static and stale.\n\nThe only way to affect change is to state honest opinions.  At this time, I would not recommend this game due to the aforementioned reasons.  In a reviews page full of thumbs up, I think it is fair to state a negative opinion in order to help gamers decide on whether to buy or not.  You have to take the good with the bad.","May 28","false","202.1"," 66 of 80 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","66","80","2","5"

During this conflict, humanity has squandered any resources that would have taken them forward and have fallen back on the steel from the past. Using this steel they craft airships to travel the land for resources and trade.\n\nBefore joining the battles, you first need to choose your role. You can choose among being an engineer, gunner and pilot. Each role is able to equip 3 role specific items and 1 item for the other two roles. This allows you to be both proficient at your role and help out with the other roles, if need be.\n\nEach crew is made of 4 players and any of them can chose be the captain and bring their ship to the table. The ships can be customized with various weapons including mortars, flak cannons, gatling guns and even a flamethrower. Not only does it matter where you damage enemy ship but also what type of weapon you use to deal the damage.\n\nThis is where the strategic elements come from. As the captain/pilot you need select the best weapons and ship to suite your play style. The gunner needs to know what type of ammo to use for each gun for maximum effect. The engineer needs to prioritize what parts of the ship to repair or build first to keep it running.\n\nIt has a distinct steam-punk theme to it. The ships are made of steel girders with steel plating as armor and are kept afloat by giant balloons. As ships parts begin to take damage they start smoking and eventually stop working. When a ship is destroyed, it violently explodes and showers the ground with its various parts. The soundtrack has a good mix of simple melodies for the menus and thumping drum beats for the battles. The guns all sound very hard hitting, yet they all have very distinct sounds to them.\n\nOverall I was impressed by Guns of Icarus. Not only does it break the mold by not being a high octane shooter but it manages to blend action and simulation. It manages to be light enough to jump in for a couple rounds and deep enough to keep you playing for hours.","May 9","true","38.5"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","47","53","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonmere/recommended/209080/","dragonmere","dragonmere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonmere/","886 products in account","I'd love to love this game. And I've really tried -- for over 1000 hours. But I just can't anymore. An *extremely* under-experienced (yet incredibly friendly!) development team leads to a very unpolished game, with an ongoing and haphazardly drastic development process. Due to constant 'rebalancing' patches, it's very different than when I purchased it, and not in a good way.\n\nThe game itself revolves around three asymmetric roles. They are generally played fairly straight forward, and are each arguably shallow. Pilots (should) stand at the wheel ~99% of the time, just flying the ship and mostly disconnected from the on-deck action. Engineers and gunners will spend most of their time firing a single weapon (possibly two) or repeatedly clicking on ship components using a limited variety of tools.\n\nTeamwork and communication are the real name of the game, so if you don't plan on being an active participant of in-game voice chat, I'd entirely skip this game. Dealing with uncooperative or non-responsive teammates can be very frustrating, and is a serious problem in battle. Obviously, this lends a large advantage to pre-made teams, as coordination between members is more important than any one role.\n\nThis leads to a few 'interesting' problems. New players will stand nearly no chance against experienced teams. This can be quite unpleasant for new players, and is unfortunately very common. However, the experienced teams themselves have an equally hard time finding a balanced match. There is no matchmaking system for teams [nor do I believe there will ever be a way to properly quantify teamwork/communication over role performance]. This leads to LONG WAIT TIMES between matches (~1/2 of my logged hours were spent in lobby), very unbalanced matches, and general frustration from both new players and experienced crews.\n\nOn a technical level, it plays no better than a solid beta; Graphics are fairly poor, yet somehow not fully optimized, and net code leaves a lot to be desired. Poor graphical performance and frequent lag spikes are par for the course. I have an average PC with good broadband, and still sporadically get crap for both FPS and ping, with potentially serious impact on game play. Syncing errors leaving you unable to interact with the ship, and bugs with "Steam's" voice servers that make you unable to verbally communicate are far too common. This game has been out for over a year and dealing very basic things like these are still on the 'To-Do' list.\n\nDevelopment cycle is also more like a beta than a final product.  Constant and irregularly released  patches address the endless sea of old and newly created bugs. They often include ***extreme*** "re-balancing" of ANY aspect of the game (from lobby structure to a complete overhaul of physics, and every stat inbetween), or sometimes add new content. The game is not and has not ever been stable, either in code or in game balance in the first place. Any changes or additions to the game often make these preexisting problems worse. Unfortunately, more often than not, the added content is entirely useless or strategically ignorable.\n\nThere are those who will sing the chorus "The community is great! The development team is so involved!" I will concede that this is the friendliest development team I've ever seen. That does not mean that they are the most professional. As a result, the game has some wonderful qualities and ideas that are put into execution rather poorly. A large part of the reason why the community is 'great' is entirely artificial, due to strict behavioral guidelines. Trolling, profanity, harassment will all get you heavily censored or kicked/banned from the game. This is not at all an idle threat, and moderators are often extremely biased towards veteran players.\n\nBut... If you've read all this, you've probably already made up your mind. And thats fine! If you THINK you'll like it, you'll probably enjoy it for a good while despite its very obvious and glaring flaws, even though I no longer can. If you do enjoy it, remember the game can change entirely at any moment with a new 'balance' patch. Have fun while it lasts, and tell the ducks dragonmere says quack off! ;-)","April 15, 2013","false","035.9"," 360 of 576 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","360","576","10","30"

There is a role for everyone, and the 3 available classes will keep you occupied for a long time.\n\nEach ship can be customized, every class can choose from a variety of tools to take into the game and once there, there is really no shortage of tactics involved. Will you be able to outsmart your opponents and be a superior crew because of your internal organisation?\n\nAs far as the visuals go, game is made to be really pretty. Despite it having good and somewhat demanding graphics it is mostly totaly lag free and runs incredibly smooth. if your computer is a bit on the slow side, you can always try lowering the quality and removing some of the filters. The game very quickly made it into my favorite list and it is currently my most played game.\n\nRecommendation!","June 6, 2014","true","123.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

It has been pretty easy for me to join matches with great people with nice coordination and communication skills.\nThe community is friendly and, sometimes, a bit insane (make a weird noise on your mic and eventually something much more weird will happen). Fortunately  I never had nor witnessed any problems or even stress between players (which are frequent on games that use voice as primary communication, and random teams).\nYou can make clans and/or parties to be able to join up matches with your friends.\nFor more information, watch the videos. But this game is EXTREMELY fun and is a must-have for anyone who likes co-op and explosions.\nThe 4-pack is a great choice since each ship takes a crew of 4 people - bring your friends on!\n\nThe only issues I ran into was the ocassional lag spike and some UI bugs on new features, but it doesn't break anything and don't even get in the way of the fun. I also believe more features can and should be implemented to build up on the awesomeness of the current experience. The devs probably have plans for that.\n\nNote 1: This is NOT a generic FPS. There's no land/boarding combat between ship crews. IMO, this makes the game even better. [EDIT: There's no boarding in the dev plans, the devs believe this would hurt teamwork - and so do I].\nNote 2: This game requires cooperation and communication. If you don't have a mic or don't like talking much, use the in-game signals [press V] to alert enemy positions, to ask your pilot to raise/lower altitude or change direction, or even to ask for repairs. There's a HUGE difference between a well balanced and communicative crew, to a silence-while-everyone-do-their-own-thing crew. You'll be surprised with the amount of cool, nice people who are all interested in having a fun match - even on novice servers.\n\nLast but not least, if you see a member from the Vagabonds [VGB] clan, make sure to say hi and join us for awesome matches! :)\n\nEDIT: Beware of the review dates about this game. It seems that the initial bugfixing after the release of this game was pretty chaotic, while the devs where trying to balance features and fix issues.\nCurrently, however, this is very much a completely different game from the one described by 2013 (and older) reviews. The current issues are all being fixed by the developers - including external issues that are being caused by the server hosting company.","May 25, 2014","true","48.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

It's about your team. If you want to be a captain, but you're afraid you won't be any good, talk to your team. Let them know you're anxious or new. The community in this game never ceases to amaze me; just be serious about it, and others will respond. I'm not the greatest captain ever, yet somehow I managed to retain three Russian speaking teammates despite the inability to speak to each other, except for them to be able to say "You are terrible captain", to which we all laughed hysterically. The only English they knew and it was enough to tell me I sucked.\n\nHave fun. That's what it is. There will be matches you just always win; there will be matches you lose historically. You may level up, you may not; some people grind for levels, some people- like me- forget achievements exist and stay level 7 for two years.\n\nAlso, this is a FANTASTIC game to livestream. Almost ALL of my best livestreams are because of this game. When you can announce to a match that you're livestreaming and the worst thing that happens is one guy squealing "I'M FAMOUS" and everyone else screaming in high pitched voices, you know it's a good community.

It fills a niche that I didn't even know existed, and provides a wonderfully unique gameplay experience that has cost me 300 hours of my life so far (which I don't want back!).\n\nCommunication is paramount in this game, and if you just get the basics of it down, you'll find that you open up to a varied meta of playstyles that are born of different teams mixing their unique strengths and weaknesses together. In other words, no two matches are the same.\n\nAdditionally, this game has some of the most organic "wow" moments I have seen in gaming so far. Rather than the fast, montage-bait killstreaks you'll find on many competitive online games, here you'll find the "wow" moments coming from last minute decisions which keep you alive while rockets, bullets and fire engulf your ship from all angles and those other times where a drawn out battle leads you to finally down that enemy ship that has harassed your team the entire match. There's so much satisfaction to be had, knowing that your kill was earned through being the finer oiled machine than the people who bit the dust due to you.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful experience that I wholeheartedly recommend.\n\nThat doesn't mean all gems come out of the earth without a litle bit of sediment still attached. That is to say, there are some issues with the game that you should take into account pre-purchase:\n\nFirstly, and in my opinion the biggest problem with the game, is the player population is very low at present. While we have spikes during sales and youtuber promotions, it usually settles back down again. This can lead to very unfair matchmaking that can wind you and your fresh-off-the-back-of-a-purchase friends taking on some of the longest standing players in the game. This difference in experience and game knowledge can lead to some absolutely crushing defeats. To combat this, I'd recommend being polite and perusing/posting on the community forums in order to find more experienced players to party up with. Not only are many in the community happy to teach newer players with a patient demeanour, but you'll find much more fun when ever second match isn't furiously stacked in the enemy teams favour.\n\nSecondly, absolutely, positively, definitely, DO NOT SKIP THE TUTORIALS. This game isn't as simple as "shoot thing, thing die" nor is it as simple as "hit thing, thing fixed". The tutorials will provide you with the very basics to be competent in your first few matches without going too far into the higher-level play (most of which you'll pick up through experimentation and advice from veterans). I'd also recommend, again, hitting the forums and reading up player guides. Just a little bit of background reading will make the game mechanics make so much more sense.\n\nFinally, you may not have a microphone or the confidence to communicate verbally, which is fine, but at least be able to listen if not speak. This game requires more communication than anything else I have played so far, and updates on enemy positions and current priorities make the difference up between life and death.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n+Game good.\n+Strategy is complex and satisfying.\n+Unique, nothign else like it.\n\n-Low player population.\n-Tutorials mainly text based, game won't spoonfeed you (get your reading glasses on).\n\n9/10, would airship again.","September 4, 2015","true","817.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Overall the game is really original and there's nothing quite like it, all the airships control differently, the levelling system is really fair and interesting in how you level up on each class (engineer, pilot and gunner), the guns just feel awesome and the sweet feeling you get when you destroy an enemy ship is like none other.\n\nHowever, there is one major issue. The customization system look's like it came straight out of a F2P game, the fact that this game's original price is £11 and that they charge up to £2 for different clothes and stuff for your ship is just wrong. Luckily none of the 'extra' stuff actually affects how decent your ship or crew are, it's just very irritating as there is no in-game credit system.\n\nThat's really the main problem, even though the overall feeling of the game when actually playing it is great, you can't help but feel like you've been cheated if you've paid the full price of the game. But, for £2.75 you really can't go wrong, the differnt ships and weapons are just endless fun with friends, and the community are really awesome! if they sort out the whole economy system of the game then it would be a definite recommendation for its current sale price.","May 18, 2014","true","8.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I picked this game up a few years back for the mere price of $5 or so and I can see that it is probably my best purchase ever. Let me give you a quick break down so you know what to expect. This game highly stresses the importance of teamwork and cooperation. Without these two you will get on a ship with 3 pilots and a gunner and eveyrthing will crash and burn. As the player, you have to be willing to submit to what your captain gives you and roll with his orders. Secondly, you need alertness. At any given instant the balloon or hull will break in the blink of an eye and you have to be ready for it. You always need to keep a constant eye on the UI and be prepared to even shoot when needed. Lastly, this is mainly for a pilot, you need communication. This is probably the most important factor and without it even the best of players will lose. As a pilot, you have to have to HAVE TO tell your crew what's going on and where you need them/when to shoot. Many guns in this game rely on timing to be effective (such as waiting for hull break to do permant hull damage). You also need to communicate with your ally captains so you can position them in ambushes or plan strategic advances. All in all, this game is awesome for those who love teamwork and efficiency. Only downside is that black paint costs a whopping dollar, like seriously Muse?","September 2, 2015","true","386.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

It's come a long way since then; levelling isn't as painful, they switched over to a matchmaking system (which isn't perfect, but it's not horrible), and Muse introduced a few other fixes that improved the game as a whole. Performance even feels a bit better, too.\n\nThe game itself is wholly fun to play and is a unique experience. The game has a variety of different ships that can be customized with different weapons; this allows for players to experiment with different strategies for different maps and gameplay styles. There are currently three different gameplay modes, each with its own maps, which changes how gameplay is approached by the player. There are a few bugs here and there that need to be ironed out (ex. getting stuck on the corner of one of the staircases on the Squid), but there are not any bugs that make gameplay difficult or near impossible. Overall, matches feel fun and not only require technical ability but the ability to strategize effectively as well. There's a steep learning curve at first, but there always seem to be players who are willing to assist in this. (This is made easier thanks to the Community Ambassadors appointed by Muse.)\n\nI took a break from the game for a while to focus on college and whatnot, but when I came back to it about a month ago, I decided to look into joining a clan since I didn't have friends who played the game frequently. (Luckily, the game has sales frequently, so more of my friends have been joining in on the fun.) Honestly, it's one of the best things I did since getting this game, and it's something I wish I had done back when I first got the game. There are lots of different communities for people to join, so you're bound to meet people and clans interested in your gamestyle or interests. It really helped me connect with the community more as well as meet so many interesting people who I'm glad to call my friends. Joining a clan is not required to fully enjoy the experience of playing Guns of Icarus, but it certainly adds something special to it.\n\nThere's a lot more I can say about this game, but long story short, GOIO isn't perfect, but it's definitely an enjoyable experience with much replayability. I'd definitely recommend buying it.","June 17, 2015","true","109.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/209080/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","I purchased this game a megaton of time ago. Mostly two or so years back. However, back then my computer broke, had to reinstall everything, and I forgot about it. A few days ago I decided to reinstall it and get back to it, see how it stands out today. As usual, I will start with the negative parts of the game; thankfully, there's just two big complains:\n\nFirst and foremost, the community. Back then you could get matches instantly. That ain't happening anymore, as while you could find over 3000 players online, right now it barely reaches 300 at some peek hours, while usually sticking to 50 players online at others. That translates into long search times, and when you do find a game, it will most likely be from a far away country, giving you quite the amount of lag. An easy fix to this would be, for example, a free weekend with a big sale going along, although that might happen when the "coop" mode is actually made. However, that was being announced way before my computer broke and there's still no sign of that, so I wouldn't get my hopes up.\n\nThe second problem there is, is the tutorials. They need some work. There's 4 little tutorials to help you understand basic controls and using the three different classes, however these tutorials are just singleplayer stages with a TON of white text appearing on your screen and fading away.   The worst part about it is when the text banishes before you could even finish reading it, and another block of information appears ahead of you. There's also the fact that new players don't need to unlock anything to play properly, which is nice, however levels rise up way too slow because they use achievements to track down your experience. It's a neat idea, but as with the tutorials it needs some work to improve, as a lot of the achievements are things like "Play/Win X amount of games", and with the current community THAT'S A REAL F#CKING GRINDFEST.\n\nHowever, leaving those problems aside, what's left is a really fun experience.\n\nWhat community is left, you can bet is nice. I haven't yet found A SINGLE #sshole, a SINGLE rude player who would blame it all on someone else. It's all about teamwork, it's a heavy team-based game and everyone has to do their part to stay alive. That translates into people treating eachother nice, and trying to keep the morale up.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also a ton of fun: your captain picks up a ship and a loadout, and while his main job is to drive it properly and not crash into a mountain, the other 3 players (usually a gunner and two engineers) have to use the turret guns and keep all vital areas of the ship healthy enough. It's simple but with a ton of depth, and will get you hooked for more.\n\nThe graphics and settings are also okay, going for a steam-punk style with tons of gears here and there, while the ships look amazing and the landscapes are quite big. I've only gotten frame-drops while inside sand-clouds, so that's a plus.\n\nThe sound gets the job done. There's different voices you can pick for your character, you can speak to the microphone freely (gunners and engineers can speak to the rest of the crew of that ship, while Captains can also communicate with other captains of the team to coordinate), and there's also music... Although the music might get repetitive. It does seem to change arround how the battle goes, but you'll hear everything quite quick.\n\nIs the game worth it? I'd say, wait for a sale. Not because the price is high, but because there will be way more players when that happens.\n\nTL;DR Edition: Fun team-based game about being sky-pirates. However, barely has players left. Wait for a sale, as new players will go in.","March 28","true","18.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

You'll fight it out in the skies as a mechanic, gunner or captain, and quite frankly, you'll love it if you're a fan of alternate team deathmatch games. There isn't much that is more satisfying than watching a blimp simply get shredded by your ships firepower, I'll tell you that much.\n\nGameplay\nYou're in first person, waltzing around your ship, smashing things with wrenches and hammers, streaming gunfire into enemy ships or piloting your ship at the captain's seat! All three of the things you can do on your ship are truly enjoyable to do. You'll feel like you're truly part of a crew, and helping to run the machine, especially when you win the game. This title does a really great job of capturing epic gameplay and true aesthetic.\n\nGraphics & Sound\nThe graphics aren't absolutely out of this world, I'll tell you that. As for the sound, it's VERY pleasing. The ambience is really generated by the old-time graphics and the genuine sounds to really create the atmosphere of Guns of Icarus. That's what the Graphics & Sound does.\n\nReplayability\nPlay to your hearts content!

So dont blame me for making some mistakes here and there ;)\n\nOne of the best if not the best multiplayer game i have played so far. When you first enter the game lobby (yes as the title suggests its an online only game) you will probably be surprised by the low player count (50-400 people) and think the game is dying. But when you look it up on the internet (steam stats) you will find that its always been that way for years now (apart from some peeks here and there) without a big relevant overall decline in player counts. In this game you play as an engineer, captain or a gunner keeping an airship (chosen by the captain) up and running and shoot other airships or capture strategic positions. Matches are rather fast paced : 15-20minutes on average. And now i get to the pros and cons.\n\nJust one more note: you definitely shouldnt be shy to talk to strangers via voice chat because every crewmember depends on each other to keep your airship running.\n\nPros:\n-great multiplayer game where communication between crewmembers and allied captains is key\n\n-enough ships and weapons for several tactical variations and counters\n\n-possibilities to either voice chat with crew, team captains (only as a captain) or all players in a lobby (not ingame)\n\n- a very helpful community that teaches novices/new players\n\n-small but overall friendly and helpful community (the most friendly community i have come across so far in a game)\n\n-Community ambassadors trying to answer question (for example in global chat)\n\n-active developers that are keen on keeping the game balanced and even add more stuff (not only tweeks, skins and clothes, there should even be more gamemodes coming up soon)\n\n-an ideal game to find more steam friends\n\n\ncons:\n\n-the community can be pretty small at times (varies from around 50-400 people online)","April 20","true","213.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastuck/recommended/209080/","mastuck","Mastuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastuck/","394 products in account","Yes, this game is a gem. A raw gem. A flying, buning, shooting raw gem with great engineers on deck.\nBut why do i consider it raw and since when do gems shoot?\nWell, raw because there are many features promised that aren't in the game yet. Like the Co-op mode i'm awaiting for about 2 years. But don't get me wrong. That shouldn't be criticism. In my opionion the developers should take all the time they need to give the players a well polished experience and for now Guns of Icarus Online is great in what it is.\nI also hope you forgot about the gem question already.\n\nSo what is it now?\nGuns of Icarus Online is a really great, tactial, team based Multiplayer. There are 2-4 ships on each team. Each ship has a crew that usually made of 1 captain, 1 gunner and 2 engineers. Sometimes 2 gunners and 1 engineer but that's an exception. Anyway the captain flies, the gunner shoots and the engineers panic... um... repair everything.\nThere are muliple ships, multiple guns you can put on the ships and a huge variety of tools and ammo for different situations.\nYou can not shoot people on enemie ships and you are bound to your ship. That means your only goal is to destroy the enmy ship. Well you can jump off the ship but that only results in a long fall and respawning.\nThe game is easy to learn but hard to master.\nYou can level each class mainly by making achievements but that doesn't give you any gameplay benefits. It just unlocks cosmetic stuff you can also buy from the store (real money) or win from matches against the developers. Yes, the developers are playing their own game. That's a huge plus!\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. The character animation not so much but who cares? I'm an engineer! All i see during a game are broken shipparts and fire! Well i don't like the rain animation on the ships but meh. Fog still looks awsome.\n\nSo what are the bad things?\nThere are only three things i have to mention.\n1. Low population. Don't get me wrong. You will always find a game but very rarely on the european server. That's not too bad because the game still runs great with a ping of ~150.\n2. If your crew is bad it can get annoying. But that's the way of team based games isn't it? I highly recommend to get some friends to play with you so you have at least 1 full ship of people you can shout at in your native tongue. Or... just don't take the game too serious...\n3. It can get repetitive. Go to lobby. Wait for the game to start. Blow up ships/get blown up. Repeat. I recommend to play it from time to time with friends and not 24/7 with strangers to prevent this issue.\n\n7,8/10 because the hull is on fire...again!","August 8, 2015","true","160.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Basically instead of creating a competitive product, you create a product where you already have the complete share because no one has created anything like it yet.\n\nThis is what Guns of Icarus is. Its created such an engaging and different game that as a result, its already got a controlling stake in anything airship related because not only is it the only working product (there have been a few other airship games, all pretty mixed to bad), but its had so much dedicated consistent attention to it that you can't help but fall in love with it a little.\n\nThe mechanics are fluid and responsive, and each class has a genuinely different play style, the community is dedicated, diverse and filled with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, as most communities are. But more importantly they're actually there and you're not left to ghost servers. Finally the devs just give so much of a ♥♥♥♥ about the game that its hard not to root for them.\n\nGood for them, and good for you if you buy this.

High learning curve (won't find auto aim here kids), demanding team effort, and most of all fun; makes for rewarding game play.

Cons: it does at certain times of the day take a few minutes to get a match going. Also you might find yourself on a team of low experienced players as the other team gets a little stacked, but hey, the real fun is in the challenge.

But when a not so popular game is this great, I just have to.\n\nFirst off, if you are thinkning about getting this game, DO IT! This is probably the most unique team based multiplayer game I've ever played. From the art and models to the gameplay, this game delivers in a special way.\n\nThe game in a nutshell: Crews of four man one of the many different types of airships and battle the enemy airships in a variety of beautiful and detailed maps. Battles can range from 2v2 to 4v4. (4v4 dogfights are epic . . . Trust me. There are also different game modes.) There are three roles as a crewmember to choose from - the pilot, who flies the ship, the gunner, who mans the ship's main weapon, and the engineer who repiars the ship and mans other guns. (Most crews are made up of a pilot, gunner, and two engineers.)\n\nI love absolutely everything about this game. Its loads of fun working with your crew and fellow allies to blow the enemy out of the sky. The different classes, ship types, and weapons keep the game fresh. You can also customize your own character with various outfits (some you unlock, others you can buy.) Ships are also customizable to an extent.\n\nJust a tip: This game is all about the people you play with. If you have a vulgar or terrible crew, then you'll have a bad experience. My adivce would be to join a friendly, talkative clan as soon as possible. Having a nice clan and friends to play with is what really makes this game fun! :)","August 13, 2015","true","134.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

All three classes (Captain, Engineer, and Gunner) are fun to play, there is great weapons' and ships' variety, and as a result each match is normally a completely unique experience. 95% of the times: good fun!\n\nThe community for the most part is really well-behaved, which helps, and I lost count of the times in which more experienced players gave me suggestions and tips. Apart from that, when my friends and I manage to fill a whole ship, it's always amazing: we coordinate easily and we become a deadly war machine! :--P\n\nIn any case, the built-in voice chat works well, and it helps the captain giving orders (although there are other ways: standard chat, and keyboards commands).\n\nI wish there were more players, so to reduce the time spent in the match lobby, but that's basically the only complain that I have.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/209080/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nGuns of Icarus Online is an online multiplayer only game. You can choose between 3 jobs: Engineer, Pilot/Captain, and Gunner. There are a variety of ships you can fly, some that fly fast, and others that have great armor but are slower.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: At this time (April 05, 2014) there has been talk of an adventure mode where there is actually a story, but at this time there is no story (If there is, it’s in those manuals that I glanced at and didn’t notice anything, the loading screen sometimes gives an interesting explanation about a map, so I wouldn’t be surprised if there is some type of story background.\n\nGame Play:  There are some excellent guides that explain more details about how to do the various jobs in Guns of Icarus Online, but basically the Pilot/Captain flies the ship, the gunner shoots the guns, and the engineer hits stuff with a hammer (fixes parts of the ship). There is an overlap so often times you see an engineer shooting guns, and a gunner repairing stuff. The Pilot rarely leaves the wheel though.\nThe game is completely multiplayer, so at times it’s a long wait in a lobby or trying to quickly join existing games. It’s a pain but if you’ve ever wanted to be on an airship with your friends, this is the perfect game for you.\n\nAchievements: Something that I personally like about Guns of Icarus Online is their sense of progression and rewards. Guns of Icarus Online has a lot of achievements, do not expect to get these very fast, the game is meant to take up a lot of time, you can only repair something 150 so fast. Often times you need to play over various sessions and rounds to finally earn achievements.\nThe value of earning achievements is that you also “level up”. For example, you need to get 5 achievements to get from engineer level 7 to level 8. As you level up the achievements get more difficult, however the challenge is very obtainable if you’re into getting achievements.\nNot only do you level up by getting achievements, you also unlock new equipment and dyes that you can use on your avatar so that you don’t look exactly like everyone else playing Guns of Icarus Online. If you’re really into aesthetics you can also pay real-money to purchase exclusive items… but anyone who knows me knows I’d personally never do that.\n\nPrice: Guns of Icarus Online currently going for  $14.99, as I commonly say on my reviews, I prefer to wait for a sale before I purchase a game. However I will make an exception for this game. If you are looking for a game that will eat up your free time, this is the game.  (As of today – April 09, 2014 – I have played only 60 hours of the game, but I know that will probably increase to several hundred hours over the next year or so)\nSo to rephrase my opinion: It’s a good game, $14.99 is too high for myself, but if you’re looking for a time eater this game will do that and its value is fair compared to the amount of time you can spend on it.\n\nConclusion: Pro’s: The game will eat up free time, if you ever wanted to fly a ship or be part of a crew on a ship this game is excellent, there are many friendly people in the Guns of Icarus Online community, the game is dynamic and very unique compared to many other video games out there.\nCon’s: There is no hanging out by yourself, you cannot fly your own ship online and get grindy achievements – you must be with a crew of other people in a game, sometimes you have NPC’s instead but fundamentally you’re always online and unless you have a lot of friends playing with you, chances are you’ll have a rough time. Naturally whenever you’re playing a game with other people, you meet some good, some bad, and some worse. I’ve had to block elitists, little kids thinking their funny, and people who tend to yell over their microphones – you will have that happen to you, the best thing to do is block them and not crew up with them again.\n\nThere is a lot to be said about the negative aspects of the game, but there is a lot to be said about the positive too. It’s just important to know what type of gamer you are, and how well you handle sociality… I personally don’t know if I should have gotten this game because I don’t handle being yelled at well. But I’ve made several good friends so I guess I think that’s worth it. :)","April 9, 2014","true","72.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Although there is always someone playing, there are times of the day when (or time zones in which) games are hard to find.

Very complex yet simple at the same time, Guns of Icarus is a teamwork based game in which crew members crew a ship to kill other ships in 2v2 3v3 and 4v4 deathmatches as well as respective KotH and rotating CP modes, thus teamwork spans from the small intership scale to a teamwide scale, making the game both chalenging and enjoyable.\n\nGuns of Icarus has a steep learning curve in order to understand the game mechanics a curve similar to that of CS:GO or any other team based games. Basics are easily covered and managed through the tutorial but more advanced piloting and engineering tactics as well as gunner acuracy takes some time to learn, but take it from a seasoned player when I say the hard work does pay off.\n\nAdditionally, Guns of Icarus has one of the greatest comunities on the internet, which is one of the reasons I've stayed here a while. I've met some of my greatest friends through this game as they taught me how to play and become just as good as them.\n\nFinally! I recomend reading the "What Do?" guide, that guide goes over some of the most important stuff to know in order to lower the learning curve, it tells you everything you need to know to A) Not ♥♥♥♥ off other people B) Not be a scrub and C) be way super MLG when just starting off.\n\nGood luck, and I hope to see you in the skies.\n\nThat's all the important stuff, but if you want some more PRO MLG SWEG tips... just keep reading\n\nBefore you start playing against the big wigs, attempt to matchmake into only Novice Matches first to get a feel for a game, it'll be boring, but just playing 3-4 games will help you understand the game.\n\nIf you really want to pilot, start out by just flying Pyramidions, they're the easiest ship to learn on as they're the most balanced and most used in the game, take your time, get good at one thing, and when you feel really ready (after 20-30 games) move on.\n\nDon't be an ♥♥♥. If you're captain tells you to do something, do it, even if you disagree. It's better to follow orders and keep communicating rather than starting an argument and then dying because you weren't paying attention.\n\nIf you need help! Message Me (IGN: -Blue-) ingame, and I'll help you out! I don't get on as much as I used to, mostly only for competative tournaments and practices so contact any SPQR clan memeber, we like to teach new players the ropes. :D (I learned to pilot with a stacked crew, makes life a lot easier when you can focus on one thing)\n\nHAVE FUN! <-- it's good to remember that this is just a game, and if you have a bad ally don't let it get you down, come back strong and do your best.","December 19, 2014","true","680.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It also has many tactical and strategical components to it as different weapons not only have different ranges and damage values but also excel at destroying the one or the other component.\n\nI'm just going ahead and say it: Guns of Icarus online is basically Faster Than Light multiplayer in a steampunk setting. Okay, there is no boarding or killing the enemy crew but everything else is in: destroying the armor (the shields) to do damage to the hull, destroying components to disable certain abilities of the enemy, i.e. the engines to remove their ability to maneuver.","July 9, 2014","true","205.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game doesn't have very high graphical requirements, and I can say, it's quite good-looking. Beggining players may not have it that hard, as the community seems acceptable of newbie players, and the game itself can be learned and player to a "normal-player" by 1-4 matches. For me, personally, learning everything, and mastering a single weapon (gunner here) took 2 matches, while I played with someone on his first match, who was already really good at certain roles. I recommend watching a let's play/gameplay/whatever video first, as it may give you a good first look on whether you'll like the game or not, and the basic controls of a ship, and it's features. The game contains a useful digital handbook called "Wilson's Notes" which accurately describes your weapons (Their angles of turning vertically and horizontally, their magazine size, equip time, firing speed, their 'pro-parts' which they damage more, etc.), and I myself enjoy reading through it, even though I myself don't have many weapons unlocked, as this game has a larger amount of achievements and unlockables. Unlockables such as ranks, titles, clothing (which is more-less DLC, but fortunately the only DLC in the game, which is obviously purely cosmetical), and the Wilson's Notes. The game, however can have a problem with XP systems (according to a friend), and graphical loading isn't the fastest either (had to wait for 5-10 seconds on a ship before it fully loaded, however I joined during a match, not on the start of one). Also, I understand it's purely cosmetical, but the DLC prices seem VERY high to me, and I'd rather have this game's items on the market, if their item amount expands and goes to "Rare" versions, as  a seasonal tophat would cost me around 2$ (50% off), and 2 suits at the time of writing cost about 3$ (50% off).\n\n9/10","December 30, 2013","true","21.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I have no idea why this game doesn't get more attention.\n\n+ Great community\n+ Beautiful & detailed airships\n+ Really motivating combat mechanics, and a huge feeling of achievement after a battle has been won\n+ Teamplay: It's working REALLY well in 90% of the games. A crew of 4 players is easy to manage, and you can have a lot of fun with your team mates.Especially because of the voicechat feature.\n+ Amazing sound and music. It's probably the most catching / enchanting music that I ever listened too in a game, and it's dynamic during a match as well.\n+ Easy to learn, hard to master (only with team play!)\n\n- The grahics of the enviroment could look better - but as soon as you are in battle you will only focus on the ships anyway, which are looking great.\n- Sometimes the matchmaking can take a while. But normally you will have a good chat (and laugh) with the other players that are waiting. (Just recently someone was reading a book, I think it was Henry Miller, and the others comment on the book and/or his reading skills. :P)\n\nHints when starting:\nGet a headset / Use your headset. And DON'T start as a captain.\n\nPS: Since I was a kid I loved the idea of flying ships. Standing on the bow of your ship and scanning the horizon for enemies with your spyglass, while floating through clouds and listening to the wonderful music, knowing that soon the quietness will turn into a mess of flames, detonations and smoke, is definetely something among the best moments that I had in games so far. :D","April 11","true","43.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is a game where you make friends, where you have fun, and where you forge a name for yourself. a few months ago, no-one on GOIO knew the name 'Caylin', but now, I'm a member of the current first place ranked team, with a mild infamy for my uniquely turquoise costumes and my love of firing lava from the hades light cannon ^^. I shortly became a community ambassador for the game after I joined the Gents, and have enjoyed through and through the experiences I've shared with new players and veterans alike. honestly, I can recommend this game to anyone who's willing to let it go and just have fun. talk to people in game, go crazy, brag and boast, yet prepare to learn. every captain, gunner and engineer has something to share, and you will always have something to learn.

I was a captain of a goldfish that I named "Nachez Riverchaser"\n\nPlaying alone, I gained a small reputation among the other loner captains. We would see each other in lobbies, wave hello, fly for a few matches, and then part ways.\n\nAt this point, I was coming up to a skill level where I would be solo flying against clan fleets. It was hard. They had the organization, communication, and fostered skills that my little goldfish and her ragtag crew couldn't handle. After some asking around, I found a mid-sized clan who took me under their wing.\n\nI rose quickly through the ranks, learning oceans more about flying than I ever would have on my own. We were a well-respected clan (and still are, as far as I know). As my experience skyrocketed, so did the difficulty of the captains I flew against. This is the point where the matches, the load outs, the strategies -- all became ludicrous. I felt less like a Han Solo and more like a Chess Master. Our ship skirmishes became shorter, faster, and more aggressive. Eventually, raw skill (something I relied heavily on in my career) became less important. It was a thinking game, and I was pretty good at it. Not the best – not by a longshot, but pretty good.\n\nI loved every minute of it. I still do.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone. There's no statistical progression, levels mean nothing. It’s very forgiving for casual players.\n\nThere are always waves of new players coming in.\nThe experienced players are all very polite and eager to teach new players. The devs are also extremely invested in the community.\n\nIt's loads of fun at every single skill level. I remember when I first started out, the spectacular skirmishes and explosions of Pyramidions as they clashed together in the clouds. And I love the ludicrous strategy that is needed for high ranking play.\n","July 8, 2015","true","445.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Puntosmx/recommended/209080/","Puntosmx","Puntosmx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Puntosmx/","228 products in account","I got this game in a Humble Bundle.\n\nThis is an online, team-based steampunk game where 4-prople crews battle it out on flying boats for number of kills or capture points.\n\nAs a player, you have 3 characters, each with a different role, and can switch them between matches. Customization includes clothing, hairdos, and a series of items/ammo/boosts classified by roles.\nThe heart of every ship is the captain, who needs to steer the ship, draw strategy and communicate effectively with the rest of the crew and allied captains. A skilled captain is crucial to success. Their items deal with driving the ship and finding enemies.\nMeanwhile, Engineers are the lifeblood that keep the makeshift boats flying. While it's usually the dullest role, it's crucial to avoid early termination. Their objects all deal with repairing the ship, with a bit of buffing.\nFinally, Gunners are the easiest path to learning the game. While it's very easy to set on a gun and shoot at enemies, the skill ceiling, range finding and ammo selection make it a more nuanced task.\nIncomplete crews get manned by AI, who are slightly competent at their jobs but lack the adaptability of actual players.\n\nWhile the game has everything it needs, there's a slight lack of map variety and game styles.\nIt would be awesome to have a scavenger hunt match type (digging into the theme of salvaged relics from wastelands), and a boss-style battle against giant ships manned by foreign potencies.\nWeapon and ship balance has been an ongoing stuggle, as minmaxers find overpowered matches, and a few ships with proven effective loadouts are the norm. Still, the game gets frequent updates and rebalances.\nThe worst part is the small playerbase. Would be awesome if this could get more players to populate the server.","May 28","true","53.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Cooperation and communication is the key to succeeding - in other words not a game for lone wolves and people just looking for action.\n\n\nIs this game for you?\n\nThe learning curve is a bit steep for new players, which can make gameplay a bit frustrating if you end up with people not knowing what they're doing. My best advice is to use a mic and try to find higher level players to join. Also, make sure you do the tutorial before entering any matches, as you won't be able to work together with your crew mates if you don't understand what needs to be done. A cooperative level 2 player is most times preferable over a level 15 player who doesn't communicate, due to the importance of teamwork. If you do end up on ships with inexperienced players, try to stick it out... I think there are many out there who give up on this game too fast, simply because they don't really get a taste of what it really is. I've heard several people say "Oh, so this is what this game is really about" once they get to play with more experienced players.\n\n\nThe gameplay\n\nWhen you're crewing a ship you'll hopefully get one or several main tasks from your captain. If you want to do a good job you'll want to stick to them, since the ship will most likely blow up if you don't. I can't stress this enough; It really is crucial that everyone on the ship do what they need to do in order for things to work. Joining (or forming) a clan is also good if you want to meet other cooperative players.\n\nGiven that you're on a ship with a decent crew, this game is just brilliant. Cruising along a mountain side with a steampunk airship looking for enemy ships is a great pastime activity, and the game has so much to offer once you get hold of the basics.\n\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you like the concept, don't give up on the game too fast. You may just have had bad luck with the crew mates or captains.","February 7, 2015","true","068.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This game is truly one of my favorite games. This whole bioshock inf. themed game (as so it seems) really goes good with the whole steam ships fighting. Love the terrian on the maps, great use of the enovirment such as a map were your in the desert and if you go into the dust it messes up your engine and all your other parts because of the dirt and dust getting into all the little parts.\n\nOther players/Crew\n\nThis is a VERY heavy depended game which if your crew is not all on the same page then it will show in your proformence.\n\n-Gunner This class is the firepower of your ship. Must be a good shot with cannon's/Galiting guns/Shotguns. He has the powers to change the ammo type, whether is be fire rounds or rounds that will fly fast and hit hard, but have a lot more bullet drop. Use them wisely and you will have a huge lead over your emeny.\n\n-Engi. Besides the pilot this is the most important job on the ship. When your ship on fire or needs a lot of repairs quick and fast the engi will take care of them if they know what they are doing. Your ship can go from good to bad in seconds and your engi needs to be on their feet and aware on whats going on.\n\n-Pilot This is normally the captain of the ship. It doesn't matter if you have the best crew if your pilot is not a good one or at least he knows what their are doing then you are completely screwed.\n\n8.5/10\n\n8.5 because if you get in a game with a bad crew then it just takes out of the game.

Basicaly, you are either an engineer, gunner or the pilot. Work togheter to be a good ship.\n\nLayer 2.\nMainly, the game is 2v2 (2 ships vs 2 ships) so not only do you work on your own ship, your ship should be helping the other ship.\n\nPut that on the other team also and you got hell of a competetive game.\n\nIt is actually a very very good competetive game in a completely different fashion than the usual strategy or fps. Its both in a way.\n\nIt can be quite confusing when starting the game out, not doing anything is worse than bots so Do the tutorials and read or watch guides/gameplay. And you will get the jist.\n\nIt is an amazing game to start seriouse on as it complements working togheter very very well.","November 26, 2013","true","771.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm going to assume the low score is there partly because when you start the game aren't too many maps you can choose from, giving an impression of a limited game. As I've understood it, this is only so that you get practice on the easier levels before you go and navigate in the really dangerous ones. Once you reach lvl 4 in any crew role you'll get plenty more and the selection is about as numerous and varied as most FPS games, Killing Floor for example. These include a desert with component damaging dust clouds, a water temple zone, a foggy fjord and an ambush oriented canyon. When I got the game, there were only two play modes, but the devs have been adding new ones like Crazy King. There is also a good variety of ships, guns, and tools to use in different roles as a part of the crew so you'll have a different kind of match to play everytime you get to it.\n\nThe graphics are good, the art style beautiful and the gameplay very polished. Starting players will be aware of only a few basic approaches to battle but the more you play the more you start to understand the potential for different tactics, using all of your guns to their full advantage, coordinating with other ships on your team etc. The community is one of the friendliest online gaming communities I've personally interacted with, most everyone is there to enjoy the game. As always, some players will give others a piece of their mind though. Still, as a new player I got good advice from those with more experience and no one was bashing me for making noob mistakes. Newbies are also restricted to play with other relatively new players (you can opt out from this if you wish), so you propably wont be completely decimated even when you're learning the ropes.\n\nThe current game is just skirmish mode (different online battle modes) but the developers are looking to release an adventure mode in 2015; imagine an MMO world with airships, factions, trade and quests and you propably have the right general idea. With what they've managed to do so far I do have confidence that the adventure mode will be a good product as well. They already have the ship-to-ship combat nailed down, all they need is to expand the world they have already visioned and you can find info about on their site.\n\nIf you've ever thought gliding through the skies on an airship would be awesome, if you enjoy tactical cooperative play, or if you enjoy steampunk aesthetics I can highly recommend this game - I've had some of my most engaging and fun gaming experiences on it. If the themes don't make you feel excited but you like online team based multiplayer games, Guns of Icarus is still a solid choice but you may want to hope for another sale to get it.","July 5, 2014","true","46.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's not your usual kind of mmo where the amount you pay will determine how far you can get in the gameworld. Here you purchase the title once, and after that everything depends on your skills and your team's level of cooperation. Item shop items are purely cosmetic stuff, and some of them are given away for free during character progression anyway.\n\nWorking together is essential in this game, and one of the aspects that new players don't always understand first, which is why early gameplay can get difficult and full of lost battles. On the other hand, you can be extremely skillful from the start, depending on how fast you are willing to learn the game mechanics. There are many useful guides around, and most high level players will be more than happy to tell you everything you need to know.\n\nIt's most fun with microphone, especially if you wanna be a captain, but I know many great players who do very well and enjoy the game without mics. Some people say that you can't succeed in this without real life friends playing with you, but that's not true, most people here play and become friends without ever having met in real life.Yet, I'd recommend building an in-game friend list as soon as you start, adding people you had fun with, as the game gets more and more enjoyable and personal if you fight with familiar folks, and not always with completely new crew members.\n\nGameplay and fighting system has a great variety and allows for numerous combinations. You can select ships, weapons, tools, maps, and all of these will determine the outcome. Because of that, preparation in lobbies can get long and tiresome sometimes, even boring, if you wanna play fast, but great victories always require great planning and preparation anyway, so consider it a part of gameplay to discuss strategies while you wait for teams to fill up. Don't forget that this is partly a strategy game, even though it offers action as well, and you gotta discuss tactics with your team at one point, and lobbies are the perfect places for that.\n\nMany people complain about the community and its rules being too restrictive, but most rules that the community guidelines include are perfectly normal and basic considerations asking for perfectly normal and basic human behaviour, such as "please don't spam and troll the global chat with profanity and/or racist comments because nobody is interested in them". The difference compared to other games is that here the community takes an active part in making sure that these guidelines are not just empty words on the game's website, but are actually kept in-game.\n\nAltogether this game is truly exciting, gives a new experience each time you fly, since nothing will be the same twice. Crews, captains, ships, maps, everything changes with each match, and that makes every battle feel unique. Also, for steampunk lovers, it's a must! :)","January 1, 2014","true","405.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So here's my over-due review.\n\nThis game is heavily based around teamwork; your task each game is to communicate with your crew - that consists of 3 other real people - and other ships on your team to effictively destroy your enemies. There are a range of maps that include beautiful landscapes and post-apocalyptic scenery, where you must navigate and fight. Currently there are 3 game modes: Deathmatch, King of the Hill, and Crazy King. (The last two basically being capture the point). Teams can go as high as 4v4, and as low as 2v2 and each ship holds 4 crew members with a total of 7 different and interesting ships to fly. There are also 3 classes; Pilot, Engineer and Gunner. Each person takes on their role and performs their duties aboard their ship, whether they are the Pilot who has control over the ship and co-ordinates with their allies, or the Engineer who must keep the ship alive and shipshape. Or even a gunner who's speciality is manning the many guns and many ammo types. Either way, teamwork is key in this game.\n\nNew players are recommended to play the tutorials which give a basic understanding of how the game mechanics work. But don't fret, you wont be thrown into the deep end as soon as you start playing. There are a host of servers that only Novice players can enter so that new poeple can learn together with other new people and better learn the game. But the help doesn't stop there. This game's community is simply fantastic. Those who are willing to learn are easily taught by the veteran players and even the game's own version of teachers called Community Ambassadors - picked by the Muse team - who love to teach. So if you like to troll and be really rude and obnoxious, this game is not for you. But if you're looking for a fun game with great people, look no further ;)","September 6, 2015","true","189.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The mechanics are fairly simple and easy to learn (but often hard to master, as i will explain). The game is at it's best when you are on a ship with a competent crew which  communicates  (preferably with microphones). This is key to success because it allows proper teamwork. No single pro player can hope to carry a match without a good team.\nWhile this can make the game more engaging and thrilling, it also creates it's greatest weakness: being stuck with incompetant/silent/uncooperative player(s) that jeporadise the ship. There is really little you can do about this.\n\nIf you can get past this seemingly unavoidable weakness, then the game can be a hell of alot of fun. There really is something awesome about blasting ships out of the sky or weaving in and out of combat or feeling like your manic wrench wacking is the only thing holding your ship together! With friends it's even better. you feel like your part of a well oiled killing machine!","August 31, 2015","true","82.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That craving for a really good, and well made co-op game? Where there is real strategy without it being a board game? Even with the customizability of an RPG? Well look around no more! For here lies the game that so many are searching for but have not found. Guns of Icarus is one of the most amazing online games I have ever played, and is definately worth the money to buy! But if you are like me, you want to know the pros and cons so here is a quick breakdown for ya! First off, the bad news...since it is the shortest part.\n\n=cons=\n-Pretty steep learning curve at first. But after a day of playing and reading a guide or 2 you kinda get the hang of it.\n-Semi-difficult interface. Some of the features are a bit confusing at first and may stump the average joe who is picking up the game. But again, this can be overcome by a day of playing and reading a guide.\n-"First game" jeebies. Because this game is so dependant on a functioning team, when you first start off, it seems quite daunting and it feels as though every mishap is your fault. But don't worry. The game selection is fitted with a newbie section for ranks 1-3, so you aren't jumping into an expert match. And everyone generally remembers the fact that they had to deal with that as well and are quite understanding. In fact, for the most part, the community is very willing to help you find your "sea legs"\nAnd wouldn't ya know it! That's the end of the cons! Now for the good stuff :)\n\n+pros+\n-One of the best multiplayer setups I have ever played!\n-Very simple, yet in depth strategy that makes the game so much more than just runnin and gunnin\n-Great community! Even though this community isn't as large as TF2 or whatnot, it is still large enough that you can always find a game, and is very helpful and kind to newbies\n-Amazing soundtrack! which for some people is no big deal, but my life is surprisingly centered around music, so it is a big plus in my book :)\n-Amazing graphics! For an online multiplayer game, that is under $20, it has very good graphics and is very visually appealing.\n-Personalization of both your character's loadout, and your ship's build\n-so good that I'm having a hard time remembering every single good thing about it because there are so many! :)\nBasically there are so many good things to this game for such small, and easily overcomeable cons, that it is not a gamble at all for whether or not you should buy it. I was quite hesitant at first, but now that I have bought it, I don't regret it! So if you like co-op, strategy, steampunk games that are rated 15 on an epic scale of 1-10, it is definately worth the money! :) Hope this has been helpful!","August 6, 2014","true","15.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atruejedi/recommended/209080/","atruejedi","Jamison","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atruejedi/","364 products in account","Guns of Icarus Online is the little game that could. Please ignore the Metacritic score; this game has been updated and tweaked and polished and fixed and balanced beyond belief. If you played the original Guns of Icarus (not online), it was, well, pretty terrible. But it was a good proof of concept; even if it was torturous to play, you KNEW it could be epic with just a bit more effort and funding! Enter Guns of Icarus Online: the best team-centered game I've played in years. Sure, Team Fortress 2 might have the word "team" in its name, but in TF2, a skilled player can just run rampant on the enemy and perhaps swing the balance of the game. In other words, teamwork is beneficial but not required. In Super Monday Night Combat, team work is so essential that having one n00b on your team tolls the death knell every single game. SMNC is unforgiving and frustrating in that respect, which is why I abandoned it. But then there's Guns of Icarus Online. GOI works differently. It strikes the perfect balance between individual skill and teamwork. Teamwork is ESSENTIAL for victory, but having a new player on your ship won't guarantee defeat. The key is communication between the crew and the captain and between the captain and his fellow captains. This is not a twitch shooter. This is a thinking man's game. You choose your ship, you choose your tools, you choose your ammo, and you make the best of a hectic situation when the bullets start flying. The GOI community is one of (if not) the most mature I've played with; new players are welcomed aboard if they're willing to be patient and learn the mechanics of the game. The game features a variety of flyable ships and different classes and "class mods" to keep those ships sailing and shooting. The variety is fairly expansive, but there's still room for additional content, which developers Muse frequently add, free of charge. In a word, GOI deserves your time, your respect, your kind words, and your money. I got the game on sale on Steam in the spring of 2012 and, after realizing what a gem I'd purchased, I kick-started their Adventure Mode campaign for twice the retail price of the game and purchased in-game items from the devs to customize my character. Give Guns of Icarus Online a chance and you will not regret it. Make a cocktail, swab the poop deck, avast ye mateys, load your ammunition of choice, give 'em a FULL BROADSIDE, and then once you achieve RAMMING SPEED make another cocktail.  There's bad dudes out there that need their steampunk-powered clocks cleaned, and your time has come.

Its a great game to play with friends. I do think you can enjoy this game alone though. Its a very team oriented game though, so be prepared to be cooperative. It consists of three main roles, The Captain, The Gunner, And The Engineer.\n\nThe Captain is self explanatory, this is the person that is most likly going to be screaming commands at you through the build-in voice chat.\n\nThe Gunner is your main offensive, they are the one's that man the guns most of the time. They mainly control the damage that is put out on the enemy.\n\nThe Engineer is probably one of the most important roles, this is the person that makes sure the ship doesnt blow up. They are in charge of repairing anything and everything at once.\n\nI have a lot of fun with this game, and I think you could too.\n\nI give this game a 10/10\n\n<3","May 22","true","9.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I took a break and had food, good food mind you. Then I played it twice. Yet again I took a break. This time I slept. I slept for 9 hours. The alarm clock went off at 9AM but I turned it off. When I finally woke up at 9:04AM I had breakfast. It was a waffle. Some syrup was on it. I forgot to toast it though. The syrup was warm so it made up for it. By this time I was full. I stood up and pushed my chair in. Only enough so I could get up mind you. I washed the plate and my hands, with soap, mind you. It was lemon strawberry coconut soap, what will they think up next? luckily it was only 9:18Am now so I could still get to school before I was hungry again. I drove to school. Then I parked my car. I parked on the 3rd space from the left. Then I realized I forgot my pants. But it was ok because it was a dream. Then I woke up it was actually 9:05AM. Figuring I woudln't be able to make it too school before I was hungry I played the game a thrid time. Then I realized it was lunch. I had a taco. From Taco Bell. I had runs the next day. It ruined my toilet. I went to the doctor for my illness and I got a medicine for it. It tasted worse than baby vomit. baby vomit doesn't tast good. I then played the game a fourth time. This time I stopped and watched the TV. Nothing good was on it. Thats because I dusted though. Normally I have a really cool action figure of the pope on the top right corner.

One person slacking can ruin it. I have the most fun with real friends. Dont touch it much otherwise. Also, please have a mic.\n\nGraphics 6/10\n^Average. Not bad. Not amazing. They get the job done and will probably age nicely.\n\nControls 10/10\n^ With keybindings it is hard to mess up on this. The game does what you tell it to.\n\nReplay Value\n6/10\nYou can play this game forever. That would warrant a 10/10. HOWEVER, the game is not rewarding or rather, you play the same game over and over. Yes, different people make each match special.\nBut imagine your favorite moba game. Everone has every character unlocked and there are only half as many characters. It is great fun for a while. But eventually, things get repetitive and dare I say boring.\n\nIn Game Store\n10/10\nNot in your face.\nPurely cosmetic.\nPerfect.\n\nBalance\n5/10\nWhile the ships and weapons are balanced players are not. With a smaller community it can be difficult to fly with people of your level.\nThat goes for within your own ship, and even against other players.\nIf your engineer does not know what to repair, your gunner has bad aim, or your pilot turns your ship into a sitting target, it does not matter how good you are as an individual.\n\nNormally, this is where matchmaking, and some sort of player skill balance comes into play.\nBut with a smaller community, this is not exactly the best choice to segregate players.\n\nMatchmaking\n5/10\nIt can be difficult to get into a game.\nYou can always find games.\nBut, it can take a while.\n\nGame modes 4/10\nPlenty of game modes exist, and are played. I think this almost hurts the game though, because it puts players in a position of wanting to play a certain gamemode, and potentially nobody wants to play that mode. if 300 people are spread out over say 6 game modes(deathmatch,king of hill, crazy king, 2v2-3v3-4v4 etc) Not including different maps.\n\nThats about 50 people maybe wanting to play with you. Take into consideration about 7 matches in each game mode and you are down to about 7 people trying to do what you are doing. That assumes no1 is afk or goes afk when you are making a match.\nTo be fair, finding a match isnt always all that difficult. It more often than not requires a higher level of patience.\n\nOverall 5/10\nThat isnt bad! It is decent, and fun will be had. It is worth a look. It is not your typical game. has its issues, but is solid fun.\n\nWith actual friends 8.5/10\nYes, there is a huge advantage to be had when playing with people you know and generally play games with. This is where the game shines. Plan to play with others, either make friends or get your friends to play with you. but fun will be had.","June 14, 2014","true","24.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I opened my mouth as my tongue started firing blanks. I had no idea how to describe this game. I thought for all of about a minute and then my mouth painstakingly howled, "Pirates of the Sky!" and then I fell over from my brain overworking itself. I can only imagine how this is going to turn out...\n\nGuns of Icarus: Online (henceforth to be called GoI:O for the rest of this review) is Multiplayer only, Team based, Matchmaking, Ship flying...*inhale*...damn thats a lot, created by a development team called MUSE and damn do they have something with this game. I found this game way back in the olden days of I believe March of 2013 when a youtuber by the name of Markiplier participated in a Polaris  organized match with several other youtubers and members of the development team. I remember wondering to myself, "Why would a character of Greek Mythology need a firearm?" Several reasons actually, but the point is that my jaw disconnected and hit the floor.\n\nThe game takes place in a post-apocalyp-stick type world that for once didn't end in either the usual Nuclear blast, zombie attack or act of God. This world tore itself and new fecal defecator in a giant, global war that has divided the world into several large, powerful and very 1910s nations and has created new weapons of war; this including your valient war horses. In this game you fly ships. No, that isn't an oxymoron, you actually FLY. SHIPS! These ships are essentially the Black Pearl meets Hindenburg, but with more firepower and personality then Chuck Norris' beard. And each ship is drastically different in playstyle, armnament and design.\n\nOn this subject of gamplay, the gameplay of GoI:O is like nothing I have ever played before, but for the sake of you I will divide my thoughts into the the three classes: Pilot, Engineer, and Gunner. Lets start with the easiest one, the Gunner. His or Her main job is to the fire the guns on the ship (No ♥♥♥♥♥e, Herr Sherlock!) and not much else. However, this roll is a highly specialized one in that the gunner needs to know how to fire EVERY guns there is, which is a Herculian task considering that each gun is different and travels differently in the world. Some weapons are really good and range while others just have too much of an arch to fire accurately or just explode in mid air.\n\nSpeaking of explosions, lets talk about Engineers. If you like stressful work environments where your sole job is to run around like a Banshee repairing things like mad, this is for you! Okay, I'm being dramatic here, but the Engineer has what I believe to be the most important and difficult job. They are the all-arounders, constantly moving about the ship checking the various components of the ship and filling jobs as they come up with their wide assortment of tools. They will frequently be called upon to go on full repairs, fire weapons, spot enemy ships, and even take the helm depending on who you fly with. It is one of the most fun, difficult, and rewarding positions you can have in this game.\n\nFinally we come to my favorite position: Piloting. Flying these babys around in normal conditions is challenging enough depending on what map you play, but flying under fire takes some serious cajones, as the Latin peoples call it. As I said before, each ship has its own different playstyle so it is easy for up and coming Captains to find their fit or even prefer multiple ships over others (Pyramidion Master Race), so the creativity from all the different tactics for flying each ship and  tools to gain the advantage over your enemies through smoke screens, impact bumpers or even magical "Take me up now" fuel, really astounds me and manages to always make me wonder, "How the hell did he do that?!"\n\nNot only does this game offer a straight up Team Deathmatch in 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 gamemodes in ship vs. ship combat, but it also has a very difficult game mode of capturing differnt territories on the map and collecting resources until you reach the max cap of points and win. Sadly, this is the only other gamemode, which really sucks because I'm sure Muse has some really awesome ideas in the pipe. However, the awesome beauty and detail of the maps that makes you feel like your on an epic journey kinda makes up for this. Plus there is going to be an MMO release of this game later in 2014, so hey, who am I to complain. A real ♥♥♥, thats what I'd be.\n\nProbably the most commendable thing that Muse has done is the community they have created in this game. Without a doubt it is the best on Steam. There, I said. Go ahead and argue with me, but I haven't seen a single rude or idiotic person on this game until Pewdiepie attrached his fans to the game. Most of the community is very helpful and understanding to new players and even the developers remain active in the game, not just on forums, but actually playing the game with people and constantly asking what they could add or make better. They've even set up 'Community Ambassadors' that serve to keep the chat clean and game experience the best it can be. There are even several active clans that hold scheduled matches against eachother like you would see on a Starcraft twitch stream. *Ahem* go clan lol!\n\nAll in all, this game is so fun and creative that I don't think I could ever write a proper review for it. My best suggestion would be to play the game for yourself and just let the excellence rain all over you. Or is that Moonshine?\n\nAnyways, Guns of Icarus: Online gets 8 mallets to the hull out of 10.","March 10, 2014","true","636.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","6"

No role appears greater than the other, and the game is balanced with plenty of options for crewmates to try out: different tools, different ships, and different weapons, including cannons, guns, and flamethrowers. Once you crash, it really feels as if a team effort to charge into the next battle to make up for losses; and once the other ship goes down leaving a trail of black smoke across your deck, it's the most satisfying feeling in the world.\n\nI wish there were more steampunk games that existed out there, and even if you're not much for the lifestyle, the gameplay is solid still immensely enjoyable. It provides an excellent break from all of the first/third person shooters that flood our gaming market today.

In the beginning levels of the game, with the straighforward deathmatch game mode, you can easily pilot a pyramidion or goldfish and simply command the AI to gun your targets down with the accuracy only a computer can achieve. However in later games, you may find that running a ghost ship is not your best option, but I digress. This game does nothing but promote co-op play. There is no kicking other players, and that's great. This has created a community of people who are more than happy to help their teammates with any questions they have, since that contributes to their chances of winning. There is no inherent "leveling" system that gives anyone a better advantage then the other. Levels in different roles simply show that you know your way around a ship and give people an idea of your overall skill level. Cosmetic awards are lackluster in the beginning, but go on to become gradually cooler looking, though some of these can be bought outright. I personally wouldn't pay $2 for a virtual gas mask to cover my character's poncey face, but that's just me.\n\nThis game is entirely skill based, there's no pay-to-win system, it's fun and you can spend weeks getting to know each class, and even longer with the ships. I reccommend playing this with some friends, as relying on strangers is a hit or miss situation. Maybe you want to pilot a Junker with nothing but engineers (Which works better than you'd think), chances are your friend would be cooler with that then someone who's very used to the straightforward tactics.\n\nAll in all, if you like co-operating with your teammates and skill based ship battling games, then definitely buy this game. The devs obviously put alot of love and even threw down the groundworks for some lore (which I hear will contribute to a possible open world "Adventure" dlc).","June 23, 2014","true","32.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Because this beautiful game actually requires you to:\n-THINK\n-COMMUNITCATE\n-BE A TEAM\n\nSet in a jaw dropping steam-punk style world with plenty of ships, maps, and tools to make it not only authentic, but highly impressive for an air-ship combat environment.\n\nPros:\n\n-RIDICULOUSLY easy to pick up and learn the roles/tools/ships/maps. This makes the learning curves simple when synergized with the achievement progress. Any class can do anything on the ship, but may access certain tools when doing their respective job. You have a: Pilot, gunner, and Engineer. All which are essential to every ship\n-Interesting idea.\n-Though very few customization, each thing proves it purpose accordnig to how you fly (assuming you’re a captain of the crew)\nThis game needs time to invest. Games are decently long and offer a whole new experience to FPS. Aside from Steampunk themed-skybox sexiness, the core gameplay is without a doubt fun; No matter what class you play. The slow game play requires you to think, as mentioned before. This maybe a turn off to A LOT OF PEOPLE, considering many game industries are now aiming for ways to make gameplay faster.\n\nCons:\n-The Achievement system is in a style that asks for repetition of certain things, yet get progressively more obscure later on as our progress. While it aids in learning the game, it maybe be difficult to pull off certain things along. Leaving people like me who’ve flown thousands of matches, seem a little behind.\n\n\n-Slow game play. That will be a major turn off. Though I look down upon it being a problem to begin with, it is what is, and I know most people will complain about it.\n-May be uninteresting and boring after a few days on it. The game doesn’t offer that much in terms of gameplay or items (though they will have content every once in a while like most games). Combining this with the speed of the game may make some people fall asleep.\n\nThis game has a possibility to be extremely boring to many. There are also minor bug/glitches (which all games have), and this ultimately turns the game into a waste of your money; especially when combined with its slowness. That seems to be the only problem (aside from no one wanting to be pilot). Again, if you’re looking for in-action heart pounding games, this isn’t for you. Otherwise, I say get it \n","January 27, 2014","true","34.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It seems to settle around 200 players during a weekday evening a couple months after the most recent sale. Check SteamCharts for more info. However, as the player population is mostly concentrated in the Americas and Europe, there might only be some 40 players or so when you decide to give GoI a spin 4AM in the morning. But you'll still be able to find a match, thanks to the existence of AI crewman! That is, as long as you're fine with flying the ship while everyone else on your ship is an AI.\n\nPoint is, don't worry about never getting into matches.\n\nOn sale or not, Guns of Icarus is quite the steal if it turns out to be your cup of tea. I highly advise those on the fence to watch some Youtube Lets Plays of the game. They'll give you a pretty good idea of what you'll be flying into.","October 15, 2015","true","606.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

So try not to be to quickly defeated, and do know that plenty of players do take a bit of time to plan out ship and crew loadouts. Also a great part is that every ship, and class as well as tools are available without requiring DLC or microtransactions. Really the only microtransactions are costmetics(ship and character), which just adds to your ability to make yourself stand out if you wish. Certain cosmetics can be unlocked by leveling each class.\n\nI'll end to say, that with nearing 500 hours and 1200 matches, it's been great so far and going to continue to play.","May 19, 2014","true","740.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It cannot be stressed enough that this is a game where you work together as a team to keep the ship afloat and take down the enemy ship or capture the point.\n\nThere is a total of 3 roles which is the gunner, engineer and pilot with a total of 4 spots on each ship. Each class specialized in their role and every one of them has a stamina bar that is useful for the specific class which on default is on the Shift key. However, anyone can grab the helm to fly the ship, shoot the guns and fix the ship. So on any emergency like the captain disconnecting or engineer busy with fixing the balloon, the gunner can help steer the ship to safety and give the hull a tap.\n\nIt's extremely hard to care for a ship all alone however, especially when starting out so it's best to have 4 people on the ship to divide the work! Don't have any friends or any playing yet? No worries, the game will set you up with random players to work together and even if there is a chance a few of those spots weren't taken the AIs will help substitute those roles with the F1, F2 and F3 button to control them until the end of the match or till someone else decides to join the ship mid game.\n\nThe community is always friendly to new players as long as you're willing to listen and communicate. If you're confused don't be afraid to ask, there are community ambassadors who are specifically there to help along and many other players who will also give you advices and tips for the game.\n\nIt is highly recommended to finish the tutorial before you begin because even though it is a fairly easy game to pick up, you might not understand the tools which may frustrate not only you but other players in the middle of the match as well. There are multiple ships and guns to choose from so experiment around and accept recommendation unless you can explain why you declined it with the captain. Gunners are not the only class that can shoot guns so don't worry if the captain wants a crew with 3 engineers.\n\nPS.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misharoman/recommended/209080/","misharoman","Mr. Darkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misharoman/","86 products in account","Guns of Icarus, a game-simulator of REPAIRTHEHULLYOUIDIOTS.\n\nRather unique game with various game modes. As you start with the Novice level (levels before lvl 8 of any class) you are given simple ships to control ("Goldfish", "Pyramideon" and "Junker"). Every ship has their own unique pros or cons so it depends on what kind or ship you choose for your team. Each ship has around 3 engines, 1 hull and a balloon, as well as the guns. The hull is the most important part as it works like your armor which can be repaired. If this armor is down your ship takes damage, the ship damage can not be repaired.\nA team can be max up to 3 ships with their own crew. And the only way to contact the other crew in-game is either by having captains speak in their private voice chat or in the team text chat that entire team can see.\n\nIt doesn't have next-gen graphics but all the locations and views are beautiful so I give it 8/10.\n\nThere are 3 classes to play: Captain, Gunner and Engineer. All of the classes can do eachother's roles, but without being able to use "Boost" ability on things they are not meant to be doing (such as boost for the ship [captain], boost for reload speed [gunner] or boost for run speed [engineer]). Each class also has 1 item/perk that is used for either guns or the ship or for the repairing (depending on which class they do NOT belong to).\nThere is only 1 captain in the crew. His main priority is to control the ship and use his perks to give it buffs for the cost of damage per second to engines or balloons, some for the cost of movement priorities.\nThe gunner's task is to... well, wield guns. He has 3 perks that he can use, each of them has specific affection on the gun's priorities, such as attack speed, clip size, damage and projectile speed. He can also repair stuff but less efficiently (given he has only 1 tool that he can use for repairing)\nEngineer is the hero of your crew and possibly the second gunner if has good affiliations with the guns and his single perk that he has. If there were to be a comparison between a moba and Guns of Icarus, engineer is your support. Engineer wields 3 different tools. Each tool has their own priority for fixing and extinguishing fire. Engineer's tools are rather different from perks of Gunner and Captain. His tools either repair a big amount of health but have a big cooldown on repairing; have a good fire extinguishing power but low fire immunity time, and so forth. Playing engineer is rather hard, unless the Captain gives you good builds and orders for keeping your ship alive.\nEven though a crew can hold on well enough without an engineer by being able to fix their ship, they won't last long enough since it will distract the entire crew to fixing the ship.\n\nThere is also a variety of different maps. There are big maps and medium maps. Big ones are only open to non-novice difficulty. The environment is also quite dangerous in these maps. There are sand storms and snow storms that will do bad things like damaging your ship when in it.\n\nFinally, there is customization. In order to not have your ships and characters look all the same you can modify their colors, skins, hats, clothes, ship's logo, ships colors, etc, etc. You unlock some while you can also buy the rest from the in-game store. Note, these do NOT give any perks or advantages for your team, only the cool looks.\n\nAll in all, this game highly relies on crew communication and strategy of your captains.\nI don't think we would of ever seen a game like this, it makes communication the first priority in any crew.","May 27, 2015","true","40.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Imagine you and your friends cooperating together as a fully-functioning crew doing various tasks (controlling the helm, manning the guns, repairing engines, etc) working together as one to thwart the opposing crew, just like organs in a body working together to achieve an objective. Imagine your adrenaline rush when you are busy fixing the hull of your ship as the enemy closes in starboard side and no one is manning the gun and you enthusiastically called for help while the captain directs someone to repair the balloon due to losing altitude. Imagine working together with 2 other crew teams against 3 opposing teams (12v12) in the midst of a Sandstorm, imagine a game full of adrenaline, tactics and chaos.\n\nThat game is Guns of Icarus Online.\n\nIf there is any game that tests your cooperation, look no further. The graphics are deeply immersive with various maps and airships, coupled with amazing music that warrants you into the Steampunk Universe. You can choose among 3 roles (Captain, Engineer and Gunner), which gives you added advantage performing specific tasks. As the ship requires someone to steer, gunners to man the gun, engineers to fix ship components in the midst of a battle, everyone will have things to do at all times and you will have to do it in tandem with the other players.\n\nThere are currently a total of 7 ships available to choose from (3 for Novice matches), and the fact that each ships has a different layout as well as stats really gives each one a very different feel and a very large-scale of depth for any team albeit anyone to master.\n\nMy own experience was a blast as I played this game along with three other RL friends, we have switched various ships and realized how extensive this game was as each of these ships give a very different feel. We found one that works though, and performance really showed when we decided to use this ship. Overall we are playing non-novice matches regularly and each session are always packed with high amounts of adrenaline and gameplay depth.\n\nNegative points\nTo be fair, there are some quirks and negative points if you really want to pick and prod, here are some minor negative points that we pick up if you are really concerned:\n- Open information prior to match is open to abuse where dirty abusive players (or those who want to win no matter what) will customize their loadout to counter yours.\n- Player customization is very minimal, but perhaps this is due to their business model.\n- In-game description does not really match and is often misleading, to really understand each of the weapons/bullets/ships, it is critical to have a hands-on experience in each of them.\n\nDespite that, overall this game has totally blew our mind as it totally went above and beyond our expectations\n\nTL/DR\nThis piece of gem has flown under my radar for so long and judging by the fact that none of my friends from various gaming communities has ever mentioned this game is simply ludicrous. This game is an absolute blast! If you have friends (4 as a team), please buy it already.","June 16, 2015","true","17.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But where other games focus on twitch reactions and the like, Guns of Icarus is more of a deliberate slow burner. Every move you make is critical, but a quick trigger finger is less important than setting up where you are going next. Once you get in close and all hell breaks loose, it is rare to feel cheated in the event of destruction - it just means you have to regroup and try a new approach. Half the fun is in the endlessly replayable variance of trying to overcome different captains and their new tricks while maneuvering between the canyons, wrecks and sandstorms of the map.\n\nEven before you get into an actual match, there is a huge amount of customisation and planning you can undertake to provide subtle advantages (and disadvantages). Not only do the three classes (Pilot, Engineer, Gunner) each have special 'stamina' abilities dedicated to the left shift key which range from enhanced ship mobility, quicker reloading and faster in person sprinting, but they also have access to extra slots for their respective class items that dictate what they can do. Engineers can choose from various repair tools, Gunners from a variety of ammo types and Pilots can pick from a number of ship-based 'buff' abilities that can help maneuver in times of trouble. This, coupled with the large number of cool airships each with their own unique configurations of customisable weapon placements, gives the entire game an impressive level of tactical feel few others match. Do you go for the long range barrages of a Hwacha-armed Galleon, or hope to outmaneuver it with a zippy flamer-equipped Squid?\n\nThe community itself is welcoming and pleasantly receptive to banter - I have had no trouble with anyone, and though not everyone has mics there is a comprehensive set of commands issuable via the 'V' key to cover almost all situations. If you DO get a team full of mics, though, then it turns into a joyful mad cacophany of communication as gunners call out targets out of arc and engineers shout out for help putting out engine fires while the Pilot converses with the other captains calling out battle plans.\n\nAll in all, it is definitely worth the money whether you are just looking for a fresh multiplayer experience or you are after something deeper and far more unique than available elsewhere. The 4-pack is a steal, and even more so when it is on sale.\n\nGrab some friends and rule the high skies !","February 17","true","95.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Для достижения поставленной цели был создан проект на сайте Kickstarter.com и безумная толпа фанатов брызжа слюной бросилась кидать деньги прямо в монитор. Баснословная сумма в размере $35,237 (из запланированных $10,000) окончательно свела с ума молодых разработчиков, и они пустились во все тяжкие.

Результатом затянувшегося трипа 27 октября 2012 года стала госпитализация всего состава студии, а через пару дней состоялся релиз игры в сервисе Steam.

It's 4 players per ship and it's ship v ship. Though the only downside that many players face. Is that you cannot board other ships. And it's hard to find a comptent crew sometimes. Though most the community is really helpful, and they are not afraid to show others how to work a certain part of the ship. And there is a lot of competetive play to it using the WANTED system. Where players can choose to become a WANTED person, and have to win matches to build a score. Doing so at the end of each period yields rewards. With that, I definately recommend this game to anyone that likes SteamPunk style games.

With the roles of: Captain, Engineer and Gunner the essential part of the gaming experience is the teamplay. As one team consists of two to three ships (which by the way also have unique roles like tanking damage or sniping) it can be a very challenging game for those of you who want to battle other players with unique tactics and crazy ideas.\n\nIf on the other hand you dont want to think about your every move but rather set the enemy on fire or destroy them with a swarm of rockets this game will absolutely rock your day too since you can join a crew as a gunner and blast the enemy to hell with a quite impressive arsenal of weapons (all picked by the captain).\n\nNow if you want to help the captain to keep the ship afloat and help your team by not only repairing the ship but also buffing specific parts to increase performance and allowing the captain to outmanouver the enemy. Then the engineer is a class well suited for you. But dont worry every good gunner knows his way around a gun to help out his gunner colleague.\n\nAs a Captain you will have little time to use a gun or repair the ship since you will be busy managing not only your ship but also knowing where and when to strike to fully utilice your crew and ship. As I mainly play this role I can assure you it is not an easy job to do but one worth every second doing it if you successfully flank an enemy, catch them of guard after an well planned manouver or scaring the crap out of them if you burst guns blazing out of a cloud singing a song of doom and destruction.\n\nNow to the technical part:\nThe game looks nice but is not a graphic festival. The effects like explosions are well done and the textures are well chosen and of good quality. The game runs fine on about any pc (if you have a notebook which is very old you might have laggs inside of clouds or if the enemy is burning you with a flamethrower). The servers run fine and a ping up to 150 is about not noticable which makes finding a server alot easier.\n\nGameplay:\nWell done even though i miss sprinting\nThe ships fly nicely and i like the time it takes them to react to your command (feels more real this way). Gunplay is good though a bit hard to learn for long ranges since you and your target are mostly moving at a very fast pace.\n\nBalance:\nWell balanced weapons even though at the moment the flamethrower seems to be a bit strong since they render weapons unusable fairly quickly (like i said its not like they are overpowered they are just a hinch to strong in my opinion)\n\nNegative:\nthe AI cant gun for ♥♥♥♥ = you need a lot of people to play the game with the most fun (3-4 people at least) but since the community is pretty nice you almost always find  good team to stay with for a while.\ncertain ships need each other ( flying a spire(good damage oriented ship) together with another random ship will most likely end badly since the spire needs to be protected and not everybody knows that.\n\nPositive:\nFun game to play with friends. almost everyone finds something he/she wants to do. Pretty difficult at the beginning since you have to learn a lot in action. Nice community. Cool developers who will fight with and against you and are good at the game. A lot of future stuff planned like coop missions and an entire mmorpg world ruled by players . Decent graphics nice gameplay and a lot of thinking to do. Very team oriented gameplay the team with the better teamwork nearly always wins (exceptions will occure with harpoon squids). You have the ability to simply mute annoying players.\n","June 17, 2014","true","152.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great variety unlock-able customizations for your character and ship. It is a little grindy if your not an achievement go getter but it is a great experience. The A.I. system is also one of the best I have seen as well. They follow commands on key and do only what is necessary. I notice a lot of thinking is required for this, after all it is a strategy game. All 3 categories has to have some sort of plan whether your engineer or gunner and especially the captain. All in all, great game. Loved it and totally recommend it.","July 9, 2014","true","62.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To get my "opinion" out of the way, this is the greatest game I have ever played. Now that that is settled, to the game itself.\n\nI'm sure that you've read various other reviews telling you that the game is very team oriented. I cannot stress this enough, and let me tell you why. Since this is an FPS game, there is NO 3rd PERSON MODE. Not even as the pilot. This forces the crew members to cooperate with eachother in a way that I have never experienced before, and it is something to behold. Communication and cooperation are key, whether the balloon and engines need repair, the gunner is slightly out of range, a sandstorm is approaching from behind, or an enemy ship is right above you, everyone has to be ready to communicate.\n\n"But thats impossible! No gaming community is cooperative, or friendly, enough to offer that kind of experience." Let me tell you that again and again the community that composes this game is not only the most friendly, but the most helpful that I have ever encountered. As a newcomer I knew this game like the back of my hand in no time, thanks to the help of some random players I met in game lobbies. The lobbies are full of fun times and cool people from all over, and everyone wants everyone to have a good game experience.\n\nLast, but cetainly not least, the gameplay. Flying these ginormous clunky ships is something you won't find anywhere else. It is a unique experience that requires a bit of skill and teamwork, but theres something so incredibly addicting and charming about it that just makes you want more. Your ship is stacked with customizable guns for different purposes, long range, medium range, short range, armor piercing, balloon damage, explosive damage, and tons more. There is always something to ready for, parts to repair and buff, guns to extiguish and load with the appropriate ammo, and enemies and hazards to be spotted. There are also environmental hazards, such as terrain to doge, weave, and hide around and sandstorms that sneak out out of nowhere.\n\nTo put the gameplay in perspective, think of this: Your ship is charging out of a cloud at the unprotected side of an enemy ship. Gunners man the front guns and open fire while the captain rushes in for a ram. Your ship hits theirs and glances off to the right, while their ship spins around and is facing your right side. The situation is now a scramble, gunners running to the right side guns of the ship and trying not to fall off in the process, mechanic repairing damage to the hull from the ram, and the captain trying to get the ship out of the enemy's range of fire. The enemy ship is now facing guns forward at yours and starts pounding away with a mortars and a flamethrower, disabling your side guns and deflating your balloon. Your ship is slowly falling, the captain has decided to retreat and the whole crew is focused of keeping the hull in repair and the balloon inflated. Despite the crew's efforts, the hull's armor is down and the ship is now taking direct damage. Lucky for you, your ally ship bursts from the cloud in front of you and totally saves the day, finishig off the enemy and giving you time to repair. This is just a little taste of the exitement and thrill of this game.\n\nWhen I found this game, it was because I was looking for a cool steampunk game to play. This game has all the steampunk charm you could hope for, in the ships, in the setting, and in the customizable characters. As a steampunk fan, I can honestly say that this game completey satisfies my need for steampunk stuff. I love this game, I love this community, and I highly reccomend this game to anyone who wants to experience something new.","April 28, 2014","true","42.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It really is a great game. At any given time there are hundreds of people playing the game, and for such a cheap and small title, that's a rather large community of gamers.\n\nAnywhere from 1 on 1 to 3 on 3 airships can battle eachother. There are 4 crew members per airship, up to a total of 24 people in any given game at a time. And better yet, if there aren't enough people, there is AI that will fill in the slots.\n\nSo, what's so fun about this game? A bunch of different airships to pilot? A multitude of turrets to man and rain destruction down upon your enemies? Constant havoc being wreaked upon your ship that you need to fix? How about all of the above! With 3 different classes, all capable of performing every single airship task, however each with their own unique sets of equipment and buffs, the Gunner, the Pilot, and the Engineer.

It is a game about teamwork: one-on-one PvP is absent, and 'leveling up' are for achievements only. You are as good as you can play, and even then, you are only as good as your team and will be expected to communicate clearly while maintaining humour and focus under fire.

It's for the most part balanced and has a wonderful community. There's a bit of a learning curve but generally the community is willing to help you out and show you around a ship. There is no progression system whatsoever, (which for me makes this GOTY: All Years) you get all your ship customization options and tools at the start and everything past that is just cosmetic. It also has a steampunk aesthetic with tons of asian influences which is an absolutely gorgeous sight to behold when 3 Goldfish are disabling your ship and shooting you to pieces.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who has 15 dollars burning a hole in their pocket and a couple friends that you can yell at.","December 7, 2013","true","306.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a first-person shooter where you and your team fly an airship.  Even though it's a first-person shooter, you don't shoot using rifles and pistols.  The ship has turrents and cannons on it.  The ships look like a pirate ships but is suspended in the air by a giant hot air balloon.  You have a choice of charater classes to play.  You can play as a Captain, Engineer or Gunner.  You can also customize your character.  Each class has a different skill.  Even though you have a certain "job", any character can take the helm or a gun.  Someone has to fly the ship as it doesn't fly itself.  Engineers fix broken or damaged parts for the ship.  If your ship becomes too damaged it's harder to defend and eventually it crashes.  After that you respawn.  After so many points, a team wins.  This game has a nice steampunk theme.  It makes everything look vintage.  To be completely honest, it's not a first choice game for first-person battle in my opinion but it has a different setting that most games don't have.  Most battle games take place on a battlefield or buildings.  Flying ships are nice to take the humdrum out of battles.  I recommend playing it!","February 17, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the dieselpunk aesthetic might seem just decorative, it does lend itself to a community of gentlemen and madames -- polite, jolly, and brimming with good sportsmanship (most of the time). It is a game about teamwork: one-on-one PvP is absent, and 'leveling up' are for achievements only. You are as good as you can play, and even then, you are only as good as your team and will be expected to communicate clearly while maintaining humour and focus under fire.

Some people have complained that the gameplay can get a little slow and this is true during certain matches. It is not a twitch shooter by any means.\n\nThe Graphics:There is no ground-breaking textures to be found in GOI online, While some may  dislike this, i do not mind it at all. I would describe the graphic style as Warm and inviting, Not cutting edge.\n\nThe Ships and combat of GOI are where you find the meat of the game.\nEach ship feels unique in the way it handles and the way you must fly and move around on it.\nThere is a noticible difference when you go from piloting a heavy ship to a far lighter vessel.\nThe weapons also add a lot of depth to this game with many different types of weapons and ammo that have varying effects on how your shots behave in flight.The movement of your ship and the enemies is also a factor\n\nA word of caution to the Rambo's out there. This is a team game to the extreme.Do not expect to be a one man army in GOI. Victory requires the entire crew to communicate,Calling out enemy vessels. Directing the pilot to manuever to give you a shot,Calling out repairs etc.\n\nIf team games and Steam punk airships sound good to you i say give this little gem a try.\n\nThere is also plans by the devs to add open-world gameplay in the future. I do not know if it will happen anytime soon or ever but there is already plenty of game here for your money.","May 22, 2014","true","180.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Another thing which can't be seen in desc or pictures is the way you level up your Pilot/Engineer/Gunner , not by time (simply playing) , not by winning , but by achievements specific to every class (thats why this game has 400+ achivs in total :D)\nThe service for this game is also great.\nThe only game that i know similar is Project Nomads , but that was a little bit different , piloting floating rocks , artifacts and stuff like that , but the main idea is same.\nOther than that i can't think of any other things that are not mentioned , so if you still do not trust me its a good investment simply wait for a sale , and you won't regret it , i promise.\n\nP.S. : Airships + Guns + Teamwork all bundled up in an epic and teamwork oriented game , just what more you want ?\nP.P.S : FREAKING AIRSHIPS SON :3","December 28, 2013","true","42.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Awesome.\n\nThis game has proven to be a love-hate relationship, because it has so much potential to be something more, it annoys me that the game hasn't advanced beyond it's emcumbered means of bashing a hammer to repair stuff and manning the same old usual weaponry to shoot other ships. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing in it's own right and I'm continuing to spend many hours playing it to date, but it has potential to be even better in my eyes; I know for one that being able to physically invade another airship "pirate style" would be amazing and give a far more entertaining contrast to the monotomy of what soon becomes reptitive tasks in the game.\n\nIf you enjoy team-work (this is a must) and quite enjoy naval warfare (but you're flying!) then this game is pretty awesome and even if you don't enjoy those things, but mindlessly enjoy bashing components on the airship and shooting steam-punk weaponry, then you'll enjoy this game anyway.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kreeth/recommended/209080/","kreeth","Count Kreethula","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kreeth/","79 products in account","Guns of Icarus Online... sounds promising, doesn't it? And it pretty much is VERY promising. I mean, I could probably go on and on about how good this game is and how I just adore it, even though I didn't really play that much (seeing as some people have 1k+ hours on this and I have a mere 27+). I'll try to make it as brief of a review as I can but don't blame me if it ends up pretty long (because there's a number of things I wish to describe).\nMy first thought about this game was 'Oh my, a steampunk game about airships! Now that's a must have!'. I should probably tell you know that I'm a BIG steampunk fan. But back to the topic at hand: when I bought Guns of Icarus Online and actually got into a real game I was stunned. And no it wasn't because it was bad. Two words: airship battles. And not the kind you would expect from a regular multiplayer deathmatch oriented game where you fly a ship and pew pew everything in sight. Instead you get a team effort game. You and three other people are the whole crew of an airship (and you have about seven to choose from). You man the guns, keep the blasted thing alive and shoot other airships. Each member of your glorious crew is of one of the following professions: captain (responsible for flying the ship), engineer (repairs and rebuilds the ship parts) or gunner (your pew pew man). Of course, there some multi-classing aspects and everyone can attend to other jobs (only not so well).\nDoesn't sound impressive? Well then, let me assure you that those combats are gloriously dynamic. You run around whacking things with a rubber mallet, shoot things or manoeuvre through the skies, hoping you don't get sandwiched by two Galleons and you can actually FEEL that you're a part of the crew. And it's not that you "carry" people to victory. It's completely about the effort of everyone on the ship. I don't know about others but those kind of feels really get to me.\nAnd speaking of airships, they are designed so very well. They have this steampunk touch I so love about them. And not only that they look really well they also come in a decent variety. On one side of the list you have a big, slow airship packed with tons of heavy weaponry. On the other there's a fast, mobile ship with no heavy guns (though has an annoying tendency to burn you all the time). Maybe something in between? Though there's only seven ships, I'm sure most people will find something that suits them (my two personal favourites are the Spire and the Mobula). The only downside I can see here is that some of the ships are the engineer's worst nightmares (ironic that my favourites are those nightmares... and I play the engineer).\nNow let's speed this review up a bit. The graphics are nice. I really like the particles and how the ships look. So that's a plus. And the music is really good. The voice chat is pretty handy and helps a lot. Alas, the game has a few flaws. The first one is that it tends to lag from time to time for no big reason (which isn't really that frustrating... I, for one, don't really mind) so you end up falling off through the floor of your ship or see a teleporting enemy, and the part you were so eagerly smashing with your mallet isn't very responsive. The second one that comes into my minds is that... it's hard to find games and crew. Don't get me wrong, there's quite a lot of people playing this game but it just doesn't seem enough. Mornings and early afternoons are simply underpopulated (I know, people have lives... but what are the odds?). I know it's not really a technical flaw, but it kind of gets me down. And lastly I... don't really have any major flaws to report.\nAnd I must say that the developers are fantastic. So is the community. I don't think I've ever seen such a friendly community in any online game.\n\nSo... that was a tad longer than I intended it to be. No matter. To sum things up: Guns of Icarus Online is a very good online game. It's a perfect buy for any steampunk fan out there who would like to actually participate in an airship battle and feel like a real sky pirate (or maybe not really a pirate but you get the point). And when you get friends to man your ship? Now that's the best thing you can do with your free time. I recommend this game to everyone, not only to those who like steampunk.

I recommend this game , if you did not buy it after looking at game description and all the pictures to get the idea , then what can i say , a thing which is not shown there is that there are bounty hunters and wanted men too , which can get you points and stuff , but of course those who are wanted are usualy high ranked. Another thing which can't be seen in desc or pictures is the way you level up your Pilot/Engineer/Gunner , not by time (simply playing) , not by winning , but by achievements specific to every class (thats why this game has 400+ achivs in total :D)\nThe service for this game is also great.\nThe only game that i know similar is Project Nomads , but that was a little bit different , piloting floating rocks , artifacts and stuff like that , but the main idea is same.\nOther than that i can't think of any other things that are not mentioned , so if you still do not trust me its a good investment simply wait for a sale , and you won't regret it , i promise.\n\nP.S. : Airships + Guns + Teamwork all bundled up in an epic and teamwork oriented game , just what more you want ?\nP.P.S : FREAKING AIRSHIPS SON :3","December 28, 2013","true","42.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the dieselpunk aesthetic might seem just decorative, it does lend itself to a community of gentlemen and madames -- polite, jolly, and brimming with good sportsmanship (most of the time). It is a game about teamwork: one-on-one PvP is absent, and 'leveling up' are for achievements only. You are as good as you can play, and even then, you are only as good as your team and will be expected to communicate clearly while maintaining humour and focus under fire.

After finding this indie marvel, I am completely ADDICTED to Guns of Icarus Online.\n\nThe flawlessly turning cogs, the beautiful sound of steam in highly detailed machinery, the immense feel of achievement from working with a team to control a giant metal airship, and destroying others with the finest weapons from the four corners of the world.\nWhether it's a continues stream of hellfire from a long-range flamethrower, the adrenaline-surging Heavy Hwacha with its fast and furious stream of explosives, landing mercilessly on an enemy ship and wrecking it like a hammer against glass, or le surprise buttesecks from a high power sniper cannon, you can be sure of a damn good time for you, and a nightmare for the recipients of your destruction. As long as you're on the winning team, of course. But don't worry about losing too much, because even if you do, your fellow (and rival) captains have the option to give you a 'Commendation' as a mute way of saying 'You did well.' There is a minor levelling system that makes it easy to distinguish the more experienced players from the less experienced, as you level up with the number of class-related achievements you get.\n\nThe community in Guns of Icarus Online is mostly a mature, welcoming one that will not only tell you where you went wrong in a match but also recommending improvements and resisting the urge to brag. The developers of Guns of Icarus Online are always online with their unmistakable green name and easy-going attitude, answering as many questions as they can in the relatively easy-going main chat, and occasionally host 'Dev Matches' where you can compete against them for a free in-game customisation item. It is in ways like this they show how they genuinely care about their customers. Something that is unfortunately missing in many modern game studios.\n\nIn summary, if you have a passion for all things Steampunk, want a brilliant community with a caring company behind it and enjoy destroying giant metal birds, climb aboard the Icarus and together we'll sail for a brave new world.","September 6, 2013","true","480.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kreeth/recommended/209080/","kreeth","Count Kreethula","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kreeth/","79 products in account","Guns of Icarus Online... sounds promising, doesn't it? And it pretty much is VERY promising. I mean, I could probably go on and on about how good this game is and how I just adore it, even though I didn't really play that much (seeing as some people have 1k+ hours on this and I have a mere 27+). I'll try to make it as brief of a review as I can but don't blame me if it ends up pretty long (because there's a number of things I wish to describe).\nMy first thought about this game was 'Oh my, a steampunk game about airships! Now that's a must have!'. I should probably tell you know that I'm a BIG steampunk fan. But back to the topic at hand: when I bought Guns of Icarus Online and actually got into a real game I was stunned. And no it wasn't because it was bad. Two words: airship battles. And not the kind you would expect from a regular multiplayer deathmatch oriented game where you fly a ship and pew pew everything in sight. Instead you get a team effort game. You and three other people are the whole crew of an airship (and you have about seven to choose from). You man the guns, keep the blasted thing alive and shoot other airships. Each member of your glorious crew is of one of the following professions: captain (responsible for flying the ship), engineer (repairs and rebuilds the ship parts) or gunner (your pew pew man). Of course, there some multi-classing aspects and everyone can attend to other jobs (only not so well).\nDoesn't sound impressive? Well then, let me assure you that those combats are gloriously dynamic. You run around whacking things with a rubber mallet, shoot things or manoeuvre through the skies, hoping you don't get sandwiched by two Galleons and you can actually FEEL that you're a part of the crew. And it's not that you "carry" people to victory. It's completely about the effort of everyone on the ship. I don't know about others but those kind of feels really get to me.\nAnd speaking of airships, they are designed so very well. They have this steampunk touch I so love about them. And not only that they look really well they also come in a decent variety. On one side of the list you have a big, slow airship packed with tons of heavy weaponry. On the other there's a fast, mobile ship with no heavy guns (though has an annoying tendency to burn you all the time). Maybe something in between? Though there's only seven ships, I'm sure most people will find something that suits them (my two personal favourites are the Spire and the Mobula). The only downside I can see here is that some of the ships are the engineer's worst nightmares (ironic that my favourites are those nightmares... and I play the engineer).\nNow let's speed this review up a bit. The graphics are nice. I really like the particles and how the ships look. So that's a plus. And the music is really good. The voice chat is pretty handy and helps a lot. Alas, the game has a few flaws. The first one is that it tends to lag from time to time for no big reason (which isn't really that frustrating... I, for one, don't really mind) so you end up falling off through the floor of your ship or see a teleporting enemy, and the part you were so eagerly smashing with your mallet isn't very responsive. The second one that comes into my minds is that... it's hard to find games and crew. Don't get me wrong, there's quite a lot of people playing this game but it just doesn't seem enough. Mornings and early afternoons are simply underpopulated (I know, people have lives... but what are the odds?). I know it's not really a technical flaw, but it kind of gets me down. And lastly I... don't really have any major flaws to report.\nAnd I must say that the developers are fantastic. So is the community. I don't think I've ever seen such a friendly community in any online game.\n\nSo... that was a tad longer than I intended it to be. No matter. To sum things up: Guns of Icarus Online is a very good online game. It's a perfect buy for any steampunk fan out there who would like to actually participate in an airship battle and feel like a real sky pirate (or maybe not really a pirate but you get the point). And when you get friends to man your ship? Now that's the best thing you can do with your free time. I recommend this game to everyone, not only to those who like steampunk. In general, this is a pretty darn good multiplayer team effort game. So go buy it.

I recommend this game , if you did not buy it after looking at game description and all the pictures to get the idea , then what can i say , a thing which is not shown there is that there are bounty hunters and wanted men too , which can get you points and stuff , but of course those who are wanted are usualy high ranked. Another thing which can't be seen in desc or pictures is the way you level up your Pilot/Engineer/Gunner , not by time (simply playing) , not by winning , but by achievements specific to every class (thats why this game has 400+ achivs in total :D)\nThe service for this game is also great.\nThe only game that i know similar is Project Nomads , but that was a little bit different , piloting floating rocks , artifacts and stuff like that , but the main idea is same.\nOther than that i can't think of any other things that are not mentioned , so if you still do not trust me its a good investment simply wait for a sale , and you won't regret it , i promise.\n\nP.S. : Airships + Guns + Teamwork all bundled up in an epic and teamwork oriented game , just what more you want ?\nP.P.S : FREAKING AIRSHIPS SON :3","December 28, 2013","true","42.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can't quite describe the feeling - when you know the ship is going down, the captain isn't even at the steering wheel anymore but huddled in a corner wondering when it all went wrong, being razed by fire on both sides, all engines failing and balloon popped, you try and jump ship only to find yourself back on board... you'll have to try it yourself to understand. Gameplay is very balanced, nice variety of ships and guns and regularly updated for new content. The only criticisms I have are some lag/disconnection issues especially on foreign servers, and graphics aren't the greatest. The community is very friendly, and very competitive.

Why did I recomend the four pack? It's best to play GoI with people you know or at least people who will put the co-op in co-operation cause if you don't then it will be difficult to coordinate different strategies. Not working together will and can get you killed, and not actually following through with the role of your class will warrant the same result.\n\nGuns of Icarus is a neat little game that caught me by suprise because I wasn't expecting it to, well, be fun at all. However the odd matches where friends weren't available to play the game got kind of boring, and it is definetly one of those games where you should atleast have people you know working with you (even though there is a chatbox and such).\n\nMADE FOR: Fans of Steampunk and Flying Ships. It's also made for those who actually have a group to play and communicate with.\n\nNOT MADE FOR: People that dislike games that run on Unity, and of course the whole setting of Steampunk. It's also worth noting that the game really isn't good if you have no one you know to play it with.\n\n\nGUNS OF ICARUS\n7.5/10","June 27, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There aren't any ships that are overpowered, though some of the ships are never used simply because they aren't as balanced as the others\n\n- Leveling up doesn't have that many rewards\n\n- Not a lot of maps, though you rarely notice your surroundings unless you're a pilot or there's no fighting going on\n\n\nOther Ideas:\n~ If you are playing with a group of 4 friends, this game is, well, simply awesome. However, if you find yourself with any less than 4 of your friends, you can sometimes end up with a newbie crewmate\n\n~ The game doesn't REQUIRE a microphone, though it seems nearly pointless without one. Without the ability to communicate with your crew/party with live voice chat, trying to say things like "THE BALLOON IS ON FIRE" can only be said with the (somewhat hard to navigate) built-in voice chat (think TF2 voice commands)","June 20, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It requires heavy team coordination with different ways to play.  The one major issue I have is the games habit of letting people choose their team and auto selecting them randomly.  I have games where 8 crew members on the enemy team and the total crew for mine can be 3 which ruins the game as it's one sided.  However if you get a group of friends together you can all coordinate so well that you become near unstoppable.","May 24, 2015","true","19.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All set in a quirky alternate history where World War I apparently started early and dragged out until humanity was left in a post-apocalyptic state where airships are the way to go because Mad Max makes land travel too lethal.\n\nYou are one of three classes, pilot (only one per-ship, directs the ship), engineer (repairs stuff), and gunner (controls the gun mounts) in a group of four (guess which class gets doubled up?) and while each class can man the guns, pilot the ship, and even do some repairs, the classes have customizable loadouts in different categories. Your class gets four tools in their chosen category and only one tool in any other. You and the rest of your crew must function as a tight knit, well-coordinated unit as pilots must keep the ship positioned to fire on enemies, gunners must have an aim worth squat, and engineers need to stay on top of incoming damage to different parts of the ship. Thankfully, unlike the original Guns of Icarus, you no longer have to worry about cargo, just your teammates (including those on other, friendly ships) being subpar to the team members on the opposite team.\n\nWhat ensues is a game requiring multi-person coordination, open communication, a careful system of checks and balances in terms of equipment loadout, ship class, and armaments in perhaps a great game of teamwork and strategy I myself have never experienced before. Some things you'll need to full enjoy this game will easily be friends to form a crew with (and expendable when the inevitable lost match causes a falling out) or patience, willingness, and possible divine favor to endure the randomized matchmaking, and lastly a good quality mic for communicating with your team or chewing out the other engineer who keeps repairing something you're already fixing when something else needs him more.\n\nBut by no means let these words discourage you, indeed, sometimes the frustration can be part of the fun and makes the times when you and your team hit the zone or you end up with just good teammates a zen-like experience of being awesome as the crew of the Enterprise, deftly taking down superior forces of Klingon warships except with more cogs and petrol fumes.\n\nIf PVP isn't your thing, the developers have been working on a PvE adventure mode for some time now and progress is apparently steady. Adventure mode will include not just AI controlled enemies, but also towns which you can visit with your avatar character to show off those fancy duds you bought in the cash store, role play your way through your lack of actual skills related to your class, or simply argue your ship is better than everyone elses/complain how broken flamethrowers are.\n\nOh, did I mention you can not just customize your avatar but also your ship to an extent aesthetically? Well you can, it costs real money but distinguishing yourself is always nice.\n\nPerhaps the current downside is that mechanical options are limited, There's maybe eight different tools to select from for each class, only so many ships, and only so many ways you can load them up in terms of weapons. Things get more restrictive when it comes to the metagame as while the engineers are always important, you end up doing a lot less exciting things and can spend whole matches staring at ship components and smashing them with a tool for repairs or putting out fires because the one gunner and one pilot slot were taken by someone else (and begrudgingly, probably more deserving of those slots than you).\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to people, if only to support indie development, and to promote strategic, teamwork dependent multiplayer games. Nevermind hope for future growth and perhaps a broader meta.","May 27, 2015","true","35.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you played the final fantasy games as a kid, like I did, then you probably wondered what a full on battle with your airship would be like.\nGuns of Icarus neatly fulfills that by combining slick killer airships, steampunk glory, and the dear old dreams of flight. It's you and three other players, who must steer the airship itself, fire the weapons to take down the enemy, and keep the ship repaired at all times.\nPilot, gunner, and engineer - not a toughie to figure out who does what. While it's worth noting that any role can do anything, pilots gets more items to enhance the performance of the ship itself (at the expense of slowly damaging the systems), gunners get more ammo types, and engineers have more tools to fix the ship.\n\nDecking out your ship is where the real depth lies. There are a lot of weapons at this stage of the game, and knowing what to have when, and at what place of the ship, and with what ammo, is the key to victory. You could be a sniping minelayer, a harpoon'ing flamerboat, or a pure on rocket speedster. There's a lot of combinations, and you will still be learning new ones hundreds of games later. The ships are as varied as the weapons, offering multiple roles per ship depending on what guns and ammo you use. Playing into all of this are the items the pilot is using, be it moonshine to make the engines go faster, kerosense to make the balloon better, or phoenix claw to turn faster - it all comes down to making up for the various ships inate weaknesses.\n\nBut, as previously mentioned, that comes at the cost of constantly damaging the affected sub-systems, so pilots needs to take care of that.\nSee, damage to systems makes them less effective - an engine that's barely alive won't perform anywhere near a full repaired one, and the same goes for everything else. It's all a matter of making priorities under fire, which makes every game intense but rewarding. And because every part of the ship has it's own health, a lot of tactical precision fire comes into play. Aim is important.\n\nThe scenery is beautiful - I sometimes forget to do my job as an engineer because I get distracted by all the effects and cool visuals around me. No other game did that to me. It's that good to look at. It's not just scenery though, things like hiding in clouds is definetly a thing. The soundtrack is great, it's subtle but powerful, and often you won't notice it there - you will just suddenly realize how well it sets the mood, and you will quickly learn to fear the sound of hwacha rockets whistling through the air.\n\nBut should the soundtrack dissapoint, your teammates can of course play their own over the mic - or whatever else they want to share. Guns of Icarus is extremely voice driven - you simply don't have the time to type under fire. Luckily, it's functional and simple. And better get used to it, because there will be a lot of banter going on in the ship. And that's what makes me adore this game so much, more than anything - people work very closely together to achive a common goal. That makes getting along so extremely important - if you don't have a good chemistry with your crew, then you simply won't do really well. Even in the pre-match lobbies, I often find myself heartily laughing at all the jokes, singing, stories, and general merry banter. It's sorta like a pre-match party!\nSo yes, if you don't like social games, then this game is not optimized for you. But the community is incredibly inviting and nice!\n\nBUT, if you like airships, epic dogfights, flying in pretty landscapes, and just having a grand old gamer time with people from all over the world, duking it up high above the ground in all it's steampunk glory, and feeling the gratification of achieving success as a team, then this game is impossible to pass up. It's pretty much the only one of it's kind, and it's only getting better. The developer team constantly plays games with the players, so they're never out of touch or lack common insight.\n\nI hope to see you in the skies!\n\nPS: Two advices...\nDon't opt out of novice.\nDon't fly a galleon if you're not experienced.","June 8, 2015","true","544.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As long as you're on the winning team, of course. But don't worry about losing too much, because even if you do, your fellow (and rival) captains have the option to give you a 'Commendation' as a mute way of saying 'You did well.' There is a minor levelling system that makes it easy to distinguish the more experienced players from the less experienced, as you level up with the number of class-related achievements you get.\n\nThe community in Guns of Icarus Online is mostly a mature, welcoming one that will not only tell you where you went wrong in a match but also recommending improvements and resisting the urge to brag. The developers of Guns of Icarus Online are always online with their unmistakable green name and easy-going attitude, answering as many questions as they can in the relatively easy-going main chat, and occasionally host 'Dev Matches' where you can compete against them for a free in-game customisation item. It is in ways like this they show how they genuinely care about their customers. Something that is unfortunately missing in many modern game studios.\n\nIn summary, if you have a passion for all things Steampunk, want a brilliant community with a caring company behind it and enjoy destroying giant metal birds, climb aboard the Icarus and together we'll sail for a brave new world.","September 6, 2013","true","480.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","1"

If you're one of those types who always wanted to feel like, let's say, Admiral Horatio Nelson and sail their own ship (or fly, in this case), or command a fleet, THIS GAME WAS MADE FOR YOU.\n\nThe gameplay promotes teamwork among the crewmates and the other pilots of your team. The team tactics are interesting aspect of the game. There are numerous ships, tools, weapons and ammunition, each useful in different kind of situations. The combat itself: Long-range, close-range, ramming, stomping etc. - all in three-dimensions and that's awesome.\n\nThe most you can get out of this game is if you play with friends and form a crew or a fleet, but if your peers prefer different genres like mine, it's still a great game to play as pilot solo.\n\nAbsolutely recommend!","October 5, 2015","true","59.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is just a pretty game in general.\n\nTeamcomps are a bit stale as the Gunner class brings less to the crew than running 3 engineers and the pilot together. But then it is currently in beta at the time of posting so we will see what they implement here.\n\nHowever there is a large variety of perks for the classes, such as the lucky foot which increases the turn angle of your ship, as well as different weapon loadouts for the many ships available to use. These include things like mines and flamthrowers amongst the cannon and rocket like guns you would expect.\n\nThis game is fun to play and even more fun if you can get a team of four friends to communicate with. alothough you have a voice chat option in game it is alot more difficult communicating to random players than to your friends over a service like mumble or skype.\n\nOverall the game deserves a much higher rating than the one it has been given and i hope to sink many hours into it as they bring out things like the adventure mode building up to the full release.","January 14, 2014","true","27.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All set in a quirky alternate history where World War I apparently started early and dragged out until humanity was left in a post-apocalyptic state where airships are the way to go because Mad Max makes land travel too lethal.\n\nYou are one of three classes, pilot (only one per-ship, directs the ship), engineer (repairs stuff), and gunner (controls the gun mounts) in a group of four (guess which class gets doubled up?) and while each class can man the guns, pilot the ship, and even do some repairs, the classes have customizable loadouts in different categories. Your class gets four tools in their chosen category and only one tool in any other. You and the rest of your crew must function as a tight knit, well-coordinated unit as pilots must keep the ship positioned to fire on enemies, gunners must have an aim worth squat, and engineers need to stay on top of incoming damage to different parts of the ship. Thankfully, unlike the original Guns of Icarus, you no longer have to worry about cargo, just your teammates (including those on other, friendly ships) being subpar to the team members on the opposite team.\n\nWhat ensues is a game requiring multi-person coordination, open communication, a careful system of checks and balances in terms of equipment loadout, ship class, and armaments in perhaps a great game of teamwork and strategy I myself have never experienced before. Some things you'll need to full enjoy this game will easily be friends to form a crew with (and expendable when the inevitable lost match causes a falling out) or patience, willingness, and possible divine favor to endure the randomized matchmaking, and lastly a good quality mic for communicating with your team or chewing out the other engineer who keeps repairing something you're already fixing when something else needs him more.\n\nBut by no means let these words discourage you, indeed, sometimes the frustration can be part of the fun and makes the times when you and your team hit the zone or you end up with just good teammates a zen-like experience of being awesome as the crew of the Enterprise, deftly taking down superior forces of Klingon warships except with more cogs and petrol fumes.\n\nIf PVP isn't your thing, the developers have been working on a PvE adventure mode for some time now and progress is apparently steady. Adventure mode will include not just AI controlled enemies, but also towns which you can visit with your avatar character to show off those fancy duds you bought in the cash store, role play your way through your lack of actual skills related to your class, or simply argue your ship is better than everyone elses/complain how broken flamethrowers are.\n\nOh, did I mention you can not just customize your avatar but also your ship to an extent aesthetically? Well you can, it costs real money but distinguishing yourself is always nice.\n\nPerhaps the current downside is that mechanical options are limited, There's maybe eight different tools to select from for each class, only so many ships, and only so many ways you can load them up in terms of weapons. Things get more restrictive when it comes to the metagame as while the engineers are always important, you end up doing a lot less exciting things and can spend whole matches staring at ship components and smashing them with a tool for repairs or putting out fires because the one gunner and one pilot slot were taken by someone else (and begrudgingly, probably more deserving of those slots than you).\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to people, if only to support indie development, and to promote strategic, teamwork dependent multiplayer games. Nevermind hope for future growth and perhaps a broader meta.","May 27, 2015","true","35.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're one of those types who always wanted to feel like, let's say, Admiral Horatio Nelson and sail their own ship (or fly, in this case), or command a fleet, THIS GAME WAS MADE FOR YOU.\n\nThe gameplay promotes teamwork among the crewmates and the other pilots of your team. The team tactics are interesting aspect of the game. There are numerous ships, tools, weapons and ammunition, each useful in different kind of situations. The combat itself: Long-range, close-range, ramming, stomping etc. - all in three-dimensions and that's awesome.\n\nThe most you can get out of this game is if you play with friends and form a crew or a fleet, but if your peers prefer different genres like mine, it's still a great game to play as pilot solo.\n\nAbsolutely recommend!","October 5, 2015","true","59.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its fun to play with friends, have nice cartoon graphics and in manage for your team to win you need to fullfill your hole in your class and know about strategy and how the ammunition works. A skilled pilot is always necessary, but communication between the crew is the key.\nWorth getting this game even more if your can pay less in one of the Steam promotions.\n\nDisvantage: The only thing bugged me off is that sometimes there are major lag spikes, duo ping, and may happens in a vital momment when you are reparing the hull or the balloon. As I'm from Brazil this seems to happens a lot with me, but maybe for who is closer to the server and then have lower ping than me will not suffer from the same issue.","May 23, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lummeck/recommended/209080/","lummeck","John Lummeck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lummeck/","22 products in account","Guns of Icarus Online is a steampunk airship combat game. As a pilot, I choose and customise an airship (you get all the airships when you buy the game, no airship DLC nonsense) and either wait for a crew or invite some friends. There can be up to three crew members, and if nobody shows up then AIs do the job (badly, of course, since they're hard to communicate with).\n\nCrew members will be one of two chosen classes: gunner or engineer. Gunners man the guns, engineers repair - in theory. Anyone can man a gun, and engineers often will do so when nothing needs repairing.\n\nAnd now to what I actually think. It's a fun game, with great aesthetics - when I go to ram an airship (and I always end up ramming), I can see the crew of the other ship. They're so tiny. They look like little ants. I like ants. Have you ever seen a close-up picture of an ant? Yeah, ants are cool. Ant-Man had some pet ants, I think. He could shrink, too.\n\n*Ahem* Anyway. Your character is customiseable, though most stuff requires you to buy (or design!) items from the store. So either your crew or ships that are really really close will see it.\n\nThere's a few issues, though - many people seem to be unable to refrain from naming their ship something ridiculous, like "Yoda's Virginity". I had to give orders to my crew like "Quick, after The Yoda's Virginity!" or "Destroy Yoda's Virginity!". I felt quite silly.\n\nAlso, my ship is haunted. An AI keeps appearing and just charging right off the side and vanishing. It's a funny glitch.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a steampunk game about airships and the airships explode with fireworks when they die. You should buy it if you like airships, but everyone likes airships, so you should probably buy it.","January 27","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Its best to play with friends. 3. when worst comes to worst at least listen to your team mates if you don't have a mic and try being an engineer or gunner deaf captain is a dead captain. Have patience when you get more experience because this game is on sale and new people join and are really bad,one guy who was captain jumped of the ship when it was on fire and didn't steer out of smoke(smoke is bad never go in it) Overall this game is extremly cheap and really fun and its like $8 for limited edition 4 pack play with your friends! guns of icarus 8.8/10( some bugs and some bad times but you will learn to love this game)","May 19, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Most games that are co-op are basically single player games that you can play with your friends (i. e. Diablo), but this game really makes or brakes depending on your teamwork.\nIt is crucial that everyone on your ship knows their job and function. Flying solo is a no go.\nThe one thing this game lacks, is the audience it deserves. This game should get the proper attention from media and gamers alike.

Coordination is key in this game and the teamwork adds a new dimension to this game.\n\nCustomization and balancing :\nBasically... you have everything unlocked from start and you can customize a variety of preset ships to your likings ranging from which guns to put where to what kind of gun you want : A tank with heavy weapons that is slow or a speeder with lower health and small guns. Having everything in ship customization unlocked right off the bat is the perfect way to fix anyone's whining of how the game lacks balance. The rest of the customization is just for looks and it adds nothing... + they're cheap anyway.\n\nLast but not least : Future updates..\nAdventure mode which is pretty much gonna add an MMO-like mode in the skirmish-like battles in this game will be something like you experienced in EVE only first person and there will be towns, economy, free-roaming and so much more to look for.\n\nBottom point - GOTY material from every angle.. I can only wish for people to buy this game and maybe if its price stayed at 10 euro for a while it could gain some fame but again, the devs do need to get some money for the masterpiece they've created. The only flaw I can find in this game is when we are playing on a 2v2 match and the enemies are dumb and don't know what the M key does (aka opens the map so we don't have to follow them outside of the boundaries).\n\nIf I could give this game a score, I'd give it a 9/10 now and a 10/10 when the Adventure mode releases. Incredibly addicting and so much customization with no balancing issues.. I can only say "Buy this and get a 4-pack if you can so you spread the word". Best 20 euro I've ever spent on a game and my friends are in love with it too (I even got 8 more people to buy the game so we have 3 crews for 3v3.. they are that hyped about it too).\n\nPeople.. the new juggernaut has come but give it time to rise among the leaders of today's gaming. This combination of FPS and piloting is creative, fun and most of all - Perfect !","January 8, 2013","true","48.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lollipopek/recommended/209080/","Lollipopek","Lollipopek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lollipopek/","209 products in account","This is, in my opinion, one of those "one of a kind" games that i fall in love with. Where elese will you find a game where you can steer a steampunk stylised flying ship against others with actual human beings as your crew? This game got me right on since the very begining.\n\nI've been playing this game alot and what I like the most here is :\n\n-The maps which are perfectly accostumed for flying and manuvering ranging from more open ones to extremaly narrow ones like cities. They also feel like they belong to the world of the game which is important to me as not every game does it.\n\n-The co-operation which is crucial for this game make other players actully care for the communication and coordination  since this is one of those game that you absolutely have no chance playing solo and not listening to your teammates, especailly captain of the ship.\n\n-The theme is also a great attribute to this game. I think steampunk setting of the world fits perfectly here making all the ships, all the modules, all the guns and its animations and character costumes alot more enjoyable\n\n-The buisness model is very fair as the only things you can buy in shop are customisation items with pretty affordable prices I would say (if you can farm up some trading cards on steam you will even be able to buy a couple of those!).\n\n-Everything is unlocked from the very beginging, you do not need to through any mundune process of gradually gaining a new item once every couple of levels. Every ship, every gun, every tool or ammunition type is avail for all classes since the very beginging. While this might be kind of overwhelming for newcomers I can guarantee you that you will get a hang of it fairly early on.\n\n-The community here more often then so is in my opinion surprisingly helpful (yes you can find your standard ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who will be mad at anyone who screws up even a bit but they are in minority here). I've met alot of players who can call themsleves veterans and they were always willing to explain what should I do, how to act on a certains ships and set ups or what is the best combination of tools/ammunition I can take with me.\n\nThis game for the majority of time was and still is alot of fun and competetiveness for me.\nIf anything the only thing to put here and cons would probably be:\n\n-While being great the community is rather small for this game so I can't guarantee if this game will survive although it has been sustaining itself for quiet a long time and does a good job of it. Nevertheless I felt like it should have been signalised\n\n-Ignore this point if you do not care for achievements on steam. this game has a reallygood deal of achievements on steam making this a really long and grindy road to 100%. The other side of these here is that some of those will be especially hard to get as some of the achievements refer to new players giving you a recommendation and vice-versa. This would not actually be such a big problem if the community was bigger but as of now there is alot more old veteran players than the new ones.\n\nOverall I think the game is great and I strongly recommend others to try tis one out. Especially if you have a group of friends who would be willing to fly with you. The 4-pack deal is pretty great as you save up 20 euro that way making the game essentially 50% cheaper without a discount!\nI will say this if you like flying ships and raining down death on enemies you won't regret buying this game!","January 14","true","87.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

You and 3 friends (or complete strangers) fly on an airship trying to destroy the enemy ships before they destroy you. In order to do that, you have to work together and communicate with your team, you can't do it on your own. This has resulted in best online community I've experienced so far. The game does have a learning curve, but it is not as steep as other competitive games, and the community loves to help those who show interest in learning the ways of the game.\n\nSo if you are looking for a game where you can have a nice chat with other players and work together to achieve a goal, or just like competitive games, but want to avoid the toxicity you find in many other games, give Guns of Icarus a try!","October 23, 2015","true","175.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You fly in a airship with 4 other guys. There is 3 different classes: 1 Gunner - Special in weapons. 2 - Engineer: Special in repairing the guns and engines on the ship (very important class) 3: Pilot - Nothing much to say.. Hes flying the ship and need to tell the other guys on the ship what to do. You can level up with all the 3 classes whrn you play games. Its a very good teamwork game and come up with many  different ships and different guns on the ship. I'll for sure recommend this game to everyone who loves teamwork games and playing with your friends.","February 21, 2014","true","48.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game itself allows for seamless communication, and the graphics are appreciable. All in all, it's highly recommended; but I'm not too serious with this game.","June 2, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is kind of like a real-time version of FTL with movement, in which you control an individual crew member. The roles are all fun to play and each one is important to your crew as a whole. The gameplay is great, requiring a decent amount of planning and multitasking ability to master, and players can develop their own unique styles of play which keeps the game very replayable.\n\nI do wish that there were more ships and maps though, but the ones that do exist are great. Each map is made in a pretty unique way which emphasizes certain mechanics, and each ship has a niche to fill on the playing field which still allows for plenty of creativity.\n\nThe overall polish of the game is decent - it's a bit buggy in some places and the graphics are not AAA quality, but the gameplay makes up for it completely.","June 3, 2014","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can give you some advice I've discovered from playing around.\n\nNo matter what class you plan to stick with the most, try them all out no matter what. Usually, it gives you a taste of what your teammates have to go through.\n\nMy example is this: I usually play as Pilot. However, wanting to change things up a bit, I occasionally played and Engineer and Gunner, to get a taste of what they're like. When I played as these classes, I learned first hand how frustrating it can be for an Engineer when your Pilot flies you into a storm or forgets to stop using an item, and how a Gunner is useless if the Pilot doesn't aim the ship in a manner that allows you to attack. Now, I do my best as a Pilot to ensure things stay in perfect condition so that the Engineers can help gun, and I always try to aim the ship so that the Gunner's don't have to deal with being unable to aim and shoot.\n\nTL:DR, Literally put yourself into your teammates' shoes. It'll help you get better at whatever class you favor and help them to help you.\n\nEDIT: One more thing. Engineers and Gunners should learn the basics of Piloting. That way, if you get a Pilot who leaves the game and strands your ship, you still have someone who can drive it so that you still have some chance. And beginner Pilots: if things are going rough in a match, don't just abandon your team because it's hard. Engineers and Gunners can be replaced with AIs. AIs can't Pilot.","November 7, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have some issues with it, but on the whole I think it is good. The needed coordination among teammates is essential, and I think what really makes this game is what they DIDN'T add. Lack of boarding, and hand-to-hand combat really emphasize teamwork, and if you don't have a good team, you are screwed.\n\nSome of the things I dislike are mostly minor, and I think will be fixed with time. The graphics are good, but on certain maps, (i.e. any with rain, or fog) I feel like it was poorly done. Also, the lack of game modes begins to get to you after a while, but they are working on adventure mode, the DLC for which i will definitely buy. On the whole, I would give it a 7/10, and I would love to give it more, but it is not the kind of game you could lose yourself in.\n\nI built up a ton of expectation about this one, and while unrealistic, it feels slightly like a letdown. But it will get better, and what they have now is impressive. Good work guys.","November 10, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Ship mechanic is fresh, with instead holding down W or S or pushing up or down on the joystick, you have a speed toggle, so you lock the speed to 5 speeds, very fast reverse, reverse, stop, fast, very fast forward. My only problems so far is that sometimes your ship gets randomly thrown into mountains and hills, making you take damage for nothing. though this is only happened to me once. Apart from that this game is very fun and made me laugh alot.

Community is really good, everyone usually follows orders, there are no rude people/trolls etc. to ruin your game. Devs regularly play the game and really clean up foul players. But as always, there are some stubborn people that "MUST BE A GUNNER!111!" or sometimes an engineer not doing their job and gunning instead, but these are rare occurances. As long as someone gives the orders, such things are avoided.\n\n-Game is well balanced and benefits highly from the use of tactics. It's not a rock-paper-scissors thing either, everything works as long as you know how to use them.\n\n-Servers are working just fine, even though I'm a bit far to Europe for instance(Turkey), I get 70-100 ms ping. Which is really good.\n\n-Crashes very rarely occur, I played for about 20 hours and experienced only one crash. There are minor bugs, but no gamebreaking bugs.\n\n-It has a online shop, but it's not a pay-2-win, the items are entirely cosmetic, and quite well priced. (If you're so inclined to decorate your ship and suit up your characters, it would only cost 10 dolars.)\n\nSo in the end, do buy this game if you like teamwork and wreaking havoc with a flamethrower, because that's what you'll get.\n","May 27, 2014","true","344.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Does that sound interesting? Well let me tell you more.\n\nThere are 3 character classes, pilot, gunner and engineer, each which a primary role. Respectively: steering the ship, manning the guns, and repairing damaged parts. Now, when you start playing a match, you can't switch classes anymore (for obvious balancing reasons), but fortunately you get the option to multitask. You can freely run around the ships while you fly and are not stuck doing the same thing every time. If there's no need for repairing, an engineer can for instance quickly man a gun. Each class gets to choose 3 skills or tools for its own specialization, and one for the other two types. For instance, when being an engineer, you can pick 3 engineer perks, one gunner perk and one pilot perk. That way you're never completely useless taking over another role briefly, something which I really like. Now let's talk about the ships, seeing as they're the stars of this game. Each vessel is customizable to a certain degree. There a 6 different types of ship you can choose from. They range from quick but frail to sturdy but sluggish and several variations in between. They're all layed out differently as well, forcing you to learn the pro's and cons and how to get around on each one if you want to get good at the game. This isn't just important for defensive purposes like knowing the best route around the ship to get to a damaged part, but also to know what to aim for as a gunner, and what to steer clear from as a pilot. The goldfish for instance has its heaviest gun on the front. So you have to either try and stay at its side or be able to decommission the main cannon to stay out of harm's way. That brings me to the ship customization. There are a fixed number of weapon slots on each ship, predetermined for heavy or lighter gun types. While you can't just put any heavy cannon randomly on your ship, you do get to choose between various different guns for each slot.\n\nA fun setup for instance, is getting a lighter ship and having a heavy lumberjack cannon on the front, which does extra damage to balloons and also put some flamethrowers on the side. That way you can swoop in, cripple your enemy's vessel by forcing them into a descend, and then turn up above and around them and burn the ever living hell out of their ship. This will set their equipment on fire so any repairs are hampered, forcing them to keep plummeting and smash into the ground underneath! This is especially handy to take down the very sturdy but sluggish galleon type ship, as their main guns are on the lower sides and they would have a hard time aiming upwards at you while you burn them. It is well balanced however. This approach isn't going to be that effective when you take on more agile ships.\n\nI do have some very minor gripes with the game. It tends to crash to desktop every so often. However, the loading times are incredibly short and there's even a quick re-join button on the main menu that gets you right back into the match. If you crash it might literally only take 30 seconds to get back to your crew. Another thing is that the spawning might get a little glitchy for a few seconds, graphically. I think it has to do with the way the game loads. I've had the odd ship part glitching out too, but nothing too terrible. Actually, I've encountered very few game-breaking bugs overall.\n\nThe developers also promised to keep adding more content in the future and up 'till now, they've definitely kept their promises. You can also often see them online in the regional chat in the main lobby, actively conversing with the players. Concluding: I definitely recommend this one!","January 1, 2013","true","45.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot. Probably as much as I loved Natural Selection, Dota, or Mount & Blade. (TF maybe too)\n\nRewarding, updated, good looking, and balanced. The community is great. The matchmaking is reasonably good, and there are great stats, achievements & visuals to unlock/purchase (clothing, paints/dyes themes none of which gives you advantage in game mechanics, so there is ZERO PAY TO WIN).\nThe difficulty and complexity scales from novice to pro nicely so there's almost always something new to learn, a trick or experience you haven't done before.\n\nShort description:\nExciting team-based gameplay. Not like anything you have played before most likely.\nCrew combat airships of various specialties/layouts in 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 ships versus ships.\nEach ship has a crew of at least 1 pilot and 3 ai crew, or up to 4 players per ship crew (including pilot).\nUsually that means a driver, a gunner and some engineers who split their time repairing damage and shooting extra guns.\nThe learning curve for crew (non-driver) is pretty easy, the pilot is a bit more tricky (flying in 3 dimensions and leading your crew usually at the same time, often on voicecomm).\n\nA match generally consists of a lobby (either deathmatch; first team to a certain number of kills, king of the hill, or cap the flag/KotH), where a map is voted on, and both teams' ship, crew, and weapons setups are organized.. before the timer ends and the match starts (plenty of time generally).\nDuring a match you try put enemy ships in your weapons range/arc and knock out their components like guns, balloon, armor, or engines, with the hull under the armor being the finisher.\n\nEach weapon, and ammo have their own thing they are "mostly" used for, and a more strict effective range plus turning limit, so the pilot must work with the gunners to give the crew good lines of fire etc.\n\nNon-pilots also use spotting scopes to tag enemy ships with a bracket for easier identification at range. Ships can use cover of terrain and clouds to evade detection/damage. While piloting skills are often the most influential single factor in win:loss, a crew of really bad humans can contribute to a loss more than having ai crew sometimes, and a good human crew is ALWAYS better than the 'bots'.\n\nThe view from the open air deck of your ship is nice, and you as a crewperson are immune to enemy gun fire, but you can fall off, which leads to a realistic fall-time and death with an immediate respawn onboard. Once familiar with the ship layouts this will rarely, if ever, happen, and even if it does, it isn't a match ender.\n\nAs a ship is damaged, the guys with repair hammers go to work to get things repaired, which is pretty fast paced and well done as a mechanic. They also do firefighting and buffing on ship components. The hull itself cannot be repaired during the match, which is why ships want to try to keep their armor intact as much as possible to protect the hull/structure. And of course if you lose your balloon you fall out of the sky, no engines make you a sitting duck etc.\n\nPeople are nice and will 'teach you the trade' "on the job" quickly.\n\n9/10\nHighly recommended if you like teamwork games.","April 11, 2015","true","305.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only bad thing about this game is that there aren't enough people playing it, and that me and my friends have experienced a few server issues and random game shut downs.\nBut honestly the gameplay itself makes up for that. Because once you're flying through the skies and communicating with your friends, yelling who takes which gun and who is repairing what, where the ship is turning and where the enemies are going, it is an amazing and intense experience.\nTeamwork is crucial to this game, so I recommend either playing it with people you can commucate with or establishing a chain of command.\nAnother thing to love about this game is how satisfying the weapons feel! It is very satisfying to fire the weapons and have whatever projectiles you sent of connect with the enemy, heck even the reload animations are cool. The game has great athmosphere and everything feels alive, it is definately worth a try.","December 2, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If the other players in your crew dont do their jobs or simply suck at the game, then you are not gonna do very well no matter how good you are at the game.

The game's all about teamwork, enhancing and requiring a lot of contact between a ship's crew, which makes the game an amazing thing to play, and usually ends up being very socially cosy and enjoyable, and often gives you your daily healthy dose of rage. The community so far is great, too!\n\nAn important point to bring forward to this game is that in order to play correctly and efficiently, you WILL need a microphone. The developers have alternatives such as voice commands, which helps, but for the most fluent and efficient communications, one should use microphone communications. The microphone recording/playback quality in-game are very fast and good enough to understand each other clearly.\n\nThe game is well-populated and features an unique experience system through earning achievements. This encourages variety in your playstyle in order to discover what suits you and your crew most. Did I mention hats yet? Everybody likes hats. Especially if most of the cool hats and paint dyes are unlockable through gaining achievements anyway!\n\nApart from the unavoidable bugs every now and then, the game's graphics are neatly done and the UI is very accessible and easy to get the hang of. The music is repetitive but cool, and the gameplay is astonishing. The 3 different classes give the player an opportunity to play as they like. Extremely roughly said: for constant focus on dodging and tactically positioning the ship, as well as laying traps and ramming into others without being able to maintain the ship itself, choose Pilot. For routine maintaining the ship under heavy pressure, repairing and rebuilding, as well as shooting every now and then, go Engineer. For pure shooting with special ammo and helping out with repairs every now and then, take Gunner. There's usually room on a ship for 1 Pilot, 2 Engineers and 1 Gunner. At least, that is most likely the most beneficial option.\n\nOnce you go Guns of Icarus, ya can't stop, so get it now, I recommend it to everyone with a sense for action-packed fun, cooperation and enjoyment.","May 10, 2013","true","222.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll find yourself traveling along slowly, but there will always be something for everyone on your crew to be doing productively.

Given that ship crews are four people strong (captain, engineer and two gunners in my group) this works out well.\n\nFor an online-only game, and in absolute terms, the community is fantastic - never once have I encountered a rude player and novices actually get a chance to learn the game rather than be bullied out by the more-experienced players (looking at you, LoL).\n\nFeature-wise, the game is very dependant on teamwork, no single ship is overpowered and there are many different weapon loadouts for each given ship, making spotting and target identification a must-have skill. Each player can take five items of equipment (one sailing tool, one engineering tool, one gunnery tool; plus two extras for their chosen class), which allows for even more customisation in fighting style. The levelling system is strange but it works - achievements count towards levels, with so many achievements being needed to level up. Crucially for an online-only game, there is absolutely no pay-to-win.\n\nThe game looks amazing, there's no doubt about that. Everything is beautifully rendered and designed. The soundtrack and in-game SFX are also incredible.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that if the game lags, it can have a severe impact on the entire crew's effectiveness, especially if the Captain is the one with the lag issues.","February 13, 2014","true","40.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics in this game are amazing and when you fly around in a pretty environment the game looks amazing.  There are 3 different classes.  The first one being the gunner, obviously shooting at the other ships.  There is more to the gunner than just blowing ammo into the other ships.  You have different turrets and types of ammo you can cycle through and you also have to calculate projectile drop and damage based on the velocity of the shot.  The next role being engineer, which you have to repair the engines and turrets.  The engineers also have to put out fires on the ship and keep all of the systems working.  The next role is the pilot.  The pilot has to manuever the ship and stay away from danger.  There are many obstacles in the map.  You also have to make sure all of the gunners have a clear shot at the enemy planes while at the same time avoiding dust clouds that damage your plane.  Overall the game is great and worth every penny.  I picked it up during the sale in which it was 75% off so it was only $3.74.  I would say it is still worth it at it's original price.  To succeed in this game, you must use teamwork and cooperation to take down other ships.\n\n10/10","February 18, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a gold coin on the sidewalk of Steam just waiting to be picked up. If you enjoy flying gunships and running around like a headless chicken while your friends scream "argh, fix the hull! fix the hull, god dammit!" then this is the game for you.\n\nThe aerial combat is brilliant; there are microtransactions, but they are purely for cosmetic purposes and so it doesn't affect your gameplay. The teamwork element is the strongest part of this game; I guarantee you will hate it if you don't man a ship with 3 people with mics; or good friends.\n\nThere are a few downsides, mainly that there don't appear to be a lot of maps and the fact that there isn't a large player-base at the moment, which is a dead shame.\n\nOverall, if you want to test your friendships; revel at beautiful landscapes; and wage engaging aerial wars, then you have to buy this game.","June 21, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
