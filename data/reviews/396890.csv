"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChilledZero/recommended/396890/","ChilledZero","ChilledZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChilledZero/","70 products in account","So first things first you will need 64bit Java to run this game well and without crashes.\nGridworld is a very interesting simulator of evolution. When I first began playing I knew little about the controls for changing terrain or food and was more or less at the mercy of natural selection with what came of my world.\n\nMy First 3 Hours\nFor the first hour of eager scrutiny of my first world I saw nothing but failures of creatures. Organisms that could reproduce but lacked a mouth. Creatures that emitted poison but lacked the ability to survive contact with that poison. Animals that could eat but not move, etc, etc. Most of them died off quite rapidly. I saw the slightest glimmer of hope when I noticed a creature moving, eating, and reproducing but when it would reproduce, the parent would die and the offspring without much energy to begin with, would die very soon after if not directly next to some food. By and large these creatures all seemed doomed and world would become a lifeless hulk of uneaten food.\n\nI walked away from the computer and left my game on. watched a television show, came back and saw not much had changed. Having left the TV on I left the room again to turn it off, sat down at my computer and stared at the screen.\n\nThat's when I noticed a small group of creatures moving and eating food in the top right of the world.\n\nI immediately zoomed in to see these organisms:\n1. Moving\n2. Eating\n3. Reproducing\n4. Conserving enough energy to reproduce while keeping the parent alive.\n\nI WAS ECSTATIC. I sat back and watch these creatures, which I have dubbed 'Monchers', take over my world in no time. They spread like wildfire in a world abundant with food and devoid of competition. Now I see my little Monchers evolving with generation after generation, creating better, different, and sometimes flat out worse versions of themselves. Even as I type this the Monchers of my world are much more efficient than the first colony in that top right corner.\n\nWith food more scarce and competition increasing between the Moncher species I noticed Monchers with poison emitters to kill of competition, ones with more speed to collect food faster, and ones with less fancy "Neurons" as the game calls them, which are basically body parts or overall traits of your creature. With less traits though the monchers use less energy, allowing them to survive longer without a meal and pass on the genetic code.\n\nWith organisms that don't die within minutes, neurons actually become interesting features of your little animals. You wonder where evolution will take them next and what might succeed or fail. What species will die out or dominate.\n\nIn Conclusion\nThis game is an evolutionary petri dish of interesting results. Although actual interaction with the player is limited, it's more like a simulation than a game. An aquarium or jar of sea monkeys. But this is so much more than a jar of sea monkeys. It's like having a small world of your own. Species to watch and track. You'll see generations live and die. Creatures rise and fall. If you have the imagination to enjoy these small beings, and don't mind a back seat view of evolution, this is a very interesting game to leave up and watch from time to time.\n\nYou will not enjoy this game if you don't like the idea of:\nVERY simple pixel graphics.\nAt times hours of gameplay without change.\nHaving to make your own stories and use your own imagination for maximum enjoyment. Often times the most world altering moments can happen quickly and without much fanfair. To someone without their mind enveloped in the game world this would appear quite anticlimactic.\nThis game requires a lot of patience and creativity.\n\nIf any of these reasons don't sound appealing to you I would recommend you NOT buy the game. Otherwise I would highly recommend it.","December 30, 2015","true","7.8"," 176 of 182 people (97%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","97","176","182","18","10"

It plots AIs if you would like to call them that learn completely from scratch in this game to survive in what has been given to them, some don't even know how to move, or what food does or even what the lava does... You could say they learn from trail and error untill they are very smart. It does not follow any guidelines like AIs from CS:GO or any other games, because theses make their own guidelines or rules, which makes them unquie and this whole "game" unquie.\n\n\nIf you do not understand what neural networks are or even care about subjects related to Artificial Intelligence and or don't have much interest in that stuff don't bother with this Evolution Simulator even though all of them are like this, if you are still interested either way read below.\n\nThis is all obviously my opinion and how I feel about this game at current state.\n\nRead if you wanted to buy\nIf you like knowing you have essentially a miniverse running on your computer and having the AI or Neurons roaming around and knowing you can control their lives and watch as they survive inside this Simulator and seeing them evolve then you got yourserlf a Steam "game" you should buy. The control is limited though but offers more features then other evolution simulators I have played. The miniverse is also limited to a piece of flat land.\n\nIf you don't like waiting for them to evolve this cannot be changed you cannot edit the speed of a process like to go faster so don't buy it if you are not patient or want to spend hours and hours or even days on end running this game to see something happen. Unless you got some quantum computer, the faster the computer the faster it will be. Limited to the render settings. The creatures learns everything from scratch so it takes time to understand what that lava does or what food does, etc.\n\nconcerns\n-Menus are laggy when using the mouse and clicking on things...\n-Needs Java 64-bit to run without crashing and to even start the game.\n-Quite a lot of stuff happens on-screen and I don't undstand nearly all of it, I did see the developer was going to push out a guide which would be nice to see happen.\n\n\nThings I would like maybe\n-I would like to see generations so I can view the history of my creatures and spawn them, possibly.\n-Custom world sizes\n-Creatures structure, I do not understand what is the sensors or the mouth, etc. Is it meant to be like this?\n-I would like to zoom out more then the default.\n-More options in the options menu, fullscreen, etc.\n-The scrollers that edit the vaules get stuck all the time and are kinda a pain to use, I would like to input my own custom numbers.\n\nI have not looked a lot of things in-game because I simply do not understand what it does. I edit as I go.\nThough their are a few free simulators like this out there this is one of the first ones I have seen on Steam and actaully under development and what not.\n\nOn the other hand I like where the developer is going with this, I feel this is more learning towards a early acess game. I will add more to this as I play the game.","December 26, 2015","true","36.7"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","48","54","2","0"

I've always been fascinated by both evolution simulations and neural network simulations, so "Gridworld" was a must-have for me. Still, there are a few issues which I find highly annoying and hope that will be improved in updates in future. I've given the project as a whole a "thumbs up", though, because I strongly hope things will be improved... Some of the points:\n\n1) Give us more details! Maybe I have been blind and am just missing the obvious, but watching blinking colours is MUCH more fun, if you have a clue what its meaning is! Okay, most often it just differntiates differnt "creatures" or "neurons", but it would be good to have that verified... Even more important: There HAS to be some manual explaining what the various neurons "do" in the world, or it is just boring to see them evolve.\n\n2) I know that a simulation is not about "looking nice", but the UI in Gridworld is "lacking" at least. I think one can live with the very primitive optics, but what is unacceptable is the lack of "responsiveness" of certain elements. First, I thought it is simply the "workload" making it slow, but when you stop the simulation, the UI becomes fully un-responsive! That is horrible beyond measure...\n\n3) In a "simulation game", where observing is more or less all you do, the program has to offer as many "observing" features as possible. I'm missing a punch! I can "export" facts, but where can i see them plottet as graphs? I would like to do record "time-lapses" of my creatures evolvement to play as a simple "movie". I would like to have a "Analysis-Screen" for the neurons when I have a creature under the "microsocope", i.e. see how it's neural network "looks" and "behaves"....\n\n4) Autosave simulation. I've run a 14hrs simulation and it just "disappeared". (Gridwork stopped working and vanished at one point.) Have at least a "timed" auto-save to be able to recover!\n\n5) Randomness: The whole simulation is based on random evolution. I think it would be mandatory to provided the means to "recreate" the same random-numbers, i.e. the seed for the random generator should be an accessible option. Thus you can "rerun" a simulation to the identical effect and check what a "modification" of some sort would do.\n\n6) Optics: Not the most important, but it would be very, very nice if the "genes" and "networks" could be turned into some "creature-shape" to be visually inspected. Only in the microscope (to have short rendering times.)","December 31, 2015","true","116.7"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","34","37","2","0"

The first stages of competition have appeared!\n\n20 minutes later, the red poison creatures killed themselves and now the creatures are evolving to be super fast (and poison free).\n\nI accidentally caused near extinction 30 hours later by making the neural energy cost really high for a moment, then just keeping it raised slightly, and now the creatures are slowing down to save energy (40 jets instead of a high of 45 jets). Creature count is way, way down and they still haven't done any more new interesting things.\n\nLeft it on for 2 days while I was away, came back, they were EXTINCT. Also, the game updated, causing old saves to no longer work. I started over.\n\nCreature 2\n42 minutes after starting, viable life appeared (yay for random gen.) and they are currently randomly rotating to find food.\n\n23 hours later, they are finding food again.\n\nAt 43 hours, they had developed into viruses, inserting their dna into every other creature they touched. To keep things  interesting, I surrounded them with a ring of lava. They suicide into the lava quite often.\n\nThe update that forced me to restart really sped up creature replication, they are only 48 hours old and are already at generation 46400.\n\nThey are still running into lava, at generation 115,000, 163 hours after starting the simulation (596 hours if this were running at 30 FPS, according to the game).\n\n166 hours in, they now avoid lava!\n\n209 hours in:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614764502\nalso, here are some stats (140,000 generation): http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614767184\n\nGeneration 200,000! This game's natural selection seems to trend toward the most basic of creatures, as it has been 342 hours and my creatures consist of pretty much just jets, mouths, neurons, dna and eyes. Even my attempt to force stingers hasn't led to their development.\n\nGame updated, highest generation was at 246,000. Nothing special happened.\n\nCreature 3\nTesting to see what the game will decide is best adapted to a basic lava map.\n\nEven faster this time, in only 10 hours the creatures are moving toward food.

When I get back, all my creatures fall under several groups:\n-No ability to move, eat or reproduce, so they spend all their lives spinning over and over.\n-The ability to move and rotate, but no way to eat or reproduce, so they wander until they starve\n-The ability to eat, but no ability to move or reproduce, so they eat what they spawn on and then die.  Spinning optional.\n-The ability to move, eat and rotate... but no way to reproduce.\nI decide to leave the game running overnight to see what happens.\nDay 2, morning:\nMost of the food is gone, but a single species has risen to dominance, at about generation 250.  It's capable of fast movement, rotation, eating and reproduction.  Due to their high speed, I dub them SANIC.  They spend their lives rushing from food source to food source, spitting out a baby every once in a while.  As an experiment, I drop a few meteors here and there, decimating the food supply and the number of creatures.  I leave it running while I go run errands.\nDay 2, evening:\nI return to a horror show.  Many of the grazers have died, as they can't find food fast enough before they starve.  The surviors are the the 650th generation, and have split into two major subspecies.  One is the descendant of the original grazing SANIC species, having lost much of its speed in order to conserve energy.  The other subspecies is their closely related cousin, who gained the ability to steal energy, and alternate between eating food nodes... and their kin.  They seem to have no ability or desire to diffrentiate between relatives and the grazing species, and devour both with glee.  I've watched several times where instances would consume their children immediately after birth, or children assaulting and eating their parents after birth.

Unless you find the various ways in which you can artificially accelerate evolution, you will be waiting many HOURS before you start seeing anything interesting happening.  Take solace, however, because you can mostly just leave this running on its own in the background and check back after a few hours.  You will find out things have advanced in somewhat predictable, but also somewhat random ways.  Eventually, you will have rather functional little creatures running around in your world doing things that actually make sense.  It takes a VERY long time for this to happen, however.\n\n\nIt would be nice if the game had some sort of guide or at least a link to a guide detailing what the various colors and squares mean.

Apart from setting initial parameters (world type, mutation frequency, etc.), it's mostly about letting your little petri dish world sit and develop. Checking in on it periodically is fun, as you can definitely see progress after several hours, but don't expect a whole lot of detailed interaction. The interface and details do take a little while to get used to, but it's cool to be able to look at fairly detailed information about each organism. I only wish the creator had put in more options to track "species" rather than just individuals.\n\nIf you like watching little worlds and systems develop on their own, this is the game for you (just don't go in expecting, as another user said, a world as detailed as Rick and Morty's battery). If you're less patient, or if you need to have more moment to moment control, you'd probably be better off buying another game.","May 14","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here is what i got out of it.\n(NOTE: This is NOT a game however, so much as a simulation.)\n\nOverview: GridWorld more or less introduces a concept of order coming from chaos. It starts by creating random bits of AI with random atributes. It has a custom grid that sections off these AI, and generates a field of food, with some basic enviromental conditions.\n\nGameplay:  While this is more of an educational simulation with the express purpose of demonstrating how evolution from chaos works on a micro scale, there are afew key events to look for.\n\n*The Kickoff-\nThe goal is to find an AI with atributes that can sustain itself and can have offspring (an organism that can eat, move, and reproduce). This is where most people get irritated because they dont understand how RNG works, and assume the game is broken. But in actuality it can take afew hours for the big "kick off" to happen. But once it does, the organism will spread like wildfire, consume the food on the map, and then reach a population equalibrium.\n\n*Observation of mutation and AI-\nFrom here on out, the dominant AI will have a random chance of mutation with each reproductive cycle. The mutation  will either hurt or help the mutated AI. If it hurts, then the AI dies quickly. But if it helps, the mutated AI will slowly take over the pre-existing non mutated ones because of its better surviability. (my first time around, it was actually canibalism, go figure.)\nAdditionally, the AI has the ability to "learn" and can develop some interesting behavioral patterns, in a similar fashon to physical mutation. As an example, it may learn to avoid the lava boundary.\n\nMy opinion:\nIn my opinion, this is a well made simulation. It perfectly demonstrates order from randomness, and how evolution is a thing. I think the most irritating thing is the GUI, and id like a better explaination of all the functions, the different physical attributes, along with the AI copy function. Some things id like to see are achievements, as this is a gaming platform, i think some game type things are in order. I think the developer is working as hard as they can on improving these aspects, so i can forgive the games minor flaws. As for the negative reviews ive seen and complaints about how the game "doesnt work", RNG sometimes isnt in your favor, but thats not the games issue thats just how math works. Anyways, its an all around decent educational simulation, and its kinda an envigorating feeling to have your own little AI world. I would recomend it to anyone with an interest in computer AI, biology, or if you have 99 cents. Thanks for reading!","May 28","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
