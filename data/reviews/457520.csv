Moustache Mountain is an example of this, and I tried really hard to like it.  I really did.  But even at a low price, the flaws in this game far outweigh the positives.\n\nNow, let me be fair up front and say that I'm not a big platformer guy.  I know, that spells bias right there, but I can get on board if there are some interesting mechanics.  And that's the problem here -- the mechanics are just boring.  One can argue that this is intended to be an NES-throwback, retro experience, but I more get the feel that the game is being limited by either the developer's experience level or a game builder platform used to create it.  In any case, while the levels are "randomized" (they're not randomly generated, but merely picked at random from a pre-selected set), none of them are very interesting, and you beat the game if you get past level 15.  I found a lot of the challenges to be cheaply frustrating, like having to jump around a ledge/overhang while you're trying to bounce up the wall.  Maybe my lack of platforming prowess is what was holding me back, but I usually had to try 10-12 times to complete this manuever, only to die on some spike once I got past it, and then start over from the beginning of the level again.\n\nThe graphics are fairly dull, and the sound loop gets old in a heartbeat.  Rather than practice this game to get good enough to beat it, I decided to move on to another more interesting title in my collection of 600+ (and let's face it, that means there are a lot I haven't played yet, so if a game doesn't get interesting fairly quickly, it's time to switch gears).  I do plan leave it open over night to collect the trading cards, which I can at least use for leverage for other ones I'm trying to collect.  So, kudos to the dev for at least creating achievements and trading cards.  I just wish he'd invested as much time in the graphics, sound, and gameplay of this game.\n\nAt least I got this as part of a bundle, so I don't feel like I need to return it or anything.  I'd encourage the dev to keep trying, but to spend a lot more time focusing on concepts and mechanics that will make the game interesting and differentiate it from the hundreds of others available on Steam.  In the meantime, I can't recommend this one.","May 8","false","6.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Note that my ability to enjoy a game is not influenced by how I recieved it.\nMoustache Mountain is a retro platformer consisting of you (a muscular man with a sexiful beard) climbing a mountain defying the laws of gravity in search of a most magical moustache gel.\n\nAs you stare at the starting menu you will discover that your mouse is utterly useless; the arrow keys are the way to go. Once your brain adapts to this you will press play and find yourself flung straight into the world of your young moustache enthusiast. The controls are briefly displayed on the screen as you bounce your way through the first level, but it is this brief explanation that produced some of the parts I enjoyed about the game and others I didn't.\n\nIn regards to story, this brief explanation was not good, because there isn't a story. If you scroll above this review and read the description of this game you will find some very descriptive words about why good Ol' Moustache Man is climbing this mountain. You don't get any of that in-game, not even a simple cut scene just briefly explaining why you are climbing these damn floating patches of dirt.\n\nIn regards to gameplay, this brief explanation made the game more enjoyable. As you progress through the game you learn things for yourself (even though they are rather minor) which made it much more enjoyable. However, I also feel that this lack of explanation was also due to the lack of content in the game. If scroll up again you can come across the list of features in the game, two of which being:\n\n15 levels of increasing difficulty\n\nAND\n\nEvery play through is different thanks to randomisation\n\n15 levels of increasing difficulty? Yes, but 15, only 15 levels. Judging by the achievements it's possible to finish the game in under 3 minutes so I'm guessing those 15 don't really stand a chance after a few hours of gameplay. But what about the fact that every play through is different thanks to randomisation. Is it different? Is it really that different? Barely, it's just a collection of pre made levels that are randomly chosen each time you start a new game. You will play the same levels numerous times. This begs the question, 'is this game worth $2?' I think $2 may be stretching it. If I had to choose I would say anything ranging from free-$1. I also think that you would see more positive reviews if the game was a F2P title.\n\nEven with these said points, I still rather enjoyed the gameplay. No, it wasn't innovative. No, it didn't have diverse gameplay, what it did have was simplicity, meaning it was simple enough for me to enjoy.\n\nVisually the game looked terrific. The pixel graphics suited the game and were done very well. The pixelated face and body of Moustache Man was not only seductive provocative, but one of this game's most appealing aspects.\n\nThe developer also seems to be working on adding more content such as a co-op mode. What I would like to see apart of the game in the future would be a possible 'Daily Run', more options (e.g. Key rebinding), more game modes and more randomised levels.\n\n\nSummary\nPros\n✔ Gameplay that lets you learn for yourself\n✔ Fun simplistic gameplay\n✔ Nice graphics\n✔ Developer working on more content\n\nCons\n✘ No story\n✘ Lack of content\n✘ Possibly overpriced\n\nConclusion\nMoustache Man does not stand out in a large collection of platformers. Me persuading you to buy this would be a bad idea, I feel that if you were interested in the game you should catch it on sale and be open to the idea of a refund. Though what I can guarantee you is some short and enjoyable gameplay that you might like to pop in and play every now and then.\n\n6.5/10\n\nDid you enjoy that review?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/457520/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","Super Moustache Man and the quest for the magical moustache gel\n\nTL;DR: Moustache Mountain is a short but challenging platformer.\n\nIn Moustache Mountain you play as a jumpy, athletic guy who has a moustache (that sound oddly familiar?) and a simple quest: go onward and reach the top of the mountain. Graphics are indie-minimalistic but fine at that, and the funky 8-bit-like music fits the game like Super to Mario.\n\nGameplay is simple enough. Each level is just one screen and your job is to reach the right side of it. To do this you may run (with a constant pace as there is no boost), jump, climb and wall-jump all the while avoiding traps. Initially I thought there might be some secret areas or collectables in the hard-to-reach parts of the levels, but alas, it really boils down to reaching the other side of the level.\n\nControls are slick and work perfectly. You can play with either keyboard or controller (I used the latter). The only shaky thing is the wall-jumping that only seems to work when moving towards the wall at the same time as you jump, which is inconvenient when you have to try and jump to an overhanging ledge but matters little when you just want to climb. In comparison the movement mechanics are almost the same as in e.g. Super Meat Boy or A Walk in the Dark.\n\nNooo, not the spikes!\nWhile those games are admittedly more difficult (and longer), there's challenge in Moustache Mountain. Initial levels are just simple parkour challenges but soon enough the levels become filled with deadly spikes, dart traps and cleavers. You have only three lives and once they are spent, it's game over. At least there are no generic saw blades!\n\nThat sounds pretty bad though, right? No one has time for starting over these days. But wait, actually Moustache Mountain is really short. With only 15 levels the game can be beaten in under 3 minutes. There's even an achievement for that. And thankfully the hitboxes are quite generous so you know most your deaths will be your own fault. Isn't that conforting?\n\nTo counter the eventual repetition, Moustache Mountain has a trick to shake things up and keep it fresh: there are more levels than it initially appears. While a single run has only 15 levels of increasing difficulty, the level roster changes between runs and effectively there are something like 50 different levels. All the levels become familiar as dying is easy in any level that you haven't played before. I think this was a neat way to expand the game.\n\nThat said, I would have liked to practice specific levels more without having to play through the whole game before randomly running into them. A sort of practice mode would have been a nice addition, although after a few tries even the more difficult levels become beatable.\n\nConclusions\nIt's a pity that even with the rotating levels Moustache Mountain took me only something like 40 runs to complete (both without dying and under 3 minutes), amounting to about 1.5 hours. Interestingly I can see that the challenge could be too much for some people: the less you've played platformers, the longer effective playtime it offers. You can also compete on the leaderboards for the shortest runs.\n\nBy the way: There's a local co-op mode though I didn't try it. However it seems that some of the later levels might be more difficult in co-op because of the reactive traps. Hard to say whether that's a good or a bad thing though it might add some randomness and fun to the soup.\n\nFor a game that costs 2 € it has an okay amount of content. It has Steam cards too to sweeten the deal. If you like platformers go ahead and buy it to get a quick snack.","May 12","true","1.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You are a young moustache enthusiast that has heard about the legends of the magical moustache gel. You go on an adventure to climb a mountain to find the magical moustache gel. There are alot of good things about this game, but also alot that needs to be added or changed.\n\nFor $1.99USD this game is coming along nicely, but it is not quite there yet. At the moment, in the current state of the game, it is fun for maybe a few hours at most. I would really like to see the full potential of this game though, because I believe that with the time and effort it can be turned into a marvellous 2D indie platformer. I would definitely keep an eye out for updated and patches to this game, such as the rumoured local co-op / multiplayer.\n\nPros:\n+ The unique music and sounds in this game really gives you the feel of a 2D platformer.\n+ The gameplay is quite challanging and is good fun for a while.\n+ The graphics and art style is appealing.\n+ The are a many different levels that are randomised in a different order each time you start a game.\n+ Devs are updating and working on the game.\n\nCons:\n- Would of liked to see more options changing the gameplay.\n- Not enough levels and variety in graphics for the levels.\n- No points system or something you can can pick up and collect on each level (eg. moustaches).\n- Would like to see the story incorporated into the game a bit more and content variety.\n\nVerdict:\n7/10\n\nThanks for checking out this review!

Your character who does not appear to have a name so I will call him tommy has a mustache. Tommy has a problem a good mustache needs wax to look its best, but his mustache demands only best and storebought will not get the job done. Tommy hears rumors of an ancient mustache wearing race of monks that created mystical mustache gel. The problem they decided to hide it ontop of flying mountain filled with deadly traps for they knew that facial hair grants you ninja like reflexes and they did not want this gel falling into the hands of non mustacheoed normal people.\npresentation\nMustache mountain looks like an old school platformer. The level design is well laid out and changes with each playthrough. While the worlds are not randomly generated there are a number of ones predesigned so it will be random on what levels you get.\nSound\nThe sound effects are simple, but fitting of the games art direction. Playing with sound on helps as it alerts you of some traps giving you the time to react.\nmusic\nThe music is a simple loop that fits for the game style, but gets repetative quickly. The problem with the music is you can not turn it off without also turning off the sound and since the sound helps with reacting to traps you are forced to listen to the music. I would sugest if a future update comes out enabling turning off the music seperate from sound.\ncontrol\nTommy controls perfectly he is a mustache ninja. You are able to play with both a controller or keyboard. The most important mechanic for a platformer is solid control and the developer nailed it with this game. you move and jump fluidly. Since tommy is a mustache ninja he can wall jump to avoid the hazards.\nDifficulty\nAs you clear levels the difficulty scales up. Expect to die at least a few times on your way to the top of the mountain. The deaths never feel cheep however if you die its because your reaction time failed to be good enough. after three deaths you must shave your mustache and it is back to the beginning of the game while this might seem harsh it is not bad since if done right you will clear the game in under 6 minutes.\nending\nTommy scales 15 random levels dodges spikes pitfalls and razor blades trying to shave off his mustache. He gets to a giant mustached statue in its mouth the prize of perfect mustache gel. Tommy's mustache assends him to the heavens and he now Lords over all..... or the game goes back to the title screen adn you may start again.\nbonus content\nThe only extra gameplay content in mustache mountain is the option to play local co-op with a friend. I had no access to another mustacheod friend so I do not have a verdict on co-op. There are however achievments to try and collect not to mention with the random level selection this is plenty of replay fun.\nFinal Verdict\nThis game is fun if you enjoy a good solid platformer in the likes of super meat boy you will most likely enjoy this game. Yes it is insanely short the record for beeting it is just over two minutes, but at a price point of $2 that is perfectly fine. I got this game the night before I did a 10k that I had to be up at 5:30am for I stayed up 40 minutes later then I wanted just saying alright one more time. I am going to be keeping an eye on future games from Nauris AMnatiaks. Mustache mountain gets Jawfins Seal of approval.\n","April 17","true","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johanforster/recommended/457520/","johanforster","Nameless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johanforster/","183 products in account","Moustache Mountain is a small platformer featuring a total of 15 single-screen levels (with a couple of variations each), a few different simple mechanics to avoid and... well, not much more. The level design is bland and almost every sprite seems to have been copied and pasted between the stages. There's a single audio loop soundscoring the entire game.\nExpect about 30 minutes of game play to beat the game and about two hours if you want to clear all the achievements. Even at the low price point of a couple of Euros I think it's a mediocre value proposition at best. I can appreciate the art style but that's about all the game has going for it.\n\nIf the developer adds a bit of additional content I might revisit my rating but for now there is no way that I could recommend this game.","April 16","false","2.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Yes, the things that I said about this game that I enjoyed, I actually enjoyed. Do I think this is the greatest game of all time? No. Would I recommend this to my friends that I know enjoy fun and difficult platformers with a fast paced nature? 100%. The dev reached out to me on Twitter after seeing one of my other reviews and offered up a code. I did my best to cover it fairly, and most of what I have to say is more about level mechanics than about my personal feelings. Thank you for reading, I will update with my video review once it is live. ~Sam from Gametionary]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXl2-1em2Eo&feature=youtu.be\n\nMoustache Mountain is a platforming jump puzzler akin to titles like Super Meatboy, in that it is insanely difficult at times, but also charming and fun. There are multiple variations of every stage that are picked at random for each playthrough. For such a game that is so simple at face value there is a surprising amount to talk about here.\n\nBefore I even get into my personal opinions on the game and what lead to moments of anger and despair I have to talk about what this game did objectively correct from a level design standpoint.\n\nLike Arin Hanson said in his Megaman X episode of Sequelitis, there was a time when video games were treated like traditional games. In the sense that you would have no idea what was going on unless someone explained the rules to you. But more importantly he said “[The game’s] biggest strength has always been to teach a player through its level design.” Moustache Mountain does that brilliantly.\n\nLevel one is set up, in all of its variations, as a way to teach the player how jumping is going to work in the game. You’re typically not going to die here unless you have absolutely never played a platforming game in your life, in which case, please do not kill me when you invade Earth you alien that is surely going to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the human race after you play this game.\n\nLevel two gets a bit more complex and shows you how wall jumping works by throwing in a couple of jumps that are too high for you to reach. Now this is good, but what else is there to learn once you know this? I mean there’s only one button in the game.\n\nWell, in level three you discover that sometimes you’re going to have to slide down walls to jump up, in level four you will learn that death comes in the form of terrifying bloody spikes, in five you’ll learn to slow down and look before you leap and in level six you will learn that these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ledges are the bane of your existence.\n\nNow, I’m not going to go further than level 6 in explaining the more complex level elements that come up, because they are genuinely surprising when they ruin your day. What I will say is, the way the game teaches you the tools you need to advance is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.\n\nNow on to some opinions.\n\nGraphically I really enjoy the art style. It’s somewhere inbetween washed out and extremely colourful which is pleasing to the eyes. I also was a fan of the parallax effect of the background. There isn’t a tonne of movement, but there is enough that the game world has some life to it, which is nice. One hang up I do have, despite enjoying the art style, I wish that there was more variety to the game’s visuals. Everything sort of looks the same and if there was more variation I think it would improve the game tenfold.\n\nI cannot imagine playing this game without a controller. It’s a bit of a pixel hunt at times to make certain ledge jumps and analog sticks are pretty much the only way to have a proper reaction time. I also noticed that there was an occasional input lag on the jumps which can be detrimental to time sensitive puzzles.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game for its high replayability factor. If it looks like something that would interest you, I recommend you pick it up. Also, the developer is a super nice guy so I have no problem saying you should be supporting him.","April 1","true","1.0"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","2"

This part is to the developer. Number one, it would be cool to have a matchmaking system where you could speed run through levels with friends/random online players, fastest person gets more points, whoever dies first ends and you have the option to launch a new game. Number two is more level variation, like maybe you could have some levels that take place in a city or a forest, you get the idea.

There could've been an awesome story to it that could add so much more to the game. With larger visual variety and like secret levels and collectables... THAT would add so mutch more value to the game!","April 3","false","10.9"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

It's a challenging, relatively inoffensive randomised (randomly ordered, not randomly generated) platformer with appealing visuals and a piece of short music that loops and drives you slowly insane. 10/10, would moustache again.","March 31","true","4.0"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","9","25","3","0"
