Because, well, Proteus is one of my all-time favourite art pieces. A giant leap in the of use of the videogame medium to express mature and philosophical subjects, taking advantage of its interactive elements to maximize the spectator involvement with a natural and surreal environment. A contemplative but also narrative masterwork, that evokes Andrei Tarkovsky’s existentialist films. And all of these elements were emphasized by the experimental approach of David Kanaga regarding musical composition. Using layers of sounds, like a painter that selects from a range of colors to fill a blank canvas with joyful and hedonistic emotions.\n\nSo, I was skeptical about Panoramical because contrary to Proteus and its narrative approach, now we’re talking of a fully abstract creation, that also implies taking a lot of new risks in its conception. Proteus was a pleasant and absorbing experience thanks to its magnificent artistic and musical design. But it also succeeded in touching the player’s heart with its psychological and complex structure, based in the recurrent art theme of using a seasons cycle as a metaphor to express an entire human life. The childhood innocence and sense of magical discovery of a new world full of stimulations in the spring. The fauna at its plethora in the summer, like a metaphor of the puberty. The quietness realization of maturity in an autumn envolved by sad and dissonant musical notes. The terrifying and ominous proximity of death in the winter, where the life forms are replaced with sinister tombs. And a final cycle of ascension to an elevated and deeper plane of reality, full of hope, where you finally close your eyes, with an emotional fade to black conclusion.\n\nBut after I can finally experiment Panoramical, and while I still remain exhilarated with its sheer beauty, I can say that is the most ambitious work created by David Kanaga to date. And that his ability to create pure and intense emotions in the spectator still remains intact. If Proteus was an impressionist painting based on the theme of nature, Panoramical is more close to Kandinsky abstract creations, affecting the player’s perception in subtle and unconscious ways. And it has one of the most impressive virtual environments conceived in the interactive art medium since Tetsuya Mizoguchi’s Rez.\n\nFernando Ramallo and David Kanaga’s new creation will appeal not only to Proteus fans, but also to all the admirers of Toshio Iwai’s underground cult classic Electroplankton. Like Electroplankton, Panoramical is a fascinating toy for musical creation, with an extremely original control scheme based in the use of a MIDI controller, that also fits perfectly a gamepad button layout. But unlike Electroplankton or the also similar Cosmic DJ, Panoramical has the ambition of being much more that a simple musical toy. Becoming a complex rehearse about the use of geometry forms and musical patterns to create intense and vivid emotions in the player, but also serving as a tool for intimate artistic expression.\n\n( The writer of this review is not an English native. So you should expect occasional grammar errors.

I don't believe I've ever had some many friends "wish list" a game I've reviewed or suggested.)\n\nI’ve just begun experiencing PANORAMICAL, and I’m damn near speechless.\n\nIt’s not a game, there’s nothing to win, no one to defeat, no points to score (as far as I can tell.) Only a world of your own making, or at least “fine tuning”, to explore in literally endless variety and scope. The intro and first two scenarios begin to display the possibilities, and so far that’s where I am. I wanted to report this “discovery” as quickly as possible, for all my friends (and others that understand such worlds of imagination.) The “player” (“conductor”, more like it) can use keyboard and mouse, game controller, or MIDI device to control nine aspects of the image on the screen. Color, texture, detail, weight, proportion…I don’t even know what each is, but it's pretty easy to see the specific results of each key. Each aspect is controlled by one of nine keys, and selecting a position on an XY graph. The Store Page indicates that there are actually eighteen controls, so I can’t conceive of the complexity, or uniqueness possible (though that may refer to nine keys times two dimensions.) The screenshots are recorded by the TAB rather than F12, a non-issue, but important to know.\n\nAnd the music of PANORAMICAL…even at this early stage it’s so suitable to the wonder and magic of the images. (And it doesn’t cost extra!) Apparently there are fifteen very different landscapes, all within your control (you, and the music.) This is one of the only of over 600 games that I want on both my PCs. I want this running while I play other games (offline), and while I watch movies, and while I read and while I sleep. I want this to be the background to my life. And all this after seeing the trailers, and less than ten minutes of the actual program.\n\nMy friends, and the Community Hub, will be seeing many of my screenshots, so each of you can be your own judge. And as I learn more, I’ll report more in this review. It would not surprise me if this becomes one of the highest rated “games” on Steam (as long as players understand what they are purchasing.) They can only be surprised that it’s more than was ever expected.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)","September 17, 2015","true","3.3"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","39","47","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/284260/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY: A musical/visual game where you manipulate various settings to create your own visual/musical combinations.  Worth purchasing if you enjoy experiential games, and like unusual musical and video experiences.\n\nPanoramical is best summed up as an audio/visual toy.  It's a kind of spiritual lovechild of screensavers, Proteus, and  the Atari C-240.\n\nAs you play (with minimal instruction) you enter various settings.  In those you have nine factors you can maniuplate - there's no directions, you have to find what they do.  Each factor alters both the musical and the visual landscape - what could be a mysterious black and white swamp, with a few tweaks, becomes a strange mirrored plain with shooting stars flying about.  Music could be dissonant, orchestral, whimsical, or something else.\n\nEach world presents different factors, effects, and sounds - and it's up to you to figure them out.  You can make amazing things with this game if you take the time.\n\nOne thing I came up with early on when playing was to simply mix a world then leave it on in the background.  Just let the music and world I made fill the room while I worked.\n\nPretty much you can tell right now if you'd like this game.  If you like things that are unusual and experimental, especially in the audio/visual vein, then you're probably already buying it.  If you're looking for something strange and fun to play with, you may consider it.  If you're looking for a traditional game with some funky graphics and music, it's probably not your bag.\n\nI will note that the same above applies for gifts.  If it's not for you but you've got that friend who loves her weird electronica or he loves playing with graphics, you just found a great present.\n\nPass on it or spend hours jamming out to imaginary music worlds, your choice.  But it is a nice job of programming and obviously made with a love of music.","September 18, 2015","true","17.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","0"

It practically allows you to generate your own abstract scenes within the game limits.\n\nThere are 15 scenes and you have 9 switches to manipulate them: change environments, add effects, make that percussion sound to be faster, etc. It sounds pretty basic and boring when you read it, but in the game it feels like pure magic and you can't say for sure what do you change exactly, how it affects the scene and what is going on.\nThe music (entirely electronic, of course) fits very well and adds to the atmosphere, although some of the tracks are pretty chaotic and feel entirely randomly generated (I believe to some extent they are).\n\nThe process is fairly simple – you hold a button and move a stick, either right or left one, depends on which button you hold. You hold the left stick once you're finished and move on to the next scene.\n\nThe game feels well polished and I didn't find any technical problems with it. The interface is excellent, very stylish.\n\nIt's an essential buy for people who like watching abstract/trippy art / scenes / video / you get it. It can be useful for meditations, trips or just watching it for the sake of its mesmerizing beauty.\n\nReview key provided by the developer\nSasha Darko for Game Obscura","March 14","true","0.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You can manipulate them and change them into something else. The sounds seem to move along with the changes or is it the visuals that move along with the sounds? It doesn't matter. Behind me, my boyfriend tells me later, the cats were breaking down the house, but I was completely oblivious and sucked into my screen. Yes I was on a trip. A journey.\n\nallthought I write a lot of reviews for websites and newspapers, this is actually the first time I decided to write something on Steam. I feel like I have to, there are people who don't get this game and I'm not saying that my vision is THE way to interpret it. But it got to me in a way where I just have to share my experience of this game.  Or is it even a game? It acts as a crossover between a game and sound-editing program with trippy visuals. But really I see it as participatory art.\n\nIt completely rips up the whole concept of 'game' and what we expect of it, and that to me is what makes it even more fascinating. It starts right out with the intro and menu being so incredibly organic, instead of the typical list of buttons you can click, it's a dial that looks almost like a living organism. It's incredibly easy to start 'playing', the controls are very intuitive. I think a game like this encourages natural play a lot more than some other bigger games out there, where you have to follow certain paths in very constrictive ways.\n\nThe music goes from angelic to stomping to racing and back again, it's mellow and then it's intense. You can adapt it like you are the creator of this little musical universe that keeps on moving and hypnotizing you. It is like you can SEE the music, a concept called synthesia, where the different areas of the brain that control our senses get connected or mixed up. Normally only people with a rare condition, or people on psychedelics get to experience this. And now we can sit behind our screens, completely sober and touch on that magical experience. Allthough I must admit being high makes it even more immersive - if you can handle, try it! Pretty sure that makers had a few trips that inspired them to make this.\n\nI must admit thought, if you're sensitive to bright lights and flashy visuals, be careful cause it's VERY intense. I'm glad I'm on preventative medication for migraines, else I would probably, or rather definitely have had an attack from this game. Having said that, I can't really discover anything else that I didn't like about this game.\n\nOf course it's a matter of taste if you like it and since it's so different, I'm pretty sure it will be a niche group that will be drawn to this game. But I guess it's the same with art, not everyone likes it in the first place and then there's all the different types of art. If you go to a museum you might pay ten euros for the entrance and look at still lives of similar visuals. Now you get to participate, make music, manipulate visuals and even make sceenshots of your trip. I think it's well worth the money and I would love to see more of the makers.\n\nAlso I think that it works different than a regular game where you level up and go through the story and then you finish after 50 hours. This is an experience, and I feel I would like to go back to that experience every once in a while, but not hours at a time.\n\nAfter playing this I feel stimulated, refreshed and inspired. Something like a meditation.","September 21, 2015","true","1.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

These people are cowards.\n\nThinking about Panoramical (or any game, really) in terms of "content" is a mistake; it's like arguing that an album is terrible because it's the same dozen songs over and over, or arguing that your local playground sucks because there's only 3 slides instead of 6 slides. The point is that YOU and YOUR DAMN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE are the "content"? HEY MAYBE THAT'S WHAT ART IS???\n\nInstead, here's how I recommend thinking about Panoramical: it's an album, it's a place to hangout in, it's one of the best local co-op experiences in years. Play this while intoxicated, while sad, while happy, while alone, while with friends, while unemployed, while angry. Panoramical will listen to you and respond better than any other game.\n\n(disclaimer: I know the developers but I bought my own copy)","September 25, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

If you approach this game passively, just turning the knobs here and there and hoping that something will be revealed to you, then a  screensaver  pretty much sums it up.\n\nHowever, if you approach it more actively and imaginatively, then it can be much more.  I think of those Japanese sand gardens.  You know, rake the sand and make "ripples" and now the rocks and pebbles are mountains and islands, and you see a whole world being created – a reflection of how you see the world.  The game in this way is intensely personal and meditative.\n\nThere are similarities with Proteus - colors and abstracted shapes and sounds.  But Proteus spells out the world pretty clearly for us to explore - paths, trees, hills, day and night;  here, what you see is mostly a reflection of what you imagine; what you imagine is then reinforced by what you see.","September 22, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall, the music hangs in a kind of adjustable steady flow which creates a calm, meditating sense of play but it can get a bit repetitive and too much in the ambient genre. Personally, I prefer the  stages that include a certain sense of advancement in them. the first and last stages portray this nicely and especially the selection of guest stages fare best in this matter.\n\nI hope the developers will find a way to bring some more content to the game or ideally create an editor for users to create more stages themselves. That would make the possibilities endless.\n\nStill it's a worthy and refreshing experience hard to be disliked!","September 19, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
