"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laptop65/recommended/10180/","Laptop65","Laptop65","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laptop65/","192 products in account","Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them. I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this.\n\nCAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):\n\nThe campaign is about 6 hours long roughly. It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty. The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours. Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game. Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign. As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements. There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels. The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\n\nSPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):\n\nThe Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level. There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2. 21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend. There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player. The missions get harder and harder as they go on. Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4. There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing. There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign.\n\nMULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):\n\nThe Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2. The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels. When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment. You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here. You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on. You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this.\n\n\nConclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale. I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision.\n\nThings to be aware of -\n\nThere is no direct controller support for this game.\n\nIf you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs. If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there.\n\nMW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers. It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you.\n\nThis game uses VAC. So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent. There is no way to lift a ban. You have been warned.\n\nAt the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play. Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment.\n\nSingle Player / Spec Ops Hub - http://steamcommunity.com/app/10180\nMultiplayer Hub - http://steamcommunity.com/app/10190\n\nThank you for reading and enjoy the game if you decide to purchase!","November 25, 2013","true","175.0"," 465 of 527 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","465","527","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smurphy-/recommended/10180/","Smurphy-","Smurphy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smurphy-/","61 products in account","This game helped me through severe depression after my wife left me. I was a mess, binging on coke and strippers to try and forget the pain she brought to me. Next thing I knew I was shooting Heroin in a Vietnamese rice farmer's hut. Don't ask me how I got there and why I decided to stay for 7 months amongst his family of 12, but I thought this was the end of my miserable life. As I lay naked in a pile of my own and what was mostly the vietnamese family's vomit and excrement... there I saw it. The light glistening on the screen. It seemed MW2 had swept the world by its feet and even in the remote jungles of Vietnam it managed to find itself. It was clear to me, this was a sign. God himself intended for me to see it. The little vietnamese child obviously didn't know what he was doing, as the little noob camped in the corner with his ACR with dual attachments of a heat sensor and a silencer, I marvelled at the beauty of this game. At once I got up, and I ran. Did I know which way to run? No. But I didn't let that stop me. Sooner or later I was back in the humble streets of my hometown. I picked up MW2 for PS3 at tescos and went on to play the game for 4 days straight without food or water. My mother and father were a little worries considering they presumed me dead and I hadn't bathed since I was back. But if there's anything I learned it's that In those 4 days I was born again, although I soiled myself several times and passed out once, I knew what it meant in life to experience pure joy and happiness. As a married man with 2 beautiful children now I really hope MW2 is brought on to next gen consoles; it will bring the utmost joy to me, and my children will be able to relive the pure ecstacy I felt. Of course they're not old enough to play yet and not even nearly mentally developed to even comprehend what would be going on as they are still babies. But the bright and vivid images of their father getting that 30th kill streak with his ump-45 silencer will fill their small hearts with pride. As they watch their father roar in triumph as the screen goes white and the battle ceases. There I will stand proud a man. A man with a 5.2 K/D ratio. A true champion. A figure to look up to. A figure to learn from. And you better believe that once they are of legal age I'll teach them and guide them to achieve the successes I have. But alas as my imagination delves deep into a utopian world it hits me that in fact this is not the case. Instead I lay here in bed next to my Russian mail-ordered wife. where only these fantasies numb the cruel pain of life. Although I am happy to have a wife and children, my profession as MW2 montage specialist has failed to provide for me in recent years; in fact my primary source of income is the allowance my mother gives me weekly. I forgot to mention that my job situation has resulted in me living at my parent's home... But I digress. Thus I cannot even begin to explain the importance of bringing MW2 to next gen consoles. It has become a joke that not a single person will pay for a copy of my ps3 MW2 360 no-scope montages. The dedication and time I put into these videos cannot be overstated. I hope that this petition succeeds. For the sake of my wife Vladimir, and my children Terminal and Highrise I pray this comes true. Nothing will bring me more joy. Nothing.","March 24, 2015","true","48.8"," 467 of 559 people (84%) found this review helpful 640 people found this review funny","84","467","559","640","22"

Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.\n\nNow, you may be asking, "Why is the multiplayer dead?" The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hackers and children. Hackers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hacker, another five are going to take that persons place.\n\nThe game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warefare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review.  Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and "clean" of hackers and cheaters.\n\nSome examples of hackers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:\n\nWallhackers\nAimbots\nInstant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks\nHud-Hacking (Yes, it does exist)\nInstant VAC Ban\n\nThe Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.\n\nPlease, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.\n\nI've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.\n\nIf you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.\n\nOverall, get it for the Spec-Ops, and the Singleplayer.\n\nEdit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hacked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.\n\nStay safe, and play safe...and watch for hackers...\n\n-Cheers","July 15, 2014","false","9.7"," 422 of 534 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","422","534","2","42"

Sometimes it gets so intense, it tends to challenge your emotional stability. Especially the part where...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/10180/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 picks up after the events of its predecessor and awes you from beginning to end. The original Modern Warfare brought a whole new look to the series and was quickly one of my favorite of the series after just a short while of playing it. Infinity Ward returns to call all players to active duty across several systems including the PC.\n\nModern Warfare 2 story kicks off after the events of the first title. Players are given a brief recap of the previous story and then sent through the obligatory boot camp tutorial. For those of you who haven't played the first game, I suggest picking that one up too, although knowledge of the first story isn't critical - just more rewarding. There are several major upgrades this time around though most of the cool ones are found in the multiplayer. As far as the single player experience is concerned, I did find the very beginning a little helter skelter. There wasn't much story to go on at first and I found myself a bit lost. This is really my only real issue about the single player campaign of Modern Warfare 2.\n\nAs I mentioned above when PC gaming is concerned I am always favoring keyboard and mouse setups over a controller. This is mainly because of the use of mouse offers a superior aiming system. The controls are pretty solid and responsive and for those that use mice with side buttons I found it easier to pull off melee knife kills and grenade tosses by assigning both to those buttons if applicable.\n\nModern Warfare 2 boasts a lot of gameplay options this time around. The three main modes that players can engage in are the single player campaign, multiplayer and the all-new Spec Ops mode. The main story while it doesn't really bring anything new to the table is fun and took me around 8 hours to beat. For those seeking a bit more of a challenge, Veteran difficulty will take a bit longer, as you'll most likely be dying a lot more due to some incredibly brutal enemy AI.\n\nThe AI, both ally and enemy is better than before offering a much more realistic experience. The chatter heard when you're pinned down or flanking is more involved than ever before. If your squad says there are tangos behind a car or dumpster, they really are there. If you pay attention to what they are saying then you're less likely to be completely blindsided and it makes the levels go a lot faster.\n\nBefore you even start the game you are given the option to skip the "really disturbing parts". While I didn't skip these parts, which I'm sure you've read about or seen on the internet by now, I found that had I skipped them I would have missed out on an experience that I will never forget. Without giving anything away its one of those scenarios that leaves you in deep thought about the world around us.\n\nSpec Ops allows for some engaging co-op fun. While it's not a co-op campaign like in World at War I found them to be quite fun. There are five levels of challenges ranging from Alpha to Echo, each with their own missions for a total of 23 scenarios lifted from deleted scenes and material from this and past Call of Duty games. You are graded and rewarded with anywhere from one to three stars based upon completion times or the difficulty level you're playing on. You can do these challenges yourself but it best if you do it with a friend. Players can team up with another player via the Internet to tackle these together to gain the maximum amount of stars. One of my favorite challenges is where you must aid a second player as they travel on foot through enemy territories from an attack chopper.\n\nThe real improvements to Modern Warfare 2 are found with in the expanded multiplayer. One of the biggest features is the newly expanded kill streaks roster. Once you reach level 10 these bad boys kick in and the fun begins. You gain access to bigger and better kill streaks as you go like a Harrier strike or the mother of all kill streaks, the tactical nuke. Fear not, the kill count doesn't stack from match to match.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 also features a much-improved Perk system from the original Modern Warfare. One of the things I will mention is the Pro Perks. These are gained by completing the challenge for say Sleight of Hand for instance. If you accomplish that challenge requirement you will be able to bring up the sights faster when you unlock Sleight of Hand Pro, which can be a lifesaver. There are a ton of perks to unlock and many challenges to complete, more than one review can cover, so discover away. The traditional rank up system in place in the first Modern Warfare is still there complete with unlocks such as weapons, attachments and camo. Players can still choose to enter Prestige Mode and start all over again if they want to at level 70.\n\nOne of the only downsides and one of the biggest gripes amongst the PC community is the lack of dedicated servers and the 32 person matches got nixed. Infinity Ward's decision to make the experience the same across all of the major versions is not really a bad choice honestly. Sure it may make a lot of people upset but you still get a kick ♥♥♥ experience either way. Players are now limited to up to 18 players during certain matches, which is more than enough for the map designs provided.\n\nModern Warfare returns with that same level of excellence the previous games had and surpasses it to a whole new level. The amount of detail that I saw on my 1920x1080 monitor with max settings was absolutely mind blowing. The sheer amount of individual animations on the clothing and gear mixed with the superb real-time physics makes this one of the best looking PC titles of 2009.\n\nOne of my favorite effects is the new blood splatter used when you take damage. To think that just two years before this game we were still used to seeing the usual red damage tint on the screens that got progressively worse. Now we have blood splatter that actually hinders vision and adds a more realistic feel to the world. The lighting effects used when in night vision mode when you're in Washington D.C., as well as little details like light refraction on a damaged riot shield are all just simply amazing. I was also impressed with the rain and blowing snow effects seen in various chapters of the story.\n\nModern Warfare 2 features some amazing sound effects, both with the environments and the weaponry. I've never heard any of the weapons used in this game in real life but they sound damn good. Infinity ward has done a fantastic job at capturing each of them for our listening pleasure. You literally can tell the difference between a M4A1 and an AK-47 as they are being fired at and around you. But as I mentioned above I absolutely love the battle chatter. Not only does it help you meet your objectives but it also immerses you in the whole experience. I also have to give a big nod to Hans Zimmer for creating a fantastic score for Modern Warfare 2.

BUT BE WARNED - Multiplayer is littered with hackers and cheaters.\n\nThere is a noticable number of players who are one or more of the following:\nInvincible\nAble to kick other players at will\nAble to unlock max rank etc.\nUsing aim bots\nUsing wall hacks\nHave unlimited knife/melee distance\nAble to control public lobbies as if they were private ones\nand various other things.\nInfinity Ward/Activision don't care, they're busy squeezing cash out of fanboys' pockets. I've contacted Activision support multiple times, and they literally don't care at all. Considering they're still charging £20 for the game, I'd say that's disgusting...\n\nIt's a great shame, because it has a great single-player, great co-op, and the multiplayer IS good, but people have ruined it. All I can really do at this point is go to their Steam profiles and report a violation. Some people will rage in the text chat "why must you hack? it's ruining the game" or similar, and 99% of the time the response is "hahaha cry more" or "shut up u ♥♥♥♥♥♥", as you'd expect.

I currently have 69 hours in multiplayer at time of edit.\n\nEdit 2: The 'unhelpful' votes for this review are from fanboys who are infatuated with grenade launchers, trickshots, and probably some hackers themselves.\n\nWhich reminds me... the playerbase in MW2 is outrageously toxic. The number of times I've been called a f#ggot, had cancer wished upon, been told to kill myself, insulted for using a certain weapon or equipment... seriously, someone wished for my mother to die of explosive diarrhoea because I was using an MP5K.

I was fascinated with how fun and "realistic" it was. I was immediately hooked on the games. I played Cod 2 and 3 religiously, and I will never ever forget the day I heard about Modern Warfare. Finally. FINALLY a game of 21st century setting. I was ecstatic. I played through the campaign and had endless hours of multiplayer logged on my Xbox 360. After doing everything I thought possible in that game, my dream came true, and another was released. To some, there's almost no difference between CoD4MW, and MW2. To others, like myself, there's an indescribable gap between the two games, where MW2 is on a whole new and higher level. To me, no other shooter game has had the balance MW2 had. It has set a standard for me that I look to in other FPS games, often times I find no equal, save the original Black Ops game. This balance is what made the game for me. I've never been a person to be "naturally" good at video games. MW2 was one where I excelled. Because I had a fighting chance. I found my niche and I stuck with it. I maxed the game on my Xbox 360, and eventually grew into PC gaming, leaving consoles behind. I only have a few minutes played on this game so far, but I had to actually back out and type this up even after the first few matches. It has been such a trip for me going through the menus and the lobby system. If you're considering buying this game for nostalgia, do it. Do it and don't take any flak that comes to you. Do it, and relive your early teens of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ girlfriends, mountain dew, and yelling at your parents. If you've never played MW2 and are looking to see the hype, I'm afraid it's gone forever. There's a few people around on the servers, but the HYPE, the actual maxed pace heartbeat of a game that took the world by storm is gone forever and ever. Then again, maybe that's the beautiful thing. Maybe that's what has this game frozen in time as one of the all time greatest.\n\nForever and ever, Modern Warfare 2.\n\nNuovaVita","April 14","true","0.7"," 79 of 88 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","79","88","7","3"

On so many other titles, you get completely f-cked by other players due to the difference in skill.\n\nThis game is different. Instead of getting f-cked by other people, the game f-cks you instead. Half the time it doesn't work properly, and it's completely unbalanced with a degenerate community. Quite often you'll encounter a hacker, and it's not rare to get stuck in a modded server. There's no Server Blacklist included, so you can enjoy getting thrown back into the same sh-thole over and over again. Enjoy the modded server admins who DDOS you if you use a weapon that they don't like.\n\nAll in all, it's the classic Call of Duty experience. This game is a known carcinogen and I thoroughly recommend it for ages 8 to slept-with-ur-mom for hours of aggravated fun.\n\nEDIT (9th Jan, 2015)\nThe limited concentration that this game requires at the casual level, as well as its fast-paced low-strategy gameplay, results in the player becoming accustomed to passively playing with the potential for high success. Because of this, it will be somewhat difficult to start playing other games again, as you are used to no-tactics gameplay.","November 1, 2014","true","5.5"," 140 of 179 people (78%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","78","140","179","58","4"

I found the Single Player storyline interesting and awesome (great fights, and great scenes in general) and I have to admit that I wanted MORE of it when I finally finished it. Although there were many negative reviews and comments about it, and to be more specific, about the mission "No Russian" in which you are asked if you really want to play it or skip it, I think that Modern Warfare 2 is a worty replacer of its predecessor Modern Warfare, which was a huge success for Infinity Ward.

I feel that it is a nice sequel to Modern Warfare 1 with a fantastic storyline and the addition of Spec Ops, a series of short challenge levels. There are a variety of guns to choose from and different levels to play through. For the most part, none of them feel repetitive in any way. It looks great and plays great.\n\nOn the other hand, multiplayer is a let-down. Its been a few years since release and many people have gone on to other titles in the series leaving Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer dwindling. They have the servers and the players but failed to incorporate some sort of anti-cheat. Multiplayer is filled with hackers. Not every game has them, but they are there (and you can definitely tell when its enabled). For whatever reason, they also got rid of the server browser so there are no more modded servers.\n\nThe single-player and co-op experience is great. Multiplayer can be so-so.

At the time I was playing there were (and probably still are) A LOT of hacked lobbies. What happened to me was I logged into a modded game. After being in it for few seconds it disconnected me from it with a message saying "Bad host". So I was like ok but then I noticed that literally all of the stats were unlocked (Titles, Emblems, Weapons and their attachemnts, etc.), it also boosted me from being a lvl 30 or something noob to a lvl 70, allowing me to enter prestige mode. I didn't deal with that, just a bit worried. I looked up on some forum, found that people encountered the same problem and that you need to contact support as soon as possible otherwise it'll ban you. I didn't know at the time how to deal with it so I went with the flow, hoping nothing will happen to my account. Then after a few weaks I recieved a ban, saying "Cheat detected". I then tried to contact any support but people on the forum stated it's too late because Steam Support won't listen to people who got VAC banned. ALSO NOTE: I remembered that around the initial VAC ban my account was hijacked and couldn't retrieve it after a year when a Steam Support finally realized the issue. I assume that the hijacker went downloading the possible external software for the game and used it on it in order to get me banned. I remember that guy, go check him up, his name is "solutioNNN" and also has a VAC ban from MW2. I am not lying about this, no I am not making this up, this is my honest review.\n-------------------\nSingleplayer: Wonderful!\nSpecial Ops: Wonderful, even co-op is great!\nMultiplayer: THE WORST, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO LOBBY, YOU COULD ENTER A HACKED ONE, RESULTING IN UNLOCKING EVERY WEAPON, WEAPON ATTACHMENT, EMBLEM, TITLE, ETC. THIS WILL RESULT IN A UNFAIR VAC BAN.\nI do not recommend this game simply because of this mess. I recommend you to pirate this game just to experience the wonderful storyline.\nOh, and if you happen to buy it and find that your items are all unlocked, I suggest you contacting the Steam Support before  getting a possible permanent ban.","April 25, 2015","false","144.0"," 280 of 449 people (62%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","62","280","449","68","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anderskolling/recommended/10180/","anderskolling","Bilbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anderskolling/","87 products in account","This game helped me through severe depression after my wife left me. I was a mess, binging on coke and strippers to try and forget the pain she brought to me. Next thing I knew I was shooting Heroin in a Vietnamese rice farmer's hut. Don't ask me how I got there and why I decided to stay for 7 months amongst his family of 12, but I thought this was the end of my miserable life. As I lay naked in a pile of my own and what was mostly the vietnamese family's vomit and excrement... there I saw it. The light glistening on the screen. It seemed MW2 had swept the world by its feet and even in the remote jungles of Vietnam it managed to find itself. It was clear to me, this was a sign. God himself intended for me to see it. The little vietnamese child obviously didn't know what he was doing, as the little noob camped in the corner with his ACR with dual attachments of a heat sensor and a silencer, I marvelled at the beauty of this game. At once I got up, and I ran. Did I know which way to run? No. But I didn't let that stop me. Sooner or later I was back in the humble streets of my hometown. I picked up MW2 for PS3 at tescos and went on to play the game for 4 days straight without food or water. My mother and father were a little worries considering they presumed me dead and I hadn't bathed since I was back. But if there's anything I learned it's that In those 4 days I was born again, although I soiled myself several times and passed out once, I knew what it meant in life to experience pure joy and happiness. As a married man with 2 beautiful children now I really hope MW2 is brought on to next gen consoles; it will bring the utmost joy to me, and my children will be able to relive the pure ecstacy I felt. Of course they're not old enough to play yet and not even nearly mentally developed to even comprehend what would be going on as they are still babies. But the bright and vivid images of their father getting that 30th kill streak with his ump-45 silencer will fill their small hearts with pride. As they watch their father roar in triumph as the screen goes white and the battle ceases. There I will stand proud a man. A man with a 5.2 K/D ratio. A true champion. A figure to look up to. A figure to learn from. And you better believe that once they are of legal age I'll teach them and guide them to achieve the successes I have. But alas as my imagination delves deep into a utopian world it hits me that in fact this is not the case. Instead I lay here in bed next to my Russian mail-ordered wife. where only these fantasies numb the cruel pain of life. Although I am happy to have a wife and children, my profession as MW2 montage specialist has failed to provide for me in recent years; in fact my primary source of income is the allowance my mother gives me weekly. I forgot to mention that my job situation has resulted in me living at my parent's home... But I digress. Thus I cannot even begin to explain the importance of bringing MW2 to next gen consoles. It has become a joke that not a single person will pay for a copy of my ps3 MW2 360 no-scope montages. The dedication and time I put into these videos cannot be overstated. I hope that this petition succeeds. For the sake of my wife Vladimir, and my children Terminal and Highrise I pray this comes true. Nothing will bring me more joy. Nothing.","April 9","true","4.5"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","85","34","40","44","1"

With that being said, our score comes with a disclaimer. For those planning to check out everything Modern Warefare 2 has to offer – online competition, full co-op Spec Ops mode, as well as the campaign – you’re looking at a no-brainer purchase. For the strictly single player crowd, however, Modern Warfare 2 is surprisingly short, and doesn’t live up to the standard set by previous Call of Duty games. The campaign can be completed in as little as six and a half hours, and the missions make better scenarios and moment-to-moment adrenaline rushes than they do a cohesive, well-told story. If you’re going solo, you’ve officially been warned. Look at the complete Modern Warfare 2 experience though, and there’s no denying its rightful place at the top.","December 9, 2014","true","22.6"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","25","31","3","0"

The campaign's plot is so dubious yet somewhat predictable, that you will now be able to stop playing it before you've completed it.\nThe special ops mode is for you and your friend to spend time with. You'll have different missions to complete, with various vehicles and weapon choices. With the vast amount of experience I have with FPS games the game was easier, yet completing the game on Veteran still remains a bit of a challenge.

When i played back in 2010-2011, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer.Now, 2016, i re-bough this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.\nAbout the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server.\nThere is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.\nAnd theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.\nIs MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.\nBut wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. "Yes" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but "no" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects.

Very common is also modded lobbies (may happen that modder will take your levels, attachments and weapons you already got before), texture hackers (undetectable), aimboters, wallhackers, norecoil hackers, rapid fire scripts or god mod. I personally prefer very popular mod Search and Destroy, where you average find around 6 games (5 of them are ususally trickshot virgin kids which literally dont let you play because of constant stunning, tubing or instant kick and let alive only the biggest idiot of your team as victim to do trickshot on him). Useful thing is tool called MW2sa by dint of you can kick hackers or tubers. The author of this tool asks in readme to try behave like adults and warning other people before kick them for some reason, unfortunately, his wish is not always heard, so often happens that 12yo kid kick you because you just winning with him or he maybe dont like something you said before.

However, while the moderate wing is trying to preserve the stability and the relationships with other countries, a special team, with John McTavish at its head, is trying to retrieve an important piece of technology in Russia. But when an old foe is provoking a Russian-American war, it's up to McTavish and his team to prove that a terrorist from Russia is behind this attack, though there is also a traitor in their ranks. Besides, during the war, a Private is fighting in Pennsylvania and in Washington to repel the Russian Army, trying to avenge the death of those killed by the old foe - though they're not aware of that.\n\nYou take the role of a mole, Joseph Allen, that will be one of the factors in the war though he didn't know that he was used for that purpose, of Roach, a member of McTavish's team, during the quest of finding any tie to the terrorist Vladimir Makarov, of a soldier, whose name is Ramirez if my memory serves well, that fights for USA's liberty after the wrongful invasion of Russia and of Soap, the hero from the previous game who will reveal himself as a familiar face for the player.\n\nAnyway, you need to play MW to understand why there is a war between Makarov and an American General, though the confirmation happens in the sequel. Anyway, between these points of view, you have the American soldier that isn't even aware of the plot, the mole that would like to explain the events but can't because well... he can't, the team searching for proofs that will wash USA's name from the affirmation that they're behind the attack. None are from the Russian's side, though the moderate wing doesn't know about Makarov's doing and that they were really reluctant to declare the war, and that seeing the story through Makarov's mind would be a long descent into a mad mind.\n\nThe gameplay is still the same as COD: you shoot, you take cover, you avoid dying, you have no respite because of the enemies or the type of enemies that are harder to kill with these armors, you direct missiles to the ground, you have timed passages, you drive vehicles.... everything of that without having time to sight as the gameplay is still nervous as hell.\n\nHowever, apart the campaign, you have also missions to do in co-op (or alone), with different difficulties, like for the solo mode. And you have also a multiplayer mode, though I have to admit that I didn't play it, as I'm not interested in it.\n\nThe graphics are also quite good, for that, I must say that I'm never deceived by that series. Even the little part in space is quite interesting. Anyway, fighting for the White House is a nice experience, and it's by night!\n\nBut what I prefer in Call of Duty, it's the soundtrack.

Starting from Ellen who was trying to stop Makarov secretly, after several events, to Soap and Price who were trying to kill General Shepherd to stop him from realizing his plan of defeating the Russian Army in order to make U.S.A regain its violent 'reputation'.\n\nThe game did give us a brand new experience on its graphics and new equipment in multiplayer mode, as well as the new cooperative mode – Special Ops in which you can play against several waves of bots either alone or with other players, this is quite challenging when you arrive at a high number of waves.\n\nI found this game's story really moving. It is one of the highlights of the COD series, this one was surely the game of the year and I definitely recommend this game to all the COD fans.\n\nPositive remarks\n+EXPLOSIVE storyline\n+new equipment\n+brand new graphics (at that time)\n+new cooperative mode Special Ops\n\nNegative remarks\n-Not many players are playing this anymore.","October 5, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I was in a game with one of those cheaters, decided to make everything fast without my consent. I asked him "I want to play in a vanilla standing" and he listened to me. Made everything normal. He was the best host I encountered too. The cheater chose only fun maps and didn't mess with our games after I requested him not to. The fact that cheaters can easily exploit due to the fact they practicly own the server when hosting makes it very vulnerable for cheaters, not to mention bad connection. I mention good cheaters that do not impact your experience negativly but those cheaters whom beat the game with their cheats is annoying, sometimes their cheats are shown in the killcam which is funny yet rediculous. I don't really like this game, p[layed it to remember the thrills of my 5th grade life. I remember having a friend over and we would be on split-screen Rust just quick-scoping for like 2hrs.

But Infinity Ward and Valve really need too watch over this game . There is way too much hackers. Like once this guy was in a lobby rank 2 and all of a sudden hes rank 70. The story line is amazing . You in a snowy terrain then all of a sudden you chasing a guy in A Favela of Rio de Janerio. This is full with action just like the old Call of Duty 4 (Shoutout) . The one thing that they need to fix is it is really hard to join friends , pretty much impossible.

Everybody was hyped for it, myself included.\nAnd unlike what you might expect, all my skyhigh expectations was suddenly very real. The gameplay was smooth (for a freshly launched game, mind you), the levels were well made, and the action was fast paced.\n\nNow, even after several hundred hours spent in the multiplayer, and many new titles being released since, I still find myself returning to this game from time to time. the amount of players still playing, is ever dwindling, as can be expected with an aging game.\n\nbut the feeling this game gives you, of nostalgia, of pure fun and carnage, is unlike any other game out there (save for DOOM 3, and UT 2004). It really is, an all time classic.\n\nIf you have yet to play this game, but like fast paced shoot-em-in-the-face-and-laugh type of FPS games, then this is for you. If you on the other hand like FPS games that require more though than duck, run, and shoot, this game (hell, this whole series of games) might not fall to your liking.\n\nHowever, given that its drop in price of the years, althought still not cheap by any means, it's defo worth a try. If nothing else, to take on your mates, and have a blast that you will all be able to remember.\n\nI hope this provided you with some usefull insight into this game.\n\nAll The best\n\nPvt.

The main campaign has it's good moments hunting down hostiles in the favelas or trying to save DC under heavy attack, but is quite short as usual (or even more). Using the riot shield is a nice change of strategy and a lot of fun and the game delivers the adrenaline rush that's expected, but despite SPEC OPS (which is mostly the same levels from the campaign with a few mods - packing an occasional surprise for specific COOP missions) and MP, there isn't enough to grow attached to this title, you basically just want to play the sequel that delivers the full blown chaos that continues the story...Perhaps that was the point?","August 7, 2014","true","29.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CRSSFIRE/recommended/10180/","CRSSFIRE","Michael Jordan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CRSSFIRE/","36 products in account","Overall, one of the best games i have ever played. When i played back in 2010-2011 on my PS3, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer.Now, 2016, i re-bough this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.\nAbout the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server.\nThere is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.\nAnd theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.\nIs MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.\nBut wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. "Yes" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but "no" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects. Im talking mostly about graphics and gameplay.","March 11","true","24.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I have had no problems with the installation of the game, and have given a lot of time into this game in the past (When I was playing console) The game itself still looks beautiful for today's standards even though it was released back in the fall of 2009. I have already sunk a lot of my time into the multiplayer, and I am looking forward to re-playing the campaign.\n\nGame BalanceThe game is very easy to run, even if it needs lower graphical settings, The maps are large and have a lot of hot spots for gun fights, speaking of the guns... They are all balanced (Other than the Vector) The mechanics have a lot of detail, and have had no glitching problems so far.\n\nProblems encounteredAlthough I do have a problem with the amount of hackers, due to the VAC system not working to its full potential. Now I know it is classic for COD to have extremely sensitive feet (You can 1 hit someone if you hit their feet) but I have seen a lot of people 'Drop Shotting', if you are unfamiliar with this it is when you see a player you drop to the floor instantly and shoot, this makes the person stutter and they end up dying, but this can easily be bypassed by shooting their feet ;)\n\nMultiplayer ExperienceI have enjoyed re-completing the multiplayer stuff, and will continue to do so. Nothing else has really bothered me, and in actual fact the player base on here is much more squeaker free, and has more mature players.\n\nOverviewI would recommend this to any person who has played Modern Warfare in the past, and would like to re-visit the nostalgic times, even if you have never played Modern Warfare 2 I would still heavily say it is the best COD around. It has even guns, a nice amount of players, and overall I still great graphics engine.\n\nExtra InformationDeveloper(s): Infinity Ward, Aspyr (Mac)\nPublisher(s): Activision, Aspyr (Mac)\nPlatform(s): PS3, Xbox 360, PC, and Mac\nRelease Date: November 12th 2009\nGenre(s): Action, FPS, and Multiplayer\n\nSource(s):\nPersonal Knowledge\nSteam Store Page\n\nWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group","February 11","true","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And arguably the last amazing Call of Duty game made by Infinity Ward. And to some, the last amazing Call of Duty game.\n\nIts campaign is similar to the first Modern Warfare, being rich in storytelling with really - but yeah, really - emotional moments. I think it's even better in that department, as it made me feel pure hate towards the leader enemy boss after a certain event I'd rather not mention here. It's definitely one of the few games that are so well made they emotionally pulled me in - like, not that I'd start punching pixels on my screen or anything like that, but I suppose you understand what I mean.\n\nBut it is the multiplayer part of Modern Warfare 2 that made it one of my most played games. No matter how many times I ragequitted from a match, saying how I'd never ever launch this stupid game again, it still kept me entertained for more than 200 hours. Let's be honest - it's an unbalanced mess which isn't really fair most of the time, as who wouldn't be mad if they got killed by someone with a grenade launcher or a random airstrike passing by on a 24 killstreak... But it's Modern Warfare 2, and it's always been awesome. The maps, the weapons, the community calling you names when you're playing better than them, the damn feeling when you get a kill and see that iconic yellow font, the, well, everything.\n\nModern Warfare 2 is a legend in the video game industry.","October 4, 2015","true","9.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The story is well written, with tensifying moments in between with a shocking discovery in the end. If you're interested in getting a good COD game, I would suggest at least giving this game a try instead of wasting your bucks on rubbish COD games like Ghosts or Advanced Warfare.\n\nThough I say that this game is good, it ain't a bed of roses either. And by that I mean the multiplayer of this game. Let me tell you this: Stay away from the multiplayer of this game if you know what's good for you. Cause if you don't, something bad is going to happen to you....... (Hint: Take the first three letters of the word 'vaccine' and take the first three letters of the word 'banana'. Put them as two words.) So what do you get?\n\nSo I highly recommend this game for the story and the spec ops, all in which are well done. I personally loved the story the most. Oh yeah, and did I mention that you shouldn't touch the multiplayer of this game cause you'll be in deep trouble if you do?","September 20, 2015","true","127.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

They completely ruined the awesome server system they had in the first MW and replaced it with this IWNet bs that doesn't let you choose the server you wanna join. Because of that it has become a paradise for cheaters, hackers and all sorts of rubbish. Combine that with the gameplay that has been more optimized for campers and snipers than ever before. Some of the perks and killstreaks you can acheive with camping are so overpowered that it ruins the whole experience.

The story is nonsensical with only the barest thread linking action pieces together and since you play a multiple characters the plot understanding fragments  further.  Oh, and the plot requires you to suffer and die a lot and on purpose.  So annoying to be kicking ♥♥♥ like a mofo only to have the game kill you up because you didn't wait for the scripted event to begin, or worse when you're laid low by a plot-mandated injury that you'd normally be shrugging off due to regenerating health.  Understand the single player game is locked on rails like a roller coaster crossed with a shooting gallery and your expectations will be properly set.

Yes it's unfair and noobtubes with scavenger are best but that's how it goes. with right amount of skill you can outplay noobtubers.\n\nBut the special ops is where this game shines. there is suprisingly many of them IF you play with the hardest difficulty. because that makes them almost nintendo like hard where you have to play them all over again dozens of times to complete them. (hardest are the breach mission and the explosive only juggernaut mission and THAT ESTATE MISSION WITH JUGGERNAUTS EVERYWHERE)\nI suggest only play with veteran difficulty. everything else is too easy\n\nAnd the best you can get out from this game is play with your friend the special ops next to each other (modern laptops can run this game easily) with the hardest setting especially the two stages with the other controlling the helicopter/ac-130.\ncoop makes them a lot of easier though because you can revive each other.\n","December 10, 2015","true","61.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The already-perfect Create-a-Class, that defined Call of Duty's gameplay since CoD 4 also makes a return in multiplayer, with more guns, perks and killstreaks to choose from.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the lack of dedicated servers and the majority of people focusing only on the latest Call of Duty titles, you will have a hard time connecting to online matches instantly. For that, Four-Delta-One offers a Dedicated Server mod for those, who want a fluid, seemless online experience with no delays in joining what-so-ever. Keep in mind, though, that Valve's VAC Protection will not work in this matter, so you should download this mod at your own risk (don't worry, there's no viruses in this mod).\nStill, as long as you have friends playing this game, the fun never stops on your end!","August 29, 2012","true","34.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes it's unfair and noobtubes with scavenger are best but that's how it goes. with right amount of skill you can outplay noobtubers.\n\nBut the special ops is where this game shines. there is suprisingly many of them IF you play with the hardest difficulty. because that makes them almost nintendo like hard where you have to play them all over again dozens of times to complete them. (hardest are the breach mission and the explosive only juggernaut mission and THAT ESTATE MISSION WITH JUGGERNAUTS EVERYWHERE)\nI suggest only play with veteran difficulty. everything else is too easy\n\nAnd the best you can get out from this game is play with your friend the special ops next to each other (modern laptops can run this game easily) with the hardest setting especially the two stages with the other controlling the helicopter/ac-130.\ncoop makes them a lot of easier though because you can revive each other.\n","December 10, 2015","true","61.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Say What!?! Yes, even as a strong advocate of the PC Gaming ecosystem, I too enjoyed a Call of Duty title. It probably wasn’t the best title to get, but at the time it was reasonable. At least on the PC, this was the last average title to be cranked out.\n\nObviously Call of Duty isn’t realistic (I certainly hope you understand that), nor was it really intended to be (I hope not). The appeal too many is the quick, non-stop action and the ability to use Kill Streaks along with perks to change up gameplay. “Fair” isn’t a term I would use, as each Call of Duty title has its own overpowered or unbalanced class and weapon setup. If you are looking for actual competitive play, Counter Strike is where you should go.\n\nThe graphics are ok, the FOV is like taping your face to the screen, and the singleplayer plot is kind of dry and confusing. For sure however, this title stands on its own – just like Call of Duty 4 on PC.\n\nI might go back and play this game again, but I don’t think it would be for a long period of time. If you are into the Call of Duty series, Black Ops 2/3 will have a much upgraded experience for PC players. For “COD purists”, this title will be the one.","March 13","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was my first Call of Duty. Now I've played 3.2 hours of its PC brother.\n\nPicking this game up today via the Activision sale was the best PC game purchase I've made on my ascendant rig. The euphoria that I once experienced when on a major killstreak or getting a string of quickscopes has been extraordinarily revitalized in 1440p, 90fps on the PC version today. Now, while TDM and FFA are the only modes with enough players to establish a great lobby, it's incredibly worth it to experience "the most fun I've had on my Xbox" all over again. I urge anyone who is undecided about this game in 2015 to go ahead and buy it, or you may miss out on the shrinking following entirely, and among the most fun that Activision has ever allowed it's customers to have.\n\nLastly, as far as hackers are concerned, I had one game where everyone was forced to use the Intervention on Rust (which was entirely enjoyable in my taste), and that was it.","May 4, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","1"

I have played pretty much every Call of Duty that's ever existed, from the first one to Black Ops 3, and none of them have ever even come near the enjoyment I've had with this game. My dad was actually the one who got this game in the first place. He played it for the campaign (which was short but very epic and fun), but never really ever touched multiplayer as he knew he wouldn't be very good at it (he also didn't like tubers, campers, and knifers). I played the campaign and multiplayer a lot after he got mostly done with it until our family computer crashed and broke down while I was playing it. I didn't touch the game for a few years until about a month ago; and holy ♥♥♥♥ did I reveal a holy grail. I'm now completely addicted to this game. I don't know what it is that makes this game so damn fun, but whatever it is, the developers sure did it right. This game exceeds above and beyond what other shooters can't do, and I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone who wants a old game that's still insanely fun.\n\nAlso, since this game is relatively old, there has been trouble finding games. As far as I've seen, people either play TDM, FFA, or Domination.","March 19","true","77.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thealptraum/recommended/10180/","thealptraum","Alptraum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thealptraum/","220 products in account","Really fun game. I've played it lots both on console and PC. The campaign is the second-best campaign in CoD, CoD 4 being the first imo. You can also play the second game mode which you can play in co-op and get three stars in all missions and stuff, I did it on the Xbox and it's really fun to play with a friend.\n\nMultiplayer is pretty good. It's not as dedication-rewarding as the newer games, prestiging resets everything litteraly so it's not very fun to prestige. The guns are really fun though. Lots of traditional weapons such as UZI and M4A1, good off-hands (shotguns are secondaries, overpowered but fun). All the guns are fun in their own way if you know how to use them. Attachments are as usual. Red dot sights, silencers, noobtubes (which are horribly overpowered in this game and has never been fixed, probably because IW doens't care about gaming experience), nothing new. You can unlock different versions of attachments by using that attachment which is pretty cool. Using the Red Dot Sight unlocks Holographic Sight, using underbarrel grenade launcher unlocks underbarrel shotgun, stuff like that. Emblems and titles are really cool and well-made imo. Killstreaks is nothing new. Care package, chopper support, airstrikes, controlling AC130s weapons and being a chopper gunner, stuff like that. They're cool and fun to get but not original.\nMaps are really cool. A russian snow map, a woodland map with a really cool cabin on a hill, tight urban combat in an afghanistan-like map, love the maps in this game. They're the best maps in any CoD game imho. You can also buy a map pack that gives you the maps from CoD 4 (not sure if all of them) which is really cool\n\nIf you're a CoD fan then this game is nice to play sometimes when you want a good CoD game to not dedicate yourself to or take seriously. Of course, there will be hackers, as in all IW CoD games.","March 25, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The last good Call of Duty I really enjoyed. Almost brings a tear to my eye... Going as far to say that Modern Warfare 2 is my favorite shooter from 2009. The multiplayer is good (in the exception of hackers), but the one thing about this game that interests me the most is it's story, resuming after the first Modern Warfare with a satisfying ending, which many games today struggle to achieve. A new innovative mode: Spec Ops. Spec Ops pits you with the option of a friend against AI foes in missions specially designed for this mode. From objective base to elimination and even stealth missions, that's right, stealth missions. The famous Veteran difficulty returns and veteran is perfect in Modern Warfare 2; its not too easy, not too hard.\n\nI guess $20 is an acceptable price for Modern Warfare 2, but I would wait until the game goes on sale.

If you play Tdm you will still find games. This is the point where CoD multiplayer was at its best in my opinion. I understand that people really enjoy CoD4, but this game is easily just CoD4+More - more attachments, more weapons, more killstreaks, deathstreaks, more reasons to prestige, titles and emblems, more ways to play and be unique in your play. Campaign is one of the best in the series, but much better if you play the Modern Warfare series in order because they all connect and have the same characters. SpecOps missions are fun side things to do co-op with and have decent replayability with the varying difficulty and needing to do better at them to unlock more missions.\n\nOverall, great game with a great campaign and the point in the series where multiplayer was at its best. I have yet to run into any hackers in my first ten online games.\n\nPart Two:\nRight after writing the review I had a run of like, five games with hackers in them. So, there are a lot of hackers in the game, but if you just avoid where they are looking or are playing on a big map there's nothing to really worry about.

I have been a loyal fan of Call of Duty for a very long time even pre my PC days. I have racked up over 700 hours on COD Ghosts and nearly 200 hours on Black Ops 2. At the weekend I randonly recieved a notification mid game during my gameplay in Ghosts to say that I had been permanently banned from online multiplayer. No reason! Just a notice. I have never cheated on a game in my life, I collect games, I achievement hunt and I have a f*cking expensive PC, all of which pretty much cements me being a solid and dedicated gamer. I contacted Activiton and went on the community hum on Steam and all I am told is it's irreversable and they say I have breached one of their t&c's for fair play. What the actual f*ck?? Why would I rack up nearly 1000 hours to then decide to cheat?! Are they F*cking stupid? I think this is absolutely disgusting and I am totally enraged by this because they have given me no explanation whatsoever other than a link to their policy agreement which is total BS. I am so enraged I am now refusing to buy anything from these c*nts ever again. How can someone or a company have the right to do this to a customer, especially when I am a loyal customer and have done nothing wrong at all. I gaurantee it's a group of ♥♥♥♥♥ on here that have complained about me in some way to force a ban on me. I have no VAC ban or nothing and never have had one. I hope those pr*cks at Activition read this and I hope half the f*cking gaming world does becuase this is not acceptable","May 26, 2014","false","22.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","1"

This one continues where the first Call of Duty left off. The graphics still are decent to this day (2016) and the music can get you in the mood as your shooting down soldiers. The only bad thing is this series rarely, if ever ges  on sale. The price for what you get isn't worth it for single player coming in at little then five (5) hours. It's all preference. The mutlplayer component is there but filled with hackers. If you can get it on sale for 14.99 or less I say grab it.

It includes a variety of wepons and settings so that each level is interesting, one level could take place in a desert and the next in a forest. There are intense moments and plot twists that really do get your emotions going, it's possibly one of my favourite story modes of all time. However it's slightly short and on veteran difficulty certain levels can be near impossible without touches of luck.\n\nSingle player also comes with 'spec ops' (which can be played co-operatively), spec ops adds another layer of difficulty to the story mode and alters story mode levels to suit a different challenge. It's divided up into a variety of categories including races so the diversity is enough to keep you playing when one type of mission is frustrating you. The frustration is worth it however as when difficult spec ops are completed you feel extremely satisfied.\n\nOverall I would say it is a great game however its lack of developer support and its toxic hacking environment (online) mean it cannot be worth its price tag.","August 26, 2014","false","24.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However, I noticed that the product has a serious discount (50%) and as an old player of MW2 I would like add few words since I didn't have the chance to do it earlier. Nowadays it's not that easy to find the ammount of players that we used to find back at 2010 but still MW2 has its fans. The campaign and co-op modes worthy enough of the 12,49€ and if you're looking for something to spend some cash on it I think this game is a pretty good solution. All in all, this game is recommended by my side but only with its current price.","December 25, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/recommended/10180/","bizargh","Bizargh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/","118 products in account","Before I give my thoughts on the game, allow me to provide some info on how to improve your experience, especially with FOV (Singleplayer & Spec' Ops)\nLocate your config.cfg file (Found in Steam > Steamapps > common > Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 > players). It can be opened with both Wordpad & Notepad, like a .txt file. There is also a mp_config.cfg, but I believe for MW2, additions there are either limited or completely restricted for obvious reasons (Unfortunate as COD4 did allow for a more limited FOV adjustment & other non-balance related commands).\n\nFind seta monkeytoy "1" (can be found easily by searching monkey with Ctrl+F) and change it to seta monkeytoy "0".\n\nCopy the following as shown (in Bold) right below all existing text:\n\nspu\n\nset developer "0" (You may need to change this to "1" initially, but switching it back to "0" after I made my binds, they worked just as before. You'll want to switch it to "0" as otherwise you'll get a lot of yellow dev text during many segments of gameplay that only the No-HUD bind can otherwise switch off)\nset sv_cheats "1"\nset thereisacow "1337"\n\nFrom this point, you'll be able to bind keys to such things as FOV, viewmodel distance, HUD on/off, Noclip, and others (As unlike it's predecessors, Modern Warfare 2 doesn't allow access to the Developer Console). Just make sure that when you're done, Right Click on "config.cfg", go to "Properties", and then tick "Read Only" when you're done, just to make sure your configurations aren't reset when you load up the game.\n\nThe related articles from the  PC Gaming Wiki [pcgamingwiki.com] &  Call of Duty Wiki [callofduty.wikia.com] can provide more information on what binds can be made.\n\nPersonally, I use:\n\nbind 8 "cg_fov 80" = FOV 80° (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)\nbind 9 "cg_fov 90" = FOV 90° (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)\nbind O "cg_draw2D 1" = HUD On\nbind P "cg_draw2D 0" = HUD Off (EVERYTHING aside from viewmodels is wiped clean, including subtitles until HUD is truned back on)\nbind 0 "cg_gun_x -1" = Viewmodel position -1, X axis (Note that this will affect ironsights, so adjusting the Y & Z axis won't improve gameplay. Editing the X axis positively will take your viewmodels further, whilst editing it negatively will bring your viewmodels closer, which can be benefitical on FOV 90° & above if you want to avoid seeing floating shotgun shells or "through the shoulder" on a very select few weapons whose animations weren't fully suited to FOVs above 80 or below)\nbind - "cg_gun_x 0" = Default Viewmodel Distance\n\nYou can assign any key you want for your binds (That the game's controls isn't currently using of course) and set any value within it's range you wish to such things as FOV (Say, you can have 85° or 96° if you wanted), but those are my preferences as they're far out of reach from my default controls and can't be accidentally pressed.\n\nThere are third-party tools to adjust FOV in multiplayer (Which unlike during Call of Duty: Ghosts' launch period, will not get you banned either by Infinity Ward & Activision nor by Valve's Anti-Cheat System). A Steam Guide here has the tool & details: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=154105687\n\nRight, with that cleared up.\nMy Review\nWell, I can quickly state that while it's arguably one of the weaker titles in the franchise, it's definitely not the weakest PC release, despite being clear it's a console port. It runs very well, being not particularly tasking on HDD space nor performance by today's standards (Although being capped at 91fps may not be convenient for those with 120hz+ monitors or a real need for FPS, aswell as a select number of chipsets reportedly being unsupported for the Mac OSX port, which the PC Gaming Wiki article can detail if necessary). I certainly can't name any performance issues on my end.\n\nSingleplayer\nThe Singleplayer experience can be summed up as "Call of Duty 4 cranked to 11", as unlike it's more believable predecessor who rarely took away the player's control while the cinematic events occured, the setpieces are both in abundance & high spectacle, with numerous quick-time events to boot, for which many are memorable often thanks to the strong soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer & Lorne Balfe.\n\nSpec Ops (Co-op)\nThe 2-Player co-op experience, "Spec Ops" is actually one of Modern Warfare 2's stronger features. It's a mission based mode with a wide variety of gameplay elements & objectives, which either originate from Modern Warfare 2 & Call of Duty 4 or occasionally are unique to Spec Ops, all with a Three Star system awarded based on either difficulty completion, time completion or other mission unique tiers. Such things as a Snowmobile race & time trail, covering a co-op partner from a Black Hawk or AC130, or getting All Ghillied Up together, along with the more classical eliminate all targets, survive or complete-a-mission affairs. Whilst most of these can be played solo, there are a small number of missions that do require a co-op partner (Along with some where a Co-op partner is ideal to completing Veteran difficulty, especially with being able to revive each other presents it's own strategies). With the right buddy, it can be quite the fun!\n\nMultiplayer\nI can only give you my experience from the Xbox 360, but based on the brief return on PC just for experimentation's sake, not an awful lot has changed. I don't know how abundant hacking remains (To which on Xbox 360, it was utterly rampant!) but I have heard concerns from players that not only is hacking still rampant, but you yourself could be at risk from being VAC-Banned just by joining a matchmade game with or controlled by said hackers (I've had a somewhat similar experience in Gears of War 2 when my stats were permanently affected by being matchmade with illegitimate players, aswell as an occasion I was matchmade with hackers on MW2 [X360], which although neither resulted in any official bans, I'd say the concern should be at least considered valid), so it may be wise to proceed with caution if you wanna play Multiplayer outside of Private Matchplay, or be prepared to hightail it if you notice anything very unusual. Regardless, I can probably sum it up as a pit of out-of-control chaos with "noob-tubing" & death from above everywhere! (As this is Call of Duty 4 Multiplayer cranked to 17, which I personally classify as not a good thing). Perks have evolved from their more subtle kit choices to something comparable to super-hero powers, especially when you get their Pro upgrades (Commando Pro being among the most notorious). As for the Kill-Streaks, well, instead of being the assisting tools of winning the game, a significant selection pretty much is the gameplay & game-winners to anyone who can manage to avoid dying. You can rain death-from-above on a massive scale with AC130s, Attack Helicopters, Harriers, Bombing Runs, Stealth Bombers, Predator Missiles, maybe more. And of course, reel in 25 kills with all that and you have it equipped, hit the Nuke to win the game! (Provided your team or the enemy doesn't do it for you before the bomb drops).\n\n\nVerdict\nWell, it's a limited recommendation. If you are willing to put your brain away for some utterly disorganised chaos of a multiplayer, eager to gear up for a potentially challenging co-op mode, or want a short & somewhat dumb (as a whole), but highly explosive & cinematic singleplayer experience, then I can recommend it.\n\nIf you're looking for something more exceptional and/or refined, I can gladly say that the PC platform has a large quantity of offerings to cater to that need.","December 5, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/recommended/10180/","bizargh","Bizargh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/","118 products in account","Before I give my thoughts on the game, allow me to provide some info on how to improve your experience, especially with FOV (Singleplayer & Spec' Ops)\nLocate your config.cfg file (Found in Steam > Steamapps > common > Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 > players). It can be opened with both Wordpad & Notepad, like a .txt file. There is also a mp_config.cfg, but I believe for MW2, additions there are either limited or completely restricted for obvious reasons (Unfortunate as COD4 did allow for a more limited FOV adjustment & other non-balance related commands).\n\nFind seta monkeytoy "1" (can be found easily by searching monkey with Ctrl+F) and change it to seta monkeytoy "0".\n\nCopy the following as shown (in Bold) right below all existing text:\n\nspu\n\nset developer "0" (You may need to change this to "1" initially, but switching it back to "0" after I made my binds, they worked just as before. You'll want to switch it to "0" as otherwise you'll get a lot of yellow dev text during many segments of gameplay that only the No-HUD bind can otherwise switch off)\nset sv_cheats "1"\nset thereisacow "1337"\n\nFrom this point, you'll be able to bind keys to such things as FOV, viewmodel distance, HUD on/off, Noclip, and others (As unlike it's predecessors, Modern Warfare 2 doesn't allow access to the Developer Console). Just make sure that when you're done, Right Click on "config.cfg", go to "Properties", and then tick "Read Only" when you're done, just to make sure your configurations aren't reset when you load up the game.\n\nThe related articles from the  PC Gaming Wiki [pcgamingwiki.com] &  Call of Duty Wiki [callofduty.wikia.com] can provide more information on what binds can be made.\n\nPersonally, I use:\n\nbind 8 "cg_fov 80" = FOV 80° (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)\nbind 9 "cg_fov 90" = FOV 90° (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)\nbind O "cg_draw2D 1" = HUD On\nbind P "cg_draw2D 0" = HUD Off (EVERYTHING aside from viewmodels is wiped clean, including subtitles until HUD is truned back on)\nbind 0 "cg_gun_x -1" = Viewmodel position -1, X axis (Note that this will affect ironsights, so adjusting the Y & Z axis won't improve gameplay. Editing the X axis positively will take your viewmodels further, whilst editing it negatively will bring your viewmodels closer, which can be benefitical on FOV 90° & above if you want to avoid seeing floating shotgun shells or "through the shoulder" on a very select few weapons whose animations weren't fully suited to FOVs above 80 or below)\nbind - "cg_gun_x 0" = Default Viewmodel Distance\n\nYou can assign any key you want for your binds (That the game's controls isn't currently using of course) and set any value within it's range you wish to such things as FOV (Say, you can have 85° or 96° if you wanted), but those are my preferences as they're far out of reach from my default controls and can't be accidentally pressed.\n\nThere are third-party tools to adjust FOV in multiplayer (Which unlike during Call of Duty: Ghosts' launch period, will not get you banned either by Infinity Ward & Activision nor by Valve's Anti-Cheat System). A Steam Guide here has the tool & details: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=154105687\n\nRight, with that cleared up.\nMy Review\nWell, I can quickly state that while it's arguably one of the weaker titles in the franchise, it's definitely not the weakest PC release, despite being clear it's a console port. It runs very well, being not particularly tasking on HDD space nor performance by today's standards (Although being capped at 91fps may not be convenient for those with 120hz+ monitors or a real need for FPS, aswell as a select number of chipsets reportedly being unsupported for the Mac OSX port, which the PC Gaming Wiki article can detail if necessary). I certainly can't name any performance issues on my end.\n\nSingleplayer\nThe Singleplayer experience can be summed up as "Call of Duty 4 cranked to 11", as unlike it's more believable predecessor who rarely took away the player's control while the cinematic events occured, the setpieces are both in abundance & high spectacle, with numerous quick-time events to boot, for which many are memorable often thanks to the strong soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer & Lorne Balfe.\n\nSpec Ops (Co-op)\nThe 2-Player co-op experience, "Spec Ops" is actually one of Modern Warfare 2's stronger features. It's a mission based mode with a wide variety of gameplay elements & objectives, which either originate from Modern Warfare 2 & Call of Duty 4 or occasionally are unique to Spec Ops, all with a Three Star system awarded based on either difficulty completion, time completion or other mission unique tiers. Such things as a Snowmobile race & time trail, covering a co-op partner from a Black Hawk or AC130, or getting All Ghillied Up together, along with the more classical eliminate all targets, survive or complete-a-mission affairs. Whilst most of these can be played solo, there are a small number of missions that do require a co-op partner (Along with some where a Co-op partner is ideal to completing Veteran difficulty, especially with being able to revive each other presents it's own strategies). With the right buddy, it can be quite the fun!\n\nMultiplayer\nI can only give you my experience from the Xbox 360, but based on the brief return on PC just for experimentation's sake, not an awful lot has changed. I don't know how abundant hacking remains (To which on Xbox 360, it was utterly rampant!) but I have heard concerns from players that not only is hacking still rampant, but you yourself could be at risk from being VAC-Banned just by joining a matchmade game with or controlled by said hackers (I've had a somewhat similar experience in Gears of War 2 when my stats were permanently affected by being matchmade with illegitimate players, aswell as an occasion I was matchmade with hackers on MW2 [X360], which although neither resulted in any official bans, I'd say the concern should be at least considered valid), so it may be wise to proceed with caution if you wanna play Multiplayer outside of Private Matchplay, or be prepared to hightail it if you notice anything very unusual. Regardless, I can probably sum it up as a pit of out-of-control chaos with "noob-tubing" & death from above everywhere! (As this is Call of Duty 4 Multiplayer cranked to 17, which I personally classify as not a good thing). Perks have evolved from their more subtle kit choices to something comparable to super-hero powers, especially when you get their Pro upgrades (Commando Pro being among the most notorious). As for the Kill-Streaks, well, instead of being the assisting tools of winning the game, a significant selection pretty much is the gameplay & game-winners to anyone who can manage to avoid dying. You can rain death-from-above on a massive scale with AC130s, Attack Helicopters, Harriers, Bombing Runs, Stealth Bombers, Predator Missiles, maybe more. And of course, reel in 25 kills with all that and you have it equipped, hit the Nuke to win the game! (Provided your team or the enemy doesn't do it for you before the bomb drops).\n\n\nVerdict\nWell, it's a limited recommendation. If you are willing to put your brain away for some utterly disorganised chaos of a multiplayer, eager to gear up for a potentially challenging co-op mode, or want a short & somewhat dumb (as a whole), but highly explosive & cinematic singleplayer experience, then I can recommend it.\n\nIf you're looking for something more exceptional and/or refined, I can gladly say that the PC platform has a large quantity of offerings to cater to that need.","December 5, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
