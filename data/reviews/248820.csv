On a planet. It's a planet made up of wierd and strange things, creatures that up until your arrival quite likely existed in peace and harmony, and then you brought yourself, your mass of crates which have scattered around the landscape, and the teleporters you so desperately need to get back to your now scuffed up transport ship to get out of dodge.\n\nWhilst on the surface the game is very much a case of guns blazing and murder everything in sight, as you dig into the lore and entries of the game, what you'll learn is that the planet was more or less *fine* until the ship crashlanded, spewed it's cargo all over the shop and you, in your size twelves and large caliber weapons, decided to cut a swathe through the landscape to get out.\n\nCongratulations, you are the risk of rain the locals keep talking about. Don't you feel just awesome?\n\nTightly tuned, finely balanced, class based roguelite gameplay...\nStarting the game the first time gives you access to the beginner class - Commando. This class is a good place to learn how to deal with the game, and a balanced set of skills that should see you progress at a reasonable rate. All the unlockable classes are tailored towards specific styles of play, and generally require specialist approaches to get the most out of them. A good example is the enforcer, which is far slower and less mobile than the commando, but due to his riot shield, can essentially soak -ridiculous- quantities of damage from the direction he's facing.\n\nLater classes are even more specialised, opening up classes that work from afar, or specialise in deployables or traps, or have other means of dealing with situations. In short, every class feels unique, and has their own combos and specific ways to work things out. Furthermore, with the items that you can collect, every class will evolve differently based on the drops you find. The Enforcer in one playthrough will be an entirely different Enforcer in the next. Even if there are some items you'll ideally want to grab each time.\n\nThe importance of good design and a great soundtrack\nThe graphics might be pixel art, which by this stage you'd think have been done to death, but on the contrary, the clear, concise design and the very well thought out vision ensure that this game always looks stylish and well presented. This is a game that revels in looking good, and always ensures that the player is in control of what's going on, even when there's a -lot- going on at once.\n\nCombined with the precise and well balanced combat, along with the great sense of atmosphere, is potentially one of the best soundtracks of recent times, going alongside things such as Don't Starve, Deus Ex : Human Revolution, and Really Big Sky. A good soundtrack sells the atmosphere, and in this case it's been captured perfectly, possibly one of the best soundtracks in my library.\n\nDeep replayability and a stellar atmosphere combined\nRisk of rain was one of my top picks when I bought it, this has not changed and it still remains one of the greatest games available on steam. Along with the legends like FTL, like Dungeons of Dredmor, Risk of Rain should be considered essential gaming for anyone who wants to get their hands into the genre of "Roguelites" that contains things like Spelunky and co.\n\nVerdict : Essential\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

Yes, like your new girlfriend, Risk of Rain is a ball of wonderment and pain.\n\nIn this rogue-like platformer, you run around each level trying to find a teleporter. Meanwhile, enemies spawn randomly; killing them gives you gold with which you can open containers with upgrades for your character. Once you find a teleporter, you fight a boss and ultimately move on to the next level.\n\nThe catch? The longer you play, the tougher the enemies become! So speed is of the essence as well as quick reflexes and mob management.\n\nThe artstyle for this game is pixel based, and it's wonderful how much character these little sprites have! The tiny animations are smooth, and watching an enemy explode into blocks of meat chunks is satisfying.\n\nThe music is also fantastic; it's a hauntin track that sounds like a dubstep/trance hybrid one moment and a thumping bass the next.\n\nAnd the gameplay: oh boy, is this game tough! But you come out of it a better man (or woman) with blistered fingers and a beard on her knuckles (that goes for the women too).\n\nSo this game comes highly recommended! There are a lot of achievements/unlockables including new items and classes, so the replay value is truly up there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExplosiveOdyessy/recommended/248820/","ExplosiveOdyessy","Odyessy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExplosiveOdyessy/","246 products in account","I wish there were more Roguelikes that was on the scale of Risk Of Rain.\n\nWhat's Risk Of Rain?\nRisk Of Rain is a platforming rouglike with it's own interesting universe, easy to understand controls, and crazy gameplay.\n\nThis is one of the few games that will help you feel like a god. The amount of power you can gain, from being a lowly survivor of the UES Contact Light that dies from a single bite to walking into rooms and watching the universe collapse every time you press "Z".\n\nEvery character that you play stands out from each other, having their own attacks, look, and feel. Not ONE character feels underpowered or overpowered compared to the rest.\n\nAlthough this game doesn't have the absurd number of items like Binding Of Isaac has...what it DOES have is how every item is viable and doesn't completely topple your playstyle over if you get it. While this does mean there aren't many "weapon changing items", I find so much joy in even finding a common item, as it brings me one step closer to absolute destruction.\n\nThat's the joy I find in this game, it's to get as powerful as possible and go as long as possible. There's a nice story under it all (and good reason as to why the items in the game are even there) and if you really think about what you're doing...\n\nYou're the villain of this story, whenever you like it or not. The only way you could be somewhat good is if you blaze through the game as quickly as possible and killing as few as you can. The story's optional, though, and you can read about it when you kill foes in Rainstorm or Monsoon difficulties, since they drop logs at a slightly rare chance.\n\nAlmost every level has a artifact hidden in it, but you have to be lucky to roll the version of the level that has it. Every Artifact changes up the rules of the game, and gives interesting changes to it. Like, the lower the health something has (including you) the faster you will run, everything exploding with a shower of Creamator explosions when they die, a random skill of yours locking every minute..there's even one called Command that tosses out most of the RNG of the game and gives you chest drops when you get an item. The chest color is the rarity of the items you recieved, and you can pick whatever item from the item table you please. It's balanced, though, that the window you select items is real time, and you cannot move until you pick an item.\n\nWhen I mentioned "easy controls", this game really does have simple controls. four buttons mapped for your movement, and four buttons mapped for your skills. You can even use a controller.\n\nThis game gets interesting when you bring in your pals for co-op, while making it even more chaotic. The game's completely viable solo, but the difficulty becomes interesting in co-op. Do you let your friend take the item drop, or do you snag it for yourself?\n\nThere's also a forced item sharing button, which balances out the items for players. Though, me and my friends agree this system is incredibly annoying, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nThe music of the game is an interesting contrast from the chaotic blitzplay of  the game. Even the most intense of the soundtrack is actually quite nice music to sleep too.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ypzpl02Rps\n\nIf you want my personal favorite piece from the game, it has to be Surface Tension. It's also a boss track, usually used for the Wandering Vagrant boss.\n\nThe bosses in this game will be intimidating and will pose a threat, like any boss will, but as you become stronger, you may be able to start one shotting them..and..as you progress even further, normal foes will be replaced by bosses. Ever faced twelve giant magma worms, three overloading ones, six vagrants, and ten colossi at once?\n\nIt's one hell of a good time!\nDespite all my praise for the game, though, I do have a gripe about the game. Though, it doesn't bother me too much.\n\nThe levels and item count.\n\nThe levels will soon feel repetitive, since you will learn their layouts pretty quickly...but at least the levels themselves have different setups. Though it doesn't help that the setups only change the minor places.\n\nThe items aren't in a vast quanity, where you will always find new ones...but, hey. Every item is viable to helping you become stronger. I'd rather have this than several items that are "considered" low tier and useless.\n\nOverall, this game, albeit not a masterpiece or a gamechanger for everything that comes after it, it's a really fun game that's even one hell of a ride with friends.\n\nAnd you know what? That's all I want to ask every once in a while. For the fun alone, I'd highly reccomend the game. The characters are colorful and vastly different from each other (along with having a lot of them) the items you can pick up are ALL great, none are trick items or downgrades, the game chugs on to become blitzplay after you start slaying... It's worth the price.\n\nOne more thing to mention. Every item in the game itself has a bit of story on it. Some of the Item logs are even begging for their own stories.\n\nI'd play this over Binding Of Isaac anyday.","October 27, 2015","true","143.1"," 319 of 347 people (92%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","92","319","347","22","7"

It's so new and original, yet so classic and oddly memorable that we can all adapt to it rather quickly while not feeling like we're repeating something playing it. Most "pixel games" as they call them I see now are simply normal games... with pixel-y art styles. This is one of those games that actually blends well with the art style, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Let's talk about gameplay for a sec.\n\nGameplay: Risk of Rain will kill on your first run. If this does not happen, you are probably a carrier of Jesus' will and strength on Earth, because it's pretty dang hard to pick up on your first go. But to help, I'll elaborate on just how NOT to die. You are given the Commando to start out with, and classes like the Bandit, Enforcer, and CHEF will be easy to get early on. Every character has 4 skills, kind of like LoL, except you don't have a basic attack outside of them - They're all you got. Most classes tend to have a movement-enhancing skill in their third slot, and a powerful skill in their fourth. The Commando is no exception. He has 4 basic skills which are very easy to learn and starts with above-average high health to help beginners.\n\nUnlocking Stuff: Unlocking stuff isn't as easy as you would think. You're probably going to start on Drizzle, the easiest game mode. However, if you're a wimp, the game won't save any of your progress (This includes item logs), and no monster logs will drop either. If you want 100% completion, you're going to have to step it up. Most characters are unlocked by doing special things or filling requirements. No surprise there. The Huntress and Mercenary are pretty hard to get, asking for 15 monster logs and 5 game-wins, respectively. But don't worry - You'll get there if you like the game.\n\nItems and YOU: Items are, without a doubt, THE most key tool you need to survive the night. When you start out, you will find items randomly from boss kills, chests, imp vases, shrines, and other places. Chests require money, imp vases require you to hunt down and kill a few frantic imps, shrines are like casinos, and bosses should be obvious - Kill em for good stuff. Most (Keyword - Most) items can stack. A few, like Thallium, can not. This is why the RoR Wiki is your field guide for items here. Items give you various buffs and bonuses, and have the power to make or break you depending on how you use them and your luck with finding items that suit you. Once you start picking up Artifacts, hidden items that you can activate to change gameplay once you die, quit, or win, can alter some things - But I'll let you figure that all out.\n\nDifficulty: There's two ways this game changes difficulty - One, by choosing your difficulty on the character-select screen, and two, by slowly raising it during gameplay at a speed dependant on what difficulty you chose. This makes for very adjustable learning curves that will suit you everywhere. Artifacts can also help or hinder you if you're good at using them or not, for example; The Glass artifact cuts your health to 10%, but gives you a HUGE damage boost (Used to be x5 damage but they nerfed it, I have no idea what it is now - Don't worry, it's still fun as heck if you don't get hit!). Remember to start and progress at a rate that you're comfortable with, or else you might not have as much fun.\n\nConclusion: Oh yes, this is a game you need. Don't even ask why, just get it. It's 10 bucks. It's awesome. Once you know how to use and abuse the artifacts and characters, you'll pretty much be playing something like a God Simulator with every run, finding new ways to use your characters, match items, and have fun with MULTIPLAYER - That's right, MULTIPLAYER! Also, achievements in the form of READING AND KNOWLEDGE! Also, THE GAME LAUGHS AT YOU WHEN YOU DIE and gives SNARKY REMARKS! The art-style is AMAZING! The music is AMAZING! The gameplay is BONKERS RADICAMAZING TIMES TEN! Just! Get! This!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/batibatibatibati/recommended/248820/","batibatibatibati","Batistuta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/batibatibatibati/","381 products in account","Risk of Rain is an action platformer with some roguelike elements. It features beautiful pixel art and a great soundtrack. Besides singleplayer, you can enjoy it in local or online co-op mode. Oh, yeah, it's also pretty hard and unforgiving.\n\nYou take a role of a space train crash survivor that ends up on a mysterious planet. Your goal is to find teleporters scattered around the planet and eventually get off it and save yourself. Only thing standing between you and salvation are hordes of different enemies and dozens of giant bosses that don't seem to appreciate your sudden visit.\n\nThere are 10 classes to choose from but only 1 is available at start. Others are unlocked through various achievements. Some work better than others but they offer enough variety and present you with different challenges which is always fun. Each class has 4 different skills where 1 is actually their basic attack (melee or ranged).\n\nTo help you in your adventure there is also a big collection of items with interesting and fun effects. They are located in chests which were your crashed train's cargo. The chests are randomly scattered around proceduraly generated levels and it is your job to find them. Just don't take too long because the game gets harder as the time goes by.\n\nCombat is what makes this game great. The controls are rather simple and I don't have any problems using a keyboard to play Risk of Rain.\n\nRisk of Rain wants everything of you but being static. You will have to constantly move to scout the level and find items or a teleporter anyway, but mostly to dodge the incoming attacks like bites from lizzard-like sentient species or avoid getting zapped by flying jellyfish.\n\nLater on, you will realise you don't have to spam jump button and just run in the opposite direction of monsters and pray. You will listen for audio ques or learn the timing of enemy atacks enabling you to time your jumps and dodges, that you can use higher ground against enemies that can't climb etc.\n\nSometimes the game will throw you a curve ball (or a fun ball depending how you look at it) in a form of elite monsters. They are beefier than their normal counterparts but the main difference is an added ability to their arsenal. It can be teleportation or even worse- they can fire guided missiles that hit for huge amounts of damage. (so keep moving)\n\nThe real fun starts when you find the teleporter and the boss spawns. It is when randomly spawning enemies start to continuously spawn around you for the next minute and a half, creating a horde aiding the Imp Overlord or whatever boss creature is randomly spawned.\n\nYou repeat this dance with the Devil until you beat the game or experience permadeath and have to start over.\n\nI had some issues during these 16.6 hours of playing. Once I had no audio which was fixed by restarting my PC and once the game crashed on last boss fight. Also, game might slow down when there is too much going on on the screen. But I still love the game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action platformers.","November 26, 2013","true","33.3"," 365 of 423 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","365","423","0","2"

You'll unlock something else though and it will get easier over time. Think of this as a survival/horde mode roguelike countra-ish shooter platformer that never gets stale.\n\nEach play through will generally net you either a new power up or unique character class to eviscerate and dismember the various lifeforms of each planet and area. It has a Binding of Isaac feel in a sense that things are swapped and randomized with each play through but you'll always fight the same bosses and end boss/stage. Much like Isaac your power ups stack and you can have some really brutal and devastating combinations by the time you get to the end.\n\nThe different classes and characters you unlock all have different and interesting criteria to make them available for use and there is something satisfying in seeing that you have reached a new tier of badassery when you are now plowing through enemies with dual pickaxes or laying down your heavy shield and firing cover shots to keep the wave of enemies at bay.\nthe starting class "Commando" is more than suited for the task at hand, especially playing at Drizzle difficulty, but it should be known that every character plays completely different from the next and has a dedicated skill set and pool of abilities.\n\nThe bosses as well as the native creatures populating the planet are all aggressive and will swarm you the minute you come within proximity of them. This game also gives you a sense of urgency to complete the planet by steadily spiking the difficulty as the little ticker in the corner continues to count. If you can handle it you can play as long as you want, you can even get all the way to end and start back from the first level with all of your power ups in hand. There is a flexible and open level of choice that allows for revisiting the game and trying different things time and time again.\n\nRisk of Rain comes complete with a somewhat minimalist pixel art style and the characters would be moving dots if the view was pulled out any further but it also helps give the monsters a look of towering giants and puts you in David V Goliath scenario for the duration of your journey. All of this is backed by an amazing and atmospheric soundtrack that will constantly have you nodding your head or getting pumped in rhythm of the beat.\n\nYou can get as much as you want out of this game but if you put the time and effort into it, you can squeeze an amazing amount of time and play out of your 9.99. Overall I give this game an 8.8/10 and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of roguelikes, team co op, old school side scrolling platformer shooters, and indie games.","February 27, 2014","true","49.6"," 135 of 144 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","135","144","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunther/recommended/248820/","dunther","Dunther","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunther/","2496 products in account","Risk of Rain is an action-platformer with roguelike elements, with some interesting mechanics wich I'll try to explain the best I can.\n\nEven if you start with only one playable character, there're ten of them total, and each one plays differently, thanks to his own four attacks.\nAs time passes, difficulty will increase and enemies will spawn endlessly until you find the teleport, wich makes you fight for one last endurance round; beaten that, you can advance to the next level. Like other games of this genre, you can find active/passive upgrades (like piercing shots, increased defense, missiles and so on), but you can level-up too by collecting experience. An interesting fact is that powerups do stack, so you can have increased effects by collecting more of the same.\nOnce you've completed enough levels, you can choose between replaying them to gain more loot, or going to the final one; you can easily grind more powerups if you want to, but the game can be beaten in less than a hour in a good run.\nBear in mind that this is the kind of game where things get bad pretty fast, and you have to start all over again.\nPixelated graphics are really good, but sometimes the action on screen become a little too chaotic. Chaos apart, gameplay is overall pretty much solid and fun.\nThe game's soundtrack is AWESOOOOOME, I love it.\nAlso, this game has coop, playing with other people works well and in my opinion some classes are not meant to be played alone.\n\nReccomended if these features caught your attention, and/or if you have friends to play with.\nI don't think Risk of Rain is a masterpiece, but it's a really solid game.","July 20, 2014","true","33.0"," 121 of 132 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","121","132","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/248820/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Roguelikes have exploded as a genre lately, largely due to the number of indie productions out there exploring interesting ways to take an absolutely classic title and bolt new mechanics to it. Games like FTL, Rogue Legacy and Paranautical Activity instantly come to mind, taking randomised areas, crazy power-ups and eternal death as a basis and building them into something new and fresh.\n\nRisk of Rain takes the idea of an impossible Roguelike to new heights. The hook of this 2D action platformer is rather simple: it literally gets harder with each passing second. Immediately the player needs to make a conscious decision: do you grind out the game in the first few minutes when the enemies are few and far between, farming gold and unlocking passive abilities that will help you when you reach the ten minute mark and all hell breaks loose? Or perhaps you want to rush through as many stages as possible before the difficulty curve rises. Risk of Rain is all about risk and reward, and while it doesn't necessarily break genre conventions, it manages to provide a compelling twist on basic mechanics.\n\nPlayers are given access to a number of characters, each with four unique abilities that will aid them in combat. Each of said abilities has a cool-down timer after use, so learning which character fits your play style, and how they fit in with the rest of your team is imperative for survival. In the beginning you only have access to the assault trooper, but after multiple runs you will slowly unlock a cast of devastating characters that will help you see the game through until the end.\n\nOnce you select a character it's game on. You are dropped on a hostile world, filled with enemies. Each enemy killed will net you some gold, which can be spent unlocking chests found in the level, or taking a gamble and spending some at a divine statue. Sometimes this will yield you amazing items, other times it will take your money and laugh at your tears as you received nothing at all. Each time you use one of the statues the cost goes up also, which often had me throwing money away at it three times before I realised I was broke.\n\nThere are tons of items throughout Risk of Rain that will give you the upper edge, most of them offering passive buffs against your foes. There are a select number of consumable items you will find along the way that can be used to get yourself out of a tight jam, and there are also some helpful assault and healing drones that you can spend money repairing so they will follow you around and help against the onslaught of enemies. Just like any Roguelike, learning how to use these items in unison is key to survival, and after a dozen or so runs, you will begin to understand how it all fits together.\n\nEach level essentially has the same goal: find and activate the teleporter which will call in a randomised boss fight. The bosses are tough....really bloody tough, and they will definitely give you a run for your money. To make matters worse, the timer is still creeping up towards a harder difficulty, and regular enemies are still spawning into the world, which makes is a cluster of pain and misery. Once the boss has been defeated the enemies stop spawning, you are left to clear the last of them, and then you can teleport to the next level. Before you leave however, you better search for any chests you may have missed, because each time you teleport you will lose your gold.\n\nRisk of Rain keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, simply because that ominous timer is always ticking in the upper right corner. Slowly but surely you see the difficulty status rise from easy to no chance in hell and the sweat starts forming on your brow. You want to make sure you survive the game, but you also need to do it as quickly as possible. It's an impossible task, one that is truly captivating and kept us coming back for more and more.\n\nWhile Risk of Rain supports solo gamers, the true core of the game lies with the four-player co-op. When you're tackling the beasts of other worlds with three of your best friends, each playing a different character and you are all working in unison, the game really shines as something special. If you're not likely to play the game with friends, I'd almost recommend skipping it all together; that is how integral the multiplayer truly is.\n\nRisk of Rain manages to pull off the pixel look with style and flair. The characters are enjoyable, the enemies are ghastly, and those tunes are fantastic. If you can swing a few dollars, definitely pickup the soundtrack from the website, it's right up there with Fez and Monaco in terms of great indie game albums.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 4, 2014","true","35.3"," 143 of 168 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","143","168","6","0"

Would. I mean, the retro graphics are amazing and give the game a nice feeling, the different classes are really fun to play, the soundtrack kicks ♥♥♥, hell it's 100% worth the 70+ hours I've spent on it.\n\nBut the only problem is that this doesn't have "matchmaking" multiplayer or a in-game server list. You'll have to either use portforwarding or programs such as Hamachi or Evolve.\nI don't blame the devs for that, though. They are college students, not Bethesda or Ubisoft. They've got actual problems in their lifes to take care of, and this is just their little experiment that turned out right. They still release bugfixes from time to time though.\n\nAnyway 10/10 would slice magma worms with kitchen knives again.\n\nEDIT: As of January 2016, the site that had a useful list of servers I posted over there doesn't work anymore!

The OST is simply beautiful. The graphics create a unique atmosphere: the gameworld is dark-toned but not lugubrious; you feel lonely, but never properly desperate, and the scenarios are always enjoyable (even after countless hours of replay). Also, the storyline of sorts is gradually revealed via item logs and monster logs you acquire after some time playing - the game starts  in media res. You don't need to know what's going on to enjoy it, but it surely adds to the flavor. I particularly like this form of storytelling: a very good game becomes more and more fascinating once you start realizing (well, perhaps not exactly) what's going on after some exploration. It reminds me of Diablo II in this point.\n\nMost important, though, is that it is PURE FUN. Very challenging and very rewarding, it leaves me wanting more every time I play. Actually, I sort of developed an emotional attachment to this game; when I started playing it, I was somewhat distant from videogames (after 24 years of being a total videogame nerd), not really willing to play too much. This game (along with Papers, Please and some others) helped me "feel the magic" again, sorta like falling in love once more with your boyfriend/girlfriend after a period of strain and doubts.\n\ntl;dr: FUN, rewarding, beautiful, challenging, cool, buy the hell out of it","November 19, 2014","true","161.0"," 95 of 105 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","95","105","7","0"

So. Please start moving.\n\nThe inherit challenge of Risk of Rain is to balance speed with thoroughness. Dwell any particular region longer and you're bound to discover (and be able to afford) an array of random weaponry which stacks together in clever ways, turning your hopeless vagrant into a prayed-for messiah. But there's that catch ... the longer you dwell in one zone, the more infernal the next will be. So as you fight simply to survive, you'll also be gauging time and charting hypothetical routes through the mysterious wasteland ... hoping to come across the right combination of moneys, chests and sacrificial totems in efficient order.\n\nAside from the planet's devious armory, your years on the frontier have supplied you with a certain set of skills. Regardless of your profession, these core skills usually take form in a weak-ish basic attack, a middling form of crowd control, some type of evasion, and a signature ability (think of this as the one that won you all that money on The Universe's Got Talent: Killing Edition). Each time you use a skill - beyond the basic attack - you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can use it again. As that one random monster crab is quickly joined by every casual acquiantance from his apparently quite-social life, those seconds can seem like an eternity. But you'll need to use those skills with abandon - conservation is for another time and place.\n\nAgain. Don't stop.\n\nAs your deaths accumulate, Risk of Rain becomes a game about learning the ins-and-outs of an alien frontier while constantly pushing yourself to discover new corners of its relentless universe.\n\nYour only choice of profession at the start is a fine-tuned but vanilla-bean commando. But just as you begin to master your skills, you'll unlock a new, entirely unique character to possibly nudge your game progress further. Trust those who have come before: The new characters will often feel useless on the first playthrough. At some point, you'll wrap your brain around the death-delivering potential of each. And as you pour gallons of acid across shadowy plains or single-shot the entire health bar of one of the game's gargantuan bosses, you will learn to feel invincible ... for a minute or two at least.\n\nEach of the planet's progressively elaborate environments includes a familiar basic layout from play to play, but its random generation makes each play just uncomfortable enough to force you to make decisions on the fly. Level talk is boring, but do note: the surprisingly elaborate final stage is reward in itself.\n\nRisk of Rain is a game that requires skill and cunning ... but not so much skill and cunning to be abusive. It drops a torrent of challenges on you ... while giving you delightful ways to overcome them. To this survivor: It's earned a place in the Roguelike Temple of Elders.\n\nBe sure to visit.\n\nJust remember to keep moving.","December 7, 2013","true","48.9"," 63 of 70 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","63","70","0","0"

You unlock new characters and items, to help you through the game. The game is very fun and challenging, but if you want to make it to the end, you need to play smart and use your time wisely.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  There's not much to say about the story in this game, the description text explains that "You are the sole survivor of a space train wreck", however that is not the case if you're playing multiplayer; then you can have *four* survivors, but I digress.\n\nGame Play: There is a lot to say about the game play. Firstly, the controls are pretty simple, you have several attacks (all of which are different based on the character you're playing), you move to the left, right, and jump.\nThere are numerous unlockables throughout the game, new characters and items. There are actually unlockables that you can only get with certain characters, so that keeps you playing and trying out new things.\nThe game advertises itself as "full of rogue elements" and to a degree it's quite right, but there are some consistent factors: the first level is always the same, time continues to tick... the longer you play = the harder the game gets.\n\nAchievements: There are 15 achievements for this game. I suspect the reason I haven't written the review for this great game yet, because I... shamefully... haven't been able to unlock the last 3 achievements I need. (at this time: 4/16/15)\nThere are only a few easy achievements that you unlock just by playing it, most achievements you will need to do something very specific. Be it, find a new character to unlock, or use a specific item on another specific item/NPC.\n\nPrice:  Risk of Rain goes for $9.99, I personally waited for a sale (much to the frustration of my real life friends who wanted to play it with me)... but in the end that's a fair price for this game, based on how much time I've spent playing it.\n\nConclusion: I've mused to myself in the past thinking "I wonder if these older indie games will age differently then console or ROM games". It seems like many indie games age well because they have unique-addictive-artistic-theme's to them.\nI absolutely recommend this game, it isn't one of those "Rack up to 100 hours" games for most people, but it is a fun change of pace from the other types of games out there. One final note: this game shines when it comes to multiplayer, playing on your own gets old, playing with friends feels like you're playing a classic arcade game with friends.","April 16, 2015","true","16.3"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","42","45","7","0"

Fast paced platformer and roguelike that makes you fight with increasing difficulty the longer you stand around. As you take longer to finish areas the difficulty increases adding more powerful enemies and upgraded bosses the longer it takes.\n\nIt has a very similar item system to Binding of Isaac, in which you must unlock items by completeing certain tasks before they are available in the game. While there aren't achievements for ALL of these, the game has a listing in the menu telling you what you must do to unlock them, and the item pages give a short description over the padlock as well to show you what you need to unlock certain items. Starting now with 100 items to unlock and use, I am hoping we get a major update similer to Wrath of the Lamb and I suspect we will!\n\nThe worlds are randomly generated as well, but I am not sure if this is infinite, or they have a finite nuber of designs at the moment. It is a 2D sidescroller instead of the overhead view of Isaac, but uses a lot of the same concepts.\n\nThe game also adds a bit of lore to it with unlockable monster profiles that give you a great background on them and some funny dialog. The items also all have their own item cards with interesting infor and funny comments about them.\n\nYou unlock several (10 total) new playable characters with completely different skills and abilities to play through the game giving it very nice replayability. While in Isaac you start with basic tears and small stat differences, each character in RoR has its own unique weapons and weapon abilities to start with regardless of what items you grab. The items enhance your character in many interesting and unique ways.\n\nGraphical style is very simple and may seem offputting at first, but it works fine and the pixel art is perfectly good. Don't disregard the game based on this!\n\nThe only issue I had early was the default controls, which seemed to be designed for left handed players, but fortunately they ARE able to be rebinded to our preferneces and I did jsut that so I felt more comfortable.\n\nThis is the next great Indie roguelike that is highly addicting, and totally worth the buy. I highly recommend it to fans of Binding of Isaac!\n\nThe game has Achievements and trading cards. The Achievements I feel are a bit underwhelming, however and don't give the same sense of completion as the ones for Isaac did. Hopefully they will address this with further updates to offer more ideas and challenges with them. Not that it needs them to be a good game, but it expands the challenge having new ideas and challengs to achieve.","November 30, 2013","true","80.7"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","49","57","0","2"

This game is an 2D platformer shoot-'em-up with loads of Roguelike elements, and to tell the truth, it's an addictive hardcore game, and after over 100 hours, I still find myself enjoying this game (boy, what an year)\n\nThe hours of dying may get you mad sometimes (Damn you Jellyfish!), but that it is purpose. Once you get used to the difficulty, you will find yourself enjoying this game much more, and it doesn't get old. I think it is really worth your time. There is even a online coop mode, where you and your friend go all the way trying to beat the game (even with all the bugs), and with the artifacts, you can turn the game into your own challenge. It is really that good, just like The Binding of Isaac.\n\nThe game consist of you trying multiple times to reach a teleporter and advance to the next level, collecting items (usually randomly generated, if not for the use of one of the artifacts), which will eventually help you on your quest through out the game. The game also keeps you into it with unlockable characters and items, as well as the randomly generated levels. If lucky enough, you could turn into an rampaging god of death, killing every single enemy that come into your face, which I got to admit, it never gets old. The satisfaction of being so powerful and sort of unkillable just makes it more fun, and with a certain artifact which turns enemies into elite mobs only, it can turn into a very fun and hardcore challenge.\n\nI deeply recommend the game, as it's controls are easy; the game itself is easy to play, but hard to beat; A very worth and thought soundtrack; a simplistic but yet enjoyable and nostalgic artwork; High replay value; A good game to play in your free time, or to spend a weekend trying to beat;\n\nThis is Risk of Rain, and welcome to your possible doom.","November 10, 2014","true","214.8"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","46","56","9","0"

When he runs out of room to jump he lets out a primal chimp scream and jumps headlong into a hoard of hungry crabs, guns blazing. Welcome to Risk of Rain, buddy.\n\nThe objective is simple.

Each class has it's own set of skills which will significantly change the way you play, but unfortunately only one (out of ten) is available from the start.\nAs with most rougelikes; levels, items and enemies are procedurally generated and permadeath is enabled but game never feels unfair, since every playthrough offers something new. Due to it's difficulty and random nature it will require speed, precision and adaptability. Luckily there are a lot of items spread out around the level that will provide passive and active bonuses like increased rate of fire or various status effects, as well as more interesting ones which I'm not going to spoil since discovering new item and monster log entries will be your main source of accomplishment in early stages of the game. However as you unlock more drops and get familiar with each class, things will get easier. This is the point where time becomes your biggest enemy (well...besides all the other big enemies). Game implements a timer in the upper right corner that will gradually increase difficulty as time passes, forcing you to find a balance between becoming more powerful and just getting to the next level with all your bits intact. It provides a nice compromise, keeping a challenging gameplay, but still providing the feeling of controling an unstopabble killing machine.\n\nThere are some problems on the technical side, like the occasional but gut-wrenching crash that will erase your progress and leave you sobbing, unresponsive controls in menus (especially if you're using gamepad) and problems with online co-op conectivity and Steam achievements. I would also be amiss not to mention brilliant sountrack and appealing pixel art.\n\nAll in all, in a sea of rougelikes this one manages to stand on it's own, providing responsive shooting mechanics, hordes of different enemies and items and a great balance between frustrating and adrenaline-pumping gameplay.

But Risk Of Rain gives you multiple characters (all except one need to be unlocked first, however) and many skills to use, and more variety in its levels. And it can become quite challenging real fast. Enemies randomly spawn in the levels and you can use your skillset to take them down, earning you experience and gold. Unlock chests and buy items on your way to keep yourself from dying, because you *will* die. It's just a matter of time really. The items you find are randomly generated and are always useful. They have no negative effects (if they do it just depends on the total number of enemies walking around and the sort of level you are in). So the goal is to find as many as you can. Each level ends with a boss fight (or fights) which you, obviously, have to defeat. Once defeated you have to take out the remaining enemies before you can teleport to the next area. But, once you teleport you 'bank' your money, so you start from scratch again (your items will remain with you, of course). In the beginning you will probably last just several minutes, but once you unlock better items and characters these sessions will increase up to 45-60 minutes I guess.\nI haven't mentioned it yet, but you probably were already aware of it, and that's the fact that if you die, you have to start completely over. I love it !\n\nSo, if you're into roguelikes give Risk Of Rain a try. It's definitely worth the risk.\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","February 7, 2014","true","7.9"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","0"

Risk of Rain can be very addicted, everytime you start from the beginning with default data and you work your way to become a badass and with the new (kind of new) artifacts system, this game generate so much varieties that I can not count. Basically you chose one of the unique characters blaze through every stage and stock items, level up and build up your character and the objective is to beat the final stage.\n\nOne of the main features is the game's difficulty, it grows as the time pass. A decent gameplay management is required as the game can be tough to beat for a new player. RoR will keep surprising you with new contents (characters, items) that you will unlock, varieties tend to increase as you explore more. Which keep a well loop and create a high 'replayability'. RoR also contains several small secrets waiting for you to discover.\n\nI have seen people complaining about the multiplayer experience, which was tough to me as well. Since the developers of RoR are independent developers, a server can be luxury indeed. Simply learn how to port forwarding will be enough to host. No hamachi required, I can prove it myself but who ever is hosting need a decent internet efficiency.\n\nDespite lack of official server (some people actually host servers look it up), RoR is a pick up and play, rogue like action game, with very intriguing item and character design, and it is constantly updating. I can't illustrate how frustrated I feel when the game beat me and some ironic words pop out mocking my failure, or how awesome and satisfied it can be, when I beat the game with tons of items I collected. In other word RoR provide really nice difficulty options where things can get nasty require you to pay some attentions in order to beat it, or you can just sit back, relax, enjoy the show.\n\nIf you are available to play co-op, co-op is not too different from single player, which just add some additional chaos on your screen. The soundtrack in RoR is another feature to enjoy, musics in the background certainly polish the game into a another level it is simply astonishing and perfect. You can find all the little details proving that there are people (devs) who care about their games, and it is tons of fun when you are relaxing and reading some introductions of the item you've been using in the game, as well as the monster logs. Sometimes the game can crash if data overloaded (because it's the nature of the game), or some minority bugs happen to get in your way but overall RoR is a must-have game, and trust me you need to go deeper to witness the sorrow of the rain.","May 17, 2015","true","118.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","0"

The atmosphere of foreign planet and the mood of playing space-alien like game.\n\n*Dificulties\nAnother main aspect of this game is also that the dificulties will increase along with the time you play the game from the begining. So if you are not fast enough to gain level or loot, and the dificulties increase , be ready to have a really hard time.\n\n*Co-op\nThe good thing from Co-op is that you can owned the game with your friends. As much friend as you can , but the cons is that you have to share the amount of loot you get and that means you have to share your strength that you usually get when you play SOLO (where you can greedily have your own loot). But anyway playing this game with friends is really addicting.\n\nI am really hoping to see another sequel of this game if it were to be made . And i believe everybody will feel the same too.","November 8, 2014","true","34.4"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","27","34","0","0"

Recently though, the devs brought the game to a newer engine, and it caused LOADS of bugs and problems, even though the fps problems are mostly fixed now. I don't recommend it because even though it is loads of fun, the devs have abandoned it for the past weeks and haven't spoken to the community at all. It needs a big patch to fix the annoying bugs the game currently has and some balancing on some of the characters so that they become more viable and fun. I really like this game and I want it to thrive, but it raised more than 400% what it requested on kickstarter, and the developers NEED to address the problems it currently has, especially considering how much extra they raised.\n\nIf you're really interested in playing the game you should download the demo and try it out. If you really like it you can pick it up, the price is a steal for what the game offers anyway, but bear in mind that the current state of the game is very poor and the devs really need to put some work into fixing all the problems it currently has, and that's why my review will remain negative until the devs adress all that.","January 4, 2015","false","121.1"," 67 of 104 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","67","104","5","8"

My only note of warning is that it takes a little getting used to on the keyboard vs a game pad.\n\nTo expand a bit on the class options, here are three examples:\n\nCommando: First class everyone has access to, others are unlocked as you play and progress, find them in levels, or unlock achievements. Basic attack is a "double tap" shot with his pistol and other abilities are: piercing knock back burst of bullets, a roll that lets you escape / pass through enemies quicikly, and his "ultimate " ( longer cd then rest ) ability is a rapid fire of abilites that stun nearby enemies.\n\nEnforcer: Very stocky character. His basic attack is a short range shot gun blast then he also has a shield slam that knocks enemies back, a defensive stance that blocks all damage from a certain direction, and his ultimate type ability is a stun grenade.\n\nBandit: Basic attack is a normal rifle blast. Has a dynamite toss ability that does aoe damage, a smoke bomb that stealths him and stuns when he comes out of stealth, and his ultimate is a big headshot that does oodles of damage and resets his other abilities if it kills an enemy.\n\nIt's a really fun system to me rather than Rogue Legacy where your abilities are like magic and auto attack. Some of the other classes include a sniper, engineer fellow with turrets and missiles, an acid beast, and more!","December 29, 2013","true","43.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","1"

What truly sets it apart is the inclusion of a time-based difficulty meter, which turns it into a rather intense survival game.\n\nThe goal of every level is as follows: look for a giant shiny red teleporter, then trigger it and survive waves of enemy spawns for a set amount of time (90 seconds on Normal mode). After the timer runs out, kill any remaining opponents and you can finally teleport to the next level. When you've completed five levels, you're given the option to teleport to the final stage or to revisit the previous ones.\n\nThis simple concept forces you to constanly find the right balance between rushing and exploring: you want to make the most of every level in terms of upgrades, but hang around for too long and the ever-increasing difficulty meter will make you pay. A typical playthrough can last an hour or more; and if you happen to die, no extra lives or continues: you're starting over.\n\nThe rogue-like elements are on point, with dozens of interesting items to discover and unlock as well as twelve character classes with very specific gameplay twists. Once unlocked, you can also choose to enable up to ten artifacts which alter the gameplay in a significant way. While not fully randomized, each stage has several different possible layouts which ensures every playthrough feels somewhat different.\n\nA huge selling point for me was the option to play the game in local/online coop. Couch coop is great fun and quite playable, only requiring the players to stay relatively close to each other. Online coop gives the players more freedom and, for the most part, works very well; however, certain items (Chargefield) and possibly characters have a tendency to cause game-ending crashes.\n\nThis brings me to the flaws of Risk of Rain: a somewhat less polished technical side seems to be causing consistent problems for some users. Aside from very minor issues, it has been totally fine on my end (and the same goes for my friends), but I would definitely recommend testing the game as soon as you purchase it, and being ready to request a refund if you can't get it to work. A couple other nitpicks: the interface is rather bland and the platforming - not a huge part of the game, thankfully - can be infuriating.\n\nOn a more positive note again, the pixel art is quite decent, and the lore that unfolds through the monster and item logs paints a convincing universe. Last but not least, the soundtrack is amazing - whether you end up playing the game or not, you'll definitely want to check it out if you enjoy nice things.\n\ntl;dr: a great blend of (hardcore) rogue-like and survival to enjoy on your own or with selected friends. Excellent replay value for the price.","January 17","true","86.4"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","19","23","4","3"

I've now invested over twenty hours into it and after I finish this review I'm probably going to go play more.\n\nRisk of Rain is addictive. That's the word I've found myself describing it most as. It hits the perfect sweetspot of challenge, luck, and skill. There's a visceral sense of empowerment- every time you collect a new upgrade, you actively feel stronger. All the visual effects that pop up coupled with seeing your inventory stack along the bottom creates this really unique sense of progression, as eventually- with a bit of luck- you can reach a point where absolutely everything you touch is obliterated in a miasma of fire, metal, and spirituality. The upgrades are all nice and varied, every single one having a unique effect such as adding a new type of damage or a chance to fire an additional projectile or a new way to heal yourself. It's not like other rougelikes such as Binding of Isaac where there are a lot of items that drastically change how you play- all of them just add effects and bonuses, making you into a walking powerhouse that just gets bigger and badder as time goes on.\n\nA typical run will be about an hour if you're going for straight completion to several if you're like me and go back to replay the earlier levels and stack as much gear as possible. The game gets crazier and crazier as you level up, and if you make it that far I recommend trying it at least once. I also recommend playing with a controller- the keyboard controls work for the early levels, but once things pick up it's too cumbersome to recommend. The levels do get a bit bland, as the layouts are reused and the environments are pretty but don't make much difference. The soundtrack is solid and atmospheric, and the art direction is absolutely top-notch. The writing is worth note, too- the descriptions of the items and monster logs have a personality I wasn't expecting. I got excited every time I found something new because I couldn't wait to read up on its history. And any game where I can feel a serious, grave attatchment to a protagonist who just weaponized a ukulele can be called a literary success.\n\nIf you like RPGs, buy Risk of Rain. It's dirt cheap, and has that special feeling of leveling up in spades. All the characters are wildly different and change up the core strategy in really unique ways, and there's tons to discover and unlock. It's some of the most fun I've had with any video game lately and I'm absolutely smitten.","December 2, 2013","true","71.4"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

There a few new school elements, the most obvious one being the item system.  If you have played Binding of Issac, this will be immediately familiar to you.  You acquire items that passively make your character more powerful throughout the game by using currency and defeating bosses.  This system is incredibly well done:  Almost all the items make an impact, yet there is nothing that feels overtly broken.  Even items that do not have an immediate, obvious application are revealed to be very powerful when paired with certain other item combinations or characters.\n\nThe genius of the game really reveals itself as you unlock new characters.  There a few that feel like they are there as a novelty, but outside of those one or two, they are very well made with distinctly different feel and strategies.  The characters function similarly to ARTS characters with different base stats and 4 distinct moves all mapped to a different button.  Once again, it was shocking to me how much the game changed when using different characters.  It seems strange to say, but I was not expecting that level of depth.\n\nA lot of people will play the game for the carrot-on-a-stick nature of the unlocks, and the siren call of actually trying to beat the game.  Even after these tasks are accomplished, however, the game never really loses its appeal.  Having an amazing run and going through the entire game (which usually takes an hour or so) is just as satisfying the 10th time as it was the first.\n\nWhen you start off, the notion of getting to the 3rd level can seem daunting, let alone beating the game.  The games learning curve can be somewhat steep, but when you come over the rise of competancy, you will really appreciate how robust the pacing, item system, characters and scaling difficulty of the game is.   Was an absolute joy ride from start to finish.\n\n8.3/10","November 25, 2013","true","25.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The devs have been all but silent since 1.2. The last post on the development blog was over a month and a half ago.\n\nCurrent bugs include (but are certainly not limited to):\n*If you are playing online mutiplayer and get to the last level, all clients will crash.\n*All abilities are supposed to do random amounts of damage, and little random "damage numbers" pop up over enemies' heads, but as you can see by watching boss's health bars when you attack them, the numbers are lies and you are actually doing the exact same amount of damage with every shot.\n*Sometimes you will get stuck one pixel below the platform that you are supposed to be standing on, and you'll never be able to move again.\n\nIf you want to read more horror stories, simply check out the Risk of Rain forums at http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?forums/general-discussion.88/ , where pretty much all the discussion right now is centered on "Why is this game still being sold while it's so broken?" and "Where the hell are the devs?"\n\nI'd love to support this game again. It was a lot of fun. But right now it's sort of scammish that it's even being sold.","December 31, 2014","false","109.3"," 73 of 127 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","73","127","5","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/recommended/248820/","outlaw953","Metal Bison [33rd]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/","263 products in account","Risk of Rain is a strategical Indie arcade-style shooter in which the player endures a constantly increasing difficulty of enemy forces while gaining experience to level-up, purchasing items and upgrades, and searching for a teleporter device that forces the player to survive a boss fight. The game shares an intriguing element with other titles in that the further you go and the more time it takes to get there, the more progressively powerful the endless waves of enemies become.\nHere are several reasons to give Risk of Rain a run while running for your life in-game:\n\nLeveling System - What was originally a foreign element to me now retains some clarity. I will be honest, I did not notice the fact that characters had a level when I began my first trek into the Risk of Rain world, especially since I was so overly focused on surviving the merciless onslaught of consistently spawning hostiles. It was only after my first few playthroughs that I truly noticed the leveling system’s effect on the game’s entirety, as it acts simply as an in-game marker on how well that run’s character was sustaining, and even acted as a gauge for comparison to the play time to see how the player was progressing during that particular playthrough. This is not to say, however, that the leveling system is a useless ploy. When a character levels up, they receive bonuses to health and damage, which is definitely useful throughout the game. What I mean to say is that the leveling system is unique in that it is not something the player has to focus on, though it can sometimes signify that the player has to either spend more time in defeating enemy forces or has time to find the teleporter due to the amount of work they put in.\n\nCharacter Selection - Each of the twelve characters in Risk of Rain has a completely unique playstyle to master. For instance, the Commando is a more tactful starting ally who is equipped with a pistol the deals medium damage and has a long range to which requires no cool-down for its use, a canon-like projectile weapon whose shots connect with multiple enemies within its line of fire, a basic combat roll which negates all damage within its arch, and a submachine gun burst that momentarily fires on both sides of the Commando player within a straight line. The Enforcer, however, is a close-range gunman equipped with a slow-firing short-range shotgun that has a slight knockback effect against enemies, a shield bash that is close-ranged and stuns all hostiles upon impact, a stance change in the form of a one-way shield block which increases fire rate for the given direction and redirects virtually all incoming enemy damage from the Enforcer’s front-however, the Enforcer cannot turn around whilst this mode is toggled-, and an explosive projectile launcher with a longer cool-down rate that has a decent knockback effect combined with explosive damage. There are eleven playable characters to unlock-with the Commando present from the game’s start-, but each requires a considerable amount of time to acquire, and even more time to master.\n\nTime-Based Increasing of Difficulty - As previously described, Risk of Rain utilizes a time-based difficulty system as well as the “Easy, Medium, and Hard” modes you would find within other titles. What sets this approach apart from the usual is that it completely and consistently influences the way you play. It is suggested that the player act quickly by locating the teleporter device upon spawning, but this requires said player to evade enemy forces persistently, subsequently causing them to be weaker when the end-stage boss fight does occur; on the other hand, because the enemies become increasingly difficult over time, grinding and exploration is somewhat limited to a shorter duration. This chaotic paradox raises a call to action within the player, in which the fast-paced gameplay is heightened to the condition that critical decisions must be made promptly. This system heavily drives gameplay, and this has been a favorite approach to gaming for me as well as a worthy mental and emotional adversary.\n\nCollectible Drops and In-Game Achievements - After countless deaths, the player should feel as though some sort of progression has been made, and the collectables found through each world achieves this satisfaction. A percentage of this progression comprises not only of how far one proceeds through each run but also of which upgrades the participating player unlocks during the playthrough. These, as well as collectible ‘Monster Logs,’ can be viewed in a catalogue from the main menu of the game. The in-game achievements create a sense of progression as well, and even allows the player to unlock additional items such as upgrades and additional characters by completing certain goals.\n\nTL:DR - Risk of Rain is one of those games that can be a chaotic mess and still retain its charm, which for some games is inaccessible. It is one of those games that you play as if it were embedded within an arcade cabinet and you have infinite quarters, without fear of failing. It is one of those games you just play: do not degrade yourself for not defeating an end-of-world boss because of a single mistake, do not worry about being a completionist while driving yourself mad just because an item did not drop when you needed it to. Risk of Rain is one of those games that deserves its claim as an Indie Gem, and that one should just play to play. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

It seems to be more of a niche game because if you like it you love it and if you don't you hate it. The game requires you to either be good right off the bat, which I doubt everyone will be able to be, or it requires you to run through the game several times before you can actually play it. The game uses an unlocking system similar to the binding of issac, except there are not as many items in risk of rain which leads to a problem of item balance. Because of the 30-60 Items, I don't honestly remember, the ones near the end add a lot of power to your run, however the ones near the beginning are rather basic, and don't get you very far. you also do not unlock the characters ight away which leaves you to only play as the Mercenary to try and unlock anyting. which in my opinion is the worst to play because you can't move and shoot like some other classes.\n\nThe game has a frustrating starting system but endgame its very enjoyable to play.\nPersonally if I was back at the start I would download a 100% game file and play it, although you won't unlock anything it would be like playing an arcade game for a higher score, with the sort-of-random worlds it won't get old fast.\n\nMusic is great (if you can get it to work common bug where the music will not play at first, when fixed it's fixed forever though.)\n\nDifficulty scale is great.\n\nEtc etc.\n\n/Rant\n\n\nStory: X/10 (Is there one, I haven't noticed.)\nGameplay: 10/10\nPresentation: 10/10\nSoundtrack: 9/10 (good not great)\nReplayability: 6/10 (it might happen. one day. offline.)","June 23, 2014","true","6.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aeronaut/recommended/248820/","Aeronaut","Aeronaut#1440","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aeronaut/","143 products in account","Risk of Rain is a frantic, fast-pased platforming/action game with a relatively short story and a HUGE degree of random variance.\n\nPlaying as one of several characters (all "crew members" of a crashed delivery spaceship), you fight your way through mobs of enemies, relying on both skill and powerups scattered throughout stages to survive. These powerups are insanely random, each granting you an often-ridiculous bonus. Some are crazier than others, and many are so powerful or stupid that I can't even begin to describe them here. What's important, in my opinion, is that they're all fun to pick up.\n\n...and you'd better be picking them up frantically, because the game's difficulty scales with time. The longer you take on a stage, the longer you dawdle trying to find treasure chests or shops with powerful items in them, the more powerful enemies will be on this stage and the next. The longer you spend fighting, in other words, the tougher the fighting becomes.\n\nA successful game of Risk of Rain usually lasts anywhere from about 40 to 60 minutes. The powerups on any given level vary wildly between playthroughs. The levels themselves can have multiple layouts and multiple styles. All of the characters--even the immediately-unlocked "Commando"--collectively provide a large number of different ways to make it to the next teleporter or die trying.\n\nIn the end, the game is a crazy race against time to acquire powerups, kill enemies, and ultimately (hopefully) fight the final boss with a nonsensical menagerie of gear. This is without a doubt one of the most addicting games I've ever played. I highly recommend it.","December 3, 2013","true","171.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

Yes, it is somewhat like The Binding of Isaac in that there's things trying to kill you and items that make them less able to kill you, but  in my opinion, that's where the similarity ends. There's no unfairness or fake difficulty; much like Dark Souls, every death is your fault. You didn't move fast enough, you didn't time your dash skill, you didn't w/e. Every death in this game is a learning experience as you struggle for life on the hellhole planet you're stranded on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/invecta/recommended/248820/","invecta","OZWA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/invecta/","100 products in account","Risk of Rain is a rogue-like that offers a few interesting twists on the genre, but utlimately this game doesn't give the player a compelling reason to keep going back into the rain-stained void.  I'm going to keep this short and just discuss the two main design errors that kept me from enjoying this game.\n\nThe first strike against this game is that it has a very skewed difficulty skewing.  As time progresses in Risk of Rain, the enemies grow in numbers and strength.  The early portion of this timer makes for an exciting experience that forces the player to formulate a careful balance between farming and progressing through the initial levels.  If the scaling maintained this logical, linear progression, Risk of Rain would be brilliant.  The problem is that near the end of the timer enemy statistics are hyper-inflated to the point where the game becomes slow, dull, and almost impossible to survive.  No matter how lucky or unlucky one is in their item drops, eventually they will reach a point where progress is slowed to a crawl due to insanely inflated HP pools and huge damage numbers.  Here's the critical reason why this is so bad: Risk of Rain is a game about kiting.  You must be able to whittle the horde as you kite across sections of each map, and when you can't effectively kill anything after multiple loops, things go badly.  Difficulty can be punishing yet rewarding, or it can be merely punitive.  Risk of Rain's difficulty starts as the former but quickly morphs into the latter.  Either the enemies need to be slowed in their evolution, or the player needs better scaling ratios.\n\nThe other problem with the game is that a large portion of the character kits are badly designed for the engine in which they inhabit. Risk of Rain is a game mostly about kiting, but only a few of the characters' kits are actually able to do this with any efficacy.  The varying roster brings a welcome diversity to the game, but any initial excitement about new characters quickly begins to fade once the player begins to realize that only about three characters are actually worth playing when attempting more difficult and longer runs.  The developers seemed to have forgotten that the game requires constant kiting, and as a result you'll find throughout character diversity many kits that inhibit or restrict one's ability to kite, and the damage compensation for the restricted movement isn't nearly enough to make it worth the sacrifice.  The Huntress is an example of a character that is designed with the game's core mechanics in mind.  Her speed, fast cooldowns, and movement are unparalleled, and playing this character augments all of the postive aspects of the game.  Kiting the flood of enemies is a rush and most mistakes can be assigned to player error. The Bandit is an example of a poorly designed character -- weak mobility, long cooldowns, and no true edge in damage.  The Bandit either would need more movement or much higher damage ratios to be a character that is worthwhile.  Perhaps many would argue that they enjoy this hieratic approach to character rosters -- and some might even enjoy the extra challenge of a poorly designed character -- but I would have liked to seen multiple playstyles designed around the mobility required in Risk of Rain.\n\nThere's a few other problems with the game, but those are the two main things that kept me from going back to it.  The initial struggle of balancing farming v. progression was addicting and compelling, but this experience was quickly ruined by an atrociously designed end-game.  The thrill of unlocking characters, too, was diminished once one understood that only three have well designed kits. It's an interesting game that will be exciting for a few hours, but if you've played other Rogue-likes, you'll soon see the design errors that hold it back from true greatness.","September 23, 2014","false","18.2"," 90 of 160 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","90","160","5","4"

Pfft, more like Risk of PAIN. Because, you know, you'll die a lot in the game.\nActually, it's not as much of a risk as it is a certainty. Hold on, let me try again.\n\n*ahem*\n\nRisk of Rain? Pfft, more like Certainty of Pain. Wait, no, that's crap. Hm, synonyms of certainty...inevitability...destiny? Destiny of Pain? That sure sounds dark, though. Although I guess it fits with the game...where was I going with this again?\n\nDammit, okay, so Risk of Rain is about an interplanetary cargo ship that gets attacked by aliens over a deserted planet. The ship crashes, and you, playing as one of about a dozen different classes, have to, with the help of the cargo you find scattered across the planet, defend yourself against the native creatures and find your way back to the ship. It's a 2D jumpey-shootey platformer that is kind of sort of roguelike-ish; the areas you go to are more or less random, with the locations of the teleporters and items - and the items themselves - being fully randomized, but each area has only a couple of variations. This is not a bad thing - once you play through an area enough times, it's easy to figure out the general layout, meaning that it's potentially easier to find the teleporter to the next area. This saves time, and in Destiny of Pa Risk of Rain, time is not on your side.\n\nThe longer you spend in the game, the harder the game gets. More enemies spawn more rapidly, the enemies become stronger and tougher, and at higher difficulties, boss enemies can spawn in the middle of a level, instead of only at the end. This not only keeps the game's difficulty up, but it also forces you as a player to keep moving forward. Do you farm enemies and search for items, or head straight for the teleporter to prevent the difficulty from rising any higher than it needs to?\n\nThe game also features both local and online co-op, which is great, but sadly both methods have their own problems. Getting online co-op to work requires more than passing knowledge of computers, and local has every player sharing one screen, which makes exploration difficult. When it works, though, it can be a blast - exploration and monster-killing become much easier with multiple people, and working in a team allows the more specialized classes, such as Sniper and Enforcer, to shine.\n\nRisk of Rain has good controls (the game is perfectly playable with either a keyboard or a gamepad), plenty of things to unlock and discover, and a punishing difficulty level that keeps it from getting boring but is never discouraging. Even though you start with one basic (albeit well-rounded) class, the Commando, getting the other classes offers a nice challenge on top of the gameplay itself, and each class plays very differently from the rest. The game is a ton of fun and you should buy it.","January 24, 2014","true","129.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","9","10","4","0"

If played right, he is probably the easiest character to beat the game with, and again, that's something you find out very quickly upon playing. Through playing, you can unlock the other nine classes, The Enforcer, The Bandit, The Huntress, HAN-D, The Engineer, The Miner, The Sniper, Acrid, and The Mercenary. Each of these classes has skills completely unique to them and each class also has its own stat progression, such as health, armor, and damage. Some classes are definately more powerful than others, but not so much more powerful as that you feel the need to only play one class. Personally, I think that the two most powerful are The Mercenary, who you get for beating the game five times, and The Huntress, who you get for finding 15 monster logs, which drop at random.\nThe multiplayer is still a work in progress, and is currently extremely difficult to get working properly. I can't wait for the final product to be released and enjoy co-op with ease.\nRisk of Rain is a very refreshing title that comes at a nifty price tag of $10, although I wouldn't hesistate to pay $30 or more for it. It is utterly flawless down to the very last pixel, and for that, has earned its place among my personal top 10 games list.\nFinal Score- 10/10","January 6, 2014","true","37.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Roguelikes and roguelike elements have been trending lately, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Risk of Rain houses a great challenge and addictive gameplay.\n\nRisk of Rain requires skill, reflexes, and luck to beat. Every character feels very distinct and they are all fun to play. Each character has four skills, three of which have cool downs, which you have to manage in order to survive. Damage comes in percents and the numbers get high.  Along with number crunching, the randomized items are an essential part of the game. These stackable items provide a number of bonuses, passive and active, that make survival possible.\n\nIt is hard to describe what makes this game so intense and rewarding.  Difficulty increases as time goes on, so it becomes a tradeoff between risk and reward. Fully exploring a level could result in multiple boss spawns and death by elite level creatures, but rushing through the levels could leave you underpowered and lacking items. Your main objective is to find the teleporter in each level, but its location is randomized each time. Your starting point, chest placement, bosses, items, and overall location are all randomized as well. The intensity of the game never lets up because of the increasing difficulty, and it will take the right items and movements to beat the game. However, every playthrough feels like it’s teaching you something different: you will start to learn the layout of levels, the quickest routes, the main teleporter locations, and so on.\n\nIf learning isn’t reward enough there are also plenty of unlockables. Besides the nine characters that need to be unlocked, there are a ton of items as well. These are all unlocked in a variety of ways that can make for some interesting challenges on top of the base game. Playing by yourself is great, but this is also a great local or online co-op experience, because teamwork is essential.\n\nOutside of the base game there are some logs and statistics to look through. While the item log seems to be less serious, the monster log provides some neat insight into the monsters of the game. The statistics page on the other hand, provides interesting insight into yourself and how much of problem this game has made out of your free time.\n\nRisk of Rain is hard to put down. The art and music are both really great, and the game feels solid and rewarding.\n","November 27, 2013","true","111.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naxts/recommended/248820/","naxts","Naxts of Romance and Vice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naxts/","205 products in account","Risk of Rain. What a game. At first I was skepticle to try this game out being that I assumed it was just your average MOBA with some sort of twist to it like most games are nowadays. What you get is a lost soul stranded on a mysterious planet fighting for survival against a army of creatures that want nothing but your death. This game is intense, sweaty hands intense. You play as one out of eight character who's only like, 10 pixels tall against giant monsters that absolutely tower you while trying to fight off a horde of smaller monsters as well. You really do feel a sort of pressure on you while you play when you remember that the monsters only get stronger as time goes on, so you're left with the decision to scour the level for items or to just continue on before you become overpowered. This game is hard, it does not forgive and death will force you to start over, and I wouldn't have it any other way. This is a game for the skillful and the strong, anyone who can't face a good challenge will not survive long in this planet.\nI love the game. Since the game randomly generates the level to be different every time, you're contantly left guessing where the teleporter is. The wide assortment of items to attain is amazing as they all have different effects that help you in your survival, such as mushrooms that provide speedy healing or a rocket laucher that fires a barrage of missiles at your enemies. There are just so many possibilties that it you're constantly left playing the game over and over again because it's impossible to get the same playthrough twice. That leads me to another thing I love about the game, it's infinately replayable. Since there are so many items and characters you can unlock, it gets to be addicting as more of the game's content becomes avaliable.\nThe Multiplayer mode is a complete blast. You would think that with teamwork, the game should be a breeze, but no. The more people are together at once, the more monsters come to rip you down. It's so much fun to combine you are your friend's unique abilities (assuming they all play different characters) and to coordinate together to survive as effectivly as possible. I always thought it was hilarious how sometimes your friends would get so desperate for items that they dive for every possible chest. Multiplayer adds a new layer of challenge as you now have decide to distrubute the random items evenly, or to have one man become the strongest and carry the rest of the team to survival.\n\nNow it's time for the bad.\nWhile it's fun and absolutely crazy when you're trying to fight off the hordes of them, after the big masses are dead, you're left with a few stragglers hidden somewhere in some corner of the map which becomes a chore to hunt them all down. One complaint I have with the game is how luck based it is, which I suspect isn't unreasonable considering the nature of the game, it's frustrating to spend your limited resources on a chest only to get some item that wouldn't help at all. There is very little incentive to use the shrines as they have such a high chance for failure, I would only use them if I had excess money on my way to the teleporter. Multiplayer is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to set up. This game uses the system where you have to connect to a friend via IP address. This system is very outdated and has only been nothing but a pain to get working. I cannot open my ports if my life depended on it which leaves me utterly unable to host games, leaving me to depends on my friends to play multiplayer, it becomes quite an inconveience to type in IP addresses for every person. At the very least, there should be an option to copy paste.\n\nAside from those issues, this is an absolutely terrific game that deserves to be played at least once. It offers so much for the moddest price of $10. It's a real bargan to get so much play time from this game.

There are multiple different classes of characters with unique abilities that set them apart from eachother. The world is always different through every play through of the game so it never gets old.\n\nThere are random chests placed throughout the world that you open with money earned from killing enemies that give you upgrades or items that help you survive.

But I got caught in a concept which the game follows. I was beaking my buddy the whole time about power ups and how they were nice in this game but it was lacking physical power-Ups like double jump's. Low and behold two minutes later I get two double jump power ups and my guy is literally jumping across the map. At that point I was in.\n\nThe game play itself is good. The concept is you get one life, you run through the levels killing enemies first and fore most to get money to therefore in turn open these chests or "luck" statues for power Ups or items. As you kill you gain experience to level up. Power ups range from being able to double jump, to jumping further, to shooting faster, to shooting through everyone every fourth shot, cool-down time faster, every time you shoot maybe something explodes... literally I don't have enough space in this review to write every single power up out. The player starts with a "commando" character unit first and as you progress throughout the game or the more you play, the more character units you unlock. Every character has their set abilities (four of them) that cannot change but every character has different abilities. Items also have a cool down period just like the weapon abilities characters have, and the nice thing about items is that they are REUSABLE! What makes the game even better is that there is local multiplayer enabled (fakin' rights bud) and online multiplayer (ohhhhh faaakk yeah bud). So I definitely have to give it up to the guy who made this game because he tried thinking of it all. Oh yeah.... and it's controller supported :) (xbox controller as well as Logitech gamepad).\n\nGraphics are graphics as you can see in the preview of the game. To me they look like old Liero touch up's which is perfectly fine but my friend put it better : "This game reminds me of playing the original nintendo". After he said that - that's pretty much what I see now. The impact effects, the multitude of varying enemies with each their own power or attack and health, the backgrounds, the different levels all are nice and easy on the eyes, maybe even appealing to some.\n\nSo I've talked quite a bit about this game, and mostly positive as it rightly is. Does it lack anything? Maybe for some. After unlocking a handful of characters I have to ask myself after being able to play for an hour every time I start a new game, what am I playing for? My stats aren't getting saved (I'm not sure if it's supposed to be saved every time you die or every time you simply start up the game) which sort of is irritating considering people like to see their stats. The game pretense is nice, it's all good but there is just that something more missing. Being able to build buildings in game? Maybe perhaps an RPG element where you can choose certain abilities? I think if this game had steam work shop or maybe some free add-ons to add to the game it would be perfect.\n\nI really want to give it my standard rating of 8 which I consider a rating of a good game, however I will have to give it a\n\n7.9/10.\n\nI feel the rating is fair because once you play this enough, you'll start wondering where is the motivation to play again. Unless of course a friend comes over or wants to play.\n\nAny chance of Risk of Rain 2?","November 25, 2014","true","5.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Really I can't keep up with all these crazy genres/sub-genres anymore. Mainly the game works like this:\n\n1. You crash land on a planet filled with hostile alien life-forms.\n2. You must seek out the teleporter.\n3. You have to survive for 90-120 seconds while killing these aliens and the stage boss.\n4. You acquire items that unlock additional abilities.\n5. You can either escape the planet or continue searching for items to become a God of alien-destruction.\n6. You never get a normal night's sleep again.\n7. You You You You You You You You You You\n\nHonestly I'm not sure why I enjoyed this game as much as I did. I'm usually not a fan of roguelikes. While I understand and appreciate the work that goes into designing a game in this style, it just seems like 80% of indie titles are some variance of "get stronger...but don't die or you'll lose everything!" Risk of Rain however, it really clicks with me, and I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nLet's start with the difficulty. RoR can be a challenging game, especially when played on the harder setting, using particular artifacts, and imposing restraints (not acquiring particular items, tougher class, etc). There's a lot of flexibility that goes into this game. Through experimentation and practice, you eventually hit the "How could you ever die?" level, that's a good indicator to change things up for your next play-through.\n\nDespite the limited number of stages and aliens, the game maintains its freshness on subsequent play-throughs. This is attributed to good scenario design. Actually I take that back, since scenarios are usually created through a combination of artifacts and randomness. Still, a lot of what makes each stage great is what can happen, and the items you find leading to subtle changes in your overall strategy. Surviving is important, but you also have to kill everything. Sometimes aliens/bosses can be "herded" by allowing them to spawn on platforms. Teleporting elites can mess with this strategy however.  It's also possible to get trapped by a swarm of aliens, forcing you to make the most of your limited invincibility moves to get away/chip at the crowd.\n\nThen there's the immense satisfaction of when everything comes together. You're shooting enemies with lasers, rockets, bullets, missiles, and a bunch of other random crap all at the same time while viewing a parade of numbers. Taking out 40+ enemies at once with a huge attack is also quite amazing. I especially enjoy playing as the mercenary. He has a couple invincible moves and a spin-slash that works sorta like a jump. Eventually I get the cooldowns so low I can mash the invincible moves every second, and constantly spin-slash through huge enemies while never touching the ground.\n\nI could go further, believe me I really want to, but I have to get my life back. Risk of Rain devours my free-time, and I still have several hundred other games to play (plus a job and some other stuff that is probably necessary). This game might click for you as well, which would be both great and terrible.\n","January 11, 2015","true","27.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

It's very deep and engaging, and once you've put some time into it it'll get its "one more run" hooks into you deep.  The problem is it doesn't put its best foot forward and it doesn't really teach you what to look for.  The starting class, the Commando, is straight forward but his dodge ability takes a lot of time to really master.  The second class, the Enforcer, is great for multiplayer but a little too slow and plodding for solo.  I've found that the most interesting classes unlock through random event spawns in the later levels, but they're either out of the way or blend with the rest of the scenery so that you need to be right on top of them to get the button prompt and realize they're actually gameplay elements.\n\nIf you want to have fun solo with this game, my recommendation is that you set it to easy, unlock all of the classes, and then play it on normal.","January 4, 2014","true","49.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I was a bit reluctant at first to pick up this game. But once I did, I instantly knew that it was an incredibly good decision on my part. I fell in love within the first few minutes.\n\nImagine a game that takes you, the player, into a cakewalk. You find a cupcake here and there and maybe one or two spoiled ones. Not so bad, right? Then suddenly, the cupcakes turn into bricks. You wonder, "Wait, why did these cupcakes suddenly get hard?". You go around finding brick after brick, wondering when you'll find another cupcake. Then to your delight you find an entire damn chocolate cake. And not that cheap crap, either. This is the premo stuff imported from a five-star in Germany. You go to town and dig right in. Afterwards, you realize there's someone behind you. You turn around and what do you find? None other than the dark lord of hellfire and cats, and he's got a legion of pitchforks behind him that are going to be stuck somewhere; and there's no way in hell you'll find any cupcakes now. Now imagine that every five minutes that same dark lord clones himself and his legion threefold; those pitchforks ain't there for decoration, either.\n\nThat's what it's like playing Risk of Rain. An amazing experience of continuously being challenged against an ever increasing difficulty and number of foes. And that's on the single-player, too. You can invite three other friends with you so that you're not the only one being stuck by pitchfork-wielding cats.\n\nThe cool thing about this game is the wide-range of character selection, as well. Each character is its own experience to be played, along with their own pros and cons. Most of these characters must be unlocked by completing a certain achievement, making quite a few of them difficult to unlock.\n\nYou can play as:\nA drug addict\nA masochist\nA hoarder\nA poacher\nA robot\nA nerd with turrets for friends\nA gold digger\nAn assassin\nAn animal\nAnd a guy who likes swords\n\n(Respectively: Commando, Enforcer, Bandit, Huntress, HAN-D, Engineer, Miner, Sniper, Acrid, Mercenary)\n\nIf you haven't already, then pick up this game. Seriously. Ignore the 78 metacritic score; it's complete bull.\nThis is a game that will give you hours and hours of entertainment with extreme amounts of replay value. I got RoR during the Steam Christmas sales, but I would gladly pay $10 for it. I know that as soon as I pick up the controller and launch Risk of Rain, I'm going to be stuck for hours at a time. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nOn a scale of one to ten, I rate this game: HAHAHAHA","January 24, 2014","true","60.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aethereus/recommended/248820/","Aethereus","NoSkillWill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aethereus/","1689 products in account","Risk of Rain is a level-based, rogue-like platformer that is several large boats full of action-packed fun. You land on an alien planet, perform diplomacy incredibly poorly by shooting everything you see until it explodes into the planet's currency, buy random loot, kill bosses and move on. Each runthrough is nicely randomized based on the loot you pick up and the character you select, and each character is well rounded with a MOBA-style 3 moves and 1 ultimate ability to help you get sh*t done. Platforming handles beautifully, all non-tank characters have movement abilities to make traversing the desolate environments flow nicely and last but not least, playing with friends is fantastic.\n\nYes, It's a good game, 10/10 would reccomend, but it isn't perfect. The main issue I have with risk of rain is the time limit. Let me elaborate by saying that RoR doesnt really have a time limit; it simply gets harder for every 5 minutes of playtime. "but a game would be boring if it didnt get harder as you progress" I hear you bleat. Of course difficulty curve is important, but RoR literally gets harder the LONGER you play, rather than the further you get. You are rewarded for finishing the level as fast as you possibly can, which effectively penalizes exploration of the level. The more you d*ck around, the less likely you are to win. I, personally, do not consider this fun. The entire point is to prohibit players from collecting every possible upgrade and stop them from screwing the difficulty curve by farming early levels for gold and experience, but since experience increases exponentially as you progress and you lose all your money when you go up a level, I still fail to see the point of this gameplay tactic. I don't enjoy feeling rushed when I sit down to play a game.\n\nThe only other major issue with RoR is that some enemies take WAY too much firepower to bring down. This small annoyance is compounded by the fact that you're on a clock. Playing this game, you will come to resent the tanky enemies so much for screwing up your perfect run. They aren't a challenge, they're not HARD to bring down, but you still need to and doing so is a CHORE. Eventually, as you play, you'll unlock a "relic" which allows you to start a new run with -90% health and 10x damage. This feels like the way the game was MEANT to be played, and when you get this extra the game becomes so unbelievably more playable you'll wonder aloud why it wasn't available from the FREAKING START!\n\nRisk of Rain is one of the better rogue-likes on the steam market, and I highly reccomend that you give it a go.

Also, holy crap is it ever difficult now that the game is no longer played in super slow motion.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to put pressure on you, challenge you, but do it in a controlled and fair way, that you can replay endlessly, Risk of Rain is a sure thing.

Didn't regret 1 second of it (except the time i died and the game ended)\nThis game has tons of fun and replayabilitiy, which is one of the first things i look when i play a game. But that's just me. First of all, the game might seem boring. But if you advance further you realize how many different stuff you can get. You have many items to collect while playing and each one of them gives you an unique ability. Also they are separated in tiers;\nWhite, Green, Red and Orange (usables) And around 80% of the items can be stacked, making them stronger and stronger as you collect more of them. But some have stacking caps.The game gets harder and harder as your progress. And if you play long enough, you might encounter the "overloaded" bosses. They take some time to defeat. Also most of the regular enemies turn into elite enemies. Them being elite lets them have special powers (depending on the color, if im right) and they have much more damage & health. I don't know if it counts as a spoiler or not so i will just say this: be prepared for the last boss. It's pretty hard to beat.\n(Updated)\nI cannot i believe i missed the 2nd most thing i like about this game! The amazing soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou! He did an amazing job on every track and i enjoy them everytime i play the game. I set my music volume to 100% just to listen to them.\nI highly recommend this game. It is worth every penny.

Salah satu game Indie yang mantap dan masuk list saya. Hanya 89.999 (Saya membeli nya pas discount kena 22.499) kita bakal memainkan sebuah game survive dengan tingkat kesulitan yang ADUHAI SEKALI. Iya, disini itu kita bakal mati , mati dan mati lagi. Jangan sepele ama tampilan pixel nya, atau harga murahnya, ini masih 11:12 ama Dark Souls  XD.\n\n*Story\nAnda berperan sebagai Astronot yang terdampar ke Planet karena kecelakan pesawat, dimana Planet yang ada injaki memiliki berbagai macam makhluk yang siap mengintai dan menerkam langkah anda. Tugas anda sangat sederhana , mencari Teleporter , dan survive dari serangan makhluk yang ada di planet tersebut. Sederhana bukan? Tapi percaya deh, tulisan "Death" bakal mewarnai layar anda kok :D\n\n*Gameplay\nGameplay nya gampang dan mudah kok, untuk bergerak cuma menekan tombol  Up, Down, Right Left di Keyboard, tombol Space untuk lompat, tombol ZXCV untuk aktifkan Abilities kamu. Oh iya, Abilities nya yakni Z untuk Double Tab (Menembak dengan pistol mu 2 kali dengan damage 2x60 % dan gk ada Cooldown nya), X untuk Full Metal Jacket (Menembakkan peluru dengan damage 230% dan mampu mendorong tubuh lawan kebelakang, cooldown 3 detik), C untuk Tactical Dive (Melakukan Roll  dengan jarak terbatas ke depan dan kebelakang , berguna untuk  menghindari serangan musuh atau lari dari serbuan musuh yang berjumlah banyak dan memiliki cooldown 4 detik)  dan V untuk Suppressive Dive (Menembak peluru dengan beruntun, damage nya 6 x 60% untuk musuh yang satu arah , dan dapat berganti mode ke mode dual gun , yang bisa menembak musuh sekaligus di depan dan belakang dengan damage 3x60%, cooldown 5 detik) dan G untuk memakai item seperti Bom , ranjau, dan lain lain.\n\nDi game ini , setelah membunuh musuh, anda mendapatkan exp dan cash. Exp untuk naik level, sedangkan Cash untuk membeli item di Container yang sudah tertera harga nya. Berbagai macam item yang anda beli  amat sangat berguna dalam petualangan Anda.\n\nLayak nya Game RPG, item nya memiliki berbagai macam fungsi, ada yang melipat gandakan Attack , meng-Heal dalam hitungan waktu, sebagai perisai, melipatgandakan jumlah Gold, dan lain lain.\n\nDi game ini juga ada Spot untuk Super Jump, jadi dengan Spot ini anda dapat melakukan Super Jump dan berpindah dari tempat satu ke tempat yang lain dengan mudah\n\nBakalan ada timer waktu yang dapat menaikkan tingkat kesulitan game. Jadi jangan berleha leha XD\n\nSetelah anda menemukan Teleporter, maka Teleporter bakalan hidup dalam waktu 90 detik. Nah dalam waktu 90 detik ini anda bakal survive besar besaran karena di bagian ini anda menghadapi Boss dari Planet yang anda injaki dan Musuh yang muncul dalam jumlah banyak\n\n*Tips dari Saya\n1. Lakukan Fast Attack dalam menit pertama, kumpulin exp dan gold sebanyak banyak nya\n2. Kenali musuh , gerak, daya serang dan tipe serang dari musuh tersebut\n3. Jika sudah memiliki Gold yang cukup, beli lah item di Container terdekat,\n4. Musuh melakukan Gangbang? Cukup hindari dan Kabur XD\n4. Segera pergi ke Teleporter , dan hadapi Boss nya, jadi dengan cara ini anda tidak membuang waktu dan tingkat kesulitan juga tidak bakal naik XD\n\n*Plus\n1. Cocok buat pengemar game yang memiliki tingkat kesulitan Tinggi.\n2. Musik nya Ciamik\n3. Harga murah,\n4. Size dan Spesifikasi sangat gampang\n5. Kombinasi item yang jadi pemicu semangat di game ini\n\n*Minus\n1. Gak bisa Online Coop, selalu error\n2. Story yang masih minim\n3. Masih kurang Playable jika dimainkan dengan Keyboard\n\nNilai: 9.5 / 10\nBuy it and feel your rage !","April 11, 2015","true","11.8"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","24","41","10","12"

The game consists of five stages. Each stage is selected at random from a choice of ten to fifteen maps per stage, with the maps being variants on two or three actual landscapes. For example, for the first level, you will find yourself either in the Ancient Forest or in the Dried Lake, and each one of those has several variants.\n\nThroughout the game, enemies spawn and attack you, the type of which are determined by the map you're on, and the number of which are determined by how far the game timer has progressed. It starts at Very Easy, Easy, Medium, and Hard, and eventually progresses to I SEE YOU, I'M COMING FOR YOU, and HAHAHA.\n\nAt around HAHAHA, you might start having two or three boss monsters spawning with the normal enemies at random.\n\nAs if this isn't bad enough, you're pretty fragile and horribly, horribly outmatched by the unending waves of enemies you face. Your weapons are laughably weak in comparison to your foes' attacks, and the fact that there are Elites and Phantasms which ramp the power up to even more ludicrous heights only makes the game more inherently unfair.\n\nYou kill enemies to collect currency and experience. Experience gains you levels, with the usual "make everything better" that comes with levelling. Coins can be used to unlock treasure chests or sacrificed at shrines.\n\nThe items you gather will make your life a little easier. Not much. Sometimes, negligibly so. But enough negligible boosts can really stack up after a while.\n\nThis game follows the Goldeneye model of achievements. Each achievement you earn comes with an in-game unlock - some will unlock items that will be able to drop from thereon out, some will unlock new characters, like the specialized and challenging Sniper, or the adorably toxic Acrid.\n\nAll in all, I have ground my face against this game for hours and hours, have only won a handful of times, and have loved nearly every minute. This is not for the Facebook Games generation, this is for the motherfudgers who thought Contra was a good time, even if they never could get anywhere without the Konami Code.","September 10, 2014","true","600.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Starting out with a small arsenal of toons, you can choose and develop your playstyle very early on. Over time, new characters can be unlocked and used, in turn releasing new items to be unlocked through use of said characters. A unique achievement system leads to an innovative way of implementing completion to the game, as when an achievement is completed, a new item is unlocked to be discovered in game.

It will require every ounce of attention, time management skills, and luck. The difficulty ramps up over 40 minutes, and after that the game is laughing in your face, throwing everything it has at you like Freddy Krueger doing his one joke stand-up comedy routine, and his one joke is having you drown in a vat of snakes and bugs.\n\nBut the reason for my recommendation is at the point of the game where you're so buffed that no monster, big or small, can touch you. The part where kills gain you extra maximum hit points, and you're taking out four of these ♥♥♥♥ers every few seconds or so. The part where you have so many drones you're raining bullets into faces and watching them all go down, firing frantically while the horde is held back by your absolute, undeniable firepower, being showered in gold, health, and experience, knowing that you cannot be stopped and that their absolute best is going to have a hell of time killing you.\n\nAnd then you get ganked by some horrible little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you didn't see in time to deal with.\n\nIf you're not that much into Roguelike-type stuff, maybe skip this and come back to it later on.

It's unique characteristic is that difficulty isn't tied with level progression, as the game allways becomes harder and harder as the clock ticks away.\n\nArt, soundtrack, hard difficulty and different playstyles for different characters are it's strong points. Perhaps you will enjoy being swarmed and being forced into kiting tactics rather than brute force or skill upgrades (there aren't any), perhaps not.\n\nDespite not being story-rich, the world is memorable, the soundtrack is one of the better ones (and one of my favourites), and the pace and progression is spot on for my tastes.\n\nThe game is highly recommended if you're on the fence. If you dislike platrofmers or rage easily, probably avoid. Looking at the game on Twitch and YouTube, it's not easy to see what's so good about it. I had a *very* poor opinion about it, until i was convinced to try it. Immediately, my opinion went from utter dislike to surprised enjoyment.\n\nYou kinda have to love games where you gotta move fast and react to chaotic swarms of enemies and projectiles rather than stalk things quietly and plan ahead (for most characters anyway, Sniper does it sligthly differently). If you enjoy very difficult, breakneck speed gameplay then this will satisfy you thoroughly. The game is very easy to play and very hard to beat. Beating it feels tremendously satisfying.\n\nThe style, soundtrack and overall mood is somber rather than guts n' gore or slapstick. Like a weeping willow with a minigun, things get very violent but rather than being a hero or villian you're forced to fight as hard as you can just to survive.\n\nThe story is largely ambiguous, told in bits and pieces of journal entries or item logs. Whatever the reasons brought you there, it's going to end in a lot of death.\n\nItems are numerous, humorous and range between very mildly useful and overpowered. With items and command artifacts it's possible to tweak gameplay difficulty and make the game nigh-on-impossible to beat. If you're into that sort of thing.\n\nThe main gimmick of increasing difficulty as time goes by is executed very well and it's possible to win either by taking your sweet time and hoping to acquire as many useful doodads as possible or by rushing as fast as possible in order to clear later stages before the difficulty increases. It will make the first few attempts pretty hard but the game stays challenging longer that way. And as i've mentioned before, beating the game is an acomplishment!\n\nI've also mentioned the soundtrack being excellent but i'll mention it again!\n\nThere's some bugs. The game engine was upgraded post release and as a results some old bugs were fixed and some new ones appeared. The level generation can occasionaly bug out and co-op play can suffer from port-forwarding problems or disconnects. Other bugs are pretty rare and minor but they get patched out occasionally.\n\nAs a single player game Risk of Rain is almost a classic. As for multiplayer, well it's got a few problems and it's difficult to get it working until the bugs get fixed.","August 22, 2015","true","88.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

(mostly from getting too cocky when I have certain power-ups. :P) It's genuinely a hard game and I love it for that reason. The music is a selling point as well, sort of a rocky/electronic/ambient thing.\n\nThe difficulty scales just right for me, it gives me a good 2-5 minutes to do what i need to do in each level, so I can do either a quick pick-up-and-play run or i could do a good 40 min run to (rarely) get to the last level. Plus this game actually makes me want to collect every single power-up and monster log just for the little storys you get alone.\n\nThe only gripe I have with it is how complicated it is to connect with friends, when I want to connect with a friend I have to use a program called Evolve[evolvehq.com] that gives me and my friends a temp IP address, and even that fails some of the time.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid game that rates highly on my games list.","March 31, 2014","true","22.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferencmato/recommended/248820/","ferencmato","Pickles Giggles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferencmato/","275 products in account","At first, I was sceptical about this game. Indie 2D platformer with roguelike elements and pixel artsy visuals - how original is that, am I right? Still, I was kind of drawn to it.\nI got it as a gift from a stranger some time ago, and it was basically just sitting in my library ever since. Recently, I've been looking for something new to play and I've decided to give it a go. I learned very quickly how wrong I was…\n\n\nWhat is it about?\nStorywise, there's not that much to talk about:  Your character somehow survived the explosion of the space cargo ship. You crash landed on an unknown planet, which is bad enough by itself. Unfortunately, the whole place is swarming with all sorts of strange, deadly creatures. As you can probably imagine, none of them is what you'd call "friendly". You need to get out of this place…\n\nLeaving the planet is not as easy as one would hope. There are 6 (somewhat) randomly generated levels, each harder than the previous one. To get to the next level, you need to find a teleporter, activate it and then survive another 90 seconds, during which you fight the boss and waves of enemies. Only after killing everything, you can progress to the next level and repeat the same procedure.\nOther than your 4 basic combat skills, there are many different passive and active items to be found  These can be bought with the money you've earned by slaughtering monsters native inhabitants. However, it takes a while to get those $$$, which is unlucky, because the game is getting tougher over time. That means you have to decide pretty soon whether to grind for a few minutes and become as OP as you possibly can, or just try to speedrun the whole thing with only a few items. It's your call.\n\n\nWhat's good...\nEven with multiple attacks, controls and the whole combat model is really easy to get into. I've played with a controller most of the time, but it's absolutely fine with keyboard too.  It feels nice and fluid. Chaining attacks is fun, but it also requires a bit of a planning to pull off, so it's not just downright brainless button mashing. Also, difficulty increasing over time is a nice little mechanic and takes the game to a whole new level (heh). Same goes for collecting and stacking different items. All in all, the game actually requires quite a bit of tactical thinking.\n\nNext, I love the amount of content they've put into the game. There are about 100 items total and it takes a while to unlock and find all of them. More than that, you can unlock 11 additional characters. All of them have their unique skill set, allowing for different playstyles, meaning very different experience. Thanks to this, and randomly generated levels, the replayability of this game is insane.\nBesides, there are diary logs, describing some of the monsters you've encountered, and also "shipping details" for all of the items you've found so far. These add more little details to the story and enviroment, making you more invested into the universe you still know nothing about. Moreover, the atmosphere is just wonderful. Pixel art style is spot on and the soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou is just stellar (I'm done with puns now, I promise…).\n\nWhile it can start to get a little bit ridiculous after 20 minutes or so, I enjoy that. Not being able to see your character through the mix of enemies, health bars, damage values, effects and particles may be stressfull for some…but making it out alive is veeery satisfying, cathartic even. When thing go wrong (and the frequently do), I always feel like I know exactly how I screwed up, despite all of the chaos and randomness. Don't get me wrong, this game is REALLY HARD and will kill you again and again and again… but it still feels more fair than any other rogue-like I've played.\nOn the other hand, beating this game for the first time was one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I think I've ever had…\n\n\nWhat's not so good…\nThere are only a few little problems, but I feel like I should mention them anyway.\nFirst, the Steam overlay doesn't work at all with this game, which surprised me. That means no screenshots on Steam. Obviously, you can still use the OS's built-in print screen function, but it's a shame that you can't share it with you friends that easily and basically support the game more. Not sure what to think about that. Also, full controller support and Big Picture mode support would be swell.\nThat's pretty much it, nothing else to complain about.\n\n\nConclusion.\nRisk of Rain is rock hard, yet fair and fun to play. It combines several interesting mechanics in a very cool way, and the amount of content and replayability is amazing. The world of RoR is eerie, strange and beautiful at the same time, thanks to it's visual style and great soundtrack.\nIf you're a fan of rogue-likes, or hard games in general, you should just buy this game right away - it is definitely worth of both your time and your money. If you are short-tempered however, I would advice you to reconsider.","April 7, 2015","true","45.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

However, when you factor in the 16 possible combinations of the first 4 levels, the myriad of variations each level has, and how item drops are completely random that gives passive buffs to the player, plus the inclusion of 9 unlockable classes and 1 default class.. You have this roguelike platformer where no 2 play throughs are the same.\n\nThe gameplay is really fantastic, lending itself to real frantic action with tons of tough enemies and impossible bosses. It has a unique mechanic of cranking the difficulty up as time passes, and so it becomes a wild race against time to get as many items as possible in as little time as possible to keep you alive. There are over 100 items to pick up with more than a handful of them being deployable during the game for added effects.\n\nIt's not just the gameplay that is great, the 2-D spritework and the forlorn-sounding music complete the experience of playing this game. It looks great, it plays great, there is a lot of depth and challenge to be had. I would say that this is one of the best Rogue-likes to come out in 2013.

There are around a hundred items which are randomized, the interesting part being that they all work with each other and can stack with each other. This means that every playthrough, your style of fighting and main source of damage will change dramatically.\n\nOne time you'll be rapid-firing a machine gun which has a chance of doing double damage, inflicting bleeding and fires faster the lower health you have - the next you'll be staying at a distance, firing the same machine gun on the same character but with mortars and rockets being launched at the same time, causing enemies to combust and leave pools of fire on the floor.\n\nThe huge combination of items as well as the unlockables and large variety of characters and playstyles mean that not only is this game fun, but has a hell of a load of replay value. The main downsides for me are the lack in truly randomized levels (the layout itself stays the same, but the loot locations change) and the lag at later levels.\n\nA definite recommendation nonetheless, and a great game.","December 30, 2013","true","12.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It's supposed to be synchronized between the players, but with pings of around 300 ms, monsters started desyncing and, due to that, completing stages was only doable by the host, as I could not kill 'all enemies on screen'.\n\nThe content that the game offers is worth it's price, but I would have definitely paid more money if it offered double the content. It's got 100 items and 7 classes so far, which isn't bad, but gets a little repetitive after a few hours. The key to making the game fresh is, instead, placed on the many classes you can unlock and play with. The soundtrack offers great tunes that motivate the players to keep going. It's very cinematic and complements the scenery in a really classy and well done way.\n\nNeedless to say, this is much better enjoyed with friends, as all class combos offer great variety in strategies. The game's difficulty is much better adjusted for teamed up players, as different classes complement each other against certain monsters.\n\nNo need to mention that this game is really hard. REALLY hard. Beating this on Hard difficulty is not a feat for the faint of heart.\n\n6/10","December 31, 2013","true","34.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

While superficially similar to games like Binding of Isaac or other action roguelikes, there's really nothing that FEELS like Risk of Rain out there.\n\nThe essentials: you are a survivor from the crash-landing of the UES Contact Light, which was hauling extremely questionable cargo when it was downed over an incredibly hostile alien planet. Play as one of eight different classes, pillage the wreckage that rained down from the sky as the ship crashed, and try your hardest to survive long enough to reach the Contact Light and get off the planet. This is a shallow summary, of course.\n\nThe basic gameplay is an action platformer reminiscent of Bionic Commando, but there's no grappling hook shenanigans: instead, every class has a completely different style of play, with four abilities. Every class has one basic attack, one crowd control power, one ability that improves mobility, and one very powerful attack that leaves them somewhat vulnerable but is tactically crucial. These range from the basic Commando, who is a classical sidescroller Dude With Gun What Shoots Mans, to stuff like HAN-D, a hulking janitor bot who punches things and launches drones to attack and heal himself, to the Bandit, a space cowboy assassin with a lever-action rifle and dynamite, to even weirder and kookier options. Every class is completely unique compared to every other class, and there's a ton of variety to be found for any kind of playstyle you like.\n\nBeyond your class, you've got one slot for an active item and a functionally unlimited number of slots for passive items that improve your abilities or stats in some way. If you've played Binding of Isaac, you basically know how this works. Where a lot of the fun comes in is the sheer variety of items you can find and the way they interact with your character, as well as the intriguing and funny backstories behind each item, displayed in the game's Item Log, which is presented as the shipping manifest of the Contact Light. As you collect items, you'll eventually build a picture of exactly what the Contact Light was up to. The game similarly features monster logs for stuff you kill, which are random pickups.\n\nDifficulty in the game is complex; while the game has three difficulty settings(Drizzle, Rainstorm, and Monsoon), it isn't immediately obvious what these do. What they primarily affect is the game's scaling difficulty, which is based on your in-game timer. As the difficulty meter ramps up, enemies get progressively tougher, more aggressive, and more numerous; at the max end, it can even spawn bosses as regular enemies.\n\nIn each level, you're looking for a teleporter which will take you to the next stage; activating it summons a boss, and once you've killed it and all remaining enemies in the stage, you can progress. You can either beeline for the teleporter straight off, or stay around for a while and try to slaughter enemies to earn money and experience with which to buy items and become stronger, but waiting TOO long becomes a risky gamble due to the ever-increasing difficulty. Too fast, and you'll be underpowered; too slow, and your foes will be insurmountable. Skilled play thus becomes a balancing act between progression and increasing your capabilities.\n\nThe game is simple to pick up and learn, but is staggeringly replayable, and this is helped by the beautiful aesthetic and wonderful music. For ten bucks, you are getting a LOT of game, and it's certainly worth your time to stand out in the rain for a while.","March 3, 2014","true","16.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You will have to fight enemies and earn money to purchase upgrades and progress to the upper levels. The game's difficulty scales with the time, adding an incentive for players to use their time efficiently. In each individual "run" - or single playthrough - there are six levels, each with harder monsters and more expensive upgrades. Boss monsters appear at the end of a level or sometimes in the middle of a level if the difficulty is high enough. Risk of Rain will require several playthroughs to fully explore what all of the upgrades do and how to play each of the survivors.\n\nRead more for an in-depth look at Risk of Rain.\n\nThis game's story is largely told in the beginning and end cutscenes, as well as in monster logs - information about enemies that randomly drop when you defeat one. Some of the descriptions in the item log also hint to background story events.\n\nRisk of Rain [ROR] is a 2D pixelated platformer game. The art is excellent and each of the characters and enemies are unique. Each of the survivors has 4 unique abilities that are fairly balanced. Each one has their own forte and shortcomings, so experiment a little with all of them to figure out which one suits you. You only start with one character unlocked (the Commando), so you'll have to unlock the rest.\n\nItems/upgrades are found in chests which unlock for a price. Monsters drop money and experience when killed, and both can also be found in small amounts within canisters. There are four ranks of upgrades - white (common), green (uncommon), red (rare) and orange (use item). The first three ranks are items that are either passive or triggered by events, while the fourth are items activated by the player. All use items and skills (except for the primary basic skill) have cooldowns. There is also an artifact hidden within each level. Artifacts do nothing in the run they are acquired in, but after that playthrough a new artifact's effect can be chosen in the character selection screen. Each one adds a different game element (only elites spawn, 500% damage but 10% health, etc).\n\nROR also has an incredible soundtrack, merging genres from electronic to trance to ambient to rock. Each level has its own exclusive background music, giving it a unique atmosphere. The sound effects are very believable and yet are alien enough to convince you that the planet you are on cannot be Earth.\n\nRisk of Rain is an incredible platformer with solid gameplay mechanics, excellent replay value and an addicting arcade-style structure. Online multiplayer is also available. A solid game all-around. Definitely worth purchasing if you enjoy a good thrill.","January 26, 2015","true","60.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

When playing for the first time, even the easiest difficulty feels like a big hit. Great and forwardening soundtrack that always keeps you on your toes. High replayability in combination with great difficulty and items to unlock that won't let your fingers off the game for a good amount of time.\n\nThough, after the first finished gameplay you realize it could use a view more levels to lengthen the game. For the current price the game does not really satisfy in regard of content.\nThe game is not optimized well in terms of performance and visualization on the screen. When things are getting too cluttered, a low- to mid-end PC often hangs on a view strings and slows down to a unplayable state. The final level always lagged on my older notebook, regardless of hosted or being the host and the monsters on the screen.\nA huge let-down is the handling of lag when playing in multiplayer. The game often ended up being unplayble as the player with a high ping did not synchronize with the host, not being able to teleport to the next level.\n\nAll in all I would recommend Risk of Rain when it is on sale, otherwise it feels like it is missing content and polishing.","December 31, 2013","true","85.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The catch is that the more time you spend alive, the more numerous and difficult the enemies become, so there is a trade-off between mining levels for items and speedrunning. Any fan of Spelunky will appreciate its extraplanetary equivalent, but there are a few less-than-desirable traits which should be of note.\n\nUnlike Spelunky, Risk of Rain has a diverse set of classes from whom to choose. However, I believe they could be placed on a bit more equal footing. Where many games of all kinds, from TF2 to The Binding of Isaac, make sure that different classes are well balanced, Risk of Rain has certain characters which are clearly far worse than the others (no matter what one's individual strategy may be). Contrary to the achievement name, you will find the Robot Janitor, and you will regret it. Classes like the Enforcer or the Robot Janitor are simply too slow to stand any chance against mid-game swarms of enemies. They are, indeed, powerful classes, but the level difficulty ramps up too quickly to avoid the swarms (whether you choose to search for items or speedjogataleisurelypace). If you do not quickly find several of the same very specific items, you will die more frustrated than entertained. The other "weaker" classes have some method of teleporting or defense-rolling to safety, but there is no health pool large enough to save you from enemies too numerous to kill and too fast for you to run away. That said, playing as the other classes yields a roguelike challenge with items and enemies worth the time and money.\n\nOverall, Risk of Rain is a good game with uniquely designed aesthetics and gameplay mechanics. This sci-fi roguelike poses a challenge which, though sometimes frustrating, still maintains considerable replay value.\n8.5/10","September 21, 2014","true","62.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In the game you control one of twelve total characters, marooned on a strange and unknown planet, each with their own abilities, stats and uses. You traverse the multiple levels attempting to get back to the ship you crashed on the planet with, facing enemies and bosses of increasing strength and gathering the lost cargo of the ship to make you more powerful along the way.\n\nThis is a 2D action platformer, where, as previously stated, you attempt to get to the final level and escape the planet you were marooned on. As you play, you unlock more characters and items in a similar way to The Binding of Isaac where as you play and make progress, you gain new items and characters. The characters are all different and have different abilities across the board. The default character, The Commando, have a high fire rate and deals moderate damage, but high knockback, making him a good crowd control character. On another end The Sniper has an ability that guarantees critical hits on stronger enemies, making him much better for bosses or singular targets.\n\nThe goal of each level is to reach a teleporter to, you guessed it, teleport to the next level after fighting a 90 second long wave of enemies and killing all the enemies before you can progress. There's a unique difficulty mechanic in this game, it becomes more difficult the longer you play, what I mean by that the seconds that you spend in each level increases the difficulty, adding a sort of risk reward system when you have to decide if you should farm the level more or check for items that you missed,\n\nOverall, Risk of Rain is a high quality game that I'd recommend to people who are looking for a challenge or a good game to play with friends, did I mention this was Co-Op? Yeah, it is. Risk of Rain gets a 9/10 from me.","August 9, 2014","true","69.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","3"

The story is about a guy destroying a ship and killing everyone but the Commando. Your job is to find a teleporter while killing randomly spawned enemies. Btw dont even think of camping cause the more you camp the harder the game is. Difficulity goes from Very Easy to HAHAHAHA trust me you do not wanna be in HAHAHAHA cause that is the hardest video game you will ever experience.\nAs you progress through the game, you get money for chests and items, items to help progress through the game and also they stack so make sure any item you see just GRAB IT cause it is important.\nThe Multiplayer is OMG AMAZING. You can play with up to 10 players. The money and XP is shared so if you kill an enemy, the money and XP scatters to the players.\nAlso the music is just amazing. Thank you Chris Christodoulou for that awesome music. The game may be in around 8-16 bit but the music is just gorgeous.\ni give this game 9 out of 10 due to the difficult and the lag if theres too many players or if theirs too many enemies cause if your in a area with no enemies, your FPS would br around 60 which is good.","May 3, 2014","true","24.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's an incredibly difficult game, but that tends to come with the rogue-like territory. The characters all feel fun to play as, and it's always incredibly satisfying picking up yet another new upgrade to add onto your already extensive pile of upgrades.

Then try again and get a little further. Then try once more and get not quite as far as the first. There's a lot of elements to this game that are random. The biggest of which is the item drops. The quality of the items, the rarity and quantity are randomly generated. That not only makes Risk of Rain feel random, but also makes it challenging. For some reason I'll get further and last longer with worse items. Makes me think I'm on my game! The randomness can feel frustrating or unfair at times, but it adds major replayability.\n\nThere are a lot of pros and cons, but just know... Risk of Rain is a fantastic game. There are different characters you play as and unlock. You also unlock droppable items through achievements and tasks. The characters all play incredibly different. I believe there's 10 different options. In the game you'll spend the majority of your time dodging and platforming - trying to trick the AI into not being able to get to you. The difficulty also ramps up for every 5 minutes you play (up to 60mins). So ideally you'll clear the level, get all the items and kill the boss all in one sweep. That's usually not the case, since you have to kill enemies to gain money to unlock a chest.\n\nA major flaw I've seen is the multiplayer. It has huge potential for a fun multiplayer experience but they missed it just a bit. You can play with 4 players in one screen. That screen does not get split. You must travel CLOSELY with your companions. I'm uncertain if online multiplayer allows you to split off. That's not the flaw, however. The upgrades are how you get more powerful. Only one person can pick up the upgrade, and upgrades are not shared. So you can either choose to split the upgrades between you and your buddy/ies and all be weaker, or have one person pick up every upgrade and have the others feel useless. This can also add some tactical measures to the game as well. If you know the upgrades well enough, you can give the ideal upgrades to the different classes and maybe be stronger as a unit then you would be with one godinator and 3 scrubby nubbies.\n\nI'm tempted to say this game is ALMOST too challenging, but it wouldn't feel like an accomplishment if it were easy to make it to the end, now would it? I've played maybe 30-40 runs and completed once or twice. Damn it felt good when I beat it.\n\nPlay this game. Beat it with every class.

At least at first, as I don't feel challenged at all anymore, even in Monsoon (Sadly!)\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n-The Multiplayer doesn't work very well, extremely prone to crashes mid-game and unable to join back\n\n-As much as I love the artifacts, you'll only ever use 3 of them after a while (Glass, Command and Sacrifice mostly.)\n\nWhat I think this game needs:\n\n-A randomize button. Press it, and it chooses you a character and artifacts randomly! Since every Artifact and every Character radically change the way you'll play, that'd make Risk of Rain a game where you truly need to adapt to what you have and surely increase the playtime I have on it of another 20 hours minimum.\n\n-Less lag on multiplayer. I am unable to do runs of over 40 mins because of crashes on my friends' PCs, and if they fixed just the crashes I would play this forever.\n\n-Nerfing Command would be a good idea, because at this point it completely kills the RDM of the game. Maybe make it you can choose but you get a LOT less items on the run, so you get those you want but not as much?\n\n\nIt's sad they don't update this game anymore, because it isn't optimized correctly, at least for multiplayer. One of the last updates greatly reduced lag on the Risk of Rain level which I am extremely grateful for, but crashes on Multiplayer kills the online fun..\n\nStill, even though I said some bad of this game, it remains an extremely good single player game with tons of replayability (140 of those hours were on solo..) and it is able to make you change your playstyle really often.

I highly recommend doing that, since the multiplayer aspect is great, but it does require you hosting and using your public IP address.\n\nRisk of Rain is a rogue-like side-scrolling shooter (originally released in 2013) where you can choose from multiple characters (which act like classes) for different play-styles that will run great on any computer.* It is a perma-death game, but like most rogue-likes there are some things that you are able to save certain things. I have spent 40 hours on this game, and by now I can tell you that I had a great time throughout all of my runs. You also come across chests which cost money to open, and give you an item. These items spruce up the gameplay a LOT, and add a ton of super fun things your character does. There are three difficulties you can choose from before starting a game (in order of easy to hard): Drizzle, Rainstorm, and Monsoon. There are also artifacts you can find in the game that can add gameplay boosts, such as having enemies drop bombs that can harm you whenever they die, and having you be able to choose your item when a chest drops one.\n\nThe gameplay consists of killing lots of enemies until you find the teleporter which is in random areas around the map. Once you find the teleporter, the boss will spawn and you have 90 seconds until you can teleport away (teleporting away requires you to kill every enemy on the map). Once you kill everything and activate the teleporter, you are whisked away to another location. This continues for five more levels until on the sixth level, you are on UES Contact Light, which is where the final boss Providence is located. Once you beat that boss, you beat the game, but don’t worry, there’s a ton of replay value.\n\nOne of the best aspects that I’m very grateful Hoopo Games added is the ability for you to host a Multiplayer game and play with your friends. There aren’t any servers hosted by anyone else (as far as I know), so you have to host your own server, which includes you port-forwarding and using your PUBLIC IP address. Luckily, all my friends know each other personally and are fine with sharing IP addresses. We have a ton of fun playing this together.\n\nPros:\n-Multiplayer support\n-Cheap\n-High replay value\n-Good controller support\n-Great gameplay\n-Fun things to spruce up the gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Confusing story (at least for me), but it’s the gameplay that matters for me on this game.\n-Having to use public IP address for servers (not a problem for me yet).\n-Crashes occasionally (about 5 times in my 40 hours of gameplay, not too bad).\n\nI rate this game 10/10, because there aren’t a lot of devastating cons and it met all my needs for a great game, even in 2016.\n\nSide note: I've almost played this more than I've played Fallout 4...","March 26","true","50.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

I couldn't help myself and just went on playing with the purpose to reach 100% achievements, however stopped at 97% with few monster logs missing. It has an enormous replay value, which sadly ends once you unlock some artifacts (Kin, Glass, Command, Sacrifice) and items (infusion, chargefield generator).\n\nOnce you get them, starting on a lemurian map, grabbing early infusion and stacking on barbed wire soon makes you and unstoppable ball of death and after 30 minutes of farming you always beat monsoon regardless of the character choice.\nThat kinda killed the fun for me, as I couldn't just go back to the regular style of playing after trying that. All in all though, the point where you can possibly roll through the maps every time you play start after you've played for some 20 hours or so already (if you are fresh new to the game), probably less if you've played it before or read the wikis a lot.\n\nBefore that I still had lots of fun, trying to survive, which is not always that simple. If you play it the regular way, your every gameplay will be different, some items will make cleaning the levels a breeze, while other sets will push you to change your strategy in order to prevent your painful death. The graphics might be a little archaic, but I think it synergizes well with the game overall and it actually looks pretty neat. The background music is prefect as for a space survival game, it fits well with the atmosphere of being on another planet, alone. Another great thing about the game are the monster logs, which I found very well written and enjoyable to collect and read.\n\nRoR doesn't escape few minor bugs like item containers (the always come in three and you can buy only one item) sometimes spawn all in the same place, so you can't even really see what you might get or some items not working properly sometimes (looking at you Imp Overlord's tentacle), but it's nothing gamebreaking. For me, the most annoying issue was the FPS rate in later stages of the game, I mean, I don't really have a gaming rig (yet), but for a game that doesn't involve any too complex graphics, I think it should run smoother rather than lowering my details to the minimum and the FPS rate dropping to 20-30 (which also affects the clock, so the in-game time is not the same a real life time).\n\nStill, for such a low price, this game is well-worth buying. It costs like 3 euro, when there's a discount running, which is a funny price for the fun I've had, especially with the AAA games having 5-10 hours of gameplay with no replay value at the cost of 40 euros. I recommend it to everyone who likes games with roguelike elements and is a completionist freak like me.","September 11, 2014","true","40.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Make sure you've got your umbrella and in case you happen to be on a cargo ship that gets destroyed and you crash land on an alien planet, don't forget to bring a ukulele and an alien head to help combat the aliens that may try to murder you.\n\nChance of Precipitation is a 2D platformer that gets mad at you for being in the shower for too long. As time goes on, the difficulty rises until a transparent shadow emerges from the steam with a pot on it's head, challenging you.  actual enemy  .it creates a fun sense of urgency to quickly find the teleporter to the next level and efficiently deal with every enemy so you can proceed, but not so quickly that you barely have any money for the bus fare. It uses an item system somewhat similar to Binding of Isaac: you find and collect stackable passives and can carry one usable item with a cooldown. They do not however, affect your physical appearance (with the exception of one.)\n\none of the things I really love about this game is that despite how terrible your RNG may be, your items (with a few exceptions) do not directly affect your actual damage, which increases as you level up, so your deaths will 80% of the time be your fault.\n\nThe one thing there is for me to really complain about is the characters. a good chunk of them are very interesting and cool, but you'll be spending a lot of the game kiting enemies as you'll usually die pretty quickly otherwise. As such, it makes the Huntress definitively the best as she is the only one who'll automatically target enemies near her for all of her skills. Melee characters also tend to have a very hard time because of this, despite being probably the most fun to use. While the game is still very enjoyable, it is a bit of a crucial design flaw for a game like this.\n\nin short, Chance of Precipitation is a girlfriend who is absolutely terrible to you but is way too cool to not hang around.

It's easy to jump into, controls are simple, lots of hidden unlockables for replayability, and the gameplay is straightforward. The straightforward gameplay has its pro's and con's. Personally, I think that it limits the game somewhat, because it does seem more repetitive than say, Binding of Isaac or Spelunky. The randomized levels don't make much of an impact here than it does in Spelunky. And the loose-nature of RPG-styled combat makes battles less intense compared to Binding of Isaac. But the lack of complexity, IMO, is what makes multiplayer possible and enjoyable.

Very relaxing while you're blasting away on the enemies that come.\n\nStory 10/10\n\nIt provides discoverable items that the specific mobs drop, that give you more intell on them (Including a background story) not to mention that the games main story is simplistic yet fitting perfectly.\n\nGameplay 10/10\nNow here's the fun, you collect coins by killing enemies, theres plenty of rewards in the form of chests, statues and more spread over each level, finding the chests, collecting the loot, getting more powerful as your enemies get more powerful each level, and each 5? minutes you spent in game.\n\nThis balances out perfectly the random odds of the items you gain. You can find "use" items that are very powerful, and go on cooldown after each use. Not to mention that all the power-up's (Besides use items) stack, so getting a bonus twice is nothing less than still a great reward (as the bonus will be enhanced.)\n\nI've picked up many games for this amount of money, plenty even over. This is just pixelated greatness and 10$ is WAY below the actual worth in fun you'll have if this is your type of game.\n\nYou can play it Co-op to upto 4 players, there's plenty different characters with unique abilities, secret findables and more to keep you occupied and coming back for more.\n\nDefinitely near or even on top of my recommendations.\n\nCheck the videos, see if this game is to your liking. If you like what you see, you're definitely going to LOVE what you get.\n\nFrom the creators of such goodness as Starbound, yet another VERY SUCCESFUL title.

It's easy to jump into, controls are simple, lots of hidden unlockables for replayability, and the gameplay is straightforward. The straightforward gameplay has its pro's and con's. Personally, I think that it limits the game somewhat, because it does seem more repetitive than say, Binding of Isaac or Spelunky. The randomized levels don't make much of an impact here than it does in Spelunky. And the loose-nature of RPG-styled combat makes battles less intense compared to Binding of Isaac. But the lack of complexity, IMO, is what makes multiplayer possible and enjoyable.

There are ten different heroes to play and they all have a unique skillset of four abilities. As a consequence, they all have a different playstyle, sometimes -dramatically- different.\nCombine this with a hundred different powerups to collect which appear at random and a small amount of variability in the level progression and stage layouts and you've got a hard as nails game that's never exactly the same twice.\nA single playthrough is a mere six stages, but even after you reach the point where you can win reliably, there's still challenge to be had, with an extra hard Monsoon difficulty mode and a new game plus option that lets you skip the final stage and replay the game over and over, retaining your character but facing off against larger and larger hordes of tougher and tougher foes.\nFew gaming experiences I've had are as satisfying as starting out weak and fragile, but overcoming overwhelming odds to achieve nearly godlike levels of power. With enough items, you may find yourself able to stand uncaring in the middle of hordes of monsters, leap abitrarily high into the sky, or unleash piercing, explosive attacks that knock groups of enemies clean off the screen.\nThis game is addictive, challenging, and extremely replayable, and I highly recommend it.","January 23, 2014","true","162.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/recommended/248820/","cannonesshannah","Katie's Hannah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/","979 products in account","Risk of Rain is definetely a hard one to review for me.  I find it a rather frustrating game that I continually return to playing and I was left having a hard think on why that is, both in terms of the frustration and in terms of why I keep returning.  Risk of Rain has been something of a mixed bag for me.\n\nSomeone looking at my other reviews - Teleglitch or SotS: The Pit - will see I'm no stranger to roguelike games and I quite enjoy them.  I don't really find them usually too frustrating and they haven't really seen any ragequits.  But Risk of Rain has.  Why is that?  I think it basically comes down to the fact that the feeling I get from the game is very much that the random nature of the game is such that if you do not get favourable drops pretty much fairly all the way through you're going to have a very difficult time even at the normal difficulty.  This wouldn't be so bad if the easy difficulty didn't penalise you for using it - your progression is not saved when you use the easy mode.  I'm of two minds when it comes to that difficulty.  One one hand, the difficulty is one of the definete genre staples of roguelikes.  On the other hand, other roguelikes I've enjoyed had an element of definete skill to them whereby even with a poor random seed you can still get by if you are really, really good.  Risk of Rain definetely feels exceptionally unforgiving in that random aspect.  It's something to bear in mind.  If you're looking for a more "rogue light" experience, Risk of Rain is definetely not what you are looking for, but if you enjoy a challenge, I think you will probably find that attractive in Risk of Rain.  It definetely has that in spades.\n\nSpeaking of difficulty, one of the more unique mechanics in Risk of Rain is the idea that the difficulty level increases across incremental levels as time elapses, whether or not you are active.  This creates a paltiple tension and as much as I have my difficulty with the random aspect, this particular aspect is something I really like about the game.  There is no rest break in this game, you have to keep going or something will murder you horribly, and that much definetely is a very roguelike thought indeed.  I quite enjoy that part of it.\n\nThe biggest strength of the game lies in it's audiovisual style however.  It has a very strong and fairly unique aesthetic that is well executed.  I'm actually kind of sad there isn't a soundtrack DLC as I'd buy it in a heartbeat: the soundtrack is utterly captivating and very well composed.  The game itself uses a very "retro" pixel art style, but pulls it off well, and the art in some of the monster logs available through the menu are very well-done examples of that particular style.  I just adore the aesthetic of the game, and when I sit and consider why I keep coming back, its to delve a little more into that world and the lore that surrounds it.  It's strange for a roguelike but I get a definete feeling of exploration in learning the environment and it's lore.\n\nAll in all, it's a very difficult game so if you're looking for a more casual experience, I couldn't reccomend it, but if you enjoy a challenge to your game, Risk of Rain does indeed offer a challenging and carefully-crafted experience that you would be very silly to at least not give a spin.\n\n[edit]: Fixed some typographical errors.","February 12, 2014","true","6.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Day after day we find ourselves experiencing new things, yet we still long for something. We feel as if we need an escape from the world in which we find ourselves. This need has given rise to a plethora of movies, books, and games, among many other things, to distract us from our life. It is with this same feeling that I decided to embark upon such a distraction.\n\nLeaping forth to immerse myself in a new world, I was excited at the new possibilities it offered. Although my character's landing had been rough, I was optimistic for the future. What never before seen wonders would I uncover. What beauty that had yet to grace the sight of man would I be blessed to lay my eyes upon? The imagination of man falls short in the face reality and I knew not what I would come across. The wonderous awe I felt as my feet touched the ground of this new world would be torn brutally away. Naïvety soon wears out its welcome, as did I apparently.\n\nWhat followed was a quick and horrifying descent into madness. As I gazed upon the flora of this new world, never having seen comparable beauty in Earth's, I was soon greeted with the fauna. A surprising variety of creatures met me with death in their minds. I fought as hard as I could, killing many, but the longer I lingered, the more arrived and the more dangerous they were. An endless flood of enemies assailed me, precious little time was I safe.\n\nWorse still were the monsters who were so much greater than the others. Towering beasts of great strength and tenacity hunted me down. Desperation seeped deep into my bones and I began to savour those rare moments when the creatures of a new area had yet to discover my presence.I would watch as the many different beings who so oft fell dead before me lived. They went about their bussiness, so similar to the animals of Earth.\n\nRealization struck me, I was the alien in this world, the terrifying invader. I represented an outside force that, if I was being totally honest, would in all likelyhood destroy this world's life for greed.\n\nIt allowed me to take a step back and gain a new perspective on my existence. 'My' fight for survival, humanity's fight for survival, comes at a great cost. What right did I have to murder so many, just so I could continue on? In what way can I justify so many lives lost for my own? The same can be said for us as a whole. We slaughter our way through countless animals without a second thought. We do not visit new land, we destory it. We do not give to this world, we take from it.\n\nIt's an eye-opening experience in which everyone should partake. This game is no mere escape, it is a wake up call.\n\nScared and confused by my new outlook on life, I was in a daze. My only consolation whilst traversing this desolate virtual land... it never rained.","June 30, 2014","true","100.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Froppirino/recommended/248820/","Froppirino","Fropps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Froppirino/","142 products in account","Hello, I am here to tell you about Risk of rain, a sidescrolly, itemy roguelite that has a trailer so confusing and uninformative that I wouldn't have picked it up if I hadn't heard about it before.\n\n-Important Sidenote! I am not critiquing the game, merely reviewing it.-\n\nIn Risk of Rain you are a traveler on a space courier ship that's attacked by a mysterious... thing. Causing you to fall to the ground of an unfamiliar alien planet, where you fight for your life. Picking up items dropped by the ship and ultimately finding your way back to the fallen ship to fight the menace and leave the planet.\nWhen you first go into the game, you walk around the landscape and monsters will start to spawn, though slowly at first. You will then kill them, as they threaten your life, picking up their gold, which you then use to buy items out of the chests that have fallen down with you. When you first start playing, you will only have a small selection of items to find, but as you play more, you will unlock more, and these are persistant across lives. The difficulty increases over time, making monsters tougher and making them spawn more often, until you either die, or finish the game.\n\nSo, is it good?\nHell yes. It definitely is fun to play. It has a nice growth curve towards the start, both with unlocking items through "achievements" -eg, kill 20 golems in one life, or activate the third teleporter without taking damage- and through increases in player skill, both with the game and with it's myriad of classes. Classes that, are unlocked through slightly bigger and harder versions of the achievements for items. -eg, kill 3 bosses or activate 40 drones in total.-\n\nIt also has nice gameplay, that although slow towards the start of a game, gets progressively harder and faster paced as time goes on.\n\nExpect to die in your first few runs.\n\nThe items are fun to use, with most of them providing unique effects that are not just simple stat bonuses. It's really refreshing. Having good items for your class is another challenge the game throws at you, as they all have different movesets with cooldowns as you use them, and different items will complement different classes much more than others. But of course, this all depends on what strategy you are using.\n\nThough there are complaints to be had.\nRisk of rain has a nasty thing called randomness, this can be good or bad, depending on your viewpoint. Some runs will be really easy, since you got good items from the -mostly- random chests, but others can be sabotaged by bad drops. Although I find that this can be overcome by player skill (and slightly balanced by the stat leveling system the game employs) this is a quirk of the genre that  can be good or bad. It makes the good runs stand out, certainly, but putting it the time to get there, at least initally, can be a slog. (I personally like it... now).\n\nThe game is also short, but very high quality. Being a completionist, I have put a disproportionate amount of hours in. -More if you count the fact that I did most of the early game offline. It's not a big immersive rpg. It's a short sharp game you will play for, a week maybe, and will have you utterly hooked. it provides a unique blend of elements that makes it stand out and provide an experience like no other. You can keep coming back to it, sure, but it's not going to change much, and you will get bored of it eventually.\nUPDATE.\nRecently, however, there was an update the added artifacts that can change the game significantly, this can make the round you are playing unique to you and anyone else playing with you. This adds a new level of replayability to the game, making it last for much longer.\n\nI hope I've provided some insight.","July 7, 2014","true","84.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/herverylowness/recommended/248820/","herverylowness","Altehäus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/herverylowness/","78 products in account","A rather short game with a big replayability value that proves how the smallest and most unlikely teams can make great pieces of art. The premise is rather simple, and not something we haven't seen before, but the way it's put in practice just makes Risk of Rain unique and outstanding. In first hand, we have the different characters, each one with his or her unique playstyle, gimmicks and skills, which makes is satisfying to struggle with an initial character that may not be ideal for you for some time, as you get such a high payback for it. Some of these characters are pretty straightforward, packing what you'd expect from them, while others shoot away from expectations, and surprisingly don't lose sense. Another strong point to be seen is the variety in the items, and how they are not linear. You see items like the Soldier's Syringe, the Warbanner and the Lens-Maker's Glasses in the most common tier, while being some of the most useful, and things that have debatable quality, such as the Shattering Justice, in the rarest tier. Apart from your usual items, we have Relics, which are obtained in unique challenges exclusive to each particular level in the game, and can be turned on or off after being acquired. These special items can drastically change gameplay, strong examples being the Glass relic, that amps up your damage to 500% (or five times) the original, but scales your starting health to 10% of the original, the Honor relic, that makes every enemy in the game (including bosses) spawn as an elite monster, which means it will have an extra gimmick to kill you, and the Spirit relic, that multiplies your speed when your health is lower, the game-changing aspect of this one being that it applies to every creature on the world, not only you. To end the "item talk", we have the only clear and "static" disadvantage of the game: it is highly gear dependant, which means you might not go far if you don't have a good range of items to choose from (which is basically what you start to work with), and even if said variety is existant, the standard luck-based system of looting doesn't help a lot.\nI could still go miles on talking about variety among the creatures, the everlasting advantages of co-op mode, the art style, the monster and item logs, but I feel like you, my dear reader, are getting tired of such a long review, and want to start your adventure as soon as possible, so I can only encourage you. Scavenge through your wallet, purse, pockets, bank account and house, blow the dust off your credit card or dollar bills, and buy this game.

Instead, I'll tell you about what will happen after you obtain this game and try it out:\n\nFirst, you'll be a little overwhelmed by the enemies and quickly advancing difficulty.  But, you'll figure out a good strategy or two for taking on some enemies, and feel pretty good about it.  "Perhaps this wasn't a bad purchase," you'll think.\n\nSecond, you'll begin to realize that several hours have passed and you have started over a few times.  You have two full rows of items at your disposal and you're going back through the first level for the second time.  You'll wonder if perhaps you should go to bed.\n\nThird and finally, you'll experience a burning desire to play this game when you have some free time.  You'll listen to the soundtrack regularly because it's so delicious, and you'll see little item or teleporter outlines when you close your eyes at night.  You'll be able to identify and name all the items you see by icon alone, in no time.\n\nIt's really a wonderful game!

Risk of Rain is a rogue-like, action platformer game with a bunch of content. Risk of Rain has over 40 monsters (or enemies) including the elite ones, with 15 bosses that will constantly keep spawning and attacking you. The spawn rate of enemies will increase as you continue your adventure in the foreign planet. The game itself is really challenging and difficult to play, and that's good to see as I like to challenge myself in rogue-like games.\n\nMultiplayer is great. I had a lot of fun with one of my friend who apparently broke the game by continously getting an item that decreases the cooldown of use items by 25% everytime he saw a red chest.\n\nSingleplayer is a bit meh to me.

He is best known as a prominent member of the "Invincibles", a team that went undefeated on their tour of England in 1948. In his teens, Morris became the first player ever to score two centuries on his first-class debut. After serving in the Australian Army during the Second World War, he made his Test debut against England. He scored a century in his third match and two more hundreds in the following Test, becoming only the second Australian to score a hundred in each innings of an Ashes Test. By 1950, he was Australia's vice-captain and had amassed nine Test centuries with a batting average over 65. Thereafter his form declined, and his career ended after his first wife became terminally ill in 1955. In later life, Morris served as a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground for over twenty years. Selected in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century in 2000 and inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001, he is widely regarded as one of Australia's most successful left-handed batsmen.","January 19","true","50.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","62","8","13","12","0"

More than a few times, I’ve missed a simple jump because the game couldn’t process that I was hitting move and spacebar simultaneously.\nMultiplayer is more fun than single player, however…\nMultiplayer has a number of bugs: 1) If you die, sometimes you can’t switch between spectating the remaining players 2) The boss timer tends to display different information to each player, e.g. I’ll see the timer has finished while the other player sees 15 seconds, etc 3) A fairly cryptic error message will sometimes appear in the upper left corner of the screen, then disappear.\nThe multiplayer lobby needs a few tweaks, such as leaving the IP visible, letting players re-select characters, showing character names/abilities, etc.\nOnce you reach higher difficulty levels and/or the final stage, the game lags horribly due to the amount of items on-screen at once.\nA game running on Steam in 2013 requiring a direct IP connection makes no sense.\nThis game does not like alt-tabbing.\nSometimes the game just crashes for no apparent reason.\nThe Writing:\n\nMost roguelikes skimp on the writing, but Risk of Rain actually has a fair amount of quality writing contained in the item log.

Unfortunately it doesn't give very polished impression... some things in the game are carried out in ways that are sub-par. I initially tried playing the game on Arch Linux, but the x360 controller didn't work with the game (whereas it worked fine for example with Hammerwatch), so I changed to Windows. All games were played online.\n\nThe biggest problem was that the Last boss teleporter crashed the game every time it was tried, which is game breaking. How can a game have so critical bug? In a roguelike it's utterly ridiculous that the game rewards the player always with error screen instead of last boss after 30 min of gameplay... no report option but just plaintext error. In a game where you start from the beginning after death, this is very frustrating.\n\nThe game also had problems starting online coop which crashed the game twice. Before that the online game had some connection issues and the other player couldn't connect.\n\nAlso, for some unexplainable reason, the enemies and other player started warping on one occasion. The ping is shown corner of the screen and it didn't really explain these warping issues. In this occasion the game played surprisingly well but things appeared somewhere where they shouldn't have.\n\nI'd really like to give this game a chance. Its gameplay is quite nice and fun but it appears to be broken. There may or may not be a fix for the gamebreaker, but it shouldn't be gamer's job to first keep googling for hours a solutions and after that keep playing half an hour just to see if the first one (or tenth one) solution had actually worked.\n\nEDIT: After ten more hours of gameplay and six more random crashes. The game keeps crashing quite often, about one time in a hour and a half. This means that every third run or so crashes.\nBesides that the coop has that last boss can't be fought because of that teleport bug.\n\nAlso during these hours of gameplay the biggest problem of the game concept was revealed. The game has quite many items to unlock, but unlocking them doesn't really give awarding feeling. The biggest accomplishment of Binding of Isaac was that gamer experienced the unlockables awarding. In Isaac each unlockable gave a chance to get further in the game and completing the game gave new levels. In Risk of Rain the game can be completed with basic layout, so there isn't really need for cool new items. Also the waves that get more difficult as the time of a run proceeds don't differ from each other enough. I tought that after the waves "I see you" and "I'm coming for you" something unbeatable would have appeared. Instead just more enemies come and some low level boss enemies that can be easily farmed for powerups. The game doesn't award for speed in runs, instead it encourages the opposite, which really doesn't suit this game.","November 22, 2014","false","57.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

In RoR, success is found through item and character synergy. At the beginning you sometimes have a chance to buy items that will shore up your character's weaknesses. For example, Commando (your first character) has excellent attack speed, but needs damage. Mortars and missiles are priority here.\n\nThere's always going to be a mob on your trail. Kiting (attacking, running, attacking) is essential to staying alive. Your drones and items will help you out, but at some point it's up to you to not jump into that death pit and insta-die. If you're flailing hard, try the Community Guides (link below).\n\nEvery round is different thanks to the plethora of items and characters. There's a lot to try here.

It turned out to be not only one of my best sale purchases this holiday season, but one of the better games I have played in a long time.\n\nIt is essentially a hardcore roguelike styled action platformer, shortform and with huge amounts of replayability due to colectables, quite a wealth of characters with 4 different abilities each and a plethora of items to unlock and pick up.\n\n- Story: There is not much of an initial story except for the opening cinematic, but as you unlock more characters and monster logs through the game more of the story is filled in. At no point was there a moment where I had to stop and look at the story so far, as it is an action platformer ultimately rather than some long winded fantasy sci-fi epic, but the way the devs have filled in bits of story via logs and such is quite well done.\n\n- Sound: Music wise, the developers have chosen quite apt styles of music for the different stages, while creating an atmosphere that suits the gameplay and themes quite well. The sound effects are something else though; each enemy has an attacking noise, as do the weapons and powerups you accrue, and eventually you get to know the sounds of each. This doesn't sound like much, but in a game such as this these sounds are both well fitting and incredibly useful to keep track of enemies in your vicinity.\n\n- Gameplay: I think of this as a side scrolling version of Binding of Isaac meets Super House of Dead Ninjas, with an added layer (or 40) of difficulty.Each playthrough is different and items per each run can make or break it for you, as they can in BoI. However, the mechanics and verticality are far more similar to SHoDN, with things being frantic on the screen most of the time. All of this combined makes the game quite fun to play through, and I highly recommend it.\n\nAs always, it is perhaps best to watch videos of the game before buying, and it is rather difficult alone. If you have a couple of friends to play with it is an absolute blast, and after you unlock a few things playing solo is also quite doable. As of yet I have not gotten to/beat the final stage/boss, but even after I have I will keep playing to unlock more items that become available. Definitely a recommended purchase.\n\nThis was my first reviews as well, hope it helps someone out there!","December 28, 2013","true","27.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I don't have much time played on it, but given the nature of the game and how there's so much to collect, I'll definitely be playing it for a while.\n\nEvery item seems overpowered, but there's so many that you really can't stick to one overall play style every time you play, which adds to the fun because instead of the game adapting to your play style, you have to adapt your play style to what you're given.\n\nThere's also a wide variety of enemies with many different levels of difficulty, and also overwhelm you at times, which add to the overall feel of the game by giving it a sense of urgency.\n\nTo restate the thesis, I definitely recommend this, and it's worth the money spent.","May 17, 2014","true","90.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's also these weird black rocks that make the game play all weirdly, so use them at your own risk (HEHEH, GEDDIT!?).\n\nthe gameplay consists of running around trying to not get killed.

I only make recommendations when I whole heartedly believe the game is not good, but truely spectacular in my mind.  This game encapsulates the rougelike genre and seemlessly moulds it together with a platformer.  It adds its own spice by introducing more powerups to find in your runs as you achieve different feats.  And if you are careful enough, you might spot some of the secrets that hide some of the characters and items.  Its only downfall is the lack of variety in the level set up as it is not truely random.  But the first 25 hours of this game, I have had the time of my life, and I look forward to playing more of it.

Late game gets redonk with the sheer amount of monsters on the map, usually the last map, causing severe drops in the games speed (note:nothing to do with my RIG, simply the vast amount of crap happening at once).  Annoying that muliplayer is a hassel to do since you have to do port forwarding (which is a plague) unless you get lazy and just use Hamachi, etc.\n\nWhilst it says randomly generated it's more a the maps are always the same (The randomly selected maps are the 2nd and 3rd map which is swapped with a whole 2 other maps) with MINOR variations and the only REAL RNG is the random crate placement.\n\nMultiplayer is fun but it seems that if you don't stay together you lose or one person gets all the items (they don't  compensate for more people by adding more items so it's already a Negative for multiplayer)  and carries the others since they insta die on the next level.","December 29, 2013","true","51.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It starts off slow, but you feel panicked to rush through as fast as possible so that you can keep ahead of the difficulty timer. When it gets to the final difficulty and you're heading into the final stage, you somehow feel both absurdly powerful and hopelessly outgunned against the enemies at the same time. I kept feeling like there was no possible way that the game was going to step itself up further, but it just kept throwing stuff at me. A very challenging game, and that's just what I expected going into it. Now to play on monsoon difficulty...\n\nGreat replayability too with the different classes.

I only make recommendations when I whole heartedly believe the game is not good, but truely spectacular in my mind.  This game encapsulates the rougelike genre and seemlessly moulds it together with a platformer.  It adds its own spice by introducing more powerups to find in your runs as you achieve different feats.  And if you are careful enough, you might spot some of the secrets that hide some of the characters and items.  Its only downfall is the lack of variety in the level set up as it is not truely random.  But the first 25 hours of this game, I have had the time of my life, and I look forward to playing more of it.  Hopefully they expand this game further to have more levels and more level variation and it will be perfect.","November 19, 2013","true","48.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The plot is you and some other people are space mailmen, trying to deliver ♥♥♥♥ when your ship starts exploding and crash lands on a planet, and then you have to get back to it before the space monsters surely eat your flesh.\n\nThe game has three main difficulties, ranging from cup of water to Atlantic Ocean, and has a difficulty timer in game that starts at 2ez, and then just laughs at you for the highest one for some reason.\n\nThere are 9 other persons who you can play as if you do some stuff, with my favorite being Handy, the robot janitor (I like him because he has a hammer). There's also these weird black rocks that make the game play all weirdly, so use them at your own risk (HEHEH, GEDDIT!?).\n\nthe gameplay consists of running around trying to not get killed. When you kill the monsters, they drop money and glowy balls, which make your life numbers bigger. To survive however, you need to use the money to lockpick boxes and buy stuff from vending machines. you can play this by yourself, or with other people sitting next you (player cap 4) or with people from the internets (up to 10 with settings adjustments! WOW!).\n\nall in all, I give this hard fun game 2 potatoes out of 3 apples.\n\nEdit: Scorpion from Mortal Kombat and the Swedish Chef are now charaters due to an update. +1/2 Potato for this.","June 27, 2014","true","33.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

For the 10 dollars that it's worth it's definitely worth it. It's simple but fun. There's a wide variety of items, enemies (including bosses), and stages. It's the type of game you can pick up and play for hours and not get bored, and even manage to find more things. I don't have much time played on it, but given the nature of the game and how there's so much to collect, I'll definitely be playing it for a while.\n\nEvery item seems overpowered, but there's so many that you really can't stick to one overall play style every time you play, which adds to the fun because instead of the game adapting to your play style, you have to adapt your play style to what you're given.\n\nThere's also a wide variety of enemies with many different levels of difficulty, and also overwhelm you at times, which add to the overall feel of the game by giving it a sense of urgency.\n\nTo restate the thesis, I definitely recommend this, and it's worth the money spent.","May 17, 2014","true","90.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In RoR, success is found through item and character synergy. At the beginning you sometimes have a chance to buy items that will shore up your character's weaknesses. For example, Commando (your first character) has excellent attack speed, but needs damage. Mortars and missiles are priority here.\n\nThere's always going to be a mob on your trail. Kiting (attacking, running, attacking) is essential to staying alive. Your drones and items will help you out, but at some point it's up to you to not jump into that death pit and insta-die.

It turned out to be not only one of my best sale purchases this holiday season, but one of the better games I have played in a long time.\n\nIt is essentially a hardcore roguelike styled action platformer, shortform and with huge amounts of replayability due to colectables, quite a wealth of characters with 4 different abilities each and a plethora of items to unlock and pick up.\n\n- Story: There is not much of an initial story except for the opening cinematic, but as you unlock more characters and monster logs through the game more of the story is filled in. At no point was there a moment where I had to stop and look at the story so far, as it is an action platformer ultimately rather than some long winded fantasy sci-fi epic, but the way the devs have filled in bits of story via logs and such is quite well done.\n\n- Sound: Music wise, the developers have chosen quite apt styles of music for the different stages, while creating an atmosphere that suits the gameplay and themes quite well. The sound effects are something else though; each enemy has an attacking noise, as do the weapons and powerups you accrue, and eventually you get to know the sounds of each. This doesn't sound like much, but in a game such as this these sounds are both well fitting and incredibly useful to keep track of enemies in your vicinity.\n\n- Gameplay: I think of this as a side scrolling version of Binding of Isaac meets Super House of Dead Ninjas, with an added layer (or 40) of difficulty.Each playthrough is different and items per each run can make or break it for you, as they can in BoI. However, the mechanics and verticality are far more similar to SHoDN, with things being frantic on the screen most of the time. All of this combined makes the game quite fun to play through, and I highly recommend it.\n\nAs always, it is perhaps best to watch videos of the game before buying, and it is rather difficult alone. If you have a couple of friends to play with it is an absolute blast, and after you unlock a few things playing solo is also quite doable. As of yet I have not gotten to/beat the final stage/boss, but even after I have I will keep playing to unlock more items that become available. Definitely a recommended purchase.\n\nThis was my first reviews as well, hope it helps someone out there!","December 28, 2013","true","27.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Insanely fun and addicting. The soundtrack of this game is submersive and ominous, but the game gets really intense listening to your own music. Sound effects are retro but not annoying, you can almost feel the explosions hitting your enemies and the sounds of bullets hitting their flesh.\nI have never enjoyed the idea of perma-death but this game has opened up that genre to me, it does a great job of making you feel like ever playable charcter is different, and the speed at which the difficulty, as well as your own strength, on each playthrough provides for excellent fast-action that is really addicting. And on top of everything its online an local multiplayer!\nThe atmosphere and small shreds of story we get from this game are excellent builing blocks for a game that question the human vs. nature relationship, this is built from assumptions incredibly sparce dialogue, and the tormented thoughts of a lone survivor adrift a hostile planet. While these intriguing elements of story and atmosphere are present, they are not so "in-your-face," rather, appearing in monster and item descriptions, these small attention to detail is immersive, interesting and not at all distracting of the core game. A perfect balance of incredibly strong replay value, and a good incentive to keep playing to unlock this worlds story, which we end up caring a lot about.\nThe graffics are very charming and pleasing to the eye. No matter what of the 10 characters you play, your are always a small  pile of about 30 pixels. Not to say that they were lazy at all, no. Rather, the simplicty and smallness of your charcter is great to look at and really makes your feel small in a world of things trying to kill you. The monsters are the same way, though they are larger than you(some very much so), they feel like true inhabitants of the world youve landed in. Bosses feel and look powerful and their deaths are satisfying. Graphically the world around you looks amazing, like the remnants of an ancient alien civilization. They really put you in concern with your characters need to survive.\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10. The reason not a perfect score is the only could use some tweaking. The difficulty, graphics, upgrades, items, collectables and secrets keep me coming back for more everytime I sit down to my computer. Never, have I put so many hours so quickly into a game that was inly $10.

The longer you play the harder the game gets. It's simple, but rewarding. You start off with one character to choose from and start unlocking others with each having their own unique skills. As you play through the game you unlock new items.\n\nRisk of Rain is pure genuine fun without all the excess bloat that games seem to forget these days. Especially triple A games that seem to pad out too much story and excess content that drain the enjoyment that could be had. Risk of Rain is different and it emphasizes gameplay amongst all else.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.

I only make recommendations when I whole heartedly believe the game is not good, but truely spectacular in my mind.  This game encapsulates the rougelike genre and seemlessly moulds it together with a platformer.  It adds its own spice by introducing more powerups to find in your runs as you achieve different feats.  And if you are careful enough, you might spot some of the secrets that hide some of the characters and items.  Its only downfall is the lack of variety in the level set up as it is not truely random.  But the first 25 hours of this game, I have had the time of my life, and I look forward to playing more of it.

The ten different characters each have a different set of attacks allowing for different play styles, from long range single target damage to melee crowd control. Different items augment your character in a variety of way, from healing with each hit, firing missiles on hitting an enemy or raining meteorites down when you use it. Artifacts also alter the way the game plays once unlocked, allowing for extra challenge.\n\nThe goal of each level is simple, find the teleporter, activate it, hold out against the spawning enemies and boss/es and get to the next level until the finale. As time goes by the difficulty increases, meaning enemies get tougher and bosses will start spawning randomly, this forces you to balance between collecting items but risk increasing the difficulty or go as fast as you can while losing out on items and not being as powerful. Combat-wise the game is simple but is not easy, careful use and timing of your abilities is key to survivng against the alien hordes.\n\nThe game has solo play, local co-op or online co-op (The online lacks UPnP and so requires port forwarding).

Although it has slight problems with game life and multiplayer, I suggest buying this game. Now we shall go onto the specifics of the game.\n\nRisk of Rain is a Rogue-Like platformer that has 10 classes; each of these classes has 4 different skill sets allowing for a very diverse game experience. There are 11 different areas in the game, each with a few different stage layouts. Not every session the player plays will actually consist of all 11 areas. Most sessions, players will only see 5 stages. Each stage is laid out very well that isn't confusing nor unfair for combat.\n\nThe combat of the game is very strong. It also can remain diverse because of the different classes. Each class possses a different skill set that can be used for different situation. The Commando, being the starting class, is the most all around class in the game. The Sniper, being an unlocked class, is the most situational class in the whole game being that it is a boss killer.\n\nLike FTL and Rogue Legacy, the game can get tiring faster than wanted. I played about 3 hours on the day of purchase because of its solid gameplay. As the week continued, the desire to play the game and the amount of time spent started to dwindle. I found that after the intial high of the game, I really didn't have a huge desire to play the game. That doesn't mean that Risk of Rain is a bad game. The multiplayer can easily increase the life of the game\n\nThis brings up another problem with Risk of Rain. The multiplayer is not very simple to set up. You have to go through and get your IP and open ports up on your computer. The hardcore computer gamer should be capable of doing this with no problem, but that doesn't mean that the process is not annoying. Dying in multiplayer can also make it a very boring game if playing with someone who is much better. There is no way to revive your friends; all you can do is beat the level or die. All they can do is watch and hope you die.\n\nTo conclude the review, Risk of Rain is an enjoyable Rogue-Like action focused platformer with a great soundtrack. Although it has slight problems with game life and multiplayer, I suggest buying this game. Now we shall go onto the specifics of the game.","November 28, 2013","true","41.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is one of the best platformers I've played. It has the pixel art feel that seems kind of more normal these days in indie games, but I like that, who cares, but the thing I really like about the art is when you get the monster logs. The way they do the art on there is the only time I have seen that style of art.\n\nThe game's idea and gameplay is amazing. You are stuck on a planet because Providence (Guy from the opening cutscene) crashes your ship and fills it with monsters. You land on a planet as one of the ship's cargo... things. You then fight off strange monsters to open chests, give money to shrines, and kill imps to get items, which all have their unique visual effect and ablility. The cool thing about these items is that all the items have their own logs, showing where they came from, what the note on it was, etc. This is because like I previously stated (Did I?) you were on a cargo ship.\n\nEvery world usually has unique monsters and sometimes a different map format than the previous one. You need to loot all the things there as fast as possible, activate the teleporter, fend off hordes and hordes of enemies and maybe a boss or 7 (The Holy Temple at the highest level... SO MANY TOXIC BEASTS AND IMP OVERLORDS!) until the timer runs out, then you kill all the enemies yadda yadda yadda... Then you go to the next level.\n\nThe combat system is one of my favourites since you have to master the characters or just be skilled at them, because smashing buttons will not work, hence the first time I played enforcer. You may think melee characters are terrible, but once you unlock the acrid you will regret saying that.","February 1, 2014","true","69.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I just keep going in to getrekt, and anyone who plays this will know of the addiction I speak of. Risk of Rekt's goal is very simple- Get to the final stage, defeat the final boss. On the way there, you have to fight your way through a good number of varied enemies and bosses that spawn from activating the teleporter and, on harder difficulties, that spawn randomly. The method is to do it all as quick as possible, to keep the difficulty bar from mocking you further(eventually reaching HAHAHAHAHA difficulty).\nEach character class has 4 skills that are specific to the type of character, and there are 8 classes in all so far, so it won't be too difficult to find one to be attuned to. Along with the class skills, there are also items that help some characters more than others. By going through the levels and collecting items, the player becomes stronger. With the game still updating every now and then, there are even more enemies, classes, and items to be introduced. There's never a dull moment while playing Risk of Rekt, even when you die, you jump right back in and start wreaking havoc. It's a game that's easily addicting and even more fun when you play with friends, and I'd reccomend this to anyone(whether you have friends or not) because it's definitely worth a go. Or, you know, 500 gos. However long it takes you to beat the final boss! But even after you beat the boss, you're going to want to play again and again to get better.","August 26, 2014","true","69.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It IS a roguelike, so you will be more at ease if you're familiar with The Binding of Isaac and even more so with Rogue Legacy, but with three difficulty settings it will suit you whatever your skill with these games.\nIs it hard? Incredibly. Is it fair? Absolutely. Is it rewarding? Immensely. Is it fun? You bet your ♥♥♥ it is.\nAll of this already makes it a must-play, but the fact that it has 4 player coop, local or online, is so awesome.

This game is basically a run-and-gun with rogue-like elements. With 12 classes , each with 4 unique abilities , you wont get bord so fast. And dont forget the items , which are a lot too. The game may have some bugs , which is not nice , but you can get over them. And i almost forgot , everything is randomly generated , so no 2 runs would be the same.\n\nNow , regarding classes , my favorite part of the game. You start at first with only 1 basic class. Yep , only 1 class out of 12. You must do certain things to unlock classes , like killing bosses , reaching a certain level or in some cases even finding the other characters hidden in the game's levels. No 2 classes are the same , each one of them has an unique playstyle and set of abilities . For example , there is the sniper who excels at firing precise shots , being very good for dealing with bosses , but not so good for dealing with hordes of enemies. Or the enforcer , a tank who can stun enemies , or block all frontal damage with his shield.\n\nNow the items. Oh boy , there are lots of items . Some give you a shield , some make your attacks explode . There are activable items who can summon ghosts to fight for you , shoot a lot of missles and so on.\n\nThe enemies in this game are well done , every stage bringing some new type of enemy . And also , you can buy drones to help you out in your journey . These drones fly near you and shoot the bad guys or heal you.\n\nAnd the soundtrack ? Pure genius.\n\nTL;DR Get this game if you like rogue like shooters with lots of classes and items , and most of all , good replay value.","November 30, 2014","true","26.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

What I particulary enjoyed, was;\n-The characters. Even though I cannot play some of them, such as Sniper or Engineer, they were quite fun to unlock.\n-The simple objectives. Although the game is so simple, of which all you need to do is find the teleporter and eradicate any remaining enemies, you know how to play Commando, itemwise and abilitywise.\n-The replayability. No matter how many different characters you have unlocked, or how many times you've beaten the game, you always can play it much more than you thought. It isn't something where you have to mod it to be able to play it again (Yes, I'm talking about you, Minecraft.), instead, it teaches you more about the characters you play, and what items are best for  them.\n-The soundtrack. This, made me so immersed into the game, from what I had seen in TotalBiscuit's review of RoR, really stood out. I turn my volume to 0%, and my Music to 100% in the game options. I just fight on, using every artifact or a few, listening to the soundtrack.\n-The final fight. This can get annoying if you don't set up a strategy, much like the game Spiral Knights, when you are fighting the Royal Jelly on the 5-2 mission 'The Soverign Slime', you will get destroyed. I set up a tactic, as I had read about Providence after getting destroyed on my fight with him.\nOverall, everything is well-made.","July 12, 2014","true","129.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All in all, I highly suggest you play this as it is perfectly built and fun every time you pick it up.","December 20, 2014","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Stellar. The soundtrack is absolutely perfect, as well - it gives each level that much more depth along with a sense of loneliness.

With a variety of characters to unlock, randomized levels, numerous bosses and an assortment of items to pick up, the game is packed with hours upon hours of Rogue-lite fun. Something I found quite interesting in this game was the ability to stack multiple of the same items, to the point where you're zapping everything in sight by jamming on your Ukulele or have enough regen to shrug off most any attack, should luck be on your side. While Risk of Rain is a blast to play solo, the inclusion of a multiplayer mode going up to 4 players (Local or Online) gives this game just that much more staying power. Playing solo or with friends, this is a must buy if you are a fan of Rogue-lite games with just a hint of platforming.","January 7, 2014","true","75.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the game is hard, it never feels so due to monsters having an unfair advantage, however several artifacts can also be unlocked to alter gameplay so it either ends up easier, or more difficult.\n\nAdditionally three difficulty levels can be selected, so you can cater the challenge to your own tastes.\n\nThe gist of the game is to fight off a neverending wave of enemies, that become progressively more difficult the longer the game is in play, over the course of 6 levels. Each level is completed by first finding a teleporter, then fighting off against a boss, and surviving a time limit wherein serveral enemies will spawn to attack the player, after successfully doing so the player will be transported to the next level.\n\nA lot of work went into the design of the game, from the easy to navigate menu's, to the environments available, and amount of enemies you can come across, to the games ostensibly simple story that reveals more depth as you dig into the lore.\n\nAlong with the many secrets, hidden areas, and unlockables to discover.\n\nMultiplayer is a blast, but unfortunately very difficult to set up with others...\n\nRisk of rain is fun on all levels, and an excellent addition to the indie genre, that should keep one entertained for hours!\nScore: 4.5/5\n-0.5 due to the difficulty in setting up a multiplayer game.\n\nSincerely,\n- Celx Requin\n\nWebsite: www.cancer-cinema.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/cancercinema\nSteam Game Page: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=241984931","July 19, 2015","true","91.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have not yet tested playing online but from what i have seen, people with bad internet will not lose game experience, it is still as playable.\n\nCombat: I have found myself mashing all the buttons when i first played it, with a German keyboard that changes the Z and Y i almost thought the first skill didnt work until i noticed it, after i found out that there is an first skill i got a lot more strategic, you cannot only stand in one place and PEI PEI PEI, you need take advantage of the enviroment since birds that can fly through walls will eventually come get you.\nEvery character has a different skill list, i found every character that i have unlocked so far very unique. The starting class, the Commando is still my favourite and i love to play as a strategical shooter.\n\nUnlockables: This game has an HUGE ammount of different and unique items, 10 classes and it will take a while to 100% this game.\nEvery class has a different way to be unlocked, some may be a challenge and others you will just eventually unlock them.\nWhat has surprised me the most about this game is how much items there is, and what every one of them do.\nI have no idea how many items this game has but everytime i find a new one it doesnt a bit like the others, one of them does something special and unique, you can also hold all of the items you find through the game!\nThere are also "Use items" that serve like a 5th skill, you can only hold one and i find it hard to choose which one is coming with me, mostly the ones that the bosses drop because they are the strongest and help alot.\n\nHow does it play: As the trailer says, the game gets harder as you play, it gets harder with the difficulty you choose and its already hard by default. This game is a real challenge, but the challenge is what makes it fun. While you play the game the game count for how many time you have been playing it, it will be filling a bar at the top right corner of the screen and it can get pretty stressful, you always get scared of exploring the world because you will be losing time and fears that the game is getting harder, its like someone is following you.\nApparentally the game has many different levels for the stages, there is a variation of teleporter locations and levels that you will get, the map may never be the same.\n\n\ntl;dr: you a patient and skillful player? get it, you new to video games and not patient? dont get it\n\nvery funny thanks guys\ni will be playing this game\nright\nnow","January 3, 2014","true","34.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

Difficult to earn, each one providing a deeper level of play, often a double-edge sword perk, but some are just downright cruel.\n\n\n9 Artifact Run? "ded" -Risk of Rain\n10 Artifact Run? "rekt" -Risk of Rain\n\nPossible to do a run in under 40 minutes? Sure. You'll probably farm some gold on each level, so you can access all the shrines, chests and other available objects, but otherwise, should be beaten in under 90 minutes per average game.\n\nThe game will taunt you.\nThe game will laugh at your misery.\nBut the game is rewarding, there is a small learning curve, but it's the difficulty curve that is your greatest challenge.\n\n\nOverall 9.5/10; minor bugs and stuff that doesn't really matter, it's a really good game.\nSoundtrack 9/10; extremely fitting for the game, decent playlist for listening to while not playing the game.\n\n\n*Some users have reported some difficulties with Multiplayer, but isn't that normal with anything online?\n\n\n\n10/10 would get "rekt" again.","March 14, 2015","true","57.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The soundtrack is sublime, a mix of electronic synths with glockenspiels and metallaphones with time signatures to fry your brains it is worth opening Spotify or Youtube (go to the composer Chris Christodoulou's channel) and listen to the whole thing.

While the game is hard, it never feels so due to monsters having an unfair advantage, however several artifacts can also be unlocked to alter gameplay so it either ends up easier, or more difficult.\n\nAdditionally three difficulty levels can be selected, so you can cater the challenge to your own tastes.\n\nThe gist of the game is to fight off a neverending wave of enemies, that become progressively more difficult the longer the game is in play, over the course of 6 levels. Each level is completed by first finding a teleporter, then fighting off against a boss, and surviving a time limit wherein serveral enemies will spawn to attack the player, after successfully doing so the player will be transported to the next level.\n\nA lot of work went into the design of the game, from the easy to navigate menu's, to the environments available, and amount of enemies you can come across, to the games ostensibly simple story that reveals more depth as you dig into the lore.\n\nAlong with the many secrets, hidden areas, and unlockables to discover.\n\nMultiplayer is a blast, but unfortunately very difficult to set up with others...\n\nRisk of rain is fun on all levels, and an excellent addition to the indie genre, that should keep one entertained for hours!\nScore: 4.5/5\n-0.5 due to the difficulty in setting up a multiplayer game.\n\nSincerely,\n- Celx Requin\n\nWebsite: www.cancer-cinema.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/cancercinema\nSteam Game Page: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=241984931","July 19, 2015","true","91.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After a while, however, I came back to it, and started to unlock more and more characters, which is when I realised that the sense of satisfaction as you climb through levels and acquire a veritable armory of items is very rewarding.\n\nI feel that, skill aside, some characters are simply more effective than others, and that some of the in-game unlockable achievements are unrealistic (Activating the third teleporter without being hurt once just seems unrealistic for a more casual player), but those are the only negatives I can think of. The art style is perhaps left to preference, but I very much enjoy the simplicity and elegance in well-done pixel art, and find it very appealing.\n\nEach character feels unique and plays unique, the simplicity of four skills combined with varying attack and movement speed lending to a completely different playstyle for every character, something that I feel is often lost in current games. The items, some more useful than others, all feel like they have distinct bonuses and different, from the Guardian Hearts to the Jetpacks and the Wicked Rings, and finding a higher-tier item feels rewarding and can immediately change your playstyle.\n\nThe levels are, perhaps, not that high in variety, but due to the adaptation in playstyle from each character and the multitude of items, they always feel like they play different. However, once all the characters have been unlocked, and all (or most of) the items, repitition kicks in: but this could be said for any game, so I won't count this as a negative.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable time waster, allowing for both quick games and intense playthroughs, the mechanics are rewarding, and utilising only four skills per character, they all feel and play wildly different. Definitely recommended.","January 14, 2014","true","43.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have not yet tested playing online but from what i have seen, people with bad internet will not lose game experience, it is still as playable.\n\nCombat: I have found myself mashing all the buttons when i first played it, with a German keyboard that changes the Z and Y i almost thought the first skill didnt work until i noticed it, after i found out that there is an first skill i got a lot more strategic, you cannot only stand in one place and PEI PEI PEI, you need take advantage of the enviroment since birds that can fly through walls will eventually come get you.\nEvery character has a different skill list, i found every character that i have unlocked so far very unique. The starting class, the Commando is still my favourite and i love to play as a strategical shooter.\n\nUnlockables: This game has an HUGE ammount of different and unique items, 10 classes and it will take a while to 100% this game.\nEvery class has a different way to be unlocked, some may be a challenge and others you will just eventually unlock them.\nWhat has surprised me the most about this game is how much items there is, and what every one of them do.\nI have no idea how many items this game has but everytime i find a new one it doesnt a bit like the others, one of them does something special and unique, you can also hold all of the items you find through the game!\nThere are also "Use items" that serve like a 5th skill, you can only hold one and i find it hard to choose which one is coming with me, mostly the ones that the bosses drop because they are the strongest and help alot.\n\nHow does it play: As the trailer says, the game gets harder as you play, it gets harder with the difficulty you choose and its already hard by default. This game is a real challenge, but the challenge is what makes it fun. While you play the game the game count for how many time you have been playing it, it will be filling a bar at the top right corner of the screen and it can get pretty stressful, you always get scared of exploring the world because you will be losing time and fears that the game is getting harder, its like someone is following you.\nApparentally the game has many different levels for the stages, there is a variation of teleporter locations and levels that you will get, the map may never be the same.\n\n\ntl;dr: you a patient and skillful player? get it, you new to video games and not patient? dont get it\n\nvery funny thanks guys\ni will be playing this game\nright\nnow","January 3, 2014","true","34.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrenchfarm/recommended/248820/","wrenchfarm","Wrenchfarm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrenchfarm/","205 products in account","Harkening back to the day of the 8 and 16-bit platformer, Risk of Rain is deliberately inscrutable roguelike that relishes in its masochistic difficulty curve. Skipping any kind of pretence of a tutorial or any of the modern hand-holding gamers have come to expect, your little spaceman is dropped into a random, semi-procedurally generated map with little more than the vague instructions to "Find the Teleporter" to go on. Vicious monsters begin to spawn almost immediately and it doesn't take long to realize how hopelessly outmatched your little guy is, and it only gets worse from there.\n\nThe central conceit of Risk of Rain, and what makes it stand out from the pack of other recently released roguelikes, is the timer. A large clock in the top right of the screen mercilessly ticks upwards with every second. The longer you take, the more frequently the monsters spawn, and the stronger they grow. Every five minutes, a bell marks the passing into a higher level of difficulty, starting at "Very Easy" and eventually tipping into the realm of "impossible" and "HAHAHAHAHA." If you haven't been efficient at collecting upgrades and items, you may soon find yourself surrounded on all sides by monsters you don't have a prayer of defeating. The mission quickly turns from "how far can I get?" to "how long can I survive!?"\n\nThere is an incredible sense of urgency packed into every second of RoR because of that timer. Every choice and action becomes crucial. What way to you explore after spawning? Should you stay in this area and try to clear out enough monsters to earn enough gold to open another chest, or just book it while you can? While you only take miniscule fall damage, you'll be cursing yourself each time a missed jump forces you to reclimb a ladder, burning precious seconds.\n\nAs you might be familiar from games like The Binding of Isaac, RoR features a plethora of items to be found. Most of these apply some kind of passive bonus to the character like a better chance for critical hits, a bonus to regenerating health, or a small demon in a jar that might cause enemies to explode when you kill them, you know, standard stuff. Others occupy the fifth slot in your inventory to be activated at will, usually with a tremendous cool down period before you can use it again. These are your typical screen-clearing bombs and the like, as well as more esoteric (and deceptively powerful) options like a Repair Kit that will instantly fix up any drones on the screen.\n\nAnd much like Isaac, part of the fun of the game is watching the strange transformation these items will wreak upon your tiny spaceman. You start as a small blip of pixels, a little speck that seems hopelessly outmatched by the towering wildlife and monstrous aliens. But all of that can change with a few lucky item drops. Wreathed in barbed wire, encircled by a fleet of drones, randomly spewing missiles, summoning poltergeists, and leaving a trail of fire at your boots, you may not even recognize your little explorer by the time you reach the final stage.\n\nThere are additional character classes to unlock. While you start with only the standard Commando in his adorable bubble-dome, it doesn't take long to expand the selection.\n\nEach character naturally promotes a unique style of play with their skills. The Mercenary and Miner feature agile fast moving attacks that double as dodging manoeuvres, encouraging you to keep it hopping. The mechanical HAN-D robot on the other hand has a suite of moves designed to keep him in the thick of battle. An Overclock boost increases his speed and power and can be extended by pounding multiple enemies. His brawling prowess is complemented by an array of seeker drones that can autonomously fly off and leech back health from the enemy while he fights, and so on. Learning how to best utilize each character's tools and abilities is essential if you hope to weather the storm.\n\nMultiplayer gives the individual characters a little more room to breathe and express themselves. Some of the more idiosyncratic classes that I thought were a bit lacklustre in single player came into their own with a team. I was worried that adding more players to the recipe would spoil the difficulty of the game. This is definitely not the case. While the extra firepower and the ability to split up and search for the exit certainly makes the early stages easier, having to share the loot and gold among 2-4 people means none of you will become the fearsome blackhole of alien destruction you might be used when hogging every trinket for yourself. By the final stages you'll need to work together as best you can to manage the laughably unfair hordes of nearly invulnerable monsters.\n\nWhile playing with random strangers results in the typical mad scramble of greed you might be used to in something like Borderlands – where every player jumps on every item they can in a micro-demonstration of the Tragedy of the Commons – playing with a coordinated group raises the game to the next level. When you can actually coordinate who gets what items based on what they need or what would be most useful for a particular cast member, you can cultivate a truly spectacular team. Multiplayer goes from being a fun diversion, to feeling like it's the way the game is MEANT to be played.\n\nWhich is why it's such a shame that it is absolutely broken.\n\nConnecting to an online game in Risk of Rain gave me some wonderful flashbacks of the late-90's. Eschewing any kind of server browser or quick-game connection UI, Risk of Rain expects you to manually input the IP and port number of your host. I haven't texted somebody an IP address in nearly a decade, and while the nostalgia trip was nice, it is a decidedly horrible way to run a multiplayer game.\n\nIt is an unbelievable shame that RoR's multiplayer is hamstrung in such a fundamental way. When I was able to find a match and everything worked, it was some of the best co-op I've played this year. It taps directly into the same impulses that made games like L4D and Gears of Wars Horde mode abiding favourites with my friends for years. Sadly, I don't think I'll be able to convince many people that putting up with all the frustration of getting a match together is worth it for RoR. I know Hopoo Games is a small group, but this was a real missed opportunity that could have taken their game from a being a fun little title to something great.\n\nRisk of Rain is a sad game. It deals in desperation, in hopelessness. Rendered in a gorgeous faux-retro pixel-art style, everything in RoR dwarfs the player. The music, brilliantly composed by Chris Christodoulou, is tense, haunting, and worth the price of admission on its own.  While RoR is intentionally light on story, the background of the game is slowly filled in through the shipping details of the items you scavenge throughout the game and a journal detailing the monsters and wildlife you encounter. Many of these little descriptions were surprisingly wistful or tragic, and by the time you've collected the last monster log, you'll probably start to feel like maybe you were the jerk in this situation.\n\nThat feeling helps carry the game. Risk of Rain isn't as smooth as something like Isaac or Spelunky. There's more technical jank, items spawning in unreachable areas, containers floating off the ground, and the gameplay isn't as balanced or fair. Where part of the skill of Isaac or Spelunky is being able to roll with the punches and succeed despite bad luck, there were definitely times in RoR where I felt failure was out of my control.\n\nBut flaws notwithstanding, I kept comming back. That sad wistful tone and the wonderfully balanced characters just dug into the right spot of my brain.Risk of Rain might not be the most polished roguelike to hit the market in the last few years, but it has a charm all to its own, and I think that is a fact to celebrate.","December 12, 2013","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrenchfarm/recommended/248820/","wrenchfarm","Wrenchfarm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrenchfarm/","205 products in account","Harkening back to the day of the 8 and 16-bit platformer, Risk of Rain is deliberately inscrutable roguelike that relishes in its masochistic difficulty curve. Skipping any kind of pretence of a tutorial or any of the modern hand-holding gamers have come to expect, your little spaceman is dropped into a random, semi-procedurally generated map with little more than the vague instructions to "Find the Teleporter" to go on. Vicious monsters begin to spawn almost immediately and it doesn't take long to realize how hopelessly outmatched your little guy is, and it only gets worse from there.\n\nThe central conceit of Risk of Rain, and what makes it stand out from the pack of other recently released roguelikes, is the timer. A large clock in the top right of the screen mercilessly ticks upwards with every second. The longer you take, the more frequently the monsters spawn, and the stronger they grow. Every five minutes, a bell marks the passing into a higher level of difficulty, starting at "Very Easy" and eventually tipping into the realm of "impossible" and "HAHAHAHAHA." If you haven't been efficient at collecting upgrades and items, you may soon find yourself surrounded on all sides by monsters you don't have a prayer of defeating. The mission quickly turns from "how far can I get?" to "how long can I survive!?"\n\nThere is an incredible sense of urgency packed into every second of RoR because of that timer. Every choice and action becomes crucial. What way to you explore after spawning? Should you stay in this area and try to clear out enough monsters to earn enough gold to open another chest, or just book it while you can? While you only take miniscule fall damage, you'll be cursing yourself each time a missed jump forces you to reclimb a ladder, burning precious seconds.\n\nAs you might be familiar from games like The Binding of Isaac, RoR features a plethora of items to be found. Most of these apply some kind of passive bonus to the character like a better chance for critical hits, a bonus to regenerating health, or a small demon in a jar that might cause enemies to explode when you kill them, you know, standard stuff. Others occupy the fifth slot in your inventory to be activated at will, usually with a tremendous cool down period before you can use it again. These are your typical screen-clearing bombs and the like, as well as more esoteric (and deceptively powerful) options like a Repair Kit that will instantly fix up any drones on the screen.\n\nAnd much like Isaac, part of the fun of the game is watching the strange transformation these items will wreak upon your tiny spaceman. You start as a small blip of pixels, a little speck that seems hopelessly outmatched by the towering wildlife and monstrous aliens. But all of that can change with a few lucky item drops. Wreathed in barbed wire, encircled by a fleet of drones, randomly spewing missiles, summoning poltergeists, and leaving a trail of fire at your boots, you may not even recognize your little explorer by the time you reach the final stage.\n\nThere are additional character classes to unlock. While you start with only the standard Commando in his adorable bubble-dome, it doesn't take long to expand the selection.\n\nEach character naturally promotes a unique style of play with their skills. The Mercenary and Miner feature agile fast moving attacks that double as dodging manoeuvres, encouraging you to keep it hopping. The mechanical HAN-D robot on the other hand has a suite of moves designed to keep him in the thick of battle. An Overclock boost increases his speed and power and can be extended by pounding multiple enemies. His brawling prowess is complemented by an array of seeker drones that can autonomously fly off and leech back health from the enemy while he fights, and so on. Learning how to best utilize each character's tools and abilities is essential if you hope to weather the storm.\n\nMultiplayer gives the individual characters a little more room to breathe and express themselves. Some of the more idiosyncratic classes that I thought were a bit lacklustre in single player came into their own with a team. I was worried that adding more players to the recipe would spoil the difficulty of the game. This is definitely not the case. While the extra firepower and the ability to split up and search for the exit certainly makes the early stages easier, having to share the loot and gold among 2-4 people means none of you will become the fearsome blackhole of alien destruction you might be used when hogging every trinket for yourself. By the final stages you'll need to work together as best you can to manage the laughably unfair hordes of nearly invulnerable monsters.\n\nWhile playing with random strangers results in the typical mad scramble of greed you might be used to in something like Borderlands – where every player jumps on every item they can in a micro-demonstration of the Tragedy of the Commons – playing with a coordinated group raises the game to the next level. When you can actually coordinate who gets what items based on what they need or what would be most useful for a particular cast member, you can cultivate a truly spectacular team. Multiplayer goes from being a fun diversion, to feeling like it's the way the game is MEANT to be played.\n\nWhich is why it's such a shame that it is absolutely broken.\n\nConnecting to an online game in Risk of Rain gave me some wonderful flashbacks of the late-90's. Eschewing any kind of server browser or quick-game connection UI, Risk of Rain expects you to manually input the IP and port number of your host. I haven't texted somebody an IP address in nearly a decade, and while the nostalgia trip was nice, it is a decidedly horrible way to run a multiplayer game.\n\nIt is an unbelievable shame that RoR's multiplayer is hamstrung in such a fundamental way. When I was able to find a match and everything worked, it was some of the best co-op I've played this year. It taps directly into the same impulses that made games like L4D and Gears of Wars Horde mode abiding favourites with my friends for years. Sadly, I don't think I'll be able to convince many people that putting up with all the frustration of getting a match together is worth it for RoR. I know Hopoo Games is a small group, but this was a real missed opportunity that could have taken their game from a being a fun little title to something great.\n\nRisk of Rain is a sad game. It deals in desperation, in hopelessness. Rendered in a gorgeous faux-retro pixel-art style, everything in RoR dwarfs the player. The music, brilliantly composed by Chris Christodoulou, is tense, haunting, and worth the price of admission on its own.  While RoR is intentionally light on story, the background of the game is slowly filled in through the shipping details of the items you scavenge throughout the game and a journal detailing the monsters and wildlife you encounter. Many of these little descriptions were surprisingly wistful or tragic, and by the time you've collected the last monster log, you'll probably start to feel like maybe you were the jerk in this situation.\n\nThat feeling helps carry the game. Risk of Rain isn't as smooth as something like Isaac or Spelunky. There's more technical jank, items spawning in unreachable areas, containers floating off the ground, and the gameplay isn't as balanced or fair. Where part of the skill of Isaac or Spelunky is being able to roll with the punches and succeed despite bad luck, there were definitely times in RoR where I felt failure was out of my control.\n\nBut flaws notwithstanding, I kept comming back. That sad wistful tone and the wonderfully balanced characters just dug into the right spot of my brain.Risk of Rain might not be the most polished roguelike to hit the market in the last few years, but it has a charm all to its own, and I think that is a fact to celebrate.","December 12, 2013","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Insanely fun and addicting. The soundtrack of this game is submersive and ominous, but the game gets really intense listening to your own music. Sound effects are retro but not annoying, you can almost feel the explosions hitting your enemies and the sounds of bullets hitting their flesh.\nI have never enjoyed the idea of perma-death but this game has opened up that genre to me, it does a great job of making you feel like ever playable charcter is different, and the speed at which the difficulty, as well as your own strength, on each playthrough provides for excellent fast-action that is really addicting. And on top of everything its online an local multiplayer!\nThe atmosphere and small shreds of story we get from this game are excellent builing blocks for a game that question the human vs. nature relationship, this is built from assumptions incredibly sparce dialogue, and the tormented thoughts of a lone survivor adrift a hostile planet. While these intriguing elements of story and atmosphere are present, they are not so "in-your-face," rather, appearing in monster and item descriptions, these small attention to detail is immersive, interesting and not at all distracting of the core game. A perfect balance of incredibly strong replay value, and a good incentive to keep playing to unlock this worlds story, which we end up caring a lot about.\nThe graffics are very charming and pleasing to the eye. No matter what of the 10 characters you play, your are always a small  pile of about 30 pixels. Not to say that they were lazy at all, no. Rather, the simplicty and smallness of your charcter is great to look at and really makes your feel small in a world of things trying to kill you. The monsters are the same way, though they are larger than you(some very much so), they feel like true inhabitants of the world youve landed in. Bosses feel and look powerful and their deaths are satisfying. Graphically the world around you looks amazing, like the remnants of an ancient alien civilization. They really put you in concern with your characters need to survive.\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10. The reason not a perfect score is the only could use some tweaking. The difficulty, graphics, upgrades, items, collectables and secrets keep me coming back for more everytime I sit down to my computer. Never, have I put so many hours so quickly into a game that was inly $10.

I'm not much for the Roguelike/Roguelite series and games which are similar, however I easily spent Eight hours playing with friends, repeatedly trying over and over. I took a break around 12AM EST and found myself playing it again around 2AM until around 6AM. This is a very easy game to lose track of time in, however the difficulty continually spikes whilst playing, which.. Is actually quite fun to work around.\nFrom my gameplay experience with this game, it has promoted teamwork with item combinations between my friends and I, and I have just enjoyed every moment of it.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to understand item system.\n- A multitude of classes and characters to choose from, to figure out your own personal playstyle.\n- Easy to set-up online multiplayer (Currently only usable in a Beta release).\n- One of the most amazing soundtracks I have heard in gaming. After Eight hours, I still want to hear more.\n- Up to Six player Cooperative.\n- Continually scaling difficulty, which promotes teamwork and makes player develop new strategies.\n- Item Collection, and Monster Journals. Each menu option tells you more about the items you use, and the monsters you fight.\n- Intuitive Combat System unlike other Roguelike/Roguelite games.\n- Combat Focused instead of Platforming Focused unlike most other Roguelikes/Roguelites\n\nCons:\n- Port Forwarding is required for this game, and some ISP's may block the native Port this game uses. (Try using 7777).\n- Game Crashes are somewhat present, and if such happens whilst gaming, your data is lost.\n- Lag prevalent regardless of Ping of players joining a server.\n\nRegardless of the Cons, I definitely would recommend this game for you.

It is also fun. It is also incredibly challenging. It is also somewhat new. It also very, very fun.\n\nYou have to unlock most items and classes. The class you start with is very balanced, and while it might get repetitive to play it time after time until you start unlocking more stuff, it certainly pays off as you'll find an entertaining and diverse cast of playable characters, each with their own distinct playstyles and roles.\nMultiplayer is downright amazing. It can be bothersome to decide who gets to keep each item sometimes and much like most co-op games, someone who doesn't carry their own weight could easily cause your doom, but regardless, when you get a well coordinated team, or at least one with a minimal amount of synergy, it becomes the sort of experience that many co-op games strive to achieve.\n\nIf you dig roguelikes, and/or games to play with your friends, you should totally check this out.","December 7, 2013","true","73.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fast paced action roguelike semi-platformer. Challenges in the game unlock new items to drop and characters to play. Collectables can be found and activated to change the game experience making the game harder or easier, depending on which ones you choose.\n\nWhile there are three distinct overall difficulties, the game's primary mechanic is that the longer you play it, the harder it gets (to a point, but it's a pretty crazy point). Rushing through isn't good unless you know how to do it right, because you'll not get any items and will be too weak later down the road. Slowing down and grabbing every chest, however, will ramp up the difficulty and make the game harder too. The skill is to do both. Harder global difficulties make this in-game difficulty clock speed up, among other things.\n\nThe game has six stages, ten levels, and at least twenty level varients. Each of the first four stages can be one of two unique levels. Each level has two or three varients, one of which will contain that level's unique collectable (every level has one) After beating stage five, you can keep looping through (levels and varients can change). The sixth stage is the final stretch to the end boss and the credits roll (but it ain't easy).\n\nIn each stage, you must find the teleporter and start charging it up (90 seconds in the first two global difficulties, 120 on the third). During this time a boss will spawn, enemy spawn chances are increased, and enemies are more likely to be elites. After time is up, remaining enimies must be mopped up. You're then free to activate the teleporter and move on to the next stage.\n\nEach character (ten total) has a unique ability set, similar to LoL or DotA. The first always has no cooldown, the last has slightly longer cooldown. Enimies drop the cash you use to open chests which contain a random item. Most items are passive, and you can hold an infinite number of them (most of them stack, usually at a reduced effect). Like usual, whites are common, greens are uncommon, and reds are rare. Oranges are usable items, and you can only hold one at a time.\n\nFull support for up to four player co-op, local and online. You respawn at the start of the next stage. Some items apply to all people who proc them, not just the one holding it. Money is shared, no additional chests spawn, and experience is duplicated. Everyone gets XP and cash for every kill, no matter who does it.\n\nComplaints:\nNo servers for this game exist, you'll need to port forward.\nGame speed is tied to framerate. This is not usually and issue, as it's not an intensive game. Only if you play for upwards of an hour in a single game (a really long time) will you start to see some issues, and only then if you're computer is lame.\nGame is very RNG, (it's a roguelike) so if that puts you off then this game (the whole genre, really) isn't for you.\nYou'll probably need to use the wiki.","January 7, 2015","true","45.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You kind of get that Super Smash Bros feel with the unlockable characters which drives you to play more and each character has their own unique stats and skills to further increase incentive to get them.\n\nThere's plenty of replayability however I don't feel the game is worth the full price of $10.  There is simply not enough content to market this game at that price since there are only 10 characters and once you have all of them unlocked your only reason to play is to unlock the other power-ups that have a chance of spawning or Monster Logs for some lore on the monsters you're fighting.\n\nI recommend this game only if it's on sale.","January 1, 2014","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is basically a run-and-gun with rogue-like elements. With 12 classes , each with 4 unique abilities , you wont get bord so fast. And dont forget the items , which are a lot too. The game may have some bugs , which is not nice , but you can get over them. And i almost forgot , everything is randomly generated , so no 2 runs would be the same.\n\nNow , regarding classes , my favorite part of the game. You start at first with only 1 basic class. Yep , only 1 class out of 12. You must do certain things to unlock classes , like killing bosses , reaching a certain level or in some cases even finding the other characters hidden in the game's levels. No 2 classes are the same , each one of them has an unique playstyle and set of abilities . For example , there is the sniper who excels at firing precise shots , being very good for dealing with bosses , but not so good for dealing with hordes of enemies. Or the enforcer , a tank who can stun enemies , or block all frontal damage with his shield.\n\nNow the items. Oh boy , there are lots of items . Some give you a shield , some make your attacks explode . There are activable items who can summon ghosts to fight for you , shoot a lot of missles and so on.\n\nThe enemies in this game are well done , every stage bringing some new type of enemy . And also , you can buy drones to help you out in your journey . These drones fly near you and shoot the bad guys or heal you.\n\nAnd the soundtrack ? Pure genius.\n\nTL;DR Get this game if you like rogue like shooters with lots of classes and items , and most of all , good replay value.","November 30, 2014","true","26.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Each play is a race against the constantly increasing difficulty timer, and whether you win or lose is heavily influenced by what the RNG decides to give you. Lots of characters and items to unlock via achievements, some easy, some stupid. If you want a game that rewards practice and learning, roguelikes are a good genre. And this is a GOOD Roguelike. It doesn't have many level layouts, so you can soon memorize them, but that works out well. Mostly the gameplay comes down to items, and the characters - each class plays differently, and this is a rare roguelike that plays well in multiplayer.

It really makes the game interesting.\n\nHordes\nWhen you find the portal in a level you need to stand your ground(survive) for 90 seconds against a boss + waves + waves + waves of enemies. You can easily be overwhelmed in the normal/hard difficulty. I really like the chaos and the intensity of these 90 second boss fights.\n\nIf you like rogue-likes you will adore this game\nThere is almost nothing to hate, and for the small price of 9 euros (cheaper in sales) this is a must have.\nI would rate this game a 9/10 however I think a dlc would make this game a 10/10.","February 26, 2015","true","45.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Empty_Shadow/recommended/248820/","Empty_Shadow","Empty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Empty_Shadow/","255 products in account","This game offers a nice combination of retro platformer and roguelike, with a touch of modern video games (particularly mobas) I rate it 8/10\n\nFrom an artstyle perspective, they nail it perfectly. The pixel art in the game is beautiful, detailed and not just thrown in there to give it the classic indie platformer artstyle, you can see that all the art has had lots of work go into it, rather than a lot of games that go with very simplistic shapes and objects and then pixelate them to cover the gap in the art skills of the team.\n\nThe soundscape works amazingly with the game, you truly feel like you're exploring a strange planet where little makes sense and even less isn't trying to kill you.\n\nFinally, the gameplay. While simple and to some degree repetitive (jump, shoot, kite, repeat) it keeps it fresh with loads of different classes, all with very different playstyles. The platforming is tight, the combat is very fun and highly enjoyable, and the randomised mechanics improve the games longevity significantly. In addition, coop play is extremely fun, and probably the biggest draw of the game.\n\nThe game does lose points for the random factor though, levels, enemy 'mutators' and the item drops are randomly generated each game, but the bosses are always usually the same and the levels are very samey. This doesn't detract severely, but I feel after 2 or 3 runs, you've seen everything the game has to offer, a lot of games suffer this and it's not always an issue (e.g. Killing Floor) but I feel that the game runs out of surprises fairly quickly.\n\nThe one exception is the items, the items are the best part of the game by far, nearly all of them are unique and most of them are thoroughly enjoyable. The background lore of each item is interesting (and at times hilarious) and the craziness of certain item combos gets you hooked and wanting more. I think they did an amazing job on the item design and the pacing of how they are deployed to the player (you unlock items through repeated play throughs, granting them as potential drops for next game)\n\nOverall, RoR is an excellent game, it has some small flaws, but in general the gameplay is excellent and the art and sound direction are beautiful. I'm hard pressed to find many indie games that compare to it's level of polish. I eagerly await future updates to the game with even more content and features!","December 3, 2013","true","67.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One of them is hoarding many various items in order to survive, which seemed appealing and awesome to me.  And my oh my, was I right.\nYou start as a stranded, fragile and little (in comparison with other monstrosities on this planet) human. On your first playthrough you will most likely die before 10 minutes pass. Actually, you will die a lot. But with each and every playthrough you'll get better and better, collect more items, learn monsters. Eventually you'll get a good run, and this where the fun begins. You can repay the deadly fauna, mowing it down in many fashions. You are the master now.\nI hope that made some sense, but it's hard for me to describe this feeling. You got to feel it for yourself.\nI've played many games, but this is one of the few that capture the feeling of satisfaction really good.

Fast paced action roguelike semi-platformer. Challenges in the game unlock new items to drop and characters to play. Collectables can be found and activated to change the game experience making the game harder or easier, depending on which ones you choose.\n\nWhile there are three distinct overall difficulties, the game's primary mechanic is that the longer you play it, the harder it gets (to a point, but it's a pretty crazy point). Rushing through isn't good unless you know how to do it right, because you'll not get any items and will be too weak later down the road. Slowing down and grabbing every chest, however, will ramp up the difficulty and make the game harder too. The skill is to do both. Harder global difficulties make this in-game difficulty clock speed up, among other things.\n\nThe game has six stages, ten levels, and at least twenty level varients. Each of the first four stages can be one of two unique levels. Each level has two or three varients, one of which will contain that level's unique collectable (every level has one) After beating stage five, you can keep looping through (levels and varients can change). The sixth stage is the final stretch to the end boss and the credits roll (but it ain't easy).\n\nIn each stage, you must find the teleporter and start charging it up (90 seconds in the first two global difficulties, 120 on the third). During this time a boss will spawn, enemy spawn chances are increased, and enemies are more likely to be elites. After time is up, remaining enimies must be mopped up. You're then free to activate the teleporter and move on to the next stage.\n\nEach character (ten total) has a unique ability set, similar to LoL or DotA. The first always has no cooldown, the last has slightly longer cooldown. Enimies drop the cash you use to open chests which contain a random item. Most items are passive, and you can hold an infinite number of them (most of them stack, usually at a reduced effect). Like usual, whites are common, greens are uncommon, and reds are rare. Oranges are usable items, and you can only hold one at a time.\n\nFull support for up to four player co-op, local and online. You respawn at the start of the next stage. Some items apply to all people who proc them, not just the one holding it. Money is shared, no additional chests spawn, and experience is duplicated. Everyone gets XP and cash for every kill, no matter who does it.\n\nComplaints:\nNo servers for this game exist, you'll need to port forward.\nGame speed is tied to framerate. This is not usually and issue, as it's not an intensive game. Only if you play for upwards of an hour in a single game (a really long time) will you start to see some issues, and only then if you're computer is lame.\nGame is very RNG, (it's a roguelike) so if that puts you off then this game (the whole genre, really) isn't for you.\nYou'll probably need to use the wiki.","January 7, 2015","true","45.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It really makes the game interesting.\n\nHordes\nWhen you find the portal in a level you need to stand your ground(survive) for 90 seconds against a boss + waves + waves + waves of enemies. You can easily be overwhelmed in the normal/hard difficulty. I really like the chaos and the intensity of these 90 second boss fights.\n\nIf you like rogue-likes you will adore this game\nThere is almost nothing to hate, and for the small price of 9 euros (cheaper in sales) this is a must have.\nI would rate this game a 9/10 however I think a dlc would make this game a 10/10.","February 26, 2015","true","45.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It opens with you crash-landing on an alien planet and the goal is to survive long enough to get back to your ship. Along the way you will encounter mobs that get more difficult with time, and plenty of items. The items are worth mentioning because you unlock the bulk of them by completing challenges through the game, and they can really make or break a run. This is also a downside, as sometimes you get a bunch of healing items, but I've never played a game where I felt like I was doing enough damage, and by 45 minutes into the game weak enemies will have 2000 - 5000 hp, but you are still doing 100 - 200 points of damage. The randomness of the items does make it fun, and some runs you will get a ton of helpful/awesome items. I have yet to tire of this game, having played for nearly 100 hours. The art is fantasticly done, the music is good, and the classes feel different and varied enough. I only have 2 complaints: The aformentioned item snafu mentioned previously, (seriously, sometimes the items you get in the first stage are so useless that you'll have trouble making past the first boss) and the lack of full controller support. Having to use the mouse to select things, including my character isn't a make or break for me, but it is unfortunate.\n\nI never tried the multiplayer, so I don't know if it is good or not, but the single player is a lot of fun and pretty addictive, especially if you don't mind playing for an hour only to die and have to start over.

Collecting items to mutate your body and enhance your abilities are key to surviving the never-ending horde of incoming alien hostiles. Time is of the essence, as the horde becomes more and more aggressive as time passes.\n\nImmediately the context is given for the game: you are alone, your goal is to survive. Depending on how you play you can be aggressive or passive in how to address the game's starting stages, but more often than not you will have to resort to running away and picking off targets before you acquire the experience and upgrades you need. Before too long you'll be strong enough to decimate colossal threats with ease -- at the aptly-named difficulty "HAHAHAHAHAHA."\n\nNow to me, this was where there was a divergence. The startup always felt sluggish to me; kiting enemies for 20-ish minutes before becoming powerful enough to take them head on didn't feel like it was worth my time invested into it. Some may find this fun, I didn't personally. Once I'd get over that hump, the game's pacing and goal changed from survival into a killing spree. This is something that the game is self-aware of with the higher difficulty levels being "I SEE YOU", "I'M COMING FOR YOU", and "HAHAHAHAHAHA" as well as the endings for each character making mention on how they have lost their humanity/sanity during their spree.\n\nOverall it's a challenging game to get into due to its slow and downright-disadvantaged start. However that nuance is exactly what was intended to give the player that feeling of being overwhelmed, and it exaggerates just how powerful you become when you reach lategame when you contrast it to how weak you started out.","February 25, 2015","true","92.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A pixel, roguelike feel and visual makes it a nice arcade-ish game. But it's not the visuals of Duncan Drummond or Chris Christodoulou's rad soundtrack that makes me really like this game, even if I'm quite a fan of roguelike stuff, or that I like the eerie, electronic (or even sometimes rock) music, which really suits the situation. But its the character development. It really feels like you're going from A to Z, so you get really OP, while the difficulty tries to match your power (until it claims that "it can see you", and "it's coming for you", and it even laughs at you). It can be slightly rage inducing if the difficulty has beaten me, but that makes this game better. Also, play with your friends, so you can have a little company (maybe even to yell at). IT IS buggy though, just wanted to point that out, plus in Linux, or Mac, you will get a lot of crashes (that you can fix by yourself, of course) Overall, the game itself is awesome, the soundtrack is great, and it has ridiculous difficulty, which is a good thing.","December 6, 2014","true","51.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Personally my love for gaming was slowly dying, as all gamess seemed to be clones of another and there wasnt really anything new and orignal out there. Untill i came across this game in a humble bundle sometime earlier in the year at first i didnt feel like giving it a go as the way it looks simple but im so glad i did!\n\n\nRisk of Rain a brillinat rouge-like Side Scrolling Platformer.  it can be as indepth as you want it to. fo example it can be a neverending loop, where you figure out that youve done a 7 hour sitting after dying. But you can also beat the game in an hour if you wanted to. The items are crazy, the game it's self is beautiful i love the art style of everything and the music is truly captivating. I find myself getting lost in the game with the music playing. With trhe ability to play with up to 7 players online and coop it really is a great game to bash with mates, Also the actual story behind the game is like i said orignal and you will find yourself re-playing to complete challenges unlocking artifacts, characters, little hidden levels and easter eggs that devs put in for a laugh.\n\nit really is one of my faveorate game i could talk about it for hours but i wont... i do STRONGLY recommend this game even if you die within the first 5 mins you'll find yourself going back for more as i do. :)","September 8, 2014","true","56.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Collecting items to mutate your body and enhance your abilities are key to surviving the never-ending horde of incoming alien hostiles. Time is of the essence, as the horde becomes more and more aggressive as time passes.\n\nImmediately the context is given for the game: you are alone, your goal is to survive. Depending on how you play you can be aggressive or passive in how to address the game's starting stages, but more often than not you will have to resort to running away and picking off targets before you acquire the experience and upgrades you need. Before too long you'll be strong enough to decimate colossal threats with ease -- at the aptly-named difficulty "HAHAHAHAHAHA."\n\nNow to me, this was where there was a divergence. The startup always felt sluggish to me; kiting enemies for 20-ish minutes before becoming powerful enough to take them head on didn't feel like it was worth my time invested into it. Some may find this fun, I didn't personally. Once I'd get over that hump, the game's pacing and goal changed from survival into a killing spree. This is something that the game is self-aware of with the higher difficulty levels being "I SEE YOU", "I'M COMING FOR YOU", and "HAHAHAHAHAHA" as well as the endings for each character making mention on how they have lost their humanity/sanity during their spree.\n\nOverall it's a challenging game to get into due to its slow and downright-disadvantaged start. However that nuance is exactly what was intended to give the player that feeling of being overwhelmed, and it exaggerates just how powerful you become when you reach lategame when you contrast it to how weak you started out.","February 25, 2015","true","92.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dogephoenix/recommended/248820/","dogephoenix","DogePhoenix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dogephoenix/","424 products in account","First of all, let me just say that I haven't writtien a review since the the required review for the Pillar of Community Steam badge. I've always planned to write more, but I wanted to make my next one way more meaningful than the first. So, here I am.  This should already say something about how great this game is.\n\nRisk of Rain is one of the best games I've ever played (And I've played on every platform, and over thousands of games). It blends co-op, roguelike elements, challenge, and good old fun in one, amazing, already low-priced package. The soundtrack is great; so much so that I was always stuck listening to it in my head, until I eventually took the files from within the game itself and copied them to my phone to listen to them when away from my pc.\n\nWhether you like playing solo or going through games with a friend, you'll find there's challenge in both, no matter the skill. The game's difficulty slowly increases with time...after the 40 minute mark, you've just about hit the highest difficulty. However, if being challenged isn't your thing, you can always just choose the 'Easy' difficulty at the character screen, and difficulty will climb slower, but you won't be able to earn achievements this way. The challenge is to get farther than you did your last attempt, and to collect as many loot items along the way, to fill your logbook, which in itself I've spent many hours just reading the hidden and not-so-hidden references in the backstory of Risk of Rain. Each item has a unique effect, and different descriptions. Some items can only be found within the game after completing certain parameters shown in the logbook. New classes can also be unlocked this way.\n\nEven if you don't like reading, and prefer just going in and shooting things, Risk of Rain will sate you. After 5 mintues into the game, you're already guarenteed to be running for your life, blasting what you can as you try and evade everything trying to kill you. Each class in the game has unique abilities, and offers different playstyles, suitable for different types of players. Personally, I like being a gunslinger, and sneaking, so naturally, I love Bandit and Commando. Commando is your basic, starting class, and is actually arguably the best class of the game, if you know how to use him to his full extent. However, that doesn't mean that your class can't be the best in your hands. Commando is only the most balanced, and a good starting point for every type of player. But as you get into the unlockable classes, you'll eventually find one that suits you, if the first few aren't your style.\n\nThe art in this game was also really outstanding, and inspiring. Pixel art isn't easy to pull off well; yet Risk of Rain's dev team did an amazing job of spinning a story within the art itself. Personally, it inspired me to do more art, and more writing. I don't think the game will ever look dated...This game could easily look as something from the 90's, yet something from any future generation with its fast gameplay, and creativity. If you appreciate any kind of digital art, you'll be lost and immersed in the game's visuals itself. This may be a little unrelated, but the soundtrack just added onto the ambience so well when enjoying this game, and the art.\n\nAll in all, the game is easily worth the money invested into it. Every game is different, no two playthroughs are the same, and your luck can be all good or all bad in any playthrough, but ultimately, you can control your destiny in the game with your skills. The game really reminded me of Dark Souls with the challenge it gives you, and the gameplay itself feels like a classic sidescroller, yet with more magic and originality than most. The game is easily a classic of its own, and I believe will withstand the test of time in this coming generation of games, and even afterwards.","January 11, 2014","true","51.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You may be thinking to yourself now: "Why is this guy telling us this, and, more importantly, why should I care?" Well, I'll tell you. A few years ago, I went to a music camp for the summer, and one of my favorite things to do was to go out into a nearby field with a small speaker and go stargazing after our performances. We'd find some chill music to pull up and just talk about our lives. One night, this guy suggested we listen to a soundtrack he had, from a game called Risk of Rain. I was intrigued, as I love video game soundtracks, so I told him to plug it in. I was immediately hooked on the music, and I decided to go investigate the game. I played a gameplay trailer, and it looked interesting enough. I was a fan of roguelike games, and the pixelated art style was always something I enjoyed.\n\nA couple weeks later, I went and purchased the game and gave it a go. Being a pretty experienced, I felt ballsy and started on Hard mode... That was a mistake. I was murdered within about 15 minutes. However, after switching down to the normal difficulty, I started playing through, and I loved every second of it. Before I realized it, the difficulty was no longer increasing, and the timer read 150:00. You know you've found a fun game when you can invest two and a half hours into it while having it feel like a matter of minutes.\n\nA couple of days later, I had every class unlocked and just enjoyed myself. I told my friends about the game, got some co-op games going, and just felt happy. The combination of a fun and challenging game is something that I've always enjoyed. The simplicity, and yet precise technicality of the game, was made perfectly. And of course, the music. The soundtrack of the game is just beautiful, and matches the tone and setting of the levels perfectly. If you wanna give it a listen, here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ypzpl02Rps\nAnyway, that's the story of how I found this game. So, if you want a fun game with infinite replayability, and an overall great experience, buy this game. It was worth every penny for me. ;)","June 2","true","23.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Before any of you say ~nu uh shut up~ I realize it isn't "like rouge", its a platformer, but genre definitions are a ♥♥♥♥♥, so it's a rouge-like. Deal with it.\nRisk of Rain is amazing. Its pixel-art is some of the nicest and most detailed I've ever seen, and some of the few pixel aesthetics games that don't strain my eyes and give me a headache. Its combat is very well done and very varied. It has an item system similar to Isaac only they STACK, and a timer which makes the game progressively harder the longer you take. On one run you could feel totally powerless and on another, very similar run, you could feel like a total badass who can't be stopped. Every variable is a wild-card and everything is very well balanced. You never feel like an obstacle is insurmountable. When you die you know that somewhere up the line you screwed the pooch, either by not taking the time to scavange for items or taking too much time and ramping the difficulty way up; both usually happen on level 3. The unlock system is put together nicely, too. Whenever you find a new item or monster log, you get flavor text that really sets you in the world (Mars isn't a nice place, be glad you aren't there). The "plot" is kind of non-existant, but the atmosphere is fantastic.\n\nAll that being said, this game has one major, glaring flaw that really sets the whole experience back leagues. If you know how most rouge-like-lite-ish-esque-jimminy-crickets go, you'll most likely picture a 30-60 minute venture into a few set evels to find random loot and hopefully become over-powered enough to emerge victorious, and Risk of Rain is no different. However, a main mechanic in making a successful rouge-like is to make everything that happens somewhat fluent. To use Isaac as an example, while most vets spend 5 minutes on the first floors, 10 in the middle, and maybe 15 on the final floors in they're crap at it. This is where RoR is flawed, and to elaborate I'm gonna have to spoil something, so turn away if you cared about the story past "You crashed, shoot worms". The final boss is KOOKOO BANANAS ♥♥♥♥ING INSANELY LONG. My first fight with the guy went around 18 minutes. Thats about as much as the first 2 levels combined. And not only that, but its BORING as hell. There maybe once in the entire thing where I felt slightly threatened, and that was towards the very end of it. The rest of the entire fight was me running back and forth and occasionally turning around to spit at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There was no engagement, just frustration that it wasn't over yet. And what makes matters worse, is that the 1rst and 3rd phases are THE SAME. The only difference is that the 3rd phase adds a clone that you can't attack to damage the boss, so it just makes the running parts way longer and the spitting parts fewer and farther between.\n\nThis one part of the game is a huge blemish on an otherwise fantastic gaqme. The visuals are great, the atmosphere is great, the combat is great, and the end is a pile of horse ♥♥♥♥ tied to the back of a deranged chimpanzee's pickup truck being driven through the tundra where the snow is replaced with bile. Despite this, I still great;y recommend this game. You should buy it right now. Just skip the end. Or at least make sure you have a portapotty or a coke can near by because you won't be going anywhere for a good while.","March 12, 2014","true","30.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Monsters make noise, your gun sounds badass, and the ding-dong-dong signifying things are about to get a lot harder is ominious as hell.\nThe characters give anyone with any playstyle their chance to shine in a group.\nThe item descriptions gave me a chucke the first time around, and even more so once I read about them in the item log.\n\nThe Bad:\nWell, the "random levels" really gives you only a few variations of the same levels. The randomization is limited to where the items are, the teleporter is located, and whether or not certain artifacts are accessible.\nMultiplayer. IP connections? I'm disappointed, Chucklefish, but at the same time, i've come to expect difficult setup just to play a game that's basically designed for multiplayer. A browser wouldn't be -that- hard now, would it?\n\n\nOther Thoughts:\nI'm capable of powering through any game, and love the way you unlock characters by doing specific actions in-game. The ability to start out with a well-balanced character will definitely help newcomers become familiar with controls and gameplay.\n\n\nI lovingly bestow upon this title an 8/10.

What makes a game different if it's the same game but unique at the same time? Gameplay and the way you change it and interact with it, just a bit. Music, sound and art style counts to.\n\nMost games (But not all games) with Permadeath has a recurring Dungeon Crawler theme, go in with nothing, explore, grab the loot and kill enemies to become stronger to reach the goal. Now "Reach the goal" can change dramatically how the gameplay difficulty is. Make the goal short makes the gameplay harder and make the goal longer makes the gameplay easier but makes you on edge not to die, like Diablo III or Path of Exile. There is also games with no clear goal(Minecraft and Terraria) that makes the gameplay the same even if permadeath is on, It only makes you on edge when you play.\n\nRisk of Rain uses the short goal way(short goal, harder gameplay) but it change the gameplay difficulty to a more timely manner, Time = Difficult. The longer you play the harder the game is. Suddenly the pattern is change, short goal with progressive(time) difficulty. With that pattern and the easy to play controls and the fun easy gameplay becomes much much enjoyable. It's like surfing, riding the difficulty and feel that you can do enything, as long your on the surfing board.\n\nI highly recommend you buy it and play it with a friend. It's one of those games that I can play again and again without feeling bored of it's mechanics. A fun unique game.","December 8, 2013","true","23.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Initially, playing the game can seem like an exercise in futility, as your character gets overwhelmed by massive odds. But slowly, as more and more items unlock and pile on, game play sessions tip the scales in the other direction, towards the absurd.\n\nBefore you know it, you've got forty items, double, triple, and quad-stacked or more, and your damage dealt is measured not in tens but thousands. Lasers and missiles and explosions spew from your body with each attack, and enemies fall when they enter your immediate range. Suddenly, game play sessions that lasted 15 minutes seem paltry in comparison to your multi-hour runs, cycling through stages countless times as you run the hamster wheel of greed and mayhem.\n\nAgain, Risk of Rain rewards the patient. Slog through your failures, and ultimately you'll come out the other side, 15 hours later, with the most fun platformer in a long time.","January 14, 2014","true","16.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's like an old school shoot-em up, like Contra, pushed to 11.\n\nThere are currently 10 classes in the game, each with a different skillset, so you should find one you are comfortable with. The classes range from a sniper who can one-shot bosses under the right circumstances, a riot officer who can plant his shield on the ground to absorb all damage from the front but renders him immobile and an engineer who can plant turrets and mines. You unlock each class by doing various objectives like beating the game or doing a mini event.\n\nEach class has four different abilities. You start out with the Commando who is very very good and is one of the best in my opinion (but I like the Huntress more). His primary damaging ability (spammable) is dual shot which fires two shots for damage,  a railgun like ability that fires a straight shot piercing all enemies, a dodge roll that gives you invulnerability frames, and an ability that can fire in both directions for quite a bit of damage. The overall combat in the game is very satisfying and if you die you know it was your fault and not the games. The game also has native 360 pad support, which is what I use to play, not so sure on the ds3 pad support though.\n\nThere is a selection of active items you can pick up that can do some pretty cool things like summon some backup drones or summon a shadow clone to mimic your abilities. There are also many passive items you can get that give you various bonuses like enemies drop meat cubes on death that heal you when you pick them up, every 4th basic attack will pierce and summon bolts after you kill an enemy that will seek out others and damage them.\n\nThe difficulty in the game can range from easy to holy ♥♥♥♥ this is the worst thing in the world, it really all depends on the items you get in the game. You can get some insane items on the first stage that can carry you through the rest of the game, like Infusion which grants maximum health on each kill or 56 Leaf Clover which makes farming much easier as it makes elite mobs, ones that have a white border around their health bar, have a chance to drop items.\n\nThe level variety is really nice as they include a snowy levels, lava levels, underwater levels (no drowning involved!), and a space ship. There is also a hidden level in the game, can you find it without looking it up? The levels in the game are procedurally generated meaning that there will never be a chest inside a wall or the teleporter to exit each stage isn't inaccessible.\n\nThe soundtrack in the game is just amazing, that's all I can say. Go listen to it for yourself! My favorite track is http://youtu.be/iSnOWqTPUNQ.

Like other roguelikes, it is possible to be killed throughout the game because of a simple slip up, and there is a reliance on getting the proper items in order to succeed in later levels. It's very possible to die on the first level simply because you don't find any useful items.\n\nThe emphasis on "permanent death" for a character may be offputting to some, but beating the entire game takes about an hour, and dying is not a tremendous setback. The fun comes from the gameplay itself, not the progression to the end.\n\nThe game is definitely worth $10 based on the singleplayer alone, and I've put many more hours into this game than games with a considerably larger price tag, but if that is not enough for you it has up to four player co-op. The multiplayer is fun but expect to die a lot more often. Money and experience is split between players which can make progress difficult, as items are not shared.\n\nThis game is a great example of the roguelike genre, and great value for an individual or group of friends.","November 25, 2013","true","33.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Risk of Rain, on the other hand, has some of the same elements like character unlocking and item unlocking and stuff, but this game makes it so wonderful on an entirely new level. I cannot praise this game enough. The game has a wonderful difficulty curve, where the more time you take the harder everything gets. Some people are under the impression that it stops at the highest displayed difficulty, but it keeps going.\n\nYou may feel like a god at times, but if you take too long, no matter how strong you are, you will be smacked down if you become complacent. The difficulty is satisfying and fair, and the entire feel of how you approach fights and how you do things is SO strongly correlated by which character you are playing that you can't at all approach a situtation the same way with one character as you did as another: It's an extremely unique experience.\n\nThere is an absolute ton of items in this game, all with interesting effects, and you unlock more by completing challenges with any character, or a specific one depending, and it all feels awesome.\n\nThe art style is absolutely gorgeous. It's very 2d and in a lot of ways is somewhat low-res, your character for example is entirely made up of only a few pixels. But the few pixels used in any given element are used very well, and it looks amazing in the end. The backgrounds as well are absolutely incredible, the background in either of the first level possibilities and the final level in particular are absolutely incredible.\n\nThe soundtrack: It's unfair. I feel very bad for every other developer in existence who now has to make soundtracks for their games now that this game's soundtrack is around. It's unbelievable how well this soundtrack fits the game. The music is amazing and I can't get enough of it, it's soooooooo good. Beyond even the music, the sound effects on attacks and enemies is excellent as well (with the minor exception of some spider enemies in the mid game who are a biiit too into making their sound) in that they impart a great feel for what is happening and the weight behind the attacks that you can rarely afford to let hit you.\n\nI could probably go on for days. This game is absolutely incredible and I love just about every bit of it. My only regret is that I didn't know about it while it was in Kickstarter, so I missed my opportunity to throw money at it in development.

It is one of best games I have played in 2013 and 2014.\n\nThe game is simple Kill monster ,eared money ,sped money ,beat boss and get the hell outta of there. The difficulty of the game is tied with the time the more time you spend on your playthrough the harder the game gets.\n\nGameplay is simple 2D contra style. Well it depends highly on which class you pick and there are great verities of them. Every class is unique with his on Con and Pros and attacks. Took me 21 hours to finally beat the game but am not done there is lot of classes to unlock. I really want to try every class. Since every class has its own style of attacks and abilities.\n\nArt of this game is amazing too pixaled but still beautiful. AND THE MUSIC OMG. A masterpiece it’s really is. It fits the game so well. From the first hour playing this game I instantly went and bought the soundtrack.\n\nRisk of Rain is a 9.8/10 for me.\n\nPs.I have not tried to play online Or locally SO I can’t comment on that.\n","January 10, 2014","true","26.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The first few games you will get beaten very hard. Theres a lot of fun in refining and slowly improving your approach and strategy to what the game throws at you. I remember feeling the same way about games like The Binding of Issac. Improvement is through iteration, yet somehow it all still feels fresh and exciting. Once you think you've got it - a new character, weapon or item unlocks and give everythign a suddenly fresh new take.\n\nPerhaps one of my favorite things is the way items stack. Seeing the same item twice doesn't feel like you'v elost ground. Getting, say many missiles that increace the chance to fire a moarter blast can work toegher to turn your player into a mean machine, blasting rockets, bullets and mayhem everywhere. Theres is a great deal of satisfaction to unleashing a lot of carnage after an especially enemy filled screen or boss fight.\n\nThe slow and incremental increase of difficulty over time, prevents meaningless grinding. You find the game is now a matter of maximizing upgrading, destruction and treasure hunting vs level progression. Its a good formula- and it scales effectively.\n\nI'm especially excited about the possibility of multiplayer, which I've yet to experience.\n\nThe only downside, if there is one- is that the characters you can play, while interestingly differnt, are also radically unbalanced in effectiveness. Some characters, like the huntress really compliment the nature of fighting enemy swarms, and tower over the other characters in overall effectiveness. the sniper, by contrast, I can only see being used as a fully support character, and is simply too unuseable, and therfore not fun or exciting to play. I consider these criticisms minor. I'd be much more nonplussed by playing carbon-copy characters with different shirt colors.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kfshradio/recommended/248820/","kfshradio","kfshradio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kfshradio/","114 products in account","Risk of Rain. A game that prides itself on being insanely difficult. Right off the bat, a red flag. But! RoR is easy to pick up, with a small set of skills that must be executed flawlessly in order to beat the game (unless you are playing Huntress. Huntress OP).\n\nThe game's selling points are perma-death (new term for "arcade") and its rougelike elements. Drops and enemies are randomized, while the ten possible maps are stitched together out of pre-determined chunks. It has a degree of arbitration while retaining familiarity to those who repeatedly play the game. A nice balance.\n\nThe game is one of the best examples of modern pixel art that I can think of on the top of my head. It's really pretty. The movement is also very polished, with no little kinks as to how you are supposed to execute attacks--the ones you would find in games like CS:GO and Dark Souls.\n\nWhat's better yet is the game has multiplayer! PvE. But, this is where the shortcomings of the game begin. Multiple players are forced to fight over a fixed amount of item drops, which either requires a lot of teamwork, or having one person be the ♥♥♥♥♥ of the team who is insta-gibbed at the beginning of each stage because his teammates stole all the upgrades. While this allows for some strategy, a necessary part of good multiplayer, the scaling is just too unforgiving. Multiplayer makes the hardest difficulty look like child's play.\n\nThe class balance is also a little wonky. Some classes are very easy to pick up (Huntress, Soldier, HAN-D), while others require ludicrous amounts of skill. Making some classes more difficult while others less so would make the game much better to play.\n\nBottom line: If you are looking for an easy-to-play, hard-to-master game with decent multiplayer capability, get this game.\n\n8/10","June 7, 2014","true","96.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(But there's certain things that can ramp up the diffuculty of the game even more, if you know what I mean☻).\n\nThere's notable difference in some of the characters kits that I notice while playing "Risk of Rain", that are sometimes better than other classes making things "unbalance" in certain situations, if you play long enough to see in classes. Despite that all the classes their own charm in their respective kit and the "unbalance" in certain situations, such as single player can add a challenge when you come back to risk of rain.\n\nSome problems I have endured during my time in risk of rains are when i'm starting a new playthrough in single player and would fall out a map and would have to restart (dosen't bother me as much), and The multiplayer that sometimes likes to work and not (In my experinces). There's other bugs that never occured to me but to other people... Last level glitch,Crashing,etc that might be fixed as game updated recently (With a beta release even more back). If not people should report them the bugs in the respective areas.\n\nBut despite all that, be sure to get risk of rain ☻","January 18, 2015","true","68.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's so satisfying to kill monsters as they continually increase in difficulty and the power-ups are so much fun to use. I can't wait to unlock new characters and play some more multiplayer because I honestly cannot wait to play some more Risk of Rain.\n\nPros:\n\n- Amazing pixel art visuals\n- The soundtrack is both epic and retro\n- One of the main features is perma-death and difficulty, and it gets harder the longer you survive\n- Gamepad support right out of the box\n- Randomized environments and monster spawns make for a different experience every time\n\n\nCons:\n\n- It's sometimes hard to see yourself in the middle of the action after stacking so many buffs on your character\n- There seems to be a bug where any Steam pop-up is increased in size ten fold when playing full-screen\n- It can be a little confusing to set-up a server for friends to play in, but local multiplayer is a breeze\n- Platforming can be a little wonky with a keyboard, though the controls themselves are very simple and easy to understand","November 27, 2013","true","66.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solinarius/recommended/248820/","Solinarius","Solinarius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solinarius/","176 products in account","I haven't played many rogue-lites myself, but I really enjoy this game's approach and its well-defined classes. Each class (10 in total) has 4 unique skills, and they allow for some fairly creative gameplay. The first skill is either a basic ranged or melee attack, although, some classes have an extra snippet tagged on. The second and third skills vary but are usually some combination of attack, mobility, or utility. The forth skill is a class's most powerful and fanciful, with the Sniper and Engineer being the only exceptions.\n\nSimilar to most rogue-lites, there is no shortage of difficulty or challenge, especially when you're 'doing it wrong'. Obtainment of items is essential, but with chests and icons (for item gambling) scattered randomly throughout maps, you must temper exploration and gold farming with efficiency, lest the game clock itself defeat you. You can also obtain hidden items called Artifacts, each possessing some sweeping gameplay change or addition when toggled. I personally won't play the game without the Glass Artifact because otherwise the items--rather than your personal ability--substantially dictate your performance.\n\nCo-op can be a double-edged sword if one of your partners is unfamiliar with the game. They may bring more firepower, but items and gold will have to be shared. Die too much, without optimal farm, and your partner will leave you behind for the rest of the game. This is kind of what I was talking about concerning itemization.","May 12, 2014","true","96.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What we have here is a tough as nails yet extremely addicting game, rewarding in every way. The pixel art is done *very*  right (and entirely by one of the two developers!) and just the right amount of attention is put into monster logs and item descriptions, with a little charm in each entry that makes collecting them that much more endearing.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lifetastedsosweet/recommended/248820/","lifetastedsosweet","Bakaloid.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lifetastedsosweet/","80 products in account","Genre: Hectic 2-D action platformer with roguelike RPG elements\nGame Time: 4~10+ hours\n\n"The game is set in the distant future, where space transportation is common. Space trains carry passengers and goods all across space. A particular space train, however, had some very special cargo. Through a series of unfortunate events, this space train gets shot out of orbit and crash lands on a mysterious planet.. with one survivor." -From Risk of Rain Wikia\n\nAn Interesting Note\n\nInitially the title "Risk of Rain" implies different origins. It could imply the pain from its roguelike elements or the loose plot where the cargo, which is potentially dangerous, falling onto the planet like meteor showers. However according to an e-mail response from the developers, "…it came around as an idiom of chance, because the game was very chance-based… It also coincides with the chests 'raining' from the sky, and our hometown Seattle."\n\nInitial impression\n\nRoguelike games has never been my cup of tea when it comes to entertainment. Sure they're alot cheaper and are easier to purchase, but that's pretty much the only reason why I would risk spending even dollar on. Risk of Rain (as RoR) on the contrary made me thirst for more. I saw myself clicking the "play" button repeatedly and despite the length of the game, I had a great time shooting down critters and getting plummeted by Magma Worms.\n\n"Visuals!"\n\nAssuming you have viewed the trailer, RoR is without doubt, pixel-based. This is the point where a surprising amount of customers have their opinion's divided. I personally agree with what Totalbiscuit said that there could have been more done with the visuals, but since the game can't get more visually neat than now, I see this as an reasonable compromise. We're talking about an Indie game here after all.\n\nIn summary, the visuals are clean and are easily understandable. The colors don't feel dull especially when each one of the maps are distinct. The effects are flashy, and although you'll get to the point where everything goes fubar, the game is fair from what you expect. Oh, but them infinitely spawning Wandering Vagrants in the last level, they were a massive pain in the butt. Even if you're picky in-terms of graphics, getting frustrated and confused from how you died, or how you're being hurt will be the least of your concerns.\n\nMechanics(Contents)\n\nNow in RoR you have plentiful numbers of passive items as well as interesting active items and drones you'll find throughout each randomized level. However what makes RoR so addictive aside from it's procedurally generated worlds, are its twelve characters that create a basis of your gameplay.\n\nYou begin with the Commando, the standard shoot & dodge character, to the Acrid, a beast equipped with poison potentially lethal to even the hulking bosses of the game. Of course you will quickly create a preference on each character, but you'll be inclined to come back to for a refreshing gameplay, especially for Co-Op. The point that has to emphasized here is that to say the characters in this game define RoR, isn't even the slightest understatement. Experiment, and enjoy the variety. Most of all, have fun taking down hoards of those monsters. Before you get utterly destroyed, though.\n\nWhat the game offers\n\nOver a hundred items that are categorized with rarity, aside from a few, there are no two items that have the same effects.\nInteresting artifacts that mostly make the game hard, but more interesting. For example the Hive Cluster artifact makes the randomized loot, choosable. The Origin artifact on the otherhand, spawns Imps and a Imp boss every 10 minutes.\nVery limited, but unique maps that provide flavor and decreases boredem to the game.","January 14, 2015","true","21.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
