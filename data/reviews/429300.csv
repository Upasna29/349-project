"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/429300/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account",""In that quiet corner of a crowded mall, next to an old discolored window overlooking a slushy parking lot, I saw the future."\n\nThere is a certain plaguesome tone that can only be heard from a forgotten instrument - specifically a string instrument since Niccolo Paganini once claimed that a string instrument is capable of resonating the closest sound to the sound of a human soul. Take a violin for example: imagine the slender form never getting touched for years, never tuned or taken care of. Then someday, someone magically decides to pick it out of its oblivion and give it a ring. The beauty of the possibly mesmerizing tunes it can play is still there, ringing foremost; yet there is a small, low distortion echoing through strings only to the trained ear. That is the sound of sadness and it has a low ringing tone that you can hear not only through instruments, but also people. The agony of the forgotten is never loud, never intrusive, never animate. It's static, subtle and present, visible only to the ones that seek to see...\n\nSuch is the seemingly ordinary existence of Mark, a seemingly ordinary high school student with a sister and a small group of friends, spending the days of his youth with idle daydreams. His stoic and somewhat detached reality is about to be challenged by the appearance of a mysterious girl named Myra who claims to know Mark despite him having no memories of her. "Who... are... you?" he asks as if calling her out in a dream, combing through his recollections for the past years. With a ghostly smile Myra makes a cryptic declaration in return: "I'm the person you wish you never met."\n\nSepia Tears is a free visual novel made by a small independent group: Scarlet String Studios. The story and the happenstance depicts a beautiful mystery which is simpler than one would expect it to be. Yet the careful balance between the beautiful, contemplative narrative of ongoing impressions and the selection of weeaboo humor presented now and then to break the grim depth of the protagonist' train of thoughts arrange a satisfactory visual novel. The vague presentations of unspecified feelings coming through characters feel more realistic, modest and genuine compared the mostly overdramatized romantic pursuits of characters that we come across in this genre. Characters mostly do not know what they actually feel, neither you are capable of observing the feeling blatantly aside symbolic imageries until climactic face offs. The resulting narrative dynamic ends up being a complete success, exalting an otherwise ordinary story.\n\nCharacters are hand drawn and sketchy with a tone of surreal pastel coloring, befitting Mark's perception of reality. What impressed me the most is that you are capable of noticing momentary expression changes of characters between narrative sequences according to the mood or the event. Their reactions do no pause within narrative scenes. They occur and resolve, creating an impact on their realizations. The narrative text is likewise alive - changing speed and tone according to the mood it tries to underline. Music isn't anything wondrous or original on the other hand, and do not expect a miracle on sound effects either, but they all serve their accurate purpose of establishing a consistent atmosphere.\n\nAll in all, it's a beautiful visual novel for you to spare a silent winter afternoon without anything to lose - and maybe reminiscence a love you have forgotten until the proper medium recalled it for you. You can safely expect 5-6 hours of gameplay, considering the story progresses very slowly depending on the protagonist's mood and ability to experience occurrences. A short bonus chapter in the end, telling the perspective of Myra through her diary is also a bonus.

I'd have to play it through Steam to confirm, but it looks like  straight port to PC. If so it's a satisfying read that does deliver teh feelz, the artwork is very good and tends to follow the "straight up anime to chibi then back again" style popular in the visual novel genre. The amount of choices to make in the game is satisfying and do at least make for a slightly different read on a second go-through. Music is theme appropriate. In all I'd say you get a good $9.99-$14.99 visual novel (it's not overly short, but don't expect a lengthy read like Katawa Shoujo or the like) for the unbeatable price of free.

And I'm not saying that "for the price point."  At five, ten, twenty, maybe even fifty dollars, this VN is well written.\n\nThe author's ability to articulate meaning and write real, rich dialogue is superb.  The word play is on par with English novellists, and it's a refreshing change of pace after having read so many pieces merely translated from Japanese to English by people whom only have a faint grasp on their secondary language.\n\nIf you're a fan of the VN medium of storytelling, and have had reservations about English titles, I urge you to try this.  The art isn't quite on a professional level, but the writing is.  If they could acquire a professional artist, I have every confidence they could create a product worthy of sale.","January 8","true","4.2"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SandmanEnterprises/recommended/429300/","SandmanEnterprises","Shadow Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SandmanEnterprises/","89 products in account","This game is simply one of the best, most immersive tragedy-oriented romance visual novels that I have ever played. The story's main theme, of a young boy trying hard to bury a secret, and of a mysterious girl finding out about this, mentally broke me, leaving me shattered. Why? It reminded me of my own past, which I will not dive into.\n\nFor a free game, the atmosphere, the story line and the art is brilliant! Some may find the story dragging on a bit "boring", but for a player such as me (who is interested in as long story lines as possible), it was brilliant, and, unfortunately, it left me aching for a longer story with more unfortunate and fortunate events packed into it. The overall atmosphere of the game, one filled with grief and loss with a light cover of some comedy or awkwardness is certainly a very interesting one. Of course, life isn't all about tragedy, grief and loss now is it?\n\nThe art may have been of higher quality, but I can't complain really. It is a free game, after all, and even in that, the art is well-made. The characters were beautifully drawn. And speaking of characters, it didn't feel like another story where everyone's basically the same, but every character had their own atmosphere, their own attributes, pros and cons and so on.\n\nI would rate this game a 9 out of 10. I absolutely LOVE this game, despite some of its cons (like art, and the relatively short length by my standards)... I will never forget how this game changed me. I congratulate the developer(s) of this game on a job well done, and at the same time, I suggest to everyone to play this game at least once in their entire lifetime for a truly wonderful visual novel story.","March 4","true","9.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","2"

What a treasure this game is!\n\nFrom a technical perspective, I admit it's nothing impressive. The background art and character sprites are fairly simple, the music is repetitive and almost a bit plain, and the story is short and straightforward. You won't find yourself wishing you had pillow cases of this game, or wanting to pay for the soundtrack.\n\nBut that has never been what makes a game great or memorable.\n\nNo matter who you are or what your childhood was like, this game will make you feel something. It will make you remember and reminisce. The entire story is about the protagonist's struggle with having a crush, after his confession to his first love didn't go so well. And this is something that every single one of us can relate to. No matter how your first love turned out, everyone knows that feeling of how the smallest thing can take over your entire horizon until you see nothing, feel nothing, can think of nothing but the person of your affection.\n\nAnd you will come to love the characters, because you've been in their shoes; you may even have been just like one of them, once upon a time. In fact, I'm certain that you were, even if you don't realize it at first. I know I was. I am a woman in her early 20's at the time of writing this review, and I've rarely self-identified so strongly with a 17/18 year old male protagonist. I adored watching the transformations and metamorphoses of all the characters. Truth be told, the steps they took as individuals were all so small--but that doesn't mean they're insignificant. Sometimes the smallest steps are the most difficult to take, because they're the most easily obscured and forgotten.\n\nAnd sometimes you may feel that the characters are too self-absorbed, too caught up in themselves, and are overdramaticizing their issues in a passive-aggressive manner. But then you realize that you still do the exact same thing, even today. And for some grandoise, unknown reason, your heart will smile.\n\nThis is such a simple game. And in its simplicity it is breathtakingly beautiful. It didn't make me cry; it did much, much more.","May 1","true","5.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This review is based on my perspective and the "rating" system is about whether the review is HELPFUL or not)\n\nI hesitated playing this game for a little while and I guess that feeling was right.  To be perfectly honest, I did not enjoy it for the most part.  (And thanks to people who reviewed this giving out spoilers WITHOUT SPOILER TAGS, that didn't exactly help)\n\nYou play as Mark, someone who is upset about a memory he's trying to forget.  A memory of a girl from his past.  3 years later, someone named Myra looks just like the girl from 3 years ago.  She stalks Mark throughout most of the game while Mark keeps trying to focus on a girl he actually cares about, his classmate Lillian.  There's various nonsense involving the little sister and the otaku classmate, but they're pretty unimportant save for comic relief...if you can call it that.\n\nPersonally, I found myself relating with Mark in the beginning, but halfway through the first chapter, all similarities were instantly gone.\n\nThe game's music choices are pretty nice, though I do have a complaint about the Little Sister theme that just....sounds like someone mashing his/her face on a keyboard.  There are a lot of pop culture references involving Fate Stay Night, Fire Emblem, Code Geass, 300, Touhou, Dokuro-chan, and various other sources (mostly anime I'm unfamiliar with but have heard the references to before).  There also seems to be Walfas artwork here when things aren't serious and are essentially a waste of time.  These references essentially drown you when the plot vanishes into the aether.\n\nIf you want to get into tropes (like a similar review talks about), then here are the roles (Spoilers included):\n\nMark:  The faceless protagonist.  Has a little sister, a nerdy best friend, and a girl he has a crush on.  He's the guy thatis essentially the amnesiac who suffers glimpses of a memory that scarred him.\n(SPOILER:  He got dumped by a random girl who doesn't matter. )\nRin:  The "Onee-chan" (Man, that irritates me) obsessed girl who....well....more or less is just a bothersome waste of time.\nLukas:  The nerdy best friend (Otacon?) who is...kinda' the definition of an Otaku.\n(SPOILER:  He'll be part of a love triangle that...you personally don't belong in.\nLillian:  The shy nerdy librarian (Maria from Harvest Moon?) ......umm....not much to really know about her.\n(SPOILER:  As if people haven't spoiled it enough.... she friend-zones you in favor of your nerdy best friend. )\nMyra:  The mysterious stalker who doesn't like to talk about herself and enjoys wasting your time.\n(SPOILER:  She creates a false identity to look and act like the girl who rejected Mark 3 years ago just to be noticed.  In reality, she's an obsessive stalker.)\n\nPROS:\nMost of the music is nicely chosen\nThe ending is great\nFree\nAchievements\n\nCONS:\nUseless side-story tangents\nNonsensical humor that just isn't funny\nLittle Sister's theme was a horrible choice for a song of any kind\nNon-CG artwork of characters does feel off (It's better than what I can do, but still...)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=612119707\n\nNow I will say that I felt myself tearing up in the end.  It was a very nice ending.   But would I say it was worth it?  Would I sit through all the nonsense I had to deal with to see the ending again?   No.   In my opinion, Days 1, 6, and 7 were the only ones that did not feel like a complete waste of time.   If Days 2-5 were cut out entirely, I feel like this game would have been MUCH better than what it was.\n\nNow, I'm not rating this down because it took me 9 hours to read it (Use that as a benchmark for your own experience).  I'm rating this down because I found myself groaning throughout more than half of this visual novel.  I know people liked Myra and I feel she did redeem herself in the end, but on Days 2-5, I wanted to strangle her so badly because of her stalker-ish behaviors and her choosing to be vague about herself.  Now if she was more like how she was on the final day, I would say I'd like her a lot more...sadly, I can't get past how creepy she was before she finally got serious.\n\nAgain, this took me 9 hours to read and for most of it, and I regretted it.  I respect this team for their efforts in this title, but there were many terrible choices with the portrait art (non-CG) and the writing.  Days 1, 6, 7, were good.  Days 2-5 were terrible.  (Days I'd choose to re-read or skip if I had to do it again)\n\n\n4/10  Most of the story was a waste of time.  Read at your own risk.  (Without that ending, 2/10 easy)","January 30","false","9.3"," 23 of 40 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","23","40","0","7"

Sepia Tears is confusing, slow-paced, hard to follow, and breathtakingly beautiful. I wish this got the credit it deserves. The graphics are iffy, but it's not the graphics that draw you in to this story.\n\nPros\n+ The story: Beautiful and breathtaking once you get into it. Truly one of the better  formulated stories I've ever come across\n+ Myra: She was amazing. Without giving anything away, the characterization and inflections of her personality were sometimes the only things that kept me rolling\n+ Humor: There was just enough dorky stuff stuck in here and there that I actually could relate the story to myself. Entertaining and well-done\n+ The Ending: No words, no spoilers. Breathtakingly beautiful\n\nCons:\n- Story Speed: Good lord it took forever to get into the game. Sometimes I had to just force myself saying "It'll get better, it'll be better in a bit\n- Mark: I tried to connect with him, I really did, but the personality and interior monologue threw me for a loop more often than not\n- Repetitiveness: Oftentimes it just felt like the writer was resaying the same lines to fill another day with Myra.\n\nResults:\n\nSolely for the ending, get the game; it's free, it's short, and it's well-written, People will complain about the graphics being sub-par, but everyone read books without pictures long before this came out and they'll get  over it. I did have a hard time with it originally, but the closer I got to the end, the more enraptured I was with it.

The music is ok and the artwork is well drawn with a colourful array of different backgrounds/locations and a nice selection of CG'S. Now the story, for the first half hour i wasn't drawn in i didn't need to know what happened next, however as i carried on reading i found myself being drawn in deeper charmed by the characters and intrigued by mystery, towards the end i had to know what happened next.

Sepia Tears follows the classic "Crying game" story progression that Key is famous for. The story was enjoyable with an unexpected twist, though I would have liked to see multiple endings.\n\nThe audio was good - except for occasionally obvious looping, and the lack of voice that is characteristic of independent VNs. Overall, the writing was witty and had a pleasant, conversational quality; though the pacing could have been better, as it occasionally lingered too long on the protaganist's train of thought, or rushed over scenes that could have used more exposition. The art was nice; however, it was clear that the artist was either still inexperienced, or was working with cheaper equipment - which is to be expected for a free game. My suggestion for the artists and writers would be merely to continue to hone your abilities to a more professional level.\n\nI should also note that much of the humor in the game derives from references to anime and VN pop culture, some of which are quite esoteric; if you do not have extensive experience with other VNs, many of these references will likely go over your head.\n\nAll in all, Sepia Tears is a nice little visual novel, with a few hours of gameplay, and a touching romance.

This is quite literally one of the best stories I've ever seen. Not the best, but it's up there. Is it cheesy? Yes. Is it sappy? Yes. Is is filled with way to many anime cliches that try too hard to be funny by being self-aware? Maybe. All of this works, though, in some way it all comes together and Just Works(TM). But my favorite thing about this story is the fact that I never quite could guess exactly what was going to happen and how. Sure some things became apparent before they happened, like SPOILER and SPOILER SPOILERING, but everything I could guess was properly foreshadowed and never in a suepr-obvious way. The juxtaposition of happy and sad, funny and serious, really comes to play to make this game feel much like real life, although a somewhat idealistic and quirky version.

I am sure there are more but I provably have missed a few of them out\n\nThe storyIt is about a boy named Mark that tries very hard to forget specific memories, memories that will hurt him mentally just by thinking about it and a girl named Myra who appears randomly who would unearth Mark's memories through the art of deception [goodwill intended in her actions]\n\nAudio and Visual elements- Soundtracks are relatively good but nothing really too "crazy" to be worth mentioning other than the Vocal ending song which the player will get to see once completing Sepia tears good end which is pleasing and nice to listen too.\n- Character art - I would say the art for sepia tears are generally good I liked it overall its consistent and holds quite a standard type of "sketch" artstyle and the chibi art are cute I loved the chibi art in sepia tears they look clean and most importantly cute.\n- Background art - They are decently average, I cannot say much for this since mostly are just photographs that has went through paint? [Sorry I can't find the right word for this]\n\nIn conclusionI would recommend this visual novel but to a certain extent. Mainly I felt that the first 3 days in sepia tears were unnecessary to the build up of the story in fact skipping the first 3 days and the story would not be affected at all, that is a very disappointing factor for me in regards to the story.\n\nNext the pacing of Sepia tears is inconsistent it felt way too slow at times and when Myra appears the next moment the pacing is on a Shinkansen.[bullet train]\n\nMark's sister Rin I do not see a point for her to even exists in Sepia tears her role I can't even see her role is and as a supporting character she is just a character that is there for the people who loves the little sister characters a character that loves to tease the big brother and that is pretty much it.\n\n1 of the "bad ends" does not make any sense the part where Rin asked Lukas to "Genuflect"\n\nAfterwordsSepia tears was a slight disappointment but I still do recommend it, well it is free I do not see a reason to miss out on this.\n\nClick here to go to the full review!![azusantiara.wordpress.com]","January 14","true","4.8"," 28 of 56 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","28","56","4","0"

Myra\n\nSepia Tears is a story about love triangle, but it's not what it look like... From a different angle.\n\nThe game start off in a dream, telling you that you had lost your memory. You will play as Mark, Mark start off as a depressed guy, who wanted his memory back from the promised dream. Mark then met a friend of him that can teleport anywhere, and that is where the story start to get interesting. Minor character like you sister and friends do have a great personality that is memorable. There was a plot twist on the game that didn't make the game clear, until you play one of the character diary.\n\nThe dialogue of the game is interesting, where sometime Mark pauses himself to think about what he said or what other character say to him. The game story start can be very confusing at first, but the story will soon piece together from the character dialogue. The game had some of the best moment like repeating you mistake to fix your future, even though I thought the game was broken. It also had many funny dialogue that keeps you entertained to keep your progress on the story.\n\nThe character sprite on the game didn't look that impressive, one of the character looks like she had a lump on her hand. The character expression is what the game nail best, the game tells each character feeling from Mark deep description. The music is like other visual novel an infinite loop, some of them set the mood around you but music like wind gust sometime set the mood around you to be scary.\n\nConclusion\n+ Great story and writing\n+ Memorable and funny character\n+ Many Metaphor\n- Sometime music didn't set up at the right time\nThis game is bad / Meh, it's something  / Must Play\nOne of the most gorgeous free visual novel on steam 9/10","January 15","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I feel the writer was inspired by the works of Key, as there are not only many blatant references to them, but the story as a whole felt similar to Kanon. And that's not a bad thing. (Come on, Key! Release Kanon on Steam already!) :)\n\nThe characters are entertaining, although I felt some of the drama was a bit forced. The supporting characters like to pull the main character's leg a lot, and after a while of this it tends to diminish the impact of the honest drama. I honestly wish the choices in the game weren't purely cosmetic, since these characters are so likeable that they deserve their own endings.\n\nBut the ending we get is good enough. It takes a bit of persistence, but it's fairly rewarding. You unlock a diary entry after beating the game that fully explains the motivations behind Myra's actions, but I wish there was a little more than that. Maybe I was expecting too much, since May Sky's after story felt a lot meatier... :/\n\nI have a few technical problems, particularly with the script. While I do like the transition to NVL to show when Mark is in deep thought, there are also times when Myra is talking instead, and the novel makes no mention of who's speaking. You may figure it out yourself if you're reading carefully, but it is a little jarring when you don't know who's talking. Aside from the rare typo, the script is pretty clean in terms of grammar and punctuation. The backlog feature is probably the best I've seen in a doujin VN, although it is a little too sensitive when I scroll up.\n\nThe graphics are a bit of a mixed bag. The character sprites look like stencil drawings, and the backgrounds look like stock photos altered to look like watercolor paintings. It's a unique style I haven't seen in a doujin VN, and for the most part, it's inoffensive. The CGs, particularly the chibi artwork, are fantastic. The normal CGs are at least consistent with the style of the character sprites, which I can't fault the artist for.\n\nThe music is mostly ambient and inoffensive, although very few of the tracks will stick in your head. The ending theme is the standout track in the novel, as the song fits the mood well and is sung pretty well, too. At first I couldn't tell if it was being sung in Japanese or English, because the lyrics were a bit unintelligible. Once I got a handle on the English lyrics, it turned out to be a pretty nice song.\n\nFor the price of nothing, Sepia Tears could have turned out a lot worse. But for what I got, it's pretty good. This is probably one of the best doujin novels you could play on Steam. There used to be three free doujin novels that I think are exceptional and totally worth playing (those titles being Brass Restoration, Moonshine, and May Sky), and with this game, a new member has been added to the family. I give my wholehearted recommendation to this VN, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. :)","January 9","true","5.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It apparently haunts you and all that is about to change once you meet her once more.\n\nSepia Tears Part 1\n\nSepia Tears is an extremely well done visual novel. Originally released for Android devices in 2013, Now it's on PC for more to enjoy. The beginning of the story is excellent as it gives you a sense of mystery. It makes you wonder of "What happened to the main character?" "Who is this girl?" The story has some choices to choose but it doesn't branch away from the main story. This visual novel does not involve sexual activity like several other visual novels but it does however; involve a very fantastic story. In the end, it makes you cry. It does not make you cry of sadness, but a warm feeling. A feeling of happiness for your character. This visual novel includes a very good soundtrack that goes with the theme of the game being placed in midwinter. Overall, I heavily enjoyed this as the characters were all unique and had their own personalities. The story was well written and knows how to hit your feelings.","March 18","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is perhaps one of the best I have seen in while, at most times remaining cryptic and mysterious until the final part of the game came around. Now not giving much away about the ending but I personally found it very satisfying and the build up really made you emotionally invested in the protagonist so it made the ending that much more impacful. The game takes around 4-5 hours to complete depending on how fast you read and what choices you make. Now I have only played through this once and got the good ending, but I am assuming there are some other (worse?) ones (When I play a VN that is heavy in the feels, I tend not to even look up nor play the bad endings). Overall this game has a solid story, a solid soundtrack, and solid artwork, A must play for any visual novel fan, and hey its free (which is actually rather suprising for a game this refined).\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10\n\nNow please excuse me as I take heat from all the people on my friends list calling me a weaboo for playing anything that remotely contains anime.","January 11","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It can be a bit confusing sometimes as it counts on you to catch some subtext between characters in conversation, but even if you don't, it should become clear what was meant earlier further towards the end.\n\nMy main critiscism is that there's no real choice. All the choices you make are false choices. They either immediately lead to a "bad end" screen which automatically loops back to the same choice, or the current scene has some change without any long-term impact. In the end, the story will always be the same, no matter what you choose, but your choices only make you see a few scenes instead of some others.\n\nAll in all, I really liked the story, and it''s a good way to spend ~4-5 hours of your time (I left it open for a while doing other things, but I'm a fairly quick reader). Plus, it's free. What are you still doing reading this? Go play it!\n\n\n**SMALL SPOILER FOR THE END CHOICE: It doesn't spoil the actual ending, but it talks about the choices to make to get the good ending.**\n\nThe ending was also very confusing because you have to pick between two locations and then whether to give up or not, regardless of the location. If you choose to give up, it just goes to a black screen and loops back to the location choice, but the "not giving up" choice does the same. It's not very clear what you have to do since you can keep doing the same thing. In actuality, you have to go to one of the locations, choose to not give up and then go through the same sequence again and choose the other location. If you go to the second location first, it also ends and loops back around, and will keep doing that until you pick the "correct" location as a first.\n\nIt took me a lot longer than it should have to figure it out, and it's quite counter-intuitive. Something that could be improved on as well.\n\n","February 14","true","5.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/veptavis/recommended/429300/","veptavis","veptavis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/veptavis/","23 products in account","EDIT: I'd like to apologize for the harsh way I expressed myself in my original review. I've altered my review and made it more constructive and less emotional, for anybody who may be interested.\n\n\nBefore I start off, I want to make it clear that while this game does give you choices in how you interact with the other characters (a grand total of about five times,) whatever you choose makes only an immediate impact on the dialogue. The main plot is set in tracks and will not be affected by your choices.\n\nNow. Where to begin. 15 seconds into the game, I noted that the writing seemed beautifully descriptive. In no time, that sentiment was blugeoned to death with walls and walls (AND WALLS) of text. The writing quickly became overbearing, the author taking ridiculous amounts of time to reach a single point (and frequently, no point at all.) Everything (from the inner-monologue to the dialogue between characters) is ambiguous, but in an I'm-twelve-years-old-and-this-is-deep sorta way. Seriously. A lof of the things in this game make NO SENSE, from the narration to the dialogue between characters, you're often left very confused and wondering what you just read.\n\nThe depth and personalities of all of the characters suggest that the author has not been well-acquainted with original ideas. Every. Single. Chracter. Is. A. Trope. There is not a single unique characteristic to be found in the whole lot. To add to the disappointment, despite there being *LARGE* amounts of time poured into the dialogue with all of the characters, you could take out every single one except the main hero and heroine and be left with the same exact story, only shorter and less painful to read. All of the other characters just seem like bells and whistles attempting to distract you from how dull the main storyline is.\n\n(You're probably thinking, "If you hated it that much, then why the hell did you keep playing until you finished it????" The answer to this is because the whole way through, I was still holding out some hope for an interesting ending. Once I get into a story, as the curious sucker I am, I am compelled to see it through to its finish. Unfortunately, the ending did not justify the hours lost. The ending was actually probably the most disappointing part of this entire game. More details below, but beware of the spoilers.)\n\nAt the beginning, we find out that Mark (our main character) has some repressed memories. Myra (our main maiden) is the forgotten childhood friend there to help uncover them. Certainly a mystery interesting enough to leave us curious and wondering, yeah? "What could have possibly traumatized our dear main character to the point of repressing memories of sweet little Myra?" Buuuuuuuut, wait. No. He doesn't actually have repressed memories. He's just numb and dead inside because he was rejected by some random (and I do mean random) girl when he was 13, and Myra isn't the childhood friend she claimed to be. She's actually just some random stalker that Mark never knew existed. After eavesdropping on 13-year-old Mark's rejection, Myra spent the following three years modeling herself after Mark's past crush, then proceeded to pursue Mark hidden beneath that fake identity. Somehow, Mark doesn't think that's such a big deal. After discovering Myra's (rather creepy) secret, he proceeds to confess his undying love to this girl, DESPITE THE FACT that about five minutes before this big end-game confession, Mark had confessed his love for another (irrelevant) girl who rejected and left him for his eccentric otaku friend. These two very "touching" confessions happened within hours of each other within the storyline. No joke, that happened. But don't worry, Myra was the only girl for Mark all along and they live happily ever after. Apparently.\n\nTL;DR/Conclusion: The plot isn't good, the writing isn't good, the characters aren't good, the art and music are mediocre.. it may not cost a dime, but I wouldn't recommend anyone put a second of their time into this game. I'd go as far as to say you'd probably be better off with any other visual novel out there.","January 17","false","8.4"," 8 of 26 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","8","26","0","5"

But, in the end, the sum of it all is a surprisingly real story. It may start out as a a cliché at first, but it does so on purpose. It is giving you the storybook love story, only to reveal how constructed it is, and once you remove those constructed pieces, you're left with heartache, or romance, or an endless cycle of both, because that's reality. Once you take out all the fake parts, all that's left is just life.","March 19","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was just disappointed that there are not more branches or actual paths in this modest-length visual novel. And that would be because it is surprisingly well written, especially for a free story.\nAlthough digestion of the story can be difficult at first, the underlying themes are beautiful and emotionally touching.\n\nLong story short before the rest of the review: A western-based VN that, for once, is a shining example of what this genre is known for.\n\nThe artwork has a charm and prettiness that is uncommon among the increasing numbers of short VNs popping up on this webstore. Unlike other VNs' clean artwork with closed lines, Sepia Tears sports somewhat charming and uniquely rough, sketchy look is the first thing you notice about it, but it does not detract, even if it doesn't really add anything. Every illustration has many uncleaned lines.\nGranted, the artwork is a little odd in a few ways such as with the main heroine's (Myra) sprite facial expressions and the supporting best buddy (Lukas) character just looking really, really awkwardly proportioned.\n\nThe music is generally fitting for each mood and there are a few sound effects as well, though no voice.\n\nRemember what the comment above, how it's disappointing how there aren't more branches?\nThe fact that this is a well written piece does leave you wanting, when there is a set up for additional heroine interactions or plotlines, but in the end, despite the apparent availability of choices, this is a VN with no alternative ends.\nOf course, that means the total content is modest. An average speed reader might be done in five hours or so.\n\n\n\nThis is a free VN, with pretty illustrations and a touching, meaningful story.

The art style is simple but memorable and sets it apart from a lot of other stories on Steam. The music sets the mood well, and the writing has a good flow. That said, I do have some criticism.\n\nTo quote a line from the game: "Funny how simple it all was." The story proceeds with vague dialogue and an unusual atmosphere that it gives a false impression that there is a really deep underlying story or a shocking twist about to be presented. Perhaps the main character has forgotten something critical that will change everything.  But in the end, it's a pretty simply story. The game takes such care in not giving away the ending that the actual writing becomes more confusing and suffers a bit for it.\n\nAll in all though despite the issues, I'm happy with the time I spent playing.","March 2","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't played many visual novels, but seeing how people were talking about this game in the Steam reviews sparked my interest. I gave it a look and completed it 100% and I have to say this was a real roller-coaster ride. If you've never played/not played much visual novels this is a great place to start. I won't say too much but the story involves a character who is scarred from an event that happened in his life. He tries to forget what happened and continues to live his life till cruel fate catches up to him and reminds him you can't forget everything. That is the base of the whole plot, the rest you can find out yourself. And a little bit of warning, don't read too much on this game. You'll probably get spoiled by a jerk who finds it funny to ruin a beautfiul game that was made by someone who put their soul into making it, just a heads up... The characters have character. the artwork is downright charming (And gorgeous), the music is fantastic, and this game will make you feel emotions you never knew you could feel. Overall, I definitely recommend this game. And it has sparked my new-found love for visual novels.\n\nRogueTom gives this game a   9/10\nYou can't turn off the heart baby.","January 18","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For one the music in my opinion goes very well with the scenes.  Also the way the story is developed I find superb.  While you could argue that it is built up to slowly if it were built up quickly the mood of the story wouldn't carry as well.  Finally the ending my whole life I have been a rather depressed person.  I suffered trichotillomania and as a result I find it hard to become emotionallty invested in anything.

I was just disappointed that there are not more branches or actual paths in this modest-length visual novel. And that would be because it is surprisingly well written, especially for a free story.\nAlthough digestion of the story can be difficult at first, the underlying themes are beautiful and emotionally touching.\n\nLong story short before the rest of the review: A western-based VN that, for once, is a shining example of what this genre is known for.\n\nThe artwork has a charm and prettiness that is uncommon among the increasing numbers of short VNs popping up on this webstore. Unlike other VNs' clean artwork with closed lines, Sepia Tears sports somewhat charming and uniquely rough, sketchy look is the first thing you notice about it, but it does not detract, even if it doesn't really add anything. Every illustration has many uncleaned lines.\nGranted, the artwork is a little odd in a few ways such as with the main heroine's (Myra) sprite facial expressions and the supporting best buddy (Lukas) character just looking really, really awkwardly proportioned.\n\nThe music is generally fitting for each mood and there are a few sound effects as well, though no voice.\n\nRemember what the comment above, how it's disappointing how there aren't more branches?\nThe fact that this is a well written piece does leave you wanting, when there is a set up for additional heroine interactions or plotlines, but in the end, despite the apparent availability of choices, this is a VN with no alternative ends.\nOf course, that means the total content is modest. An average speed reader might be done in five hours or so.\n\n\n\nThis is a free VN, with pretty illustrations and a touching, meaningful story.

It is giving you the storybook love story, only to reveal how constructed it is, and once you remove those constructed pieces, you're left with heartache, or romance, or an endless cycle of both, because that's reality.

The two of them seem to have a history, but not quite. Myra knows him, but he does not remember her. Ever since that day Mark just can't seem to get his mind off of Myra. As Mark continues on with his daily life (going to school, hanging out with his best friends and sister), Myra continues to appear in front of him. And the story continues with Mark trying to find out what the connection is between him and Myra.\n\nPros:\n+ Somewhat Easy Achievements\n+ Has some cute moments (Chibis)\n+ Unexpected  (good but freaky)  ending\n+ The mysterious-girl theme kept me engaged\n+ Has a couple of choices\n+ Realistic\n\nNeutral:\no Music & Art (good but may be repetitive)\n\nCons:\n- The story may take a bit of time to progress\n- Few insignificant fillers\n- No voice acting (but hey, it's free)","April 2","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't played many visual novels, but seeing how people were talking about this game in the Steam reviews sparked my interest. I gave it a look and completed it 100% and I have to say this was a real roller-coaster ride. If you've never played/not played much visual novels this is a great place to start. I won't say too much but the story involves a character who is scarred from an event that happened in his life. He tries to forget what happened and continues to live his life till cruel fate catches up to him and reminds him you can't forget everything. That is the base of the whole plot, the rest you can find out yourself. And a little bit of warning, don't read too much on this game. You'll probably get spoiled by a jerk who finds it funny to ruin a beautfiul game that was made by someone who put their soul into making it, just a heads up... The characters have character. the artwork is downright charming (And gorgeous), the music is fantastic, and this game will make you feel emotions you never knew you could feel. Overall, I definitely recommend this game. And it has sparked my new-found love for visual novels.\n\nRogueTom gives this game a   9/10\nYou can't turn off the heart baby.","January 18","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a great twist in it displaying that the girl who likes the guy is actually a person who tried to impersonate a girl who liked the guy from 3 years ago, which she also tried then, but failed that time and ran off and came back. It has some amazing sketched art and sad music. You get to choose what you want to do.

Key moments boast with much appreciated details.\n\nSlight SPOILERS about the genre and subject matter at hand:\nThis VN is a dash of psychological horror, dealing with how assumptions may seem safe but not necessarily be in line with our world, and most terrifying of all,  rejection .

The character's art style is simple but great, the chosen backgrounds are good and the music was a perfect fit. The story's premise is not revolutionary but the execution and dialogue was well done. There was a few places where the dialogue felt slightly off but they did not affect my enjoyment of Sepia Tears. Overall, I feel Sepia Tears is a great visual novel and one I recommend to anyone who isn't sure whether they want to play it or not. I won't take long at around 3-4 hours.\n\nI was also surprised to see that some of the background images used were pictures of Toronto! Visual Novels aren't that well known as most games, so seeing Sepia Tears using images of Toronto was a pleasant surprise :)\n\n","May 14","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like most visual novels, Sepia Tears presents to you with choices, which will affect the characters and the direction of the story as it progresses.\n\nNow to be honest, I have never played a visual novel for a long while now. In fact this game is my second time playing one since 2012, my first one is a visual novel called Katawa Shoujo and let's just say I'm a fan of that game (Hanako FTW). Anyway, I haven't played one ever since due to my distrust of anime since as much as I love the art style of it. Most of the time, anime styled media often contains very mature content from my experience, so it has made me quite sceptical whenever I see something that's anime though there are exceptions (Katawa Shoujo is one example).\n\nAfter some time thinking if I should play the game or not, I've decided to download it and play it.\n\nAnd I do not regret it.\n\nThe art style looks great, the characters are well written and believable and the music sounds amazing. The background pictures are all right though they're not too interesting compare to Katawa Shoujo but they are all right. But the big thing I want to talk about is the story and my goodness it's so good and adorable. The story at first may seem confusing but it all nicely wraps up towards the end of the game with a very surprising twist. You are given a good amount of choices but most of them don't really have an effect on the game's story expect for the one near the end of the game.\n\nMost of the choices are kind of there to add an illusion of choice which might not be something that everyone would enjoy, but I don't mind it too much as many of them are quite funny and unexpected though there is one choice where it forces you to choose the correct one around the middle of the game but it's not related to the plot. There are many clever references to other video games and even to the concept of visual novels throughout the story, though like most anime media there are a few adult references but thankfully they are not very inappropriate and are more funny then mature. The game is a fairly short to complete compare to an entire playthrough of Katawa Shoujo, about 2 and a half hours for me to finish Sepia Tears but what you get from playing this game is worth those hours. And it's all for free.\n\nSo whatever you're a fan of anime, romance or visual novels in general, Sepia Tears is a game that I recommend for those to play. Even though it has a linear story and fewer choices unlike other visual novels such as Katawa Shoujo which has multiple paths to play through and has a lot more emotions in its stories, it does something different compare to those games and I quite liked it.\n\nThere, I said it. Now can my heart stop feeling so happy and emotional right now.","January 15","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Something about the art and music really made me feel nostalgiac, but I have no idea why. I liked the character designs and the sound track that helped build the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, I feel like certain parts were dragged out and the story was a bit over complicated. There was also a lot of references to anime which would not bother me if it didn't seem slightly overboard at times. I disliked the avoidance of saying certain things that would reference an important event to the plot.","April 21","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
