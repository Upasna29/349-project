I've just played my first game without bothering to do the tutorial or read the manual. Of course I lost, but my point is that it's easy enough to figure out how to play it as you go along. Sure, there's things I still don't understand, but my first impression is that it's a quick, fun and easy game to play, even if you don't fully understand everything that's going on.\n\nSome of the game mechanics are a little unusual, but simple enough once you get used to them. Navies are just set and forget, you send them to a sea area and they conduct battles on their own, so there's no naval manoeuvring as such, which is convenient if you just want to concentrate on the land combat. Multiple units can attack an enemy simultaneously, which is a nice touch.\n\nIt's a strategic level game of course, as the title indicates, so you have to deal with research, production, supply and so on. I didn't learn much about them in my first game but they seem straightforward enough. Compared to Hearts of Iron or Making History, this is a tiny game that focuses just on Europe. In spite of its relative simplicity (or perhaps because of), this is a great way to experience the European theatre of WW2 quickly, possibly in one sitting, which makes a nice change from games that take weeks to play.\n\nAs is typical of wargames, the graphics are hardly state of the art, but they are quite functional, and the game is highly playable as a result. They actually look better (sharper and clearer) than the screenshots above when you play it. There are options to display the map and units in different ways so you can choose the one you like the best.\n\nSome have said that the interface is confusing but it seems straightforward enough to me. Once you become familiar with it you should have no problems. Others have reported crashes and bugs, but I've encountered none so far (I've been playing it on Win XP). Some also say the music is terrible but it sounds fine to me. Maybe they just don't like the style? You can turn it off of course, if you don't like it.\n\nTo sum up, this is a fairly simple (but not too simple) game of WW2 in Europe, which can be played quickly and easily on a smallish map. It would suit anyone who's interested in WW2 and wants to replay the entire war quickly and easily, without the insane depth and complexity of games like HOI. As such I think it's an ideal introduction for newcomers to strategic scale wargames.","April 7, 2014","true","2.6"," 90 of 110 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","90","110","0","1"

If you prefer real time, micro management, or first person shooter games, this one is not for you.\n\nI rate the game 9 / 10.\n\nThere are numerous negative reviews about this game and before I purchased the game, I read every single review.  Personally, the negaitve reviews are just a big ole bunch of whining.  Here's why:\n\n1) The game will crash.   So what?   Save often or upgrade your PC. FYI autosave happens at the end of every turn.\n\n2) The navigation and unit commands are unusual.   So what?   Read the manual, its full of useful information.  Invest the time to learn how to play the game.\n\n3) The balance of play is unsatisfactory (i.e. USSR tank armies are too strong,  German forces are overwhelming).   So what?   Mod the game to your liking or figure out how to win.\n\n\nHere's why I LOVE THIS GAME.....\n\n1) It is a labratory of history.  What if Operation Sea Lion or Operation Felix were successful?  What if Germany developed an atomic weapon?  What if the Italians stayed out of Greece?  What if Spain entered the war?  What if the Warsaw uprising of 1944 held and the city reverted to Allied control in between the German and Red Armies? All of these contingencies can be played out in this game.\n\n2)  Great value for the price.  Steam just lowered the price too.\n\n3)  Takes me back to fond memories of other great grand strategic WWII wargames:  Third Reich (AH), Storm Accross Europe (C64) and High Commannd (IBM-DOS).

There are too little content for its price. I can buy two Paradox games of much greater capabilities with the same amount of money. And I suggest you to look the other way, as well.\n\nNow, what is it all about? WW2 in Europe, of course. But the title is not quite right, though. From where I stand, the "Strategic" elements in this game are its weakest spot, and you know what is the strongest? Well, the strongest will be the interface. There are not much to do but to build units, send them to direct battles and... idling for more resources. There are a "Diplomacy" button in the hud, yes... but forget about it! It is useless because there are no chance you'll get Diplomacy Points until the point you don't need them already. I mean, there are really exist a possibility to play for no-big countries like Greece or Romania, or even Ireland! But there are not a chance you'll change the course of history by playing one of them.\n\nGame mechanic is quite simple, but that's not so good trait, as you can think (as I thought buying this lame piece of code). Every country has "Resources" and a counter how fast they restock. Those "resources" in fact a single digital, and it can only be improved by conquering other lands. And if you choose Ireland , well... grab some popcorn, the only button you'll ever need is "End turn". That's a bugger, really, as there are dozen f2p facebook games, where you can actually build up your power, improving digits of manpower, morale, etc... And I'm not talking about "Hearts of Iron" or even "Civilization". This "Strategic War in Europe" in fact is dumber than f2p facebook games!\n\nAbout changing the course of history there. Let's suppose you're playing for France, and destroyed Nazi for good, defeat Germany in the early 1941. Italy becomes the leader of Axis, you defeat them as well... but at this time, Bulgary joins the Axis and becomes the leader of Axis, after defeat of Italy! Bulgary! Yeah, Very Realistic game mechanic, which reacts properly on every change in alignment. My Back!\n\nI'm not done speaking about mechanics, sorry for my rudeness. So, you have "resources" digit, it will raise with time passing, while you still have some land on your side of border. With those resources you buying units (ground, air and naval), and you can also spend some to hurry the researchers. A vague relate to Paradox titles, those researches are "infantry", "tanks", "air", "subs", "naval" and "nuclear", with tiers from 0 to 5 (although nuke has only 0/1 tier). Now! You have some units from the start, you can build more, you can transport them via railroads or boats from one end of Europe to another... in theory. In fact, you'll probably not ever use railroads or embarkment, unless you'll choose USA or England (neither of them is recommended). Basically, you just get what you have, and march on enemy lines, with some common-knowledge maneuvers, like to cut Maginot line through Belgium, And even there, in the armies basic management, we have a big disadvantage. The map is SMALL! Forget about limitrophes like Estonia! Christ, the POLAND has only 2! cities there, Warsaw and Lvov! And there are an achievement, to defend Warsaw for 5 turns. How?! The Germany always start first, so by the time you get the wheel, there are only two white-and-red ground units, so that's impossible to hold even two! rounds for Poles, no matter what you'll do (unless you'll cheat it some weird way).\n\nOkay, let's summarize:\n\n+ easy to start with, mere interface, obvious goals\n\n+ the events in the game goes along with the history books, well, except in more primitive view. Much more primitive and one-way scripted, really.\n\n- the major strategy is always build some tanks and rush to enemies cities. No artillery, very basic usage of air forces, almost useless fleets... And forget about spies and diplomacy!\n\n- the only chance to get more resources is to capture some cities, and capturing them feels... no, it doesn't provide any feelings, you're just pointing square A (your tank) above square B (any city). Booring!\n\n- the game is weak as strategy, but the achievements... well, they're the worst thing that game have, if not minding the price. Like to build 1K submarines, or infantry units. While game prompts, that it will count that thousand of units along all sessions, in truth, you need to finish that in one session, or the counter will reset. And there are absolutely no chance to have enough resourses to build that many. And I'm not even speaking about nukes there... To be frank, there is no legit way to complete achievements. Some use SAM about that game, and I can't really blame them, even if I hate SAM myself.\n\n- and what finished me, is the backup the devs give to the complaints. Just look at the community hub about the game, read some discussions, to make your own impression.\n\nMark 4.2/10 - "lame". I recommend you to stay with Hearts of Iron and Civilization titles, for way better experience. And if you are up to something different, find two KOEI games: "Operation Europe: Path to Victory" and "PTO: Pacific theather of operation". Despite the fact they were made more than 20 years ago, they a Way deeper as strategies (than this "Strategic War in Europe") and in terms of visuals, well, almost the same thing.","September 24, 2015","false","35.8"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","43","52","0","3"

While not as deep as games such as Hearts of Iron, it offers a fair amount of depth. Things like research and diplomacy are in the game, but not so detailed or timed consumer that they take away from the game. If you are looking for something fun that can be played in a few sittings then consider Strategic war in Europe.\n\nKey points of the game\n\nUnit types:\n\nThe types of units include Infantry, Mechanized, Armor, Airborne, Fighters, tactical bombers, strategic Bombers, and a verity of Naval units. Land units (except Airborne which are corps) can be bought as either army or corps. Armies are bigger and thus cost more. Depending on the size and type of unit it will be ready for deployment in 1 - 3 turns.\n\nResearch:\n\nPlayers can research, infantry, armor airplanes, navel, subs and nuclear bombs.  Nuclear bombs are only one level (you either have them or you don't) and once you do you gain a bomb every few turns which can be dropped by one of your strategic bombers.\nAll the others  come in five levels (some countries start at higher levels than others) and each level needs 100 points to reach. Players spend production points to increase research effort in the area of their choice. Any area can have up to three investments (represented by light bulbs), the first one cost 200, but the price for future ones goes down as the research gets closer to the 100 mark. For example if you buy all three investments upfront it will cost you 600 (3 * 200); but if you buy the initial 200 and wait a few turns the next investment might only cost 170. I seen it go as low as 30 when it was 87 out of the 100 needed. Of course once 100 is reached that level is unlocked and all the light bulbs go out and the player must start investing again\nNukes work slightly differently, there is only one level that needs 800 point and the initial investment is 1000 production points.\nAs new levels unlock better units can be bought at an increased price. For example if you ahve 4 levels of infantry unlocked you can buy them at any of those four levels.\n\nMod support:\n\nWhile there is not allot of stuff in the workshop yet the game does allow for mods. Want to change something, simply ask the developers on the forums and they will point you in the right direction. They even explain to one user how to remove the turn limit\n\nScenarios:\nThere are a great number of scenarios included; ranging from beginning of D-day (13 turns) to full campaign (70 turns). Other options start with Operation Barbarossa and even a what if, that has the Allies fighting the Russians after the fall of Germany\n\nPlay as any country or countries:\nOne thing I really like is the ability to play as multiple countries. Where most games let you only play one, here you can play as many as you like. This really helps in saturations like the invasion of Russia where in many games the players German troops get stuck behind the AI Italian or minor axis allies forces.  In fact if you want to play as all the axis, all the allies or as Russia there is even a quick start where you pick a faction and control all the nations in it\n\nDifficulty set by country:\n\nYou can set the difficulty level for each country in the game. The different levels adjust how much income the nations receives. This allows you to boost or subtract from nations for some interesting what if. Say the Italian economy was more in line with the other nations, or America was not the economic powerhouse that it turned out to be.\n\nCONS:\n\nLike any game Strategic War in Europe does come with its faults. The two biggest are: Random crashes and achievements not opening up. In both cases the developers are on the forums discussing the issues and are actively working the solution","May 27, 2014","true","15.5"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","39","49","0","1"

The game has several playable scenarios and you can play as any of the axis or allied countries (or multiple). Overall the game is fun and the ability to play different countries makes playing multiple games interesting. You can also choose to nerf or boost individual countries. The game also incorporates some of the historical treaties and invasions of WWII and prompts a player to follow history or go a different way. Playing a single scenario may take 5-10 hours.\n\nA strength of the game is the number of combinations of land, air, and sea units. Land units can be pne of three: infantry, mechanized, or armor. Air units include fighters, tactical bombers, and stategic bombers. Sea units include three types of the following: subs, cruisers, aircraft carriers, and battle ships. These different types coupled with indiviudal unit strengths, levels, experience, and the ability to assign a handful of historical commanders to some of the units creates a variety of attacking strengths.\n\nThe negatives would be the AI, lack of Pacific Theater and network play. The AI is fair adept but after replaying it becomes easier and easier to counter upcoming moves. However, this AI is far superior to the AI in the Hasbro Axis and Allies game. The game would be greatly enhanced if the map were expanded to include the Japanese empire. By far the biggest downfall of the game is the ability to play against others online...you simply can't. The game has a play by email option which is almost laughable. I guess they figured nobody would be willing to find someone to play long enough to finish a scenario. Too bad the game makers didn't break down the scenarios into smaller chunks and add network games.\n\nIf you are fan of the Axis and Allies board game and looking for a good strategy game, this is a good choice. I would rate it an 8 out of 10.","December 6, 2014","true","137.7"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

You can take command of any of the countries represented in European theatre of WW2, including the small ones, you can also direct several countries, so if you want to e.g. control all Axis, it is possible. The economy and research are very simple, with the main stress placed on combat. The basic scale is corps size, but you can divide and merge units too, which gives a lot of control. In the spirit of simplicity the game displays actual effective strength, not the size of the unit, so you do not need to calculate things like lack of supply commanders etc. Land combat works really well, even modelling things like sieges. Unfortunately naval combat is a bit obscure and boring (especially sub raiding, with the results hidden in advanced reports and not displayed). Still, the game is really fun, easy to mod and occupies the middle ground between simplistic and very complicated wargames.","March 23, 2014","true","5.3"," 41 of 59 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","41","59","0","0"

It’s often compared to Time of Fury as being smaller—in terms of scale and the time allowed to complete the game. Instead of a monstrous 300 turns, like some scenarios in Time of Fury, it only takes 70 turns to play the entire struggle from 1939-1945. The map covers an area from Norway in the north, North Africa and the Middle East in the south, the Urals in the east, and the Coast of the US and Canada in the west. It's at grand strategy level, which means you're focused on the larger scope of the war rather than every individual battle.Okay, so how does it play? It's quite good, for a budget title. It isn't as overwhelming as Hearts of Iron can be; it’s very manageable in terms of micromanagement. However, there are some technical issues that need to be corrected. The game can be a bit buggy at times. I had some issues with the sound which led to the game running really sluggish. I liked how the developers tried to simplify things, and it wasn’t too much. By comparison, the turn times are much faster than Time of Fury. It's moddable as well—this will add more enjoyment to the game. It fits in that happy medium of a grand strategy game focused in World War 2 Europe—a medium that strategy gamers like. This is a game that can be finished in a few hours rather than days or weeks.

For example, games like Panzer General, Making history, Axis and Allies or even Diplomacy to name a few.  In truth, the closest I could think of to matching this format of game would be the old Avalon Hill tabletop game by the name of Rise and fall of the Third Reich circa 1970s. Although naturally this version is simpler or perhaps even somewhat overly simplified, it is not without its more pleasant charms. For example; the combat system is far less clumsy as well as boasting a production system that is not only fun and innovative but also more than a little challenging.\n\nBefore getting to that point however, it must be immediately noted that a patch will be required for anyone running Windows 7 or later. I found the necessary patch on Google, I admit it did take some patience and require no little amount of venting frustration but in the end I am more than pleased with the total game experience. The simple truth is, this is not a game for the arcade player or the typical armchair general.This game will require the player to command at least some knowledge of the second world war in Europe. The A.I.is not overwhelmingly challenging so much as it is historically based. When playing Germany for example, a typical player will most likely be tempted to over-run Poland as quickly as possible in order to focus more quickly on France. What sets this game apart however; is that the allies will not deal with German aggression simply militarily. In fact I have found a refreshing change with this game lies along the channels of diplomacy and containment. In truth the scope is limited only by the imagination and the options available are as broad as one's own individual planning. In short this may be the first wargame set in Europe in which I truly feel that neither side has a clear advantage.\n\nNone of this is to say that this particular version is not without its faults or problems. If anything I see it as a "concept game". Innovations in this game may eventually find their way into future ideas.\n\nIn conclusion I would recommend this game, if for no other reason, than the price is reasonable and as a "beer and pretzels" concept, it does succeed in delivering what it advertises, no more or less.\n\nWith the Pacific theater version, "Storm over the Pacific" now available, I hope to eventually try that one as well for a full war experience.\n\nHope I was helpful.\n\nJim","June 18, 2014","true","2.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","2"

I don't understand why people call this game a "SIMPLE TURN BASED STRATEGY GAME" to me this game is quite complex and might be worth the asking price of $15 for fans of the genre, but you can wait for a discount just to be safe that it caters to your taste. There is a pretty big variety of troops to chose from since you can control dozens of countries each turn if you so chose to, but it sure isn't newbie friendly.\n\nREPLAYABILITY\nIf you're a fan of the genre you might quickly fall in love with this game, you're not limited to a few factions but instead you control the countries of your choosing and their whole armies and resources, you can have fun turning the tide of World War 2 and with your strategic mastery you may put the world at your heels. It's a little confusing to know when you have reached each stage's main objective though since you can continue playing until you conquer the whole of Europe or get stomped completely (I hate you Russia).\n\nGAMEPLAY I have never been a great macro management strategy gamer, I have enjoyed completing the RTS campaign in Starcraft, Age of Empires 2 and Age of Mythology back in the day, I even played some online matches with some friends but I've never been an RTS buff. That said, the tutorial isn't very polished and sea units are very confusing to keep track of, at least for someone who hasn't played an RTS in a decade and want to try a simple strategy title, SIMPLE as this title is advertised by a lot of people but I consider that it isn't. After some tweaking you can get to see the map as hexagons and the individual Units display is very friendly to know the unit's remaining HP and Action Points, other than that I don't find it pretty newbie friendly at all, I'm more used to turn based RPGs that involve micro management instead of macro management.\n\nAESTHETIC The visuals are pretty pleasing, you can change the display of the map and the units to suit more your personal taste but I find it very good, although I must point out that everything is static and when the unit attacks you just get some sounds so it's basically a board game re-imagined as a PC game, and there's nothing wrong with that, heck that's why a lot of people call it a "simple RTS".\n\nSTORY\nNow I should applaud the devs for this because they did their history homework, they tell you about some key war events that you may decide to fulfill exactly as history tells or you may decide to write your own history (like honoring some peace treaties or attack former allies, or decide to deploy some historic squads into North Africa or deploy them in Europe). I did enjoy the historic content of this game, I only missed some key figures descriptions and added bonuses for historic accuracy, like having important generals such as Rommel or Montgomery with some description and a bonus if they commanded tank troops per example, but this was just a missed opportunity.\n\nMUSIC The sounds are nice and the music is pretty good, although you don't have control over it and it's just an epic playlist on repeat (about 10 songs or so), so after you had your share of hours some of the tunes might seem pretty repetitive to listen to again and again. Still, I enjoyed to listen to this game's score since it's pretty epic.","September 18, 2014","true","5.1"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","0"

It's a simple to learn game with plenty of tactics involved. I'd consider Strategic War in Europe a good introduction into the Grand Strategy genre.\n\nThere's a decent variety of units, all of which can either be leveled through battles, or you can spend extra in training them so that they come out at the level you want. There's a basic research and diplomacy which I found a bit disappointing, but I still enjoyed the game.\n\nThere are several small bugs in the game, UI mostly, and compared to Paradox Interactive's Grand Strategies, the visual map and map modes are bare in comparison to put it nicely. But it's not a game breaker. They do offer 2 map skins and 3 unit skins, so there's some customization there.\n\nOverall, I think $15 is a bit much considering the bugs and lackluster map modes, but I'd still recommend, since it's a fun game. I'd wait until a sale, $5, maybe $10 at most.","January 15, 2015","true","4.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","1"

Its sort of like a more involved axis and allies. This game is quite good, it is both accessible and deep. This is for patient people who enjoy thinking about strategy and then employing it. It takes a playthrough or two to really get a feel of everything. Reading the manual is highly recommended. Also great for any fan of WW2 as there are many historical points where you can choose how the war plays out. I have not encountered any bugs, game runs very well on my modest system. You can customize the game in a lot of ways, if you want to control entire alliances or just a single country you can do so. I love the hearts of Iron series but this game is like an 'arcade' version of that, in my opinion. Very fun, well made title. I'm glad Steam is putting out some real wargames like this and look forward to more in the future.","June 9, 2014","true","13.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

However, I liked the idea of a more in-depth level of game play enough to give SWiE a genuine try. I've only played it for a few hours up to this point, but I'm already glad I decided to give it a chance.\n\nAnother review mentioned the fact the the UI is difficult to come to grips with. I have to agree that at first it's a little overwhelming just because of the number of options you have. I'm not accustomed to considering land, sea, and air units as being so very different, for instance. It took me a few minutes to understand how to fly recon to find enemies, use fighters to attack enemy fighters, and then attack ground units with bombers. Those who are familiar with the genre may laugh, but it honestly left me scratching my head for a moment or two. However, after playing through the tutorials once (or maybe twice, lol) I started to get a feel for the controls and in very little time I was moving armies across Europe and crushing my enemies under foot.\n\nAfter just a few minutes I got tired of playing Germany in a campaign I was at least loosely familiar with and decided to play as Norway in-stead. As soon as Germany declared war on me I sent my very small army down to North Africa and helped the Allies drive the Nazis out. I know that's not exactly conventional, but it's the kind of game play I love.\n\nOne of the most interesting things about SWiE (at least in my opinion) is that you can play as the “little guys” in WW2 and try to shift the balance of power. In my last game I played as Finland and managed to hold out against the Russians until the very end of the game. (It can be done, believe it or not.) I wasn't able to destroy vast armies or take over most of Europe, but I denied Russia Production Points (which amounts to currency) from the very beginning of the game. The Germans mopped them and I was able to have a hand in it.\n\nI anticipate many hours of enjoyable play as I try to help one side or the other overthrow the world with some outlandish and off the wall strategy. And up to this point I've only scratched the surface. I still know next to nothing about diplomacy, I've only ever made one amphibious assault, I've never built an air-force, or even been in a major naval battle.\n\nThere's a great deal to this game for those who are willing to take the time to look. If you genuinely enjoy WW2 strategy I feel Strategic War in Europe is certainly worth your time.\n\nOn thing worth knowing is that the manual can be downloaded here:\n\nhttp://www2.wastelands-interactive.com/shared/Strategic_War_in_Europe_Manual.pdf\n\nIt's the kind of game where the manual is actually useful.","March 22, 2014","true","26.9"," 44 of 82 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","44","82","0","3"

This game crashes a lot, mainly after saving game (either manual or auto save). It happened to me once, that autosave, after/during which the game crashed, has simply disappeared and that was the only save for the current game. So when you want to end your turn, the game tries to create autosave and crashes, sometimes it crashes a bit further - when it is calculating supplies. My best score is restarting the game 5 times in a row, after crash on the same turn.\n\nAbout achievements: it's hard to max this game out. REALLY HARD\nProblem here are the crashes ofc (after crash, I haven't got any achievement in the continued campaign), but also the fact, that partial scores are sent to steam only at certain levels, i.e. you want to get 1000 infantry achievement? you have to build 250 in a single campaign for this partial value to register ...","October 17, 2015","false","40.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Others have reported problems using very high resolutions to play ( i personally run 1280x1024 and have no problems with screen/buttons etc,etc) Now for the game itself i haven't had it crash after making these changes and would give the game a solid B-. It's not as hard or confusing and micromanged as Hearts of Iron and just a bit more complex than the old Axis and Allies pc game or board game.

Twice I have lost by 1942, on "normal" difficulty.\n\nI have many tech level 2 infantry armies by the time the Germans attack in the summer of 41, right on cue, but I am steamrolled by Panzer armies of 20+ strength. My best infantry armies have a strength of 8 at best. My two armored armies and three morotorized armies are similarly destroyed as if they were infantry corps. The strength of the german panzer units is just ridiculous.\n\nThey did not appear to have an air force, but then neither did I besides the two starting fighters, as one fighter is priced the same as 4 infantry armies. I was able to knock out the Baltic states and Finland after the pact with Germany triggered, sustaining no losses and narrowing my front.\n\nIt's not a matter of strategy or tactics. I have my defensive line dug in in the best defensive terrain available, behind rivers whenever possible. This is nothing new to anyone that has played this sort of game before. My armies are commanded by the best generals I have. I try to fall back before the onslaught, using defensive terrain. I have fresh reserves of infantry armies dug in around Leningrad, Moscow, and Stalingrad. It matters not. They are rolled up by the spring of 1942, as while the winter impacted the movement points of the German legions, it did nothing to diminish their strength. They were well supplied and equipped, without a hint of trouble in their lines of supply as I retreated across the Urals again.\n\nLook, the Germans should be kicking ♥♥♥ in 1941. I don't know if there are triggered events later on that lower the strength of their units as they get deeper in to Russia, but I'm not making it that far. The math just doesn't work when you've got a dozen 20 strength units that can wipe away your strength 7 units without taking losses.\n\nThere is a nice skeleton of a casual strategy game here, but it needs more work before I could reccomend this to anyone. At this point, I regret to say that it is not really worth the $7 I spent on it, without some serious updates.","July 4, 2014","false","11.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","1"

If you've got the most incredible patience, this might be a playable alternative to RISK. I've never been so offput by a UI in my life, this is certainly an experience.\n\nIf you do play this game, leave a comment or review on the mechanics. I'm going to go enjoy my migraine now.","March 21, 2014","false","3.9"," 85 of 185 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","85","185","0","9"

It has enough variety of units and technologies to be interesting but not too much to create a micromanagement headache.\nIt is a fun quick game that is still fun to replay. Especially with the ability to play as either one of the major or minor powers.\nAlthough there is no editor, many of the scenario files are text editable so you can change many aspects of the games, including adding new events.\n\n\n","November 24, 2015","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice 2D graphics, many bugs, simple game mechanics. If you're looking for a game with some depth or difficulty, look elsewhere. If you're new to the genre and find it for 1$ or less, maybe.","December 27, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
