Some... product."\nI'm baffled as to why this would ever be ported to the PC. I understand making it for 360 and PS3, since there's no native port of DOOM 3 for those consoles. But a gimped version that offers almost nothing new and downgrades everything old, has no place on the platform that already has the perfect, definitive version of the game. This is a downgrade.\n\nFirst thing's first - at the end of the day, this is still DOOM 3. Despite all the downgrades, most (but not all) of the stuff that made DOOM 3 so great and fun to play is still here. BFG Edition doesn't butcher DOOM 3's gameplay too much.\n\nThere are changes, though, most of which are for the worse: the original flashlight mechanic, that a lot of the level design and lighting in DOOM 3 is built around, has been completely stripped out and replaced with the Duct Tape mod with no option of switching it back; despite selling itself as an 'enhanced' port, BFG Edition looks worse than the original version on Ultra settings thanks to low-res textures, messed up lighting and blurry visuals; the gameplay is made pitifully easy thanks to pickups yielding significantly more ammo than ever before, and the maximum storage capacity for your guns being dramatically increased, ensuring that it becomes impossible for you to ever run out of ammo; almost all advanced graphical options have been stripped out of the options menu; even the added ports of the original two DOOM games have been censored (seriously, we're in the 201X's, and nazi content is still too controversial to have in a video game?)\n\nThe only new content that BFG Edition provides is a couple of new campaigns for DOOM 2, and DOOM 3. 'The Lost Misison' for DOOM 3 is an absolute insult. No worthwhile new story content and levels that almost entirely consist of level sections and set pieces from previous DOOM 3/RoE levels. If you've already played the D3 and RoE campaigns, then there is absolutely nothing new here. The new DOOM 2 episode 'No Rest For The Living', on the other hand, is actually pretty good, with some creative level designs and massive enemy encounters. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but it alone cannot justify the BFG Edition as a purchase.\n\nThere's also achievements now, but I hope you're not planning on taking any screenshots during the whole campaign, because the game detects that as cheating and disables achievements, forcing you to restart your progress.\n\nOne of my biggest gripes with BFG Edition, though, is the multiplayer aspect, or rather lack thereof. Despite co-op being one of the most popular DOOM 3 mods, and even the original Xbox port being smart enough to include split-screen co-op, BFG Edition has opted not to include any native co-op modes, neither online or local. The multiplayer, as it stands, is now dead. The matchmaking system (no server browser available) is unable to ever find any other players.\n\nNow you might be considering purchasing BFG Edition just for the convenience of having multiple DOOM games in one place, for one purchase, but even that ends up being a poor choice. I believe I have established that every game contained within has been gimped and is inferior to their original counterparts. And these originals are also available on Steam, that you can get for less money. The 'DOOM Classic Complete' bundle and the 'DOOM 3 Pack' combined cost less than BFG Edition does, and they give you more content. You won't get the new campaigns from BFG, but you will get 'Master Levels for DOOM 2' and 'Final DOOM' (which itself consists of two seperate DOOM games). BFG Edition also has a greatly inflated filesize for how little content it has, due to duplicate assets within its files.\n\nAll of these points, I believe, is enough to support my stance that there is absolutely no reason to buy BFG Edition over the orignal version of DOOM 3 (or preferably the bundles mentioned above). It isn't an upgrade in any significant way, and, in fact, is only a downgrade.","October 11, 2015","false","43.0"," 855 of 1,099 people (78%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","78","855","1","50","95"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavageBeastZero/recommended/208200/","SavageBeastZero","SavageBeastZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavageBeastZero/","609 products in account","Introduction\n\nDOOM BFG Edition is a collection of the prior DOOM releases in their most complete form as stated by ID software themselves. Let's find out if that statement holds true or if this release spelled a different kind of DOOM for the franchise?\n\nOverview\n\nDOOM 3 BFG Edition is a collection of games that defined the first person shooter genre across multiple generations. From DOOM, DOOM II, DOOM 3, and DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil, along with The Lost Missions, each had their own impact on the genre of varying success. This release is headlined by DOOM 3: BFG a "remastered" version of 2004's well recieved title which is considered a classic by many. So does this remaster bring enough to the table to be considered exactly that?\n\nGraphics & Optimization Quality\n\nNOTE: Most importantly this section of the review is going to focus more on covering the remastered version of DOOM 3 and it's dlc content, titled DOOM 3: BFG Edition. This is simply due to the fact that the other content in regards to DOOM I and II are direct re-releases of the originals with no changes being made.\n\nSo what exactly constitutes this as being a remaster? Well......Not much. Listed below are exactly what graphics options are available to you in game which are meager to say the least.\n\nResolution - (Windowed - Full Screen - Up to 4K)\nFrame Control (60 - 120 - Unlimited)\nVertical Sync (Enabled or Disabled)\nAnti-Aliasing (Up to 8x)\nMotion Blur (Up to 64x)\nTexture LOD Bias\n3D Options (varying)\n\nNow although there aren't many options overall, what's there serves for future functionality and that's really what's most important at least in terms of easily applied in game available resolutions that will be displayed without issues on today's current HD monitors and screens.\n\nWhere is the Texture Quality Option?\n\nNow that's where we run into another slight issue. As many fans of the previously released DOOM 3 know, there were texture pack mods available on the net that exceeded the BFG versions texture resolution quality. In comparison this releases textures are blurry when played at higher reolutions yet, still actually look acceptable overall if and only if considering this is a simple port of the Xbox 360 version.\n\nYet, that's not how something should be judged, should it? So with that being said, in regards to the textures quality in game, they simply don't meet the quality expectations that a gamer had come to expect on PC in 2012 (when this was released), let alone in 2015.\n\nFrame Control, Vertical Sync and Anti-Aliasing are all basic graphics settings that aren't exactly something to write home about, expected but, still welcome. Motion Blur is either a hit or a miss for many PC gamers but, is in fact presented here nonetheless, which is a bit odd due to the fact that there were so many other options begging to be within this package that would have served this  remaster and the series fans much, much better. Once again, nothing much to say in regards to texture LOD, other than it does what it's supposed to do as per usual, yet with lack luster results due to the lack of high quality resolution texture packs presented directly from ID software.\n\n3D Options\n\nNow this is where things actually get interesting. If DOOM 3: BFG is played in 3D the experience in quite an upgrade to the previous original installment. When enabled, the experience is almost surreal in certain ways, especially so if each in game setting is maxxed out. Sadly though, the amount of PC gamers that actually have the ability to experience this fantastic video mode are extrememly limited. So much so that, this once again becomes an almost irrelevant feature in the grand scope of things. Not many PC gamers have 3D enabled monitors, let alone the hardware to operate and utilize it.\n\nSo with that being said, if you do in fact (like myself) have the hardware necessary, you'll be in for an interesting DOOM 3 experience. Sadly though, I'm speaking to an incredibly small user base.\n\nOptimization\n\nO.k, here we go.....Considering the incredible lack of in game options which, of them none are especially resource intensive, DOOM 3: BFG most definitely isn't a highly optimized port. Will you be able to run it with respectable resolution and in game settings? Yes, more than likely pending you possess the required graphics hardware. Will you be able to run it fully maxxed out (Including 3D) without issues? Most likely not, regardless of the hardware you possess, which is unacceptable. Yet, considering most users wouldn't be utilizing the 3D options anyways, this doesn't hurt the experience, but is an injustice to the series fans who supported them financially upon release.\n\nGameplay Quality\n\nAny previous fans of the series know there's nothing new here, but that doesn't mean that there's anything else that should have been either. The DOOM experience in a whole is considered by many (myself included) to be the pinnacle of the true single player fps experience. Intense, exlierating and downright frightening and that last one has nothing to do with the graphics and never did. It's created by the impending doom of being chased by and immense amount of npc's who do not stop coming after you, leaving you no time to prepare so, your only option is to run, strafe and generally flee in fear until you see an option to peck away at them one by one, with the general outcome being...you're dead.\n\nWhich is fantastic! The original DOOM games and to a lesser extent DOOM 3 were created during a time that the general fps skill base on an entry level were on a totally different scale. These games were created to challenge you to the fullest, while giving you crumbs in return for your efforts, all the while turning you into a DOOM fan like many of us who have come before you.\n\nStory & Multiplayer Experience\n\nDOOM GUY > GETS ATTACKED BY > OUTER DIMENSIONAL HELL DEMONS > DOOM GUY > GETS ANGRY > DOOM GUYS RETALIATES > WITH > THE SUPER SHOTGUN > DOOM GUY > RUNS OUT OF AMMO > DOOM GUY FLEES > A DEMON CHASES > DOOM GUY> 100 DEMONS NOW CHASE > DOOM GUY > DEMONS LOST HIM > DOOM GUY > RETURNS WITH > THE BFG > ALL OF THE DEMONS > = DEAD.......Nuff said!\n\nIf this were during the original release of DOOM 3 in 2004 the online experience would have been brimming with players on any given hour. Yet, sadly the same can't be said about this remastered edition. There simply isn't anyone playing this online anymore but, that doesn't mean you can't get some friends together and frag til' your hearts content.\n\nSound Quality\n\nConsidering there are multiple titles in this release, I suppose the best thing for me to convey is that each releases sound design was exceptional during their time and surpassed anything else on the market at their respective times. Agurably so, the DOOM series stands as a figurehead of the industry and always has in terms of sound design. So each game within the confines of this collection will undoubtably brim with nostalgia and were often later copied by far too many develpers throughout history..... Simply put, just open a door and let the sounds of nostalgia echo throughout.\n\nReplay Value & The Bottom Line\n\nIt's DOOM for goddsake, people are still playing the original release since it was published. In terms of replay value, it doesn't get much better than this. BFG edition contains the entire DOOM franchise all in one fairly tidy package, you'll easily get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of it. Rough edges aside, this collection is arguably one of the best of all time and deserves a place in any fps library. Just as long as you consider this release an Ultimate Collection, instead of the remaster they wanted you to believe it was.\n\nFinal Judgement: Add it to cart and enjoy your DOOM!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405330961","June 23, 2015","true","51.9"," 234 of 290 people (81%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","81","234","290","20","22"

You only get Ultimate DOOM, DOOM2 and 8 levels made by Nerve Software named No Rest For The Living.\n(nerve.wad, pull it out of BFG and stick it in your WAD collection)\n\nOnly buy the BFG edition for the Lost Mission and the Nerve DOOM2 levels, otherwise play the originals.\n(I'm not a reviewer I just wanted to clear these things up as they bugged me so much, don't expect expertly written or usual reviews from me)","October 28, 2015","false","40.4"," 248 of 321 people (77%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","77","248","321","16","6"

It includes Doom 3 HD, Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil, the Doom 3 Lost Mission (8 level pack), Doom 2, Doom 2: No Rest for the Wicked and Ultimate Doom 1. The major focus on this is the HD version of Doom 3. For those of you who don't know, its an action FPS, but with how dark, slow and gory it is I'd say its more of a survival horror FPS. This version plays better than the original Doom 3, just with the tweaks such as using a gun and a flash light instead of one or the other. The movement speed has been improved, an autosave function is in there too as well along with numerous other things you'll never notice. Even these small tweaks make the game just seem more fun and less challenging. The downside is no mods like the original Doom 3. Sure people will still complain about how pitch black it can be without a light, the weapons not having an impact and the numerous monster closets, but this is a good game in my opinion.\n\nAs a game, Doom 3 has more of a story to it, which it didn't need. You're the new guy on Mars and within a level or two of getting acclimated, eventually fit hits the shan and you'll be battling zombies, mutants and creatures from Hell or Mars. Whichever. The game really stands on its horrific graphics, even after all of these years. While the action is slower than the old Doom games and it does feel like a very straight forward game with far less linear levels than the original, there are places to explore and puzzles to solve.\n\nSince it is Mars, you'll get to walk the surface of the planet where you'll need Oxygen to survive. You'll also experience a really awesome level in Hell, but mostly you're inside of futuristic bases. With such a long 20 hour game, the metallic walls, dark ambient lighting and pipes all begin to feel the same. Sure there are different colors, med labs, offices, boiler rooms and scenes of blood and mutilation, but its over and over again. A lot of it feels like you're in a diesel submarine fighting creatures.\n\nYou'll start with a pistol and move on to a machine gun, shotgun and a chaingun. Eventually, you'll find the rocket launcher, plasma launcher, BFG and grenades. The weapons don't feel that good or impactful. Shooting a shotgun close range will do far more damage than long range, unlike the original Doom 1 that you could snipe with it. The grenades don't feel that good to use, because they are their own weapon not some secondary weapon like in most games where you throw it. That makes the grenades feel useless unless you need to drop a grenade to a monster below. Eventually you'll find 'the Artifact' that can be thrown as a bladed weapon, bouncing off of walls and shredding through enemies.\n\nEnemies come in a variety of sizes. Big bulbous cacodemos fly around shooting balls of lightning, mancubus are fat and take a lot of bullets while their dual cannons bellow fireballs. A towering, rocket shooting horn headed cyberdemon. Flying skulls, six legged human head spiders. A boss that is half man half tank and little half baby half insect creatures. It is all beautiful, grotesque horror that debuts each creature with a brief cut scene. That's something the first game didn't have. Cut scenes. There are a few story cut scenes, but thankfully they are less and less frequent.\n\nEach of the enemies has a revamp. Enemies are somewhat intelligent, while zombies will just come shambling toward you, smarter enemies will hide and take cover. They'll eve awkwardly sidestep your bullets. The levels just never really accentuate the enemy intelligence. Most levels are straight forward, so everything will be dead with no chance to flank you or get behind you organically. There are still monster closets, doors that open up behind you and have enemies or some enemies like imps will just teleport in behind you. Some found it annoying.\n\nBFG Edition also comes with the expansion pack Resurrection of Evil for Doom 3. This is a good sized campaign that introduces the double barreled shotgun and a grabber gun, similar to the Half Life gravity gun that will allow you to grab barrels and enemy projectiles to throw at enemies. That's not the only similarity between the Half Life games, the wall health and Doom 3's story seems to have been inspired by Half Life 1. The expansion pack also offers more abilities that will allow you to slow time, give invulnerability and give berserk which doubles your weapon power. Each ability will help you deal with the new bosses in the game and traverse the levels.\n\nNow for the big reason Doom 3 fans would get this game, the new expansion / level pack called 'the Lost Levels.' Is it worth $20? no. Is it worth $10? Probably not, but there is still a lot of value with the whole package.\n\nNext up are the first two Doom games all the way back from 1994 and 1995. The Ultimate Doom is 4 episodes of Doom 1. The first 3 episodes of 8 - 9 levels each and a bonus episode. Its still every bit as fun as it was back then. Bright, vibrant, you move like a racecar, great enemy variety and weapons. The levels feel open and offer a lot of variety. You'll collect keys and open doors, pull switches. You can do everything easily and freely. You can snipe with a shotgun or pistol. There is no vertical mouse aim. If you are horizontally aimed at an enemy and shoot, your bullets will go up or down toward the enemy.\n\nDoom 2 is also the same engine as Doom 1, but with more enemy types and 32 levels all in 1 episode. But wait, there's a bonus episode of 8 levels from 2010 made for X-Box Live. This 8 level pack has great detailed maps with a good challenge for veterans.\n\nOn top of that, the original 2 Dooms, there are 20 levels of extra levels, some of which are awesome others.... not so much. While there are mods for Doom 3, for whatever reason, mod support IS NOT IN DOOM 3 BFG. Not sure why, but whatever.\n\nIn all, its worth $10, maybe even $20, but wait for a sale. Chances are anyone interested in Doom has already had the first two games. This is a quick cash grab from iD. Everything is still a lot of fun to play especially with Doom 3's tweaks, but just wait for a sale.","July 18, 2013","true","21.3"," 172 of 217 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","172","217","0","0"

It's not a perfect game, and it's not exactly like the original two, but it's a solid horror shooter with great style, mood and combat. Unfortunately the "BFG Edition" is a step back in most ways, worse than the original game on PC.\n\nFirst off the lighting changes are for the worse. Everything is brighter, but Doom 3 is meant to be dark. The textures look worse under harsh lighting and the mood of each level is thrown off considerably. Even on a gameplay level this matters, since many ammo clips and armor packs were previously hidden in darkness, but now stand right out. The flashlight, long a thing people have complained about needing to switch to, can now be on permanently, but this ruins a lot of the level design and mood of the game. To be blunt: this game and these levels were not meant to be seen under bright lights, and the gameplay is thrown off by the changes as well as the visuals.\n\nOther changes annoy. Quicksaves now pause the action and pop up a menu prompt, which throws off the pace and takes you out of the game. The in game touch screens seem less fluid for some reason, and the PDA is now designed more for a gamepad than a mouse. On top of this the game takes a lot more HDD space, a lot more GPU power and has less ability for tweaking, which will annoy if you want to play it on an older machine or laptop.\n\nThe only reason to get this on PC is for the "lost levels," eight additional levels exclusive to this release. The problem here is that Doom 3 and its original expansion are already so long and packed with content you don't really need any more, and these added levels look identical to the main game and play worse, since they aren't as well designed. Just not worth the effort, let alone the money.\n\nI knew the BFG edition wasn't perfect, but I didn't expect it to be worse than playing the original. That makes it worse than a pointless release, it makes it a damaging release.","December 12, 2013","false","0.6"," 1,060 of 1,556 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","060","1","0","67"

I know, i built his cage..."\n\nThis is the 3rd Installment in a Massive (Or even Revolutionary if you\nwant) Franchise. (Buckle up this is a Big Review)\nNow DooM 3 was a very Noticeably Different Game when Compared with the prevous 2\ninstallments in the series. It was to keep  up with gamers, Graphics cards and\nDemands. Of course it got much criticism for being so different from the older games\nbecause it lacked many features that were highly wanted. (eg. Co-op, More\nMultiplayer Features and Custom Maps. All of those could be foound in the previous\ngames...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688430529\nAnyway, this game contains 3 games and 2 DLC almost the whole series at the\ntime of release (If you dont count TnT, Plutonia Experient, Brutal DooM and Final\nDooM). And this is Great! content= more playtime= money's Worth...Right? We'll See\nin this review!\n\nFirst of all if you want to get the full DooM experience, no mods, better graphics,\nmuch more content, Diverse range of achievements, more Gameplay Options...Keep Reading\nHowever! If you want to get a mod avaliable (Co-op), true horror\nexperience (Take the Flashlight system for example), Simpler Multiplayer system, and\noverall a much more difficult Shooter...Buy DooM 3. Custom Maps, Monsters, Weapons\netc. all on here...with a bit of effort of course.\n\nOk now that thats out of the way, lets break down the main Points of the Game (DooM 3 and the DLC)\n\nPros:\n-Price on SALE is very Proportional to the Content recieved.\n-Occulus friendly, if you can get it to work...\n-Graphics is definetely Improved\n-Lots more options too in the menu\n-Smooth Performance (50-65 if your PC can)\n-Overflowing with Content (At least 60 to 80 hours through everything.)\n-Controller Support too!\n-Boss Fights are on a Big Scale and dont play around..\nWhat it lacks in Story it makes up for with the Amazing  Dark Magic that is...The\nCommand Console. Many options to be played around with here.\n-Achievments are for all 3 games (And the 2 DLC) and are quite balanced. ROE on\nNightmare might take the Longest...\n-ROE could have easily been made into a sequel along with some other content but\nthey chose to leave it where it belongs.\n-Weapons are quite balanced in Multiplayer. Balanced being a strong word when most people use Rocket Launchers...\n-The Level Design of some parts of DooM and the DLC are amazing, take Hell for example. Its so unique compared to the rest of the Metallic Blood stained doorways of the main game. also the Final few levels have a Ruins, Aged Feel to them. No Spoilers here\n\nCons:\nIMPORTANT (For the Fellow Screenshotters)\nThe Fricking DEFAULT Key for Screenshots is F12 so when you enter it for the first time in the middle of a game (Hopefully early on), the Games Console system (Invisible bugger) detects that as some type of command input and promptly turns off any and all Achievments still to get for the Session. Easy fix is to change the screenshot key to something more comfortable and then restart the session. Enabling the Console later on is risky when you have achievements still to get, Especially in Mutliplayer. Save the Spawning and Manual-Commanding for the After Party please :D or make a Seperate Save just in case.\n-Ammo is Plentiful, too plentiful. you might even walk around a corner and pick up some without noticing. This isnt how Semi-Horror Shooters werent meant to be played!! Especially before bosses (Which give away the Surprise of the Concept..)\n-Bye Bye Mods! Ill Miss you!\n-Story is crap, its basically being fed to you on a drip. Kill x ammount of Demons and the next Cutscene/ Objective shows up! Rinse and Repeat.\n-Enemies are Dumb and can get stuck easily, BUT they can even end up fighting each other if you manage..\n-Guns have no Variation, But this is alright in some parts, especially Multiplayer! Balanced is the Key word here.\n-Without little things like the seperate Flashlight from DooM 3, it makes the Experience a Standard Action one, which i alright. except if a horror experience is exactly what you wanted (I know i did.)\n-Enemies have little Variation. More Enemies (Maybe 10?) would make it a weapon switching wonder in the tight Hallways.\n-The Final Boss Battle is just...Terrible, Find ONE Weakness and then Rinse and Repeat that (Plus minor Enemies) untill the end.\nDooM 3 is Very Linear and doesnt Lead on to ROE well at all. One major Plot point might be enough, but many were expecting more!\n-Many Minor Bugs, Crashes and even Loss of Save data (only once for 405 hours...)\n-Autosaved right before, getting instakilled? Too Bad! That ones Straight from New Vegas unfortunetely..\n\nOk, thats a lot of Points! thanks for reading them all. Now Ill just Summarise the Brief Components that make this BFG Edition\n\nGraphicsYES, a nice fresh, refined version of DooM 3's Blocky Style. Mixed with 3D, 120FPS and even Occulus its a very attractive Combo.\n\nStoryNot a Chance, its no Masterpiece in that Department, but it fits well with the Demonic, Mars and Mysterious Atmosphere. Still its very linear (Which is all too common for Shooters these days) and Average really.\n\nContentMIXED\nLots of Fun to be Had here! Many things to do, from Watching a Cyber-demon vs a Spider-Mastermind fight Arena-Style in DooM 1 to playing Super Turbo Turkey puncher 3 on an Arcade Machine in DooM 3. Theres clearly lots to Gib, pick-up, shoot, Strafe, Blast and Discover. But because its very Linear (Go there, pick up that shoot that,etc.), once you have done all you can. theres little to no replay value. :(\n\nAchievmentsYES, Lots of Variations of Funny, Completionist or just Damn Challenging Achievements.\nCovers all the Games (And DLC) but lacks many Multiplayer achievements (Only 6?) Although they are fun to do, but very hard to get! People who like achievement hunting shouldnt have a problem here, 65 sounds like the right ammount.\n\nActionYES, in its own way(s)\nDefinetely Has lots of this! Weapons are Plentiful and simplified. But some are just too OP to use in SP or MP, for example the Rocket Launcher is the Best Weapon in MP, but im SP the BFG is by far the Best weapon. Capable of clearing a room with its green Bioforce Plasma! Obviously the bfg is too overpowered for MP...And thats fine! Otherwise thered be More Chaos than usual. xD\nIn SP tight spaces really shine a new light on how you handle action situations.. Use the Rocket Launcher and risk harming yourself but get a wide spread of splash Damage? Use the Shotgun and Risk Long Reloading time for Powerful Shots? or even the Chaingun, fire a long spread of bullets but risk high maneuverability when surrounded? The Weapon system is well handled.\n\nBoss BattlesNO, Satifactory is all..\nIn DooM 3 there are 5 Main Boss Battles, In TLM there is Only 1 and in ROE there is 4. I'd Say that ROE's Boss Battles are the Best by far  because you have to discover unique ways to defeat each one from what you have learnt and acquired so far, like the Artifact for example.\nMost of the Boss Battles are very short and easy, which ISNT what a Boss Battle should be at all! Its almost like its just trainining your skills\n\nMultiplayerMEH, Maps need tweaking and expanding.\nMore Game Modes, More People Playing (RIP), More Options, Maybe a Little System for levelling up. Basically everything that the new DooM (When im Writing this) Has Overdone in a true COD/ Halo Fashion. But thats a whole new discussion.\nId say that multiplayer is what people expected nothing more, nothing less (Some Maps are very small and have a Simple Environment.)\n\nFinal Thoughts: Standard action, with many things it could have easily improved.\nI Rate this Game a 7/10!\nThanks for Reading! and Leave any Questions Below ;P\n-Kyle","April 20","true","440.3"," 60 of 73 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","60","73","4","11"

Hell I used to play Doom back on a Windows 3.11 system using a bootup disk to load the game in HighMem. That and editing the modems ATT dial up script for a low latency connection to play Coop with friends. Oh those were the days. Well lets get back to Doom 3!\n\nDoom 3 BFG Edition, upgrades to the graphics (somewhat) and it now includes a flashlight on the guns. Before you used to have to download the flashlight mod otherwise you would have to switch back and forth from gun to flashlight. I was really eager to get this game on Steam when it was announced.\n\nThe starting to the game really sets the stage for a dark and eerie game. You arrive on Mars as a new recruit and have to make your way to the commander where he sends you on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mission to get some scientist, why? Well because your the newbie soldier (kinda like in real life, trust me I speak from experience). This is all a good lead in for whats to come.\n\nThere is always something to over hear with when listing to the other soldiers converse or the maintenance guys talking about whats going on and there speculations of whats its all about.\n\nWhile playing you will come across some audio logs, PDA's and locked cargo containers. Listening to the PDA's audio logs and reading the emails on them will get you the access codes for the lockers as well as the locked rooms you will come across with all that awesome weaponry!\n\nOne of the PDA's will tell you to go to a website (you do this in a web browser outside of game, at the time this was an interesting idea but these days there are integrated web browsers in game or something similar) like martianbuddy.com! Unfortunately that website is no longer running. If you want to see what the website was like there is http://web.archive.org/web/20110208053311/http://martianbuddy.com/ that has it archived so at least you will get to see what everyone else did when Doom 3 was originally released in 2004. There is another website but I don't recall the address for it anymore.\n\nThe game itself plays just like it always did. Running and gunning at times, hunting for ammo, health and armor boosts. The music and sounds to the game that give it its eerie feel and scares you when playing at night in the dark was done by Nine Inch Nails.\n\nI played the game with a keyboard and mouse originally but the BFG edition I play with an Xbox360 controller and it plays very well. The game was also made to accommodate the controller without any issues.\n\nI have to say that the BFG edition was defiantly worth the price and even more so when you get it on a sale because it includes all the Doom games and the Doom 3 expansion as well.\n\nThe biggest disappointment for me was that the Doom 1 and Doom 2 games that are included don't have Coop play option like they did when originally released. I really don't understand why Id Software decided not to include this option of play as it was one of the best things about the Doom games! Being able to play together with a friend and beating the game was so much fun and you could set it on the higher difficulty settings and play the whole night.\n\n\nPro's\nEnhanced Graphics\nOculas Rift Support\nStory Line\nDoom, Doom 2 and Doom 3 Resurrection of Evil included\nAwesome music and soundtrack\nCon's\nNo Coop what-so-ever!\n\nI give this game 4 stars because for everything it has it should have had Coop as well but was taken out for some reason.\nːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː\n\n\n\nCabinet Codes\nFor the locker codes to all the cabinets I have provided them below and marked them as a spoiler for those who want to find them in game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rathori/recommended/208200/","rathori","Rathori","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rathori/","892 products in account","TL;DRBad horror elements, decent shooter, good voice acting, censored classic games, Final DOOM not included, added Steam achievements (even for DOOM I/II). Optimized for widescreen, 3D, Oculus Rift and high framerates. Multiplayer is dead. The BFG Edition-exclusive DOOM 3 "The Lost Mission" and DOOM II "No Rest for the Living" expansions are great, so it's still worth getting even if you own the original games, although you should probably wait for a sale in that case.\n\nDOOM 3Despite its horror elements being utter crap, DOOM 3 is a decent shooter game. The graphics are good, except for human character models (which are ugly and repetitive - prepare for attack of the clones!), the weapons are diverse and well-balanced - pretty much all of them are useful throughout the whole game, and the voice acting is good. The game gets more fun towards the end, so even if it gets a bit monotonous in the middle of campaign, it is worth enduring so you'd get to play its best part.\n\nIn BFG Edition flashlight is no longer a separate weapon, it appears to be shoulder-mounted and can be used at any time with any weapon equipped. Along with more ammo found in the levels, this makes the game somewhat easier and less tense that original DOOM 3. Zoom is no longer available, but I didn't miss it at all.\n\nThe game now has out-of-the-box support for widescreen resolutions, 3D and head mounted displays (such as Oculus Rift), and runs steadily at 120 fps 1920x1080 on my system, all maxed out.\n\nAlso, the controls are customizable (seeing all the negative comments about unchangeable controls, I must assume this has only been patched recently), and you CAN bind CTRL to crouch and even rebind weapon selection buttons as you please (which you should as they go all the way from 1 to 9 and it is hard to switch to the most powerful weapons in a middle of a fight with default bindings).\n\nDOOM 3: Resurrection of EvilThe new grabber is fun to use and comes in handy quite often - it can actually be used to defeat some of the thoughest monsters and save you tons of ammo -, the double-barreled shotgun is as good as it was in DOOM II (which, in case you haven't played, is VERY good), and the new artifact brings some variety to gameplay.\n\nUnlike DOOM 3, where PDAs played major part in delivering the plot, in RoE audio logs on PDAs are almost non-existent, and those that are there are written poorly, as well as all the emails. It also has what seems to be the worst ending in entire history of video game, and the protagonist is as dumb as a bag of hammers - just play and you'll see why.\n\nAll the changes in BFG Edition that apply to DOOM 3 also apply to RoE, so you can't zoom anymore but are able to use flashlight with any weapon.\n\nAll and all, despite its flaws, DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil is fun to play, especially if you liked DOOM 3.\n\nDOOM 3: The Lost MissionAdds no new enemies or weapons, but has almost everything from both DOOM 3 and RoE, along with high quality PDA entries that are quite enjoyable to read/listen to. I also enjoyed the level design, especially in the Hell levels, which look very different from those found in original DOOM 3 and RoE.\n\nA solid addition to the game, and, along with No Rest for the Living, is a reason enough to get the BFG Edition even if you already own the base game and RoE outside BFG Edition.\n\nClassic DOOMsI totally hate it that they censored the games - medkits look stupid with that pill symbol instead of red cross, and they pretty much ruined the secret levels in DOOM II, which are now barren and have all references to Wolfenstein 3D removed but not replaced with anything else. The only good changes are added achievements and "No Rest for The Living" episode for DOOM II. Also, Final DOOM is not a part of BFG Edition so you'll have to buy it separately if you want it.\n\nIn every other aspect it's the same old DOOM we all love.\n\nNo Rest for the LivingI was sceptical about it at first, but it turned out to be a good expansion pack that has the spirit of original DOOM games and is a lot of fun to play. The levels are well designed, well balanced, and, due to being designed for much more powerful systems than those in original DOOMs, are much more detailed. They are also about as non-linear as levels in original games and are fun to explore - I actually took time to find every single secret on every level, including the secret level.\n\nIf you like old DOOM games, No Rest for the Living is a must-have.\n\nMultiplayerIt is dead. There are no servers and no players. You could still find some people willing to play on Steam forums, but don't expect to just jump in for a quick match.","October 26, 2014","true","38.3"," 53 of 65 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","53","65","2","0"

It contains Doom 1-3 and the doom 3 expansion. This pack features updated graphics for each game. Some argue the pack is a waste because you could just download graphic mods for the same effect but if you don't own these games already then its a great deal with less work.\n\nDoom: A classic fps with varied monsters, creative levels, and tons of secrets. The varience between the monster weapons (guns, projectiles and melee) is what keeps the monster slaying interesting; Most of the time you will be using the shotgun however because of how the shell boxes are the most abundant ammo pickup (20 shells per box) . You can't look vertically only in a horiztonal axis but after awhile you zone in and don't even notice. 5 out of 5\n\nDoom2: Much like the first doom but with updated monsters and a double barrel shotgun "ohh yeah!".   This was the Doom im most familiar with from my childhood. There are also many secret areas and even secret level in both Dooms. Ammo is often more scarce at the start but the later levels offer more ammo incase you die and need to repeat that stage again (you lose your ammo when you die).\n\nDoom3: A fun run on a space station. The game is pretty good, I tend to enjoy the interactive ingame screens and the audio logs; these were new concepts at the time. However the areas look so similar it gets monotonous just trying to run through the level. They also try to scare you relentlessly with voices and things poping around. This game just lacks the complexity and level design compared to halflife 2.","September 30, 2013","true","77.8"," 64 of 84 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","64","84","0","0"

The price was my primary motivating factor, because I already have Ultimate Doom, Doom II, FInal Doom, Doom 3, and Resurrection of Evil  on cd. Yet I still recommend purchasing this product to fans of fps.\n\nI found Doom 3: BFG Edition convenient, because I don't care for the chanllenge of downloading patches and mods I have to Google search for and then try to make work. The BFG Edition contains playable Windows 95 era games and versions of Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil that offer widescreen support. I also enjoy the Steam achievements that can be earned as well. I have limited playtime experience and can not verify all of the complaints about changes made to the games. For example, if the Wolfenstein 3D secret levels in Doom II are still accessible.\n\nPros:\nAll games are playable on modern operating systems and hardware. (I can verify this for Windows 7 Pro and a GTX980m gpu.)\n\nDoom 3 does look visually better in the BFG Edition versus the original cd version I own. Both versions have limited graphics adjustments, as others have mentioned.\n\nThe sale price of less than $7.00.\n\nSixty-five Steam achievements are available.\n\nAll of the games are fun, challenging, and offer many secrets to discover.\n\nThe infamous flashlight issue in Doom 3 has been resolved, although your flashlight now has limited power.\n\nCons:\n\nCheats are disabled. (I don't know how players of this version will be able to see John Romero's severed head on a pike in Doom II. It was only available using a cheat code.)\n\nDoom II does not reveal secret count when you TAB the map feature.\n\nFamous mod maps for Doom II can not be added.\n\nFinal Doom and the Master Levels of Doom are not included.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\n\n\n","July 24, 2015","true","7.0"," 54 of 69 people (78%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","78","54","69","8","1"

Unlike the previous version of the engine, this one is well optimized.\n+Controller support if you're into that.\n\n\nMIXED:\n+/-The original Doom 1 and 2 are included, along with some Master levels. The better question is why aren't you playing them already on zDoom. Seriously, there's no reason to play the in-game version of these old games unless you want achievements.\n+/-The Flashlight has been replaced with a shoulder-light. This is sorta bad and good for one reason: You keep it when you go to Hell. Hell, as a level, was not designed with the flashlight in mind.\n+/-The Lost Mission levels are sorta good, but sorta bad. They aren't anything to write home about.\n\nCONS:\n-The game is too easy now for one reason: ammo. Ammo found in the BFG Edition have DOUBLE the amounts given rather than normal Doom 3 and ROE. Once you find the chaingun and plasma rifle, the game is over because you will NEVER run out of ammo. It really hurts the game because there was never a problem with ammo in the original Doom3. So, giving more ammo just breaks the game so much.\n-The unique sequence in ROE3 when you go through the waste tunnels is broken. In original ROE, the helmet + oxygen meter makes the set piece good. In BFG, it's just a normal level... Nothing new.\n-Mod support is gone.\n-The original Doom 3 and ROE are on Steam. There's no reason to buy BFG when you can get the normal version of Doom 3.\n-The biggest and most damning problem of Doom 3: BFG Edition is the lack of actual upgrades. There's NOTHING you can't already download as a mod to make normal Doom3 look better than BFG.","April 7, 2015","false","41.7"," 138 of 207 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","138","207","7","7"

The original Doom's were pretty much perfect, perfect levels, perfect enemies, perfect weapons, great games.\n\nNow even though Doom 3 is a good game too, it kind of lacked some things that the older Doom's had. Doom was all about rushing through hell while destroying all of hell's minions, while Doom 3 was a bit different. None the less, Doom 3 somewhat offered the same experience as the older Doom's. Same enemies and weapons, but not necessarily the same level design.\n\nI am going to compare Doom 3 to Doom 3 BFG with some pros and cons, so you will know which Doom you'd rather get.\n\nDoom 3 BFG Pros:\n-You get Ultimate Doom, and Doom 2, as well as a better looking Doom 3\n-Doom 3 looks much better but still the same in different ways\n-You get Doom Resurrection of evil, as well as the Lost mission\n-There are achievements for all Doom's\n-You can use the Oculus Rift on Doom 3 BFG\n-Fair Price ($20)\n\nDoom 3 BFG Cons:\n-There isn't many settings to lower the graphics so you'll need a somewhat beefy PC\n-You can now use your flashlight while using weapons at the same time which overall makes the game less scary\n-The controls could be better\n-Doom 3 BFG is not moddable\n\n\nOriginal Doom 3 Pros:\n-It is moddable, which makes the game have lots of replay value, which there's even a Coop mod, so expect lots of playtime\n-There is actually a console you can use to spawn weapons/enemies/objects\n-The Controls are fantastic, you can change pretty much any key if you wanted to, unlike Doom 3 BFG\n-The game is much more scarier since you can only use a flashlight and a weapon at different times\n-Better price ($10)\n\nOriginal Doom 3 Cons:\n-The original Doom 3 does not include any DLC or the older Doom's\n-The game looks a little more outdated which means the graphics aren't as good\n-The steam overlay is pretty awful (small resolution)\n-No Achievements\n\nTLDR:\nSo overall, I would say, if you want a better looking Doom 3 with all the older dooms as well as Doom 3's DLC, but are willing to only being able to play the content you have (no mods), then get Doom 3 BFG\n\nIf you want a less better looking Doom 3 with lots of more options to do (moddable) and are willing to buy the DLC separately as well as the older Doom's, The original Doom 3 is for you.\n\nFinal score:\nDoom 3 BFG: 8/10\n\nOriginal Doom 3: 9/10","May 24, 2015","true","12.8"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","38","44","0","1"

Anyway I have to say that I am glad that I came back, DOOM is a classic and I am enjoying the BFG release and yes like I said I had the original DOOM 3 on disc, I don't miss the mod option (they only did so much anyway) with the BFG release the game runs sweet @ 120FPS and with all settings maxed out still looks good and with using my XBOX 360 controller on my PC plays sweet, the shadows one could argue were slighter better in the original. As for the flashlight debate, in my opinion having to switch between your gun and your flashlight in the original release did make DOOM 3 more of a scare fest since you could not see half the time vs. the BFG release where you are equipped with a shoulder mounted flashlight that you can turn on and off with a limited battery life via Alan Wake, however I prefer the new flashlight. For one I am a marine and I should have some tech and 2nd I always thought it was silly that in the original DOOM 3 release you could carry a pistol in one hand but you couldn't hold a flashlight in the other, something every earth cop can do when clearing dark rooms. DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 as well as the extra content for DOOM 3 are a nice bonus!\n\nI respect your view but I honestly was not really impressed with what any of the mods do for the original DOOM 3 compared to BFG, but I have to say having owned the original PC release of DOOM 3 when it first came out reading this interview online is what made me buy the BFG ediition.\n\nDoom 3 BFG Edition won't be just another re-release with bonus content.\nIn a recent interview with VG247, id Software's Tim Willits said that Doom 3 BFG Edition isn't merely a re-release of something old with added content:\n\nIt's a complete overhaul of the 2004 slow-paced survival horror shooter. Willits said the studio has returned to its roots with this release, cranking up the action so it's not such a gloomy crawl-fest.\n\nOf course, there's more to the BFG Edition than cranking up the action. Levels have been re-designed to match the pace, and the team has thrown in new textures to bring the game up to speed on current consoles. Other goodies include new lighting mechanics, the new eight-mission chapter called "Lost Mission," and bits of Rage tech thrown into the mix.\n\n"It’s not just Doom 3 – that’s what we’re keen to make sure everybody knows," Willits said. "We’re doing more with Doom 3 BFG than just re-releasing the original.  We’ve actually put a heck of a lot of Rage tech into the Doom 3 engine to kind of modernize the game."\n\nAs an example, the team tossed in the Rage input control and checkpoints. They also updated the lighting so it's brighter throughout the game, changed the annoying flashlight, tweaked the ammo, and even implemented the Rage network layer to make it run faster at low latency. There's also 3D support, and multi-display support for the PC platform.\n\n"We went through every single level of the original and things that were really frustrating or not fun, we made them more enjoyable. So it is really kind of cool for us – especially as we all love the Doom franchise – to go back and rework the game in such a way," he added.\n\nDoom 3 BFG Edition has enough small changes to essentially re-introduce the franchise to old and new fans alike. "Everyone’s heard of Doom, but you’d be surprised at just how many people haven’t actually played it," he said.\n\nAs for the specs needed to run the PC version, they'll obviously need to be higher than what was required in 2004. Willits said the biggest change with the PC version is that it now runs at 120 Hz. The team also revamped the HUD elements, the PD elements, and made map modifications. Overall the biggest glaring change will be for console junkies who purchased Doom 3 for the original Xbox eight years ago.\n\nThat said, the interview went on to talk about tweaking the map designs. He pointed out one section in the Alpha Labs that simply had to go because it was incredibly... not fun. "There was this part where you walk up these stairs, and the stairs fall apart behind you and Imps spawn in front of you," he said. "When we were playing through that earlier this year we were like, 'this is not fun right here…this was a bad idea.'"\n"We grabbed our young designers and said, 'young designer, this is a bad design right here. How do you think we can fix it?’ and so we fixed it," he added. "You know it’s kind of funny, because most of the guys who worked on Doom 3 originally, they still work there."\n\n"One of the guys wanted to go back and up-rez and make the characters look better, and a texture artist said, ‘you know, I never liked those textures, can I go back and fix them?’ and we said ‘sure, go ahead, knock yourself out and fix them up,'" he said.\nSounds like Doom 3 BFG Edition will be an entirely new experience when it launches on October 16.\n\n(There is more to this interview online, but this was the edited version)","May 5, 2014","true","82.3"," 90 of 133 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","90","133","0","3"

If you score this on sale as I did for $5 there is no way you'll be disappointed. There’s a decent variation of enemy’s. Most are modern versions of classic DOOM baddies. There is a good assortment of weapons. I found the Plasma rifle to be the go to tool. There are well thought out maps, and a decent number of interactable devices such as terminals, switches, computers, lifts, etc. The game looks really good for it's age. Nothing 4K here, but on point with an Xbox 360 title. The sound effects are also good. There is a story here, and surprisingly it's not bad. The story is told through PDA's you find throughout the game, they also provide helpful info such as unlock codes for storage lockers, and hints to what you should be doing. The game never really takes you out of the scene, as you can be attacked while reading a PDA. I love this aspect! At the core this game is a classic old school shooter, with some newer mechanics. The game offers full controller support. I found it worked pretty well out of the box, but you can improve the scheme by remapping some weapon hot keys to the D-pad for quick access.  All in all this is solid play. I would definitely recommend this game when its on sale.\n\nOLDER GAMER APPROVED\nVisit our Currator Page","March 28","true","26.2"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","34","40","0","5"

Lots of ammo, new map layout (most noticeable during battle against third hunter - you could get under the arena to get health and souls) - why would they do that? Main character still makes hilarious faces during cutscenes. Play it if you want, map changes are not that significant.\n\nLost Mission is a nice expansion.

Those of us who were fortunate enough to see how games have grown will know that the godfather of all FPS games is none other than DOOM.\n\n(BFG EDITION CONTENTS)\nSo what makes DOOM 3: BFG Edition so special? First of all it contains the nearly complete DOOM bundle... nearly complete as in meaning it contains Ultimate DOOM; DOOM 2; DOOM 3; DOOM 3 Resurrection of Evil and the latest installment; DOOM 3 Lost Missions. All that is missing is Final DOOM (standalone modification of DOOM 2) and the two episodes it contains being TNT Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment. This of course is a bit of a bummer, but not as bad, since they are in my opinion not as important and on top of it all incredibly difficult.\n\n(DOOM 1 & 2)\nFor those who haven't experienced this awesome game, it consists of a TON load of shooting/killing, monsters, awesome weapons and the hordes of Hell. DOOM 1 and 2 has linear maps with good old 90's graphics/gore. You spend the entire length of the game running and shooting, finding keys and items for your arsenal. It is very little story orientated, but there is a bit of a plot none the less. If you're into old-school games like I am, then I highly recommend you give this game a shot, unless you already have (which I'm sure most of you have) ;)\n\n(DOOM 3 and INSTALLMENTS)\nDOOM 3 and its expansions has the improved id tech 4 engine, and comparing it to its predecessors has immensely improved graphics. It does focus a whole lot more on the horror aspect of DOOM, narrow halls, close corridors, zombies, freaky ambience, you name it. A lot have complained in the past about the game not focussing on the core of the originals, and that the main focus was on horror alone. In my opinion it took DOOM to a whole new level of FPS but this comes from a guy who enjoys horror so the best I can say is play and decide for yourself. :) DOOM 3 still sticks to the large amount of weapons, heavy actioned packed, slaying the hordes of Hell theme, but is a lot darker and spookier, so beware ;)\n\n(FEATURES)\nOther features include achievements for all of the installments of this game, an upgraded multiplayer mode for DOOM 3, frames per second being boosted to 120hz if your PC can support it, the flashlight is now part of your suit instead of a single item, and other than that a few tweaks here and there. In short I put my stamp of approval on this game.\n\n(SPOILER)\nA little bit of info on The Lost Missions: it takes off right after Bravo Team got wiped out in DOOM 3. There were two survivors, of which one you experience being killed, while the other by luck survived and you play as that marine taking on his own quest against Hell.\n\n(PLOT CONNECTION)\nThough I doubt that any of these will have a direct connection with the upcoming DOOM 4, it might be a good idea just to see how and where things began. The only ones that really connect at this stage is DOOM 1 and 2, but there is very little of a connection with DOOM 3, other than the UAC and the hordes of Hell. DOOM 4 by the looks of it will not be as horror intensified, but will be going back to the roots of DOOM 2, so it remains to be seen how the plot is going to turn out and whether it will have link with its predecessors.","December 7, 2015","true","46.3"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","36","47","6","3"

The reason you want to get this game compilation is DooM (and maybe DooM II) - it's already modified to work flawlessly on modern machines - and despite a bunch of changes, the game and everything it does is still pretty much intact.\n\nDooM will forever be one of the best games I have ever played. The core-mechanics of the original DooM in combination with excellent leveldesign (especially the first episode done (almost?) entirely by Romero) are just as much fun as they were in the early 90ies. The game has a certain arcade-quality to it, a no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t attitude, oozes 90ies cool and still captures my imagination to this very day. It's a timeless masterpiece.\n\nIt all goes a bit downhill from here, DooM II is more or less a missiondisk, the leveldesign isn't quite having the same quality to it, introduces a lot of annoying elements and overall doesn't seem to be sticking  to the design-principles that made Romero's maps in the first game as iconic as they are for me. There are some MASSIVE battles to be fought though, which is the saving-factor for DooM II.  More of the same - just not as captivating - back in the day I was disappointed.\n\nDooM³ and it's expansions are a huge departure from the classic game and never convinced me either as a standalone title or as part of the DooM-legacy. There is a hint of survival-horror, lots of confined space, weapons without punch - the list goes on and on. None of this makes DooM³ a superior experience to the original, in fact DooM³ gets stale a lot faster as it drags forever on (10hrs is WAY too long, I could beat the original DooM several times in that time-frame). It also keeps reusing the same methods to build suspense over and over again.  Quite frankly, it becomes predictable and boring - and unfortunately they never mixed it up for the expansions either which feel like "abridged" versions of the maingame - just cutting down on filler-levels and with the narrative at a faster pace. Can't say I am impressed.\n\nDooM³s real beauty lies in the fact that art-direction and engine are top-notch and had it age gracefully. It looks surprisingly good and the majority of (monster) designs are fantastic, same goes for some of the landmarks in the level architecture - the creative people behind this gave it their all, and it shows. It all just feels so cohesive. From a world-building perspective this is a really cool game that manages to capture the atmosphere of space station in nasty trouble quite nicely (at least what Hollywood assumes that it would be like). Ultimately this was the reason I kept going, cause I wanted to see it all and take it all in. A shame that I cannot say the same about the actual gameplay - which seems even more silly considering that the original DooM was all about gameplay but just so happened to have incredibly great art- and sound-design.\n\nGood thing with the BFG-Edition is however - you can simply drop out of DooM³ and actually do the timewarp straight into the original DooM again to relive the golden age of fragging. And for me, that's worth it.","November 22, 2013","true","25.4"," 45 of 65 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","45","65","0","1"

It was real fun to play with the first two Doom games many years after their release and as an added feature now all games have achievements.\n\nWhile the description boasts Doom 3 now has updated graphics it still looks an outdated game (after all, it was released more than 10 years ago).

I was talking with this guy, you know the typical modern videogamer all about "cuda cores/memory bandwidth/fov/blablablablabla" when I asked him, informed person, what he thought of DooM.\n"Oh yes pretty graphic lot of light and shadow games nice horror scenario"\nAnd I was like "no...no no no...no no no no no...I mean DooM...the old one...the one from 1993...you know right?"\nAnd the answer was "DooM?...the old one?....no man I don't play such old games like those with that pixel graphic without details....."\nAnd while he was still talking I gently and slowly stood up I grabbed my chair and I've smashed it on his head so hard that today he's still spinning.....AND THIS HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO OKAY?\n\nI mean seriously, if you are a true gamer you don't really care about graphic because mostly you will look for few things like:\n\n- Gaming experience\n- Entertainment\n- Fun\n- Gameplay innovation\n- Soul\n\nThis is what you will find in the BFG edition of DooM 3...all the three DooM complete with their expansions and even the deleted levels!\n\nGames of those days are too much linear and too much easy to understand and even to finish....but....\nWhat other game will make you cry about looking for the "Red Card" to open the door?\n\nDooM!\n\nAnd when you will find the "Red Card" you will discover that you will even need the "Gold Card" to open the last door and you will want to cut your veins!\n\nWhat game will make you turn your head side to side, upside down, on an angle, etcetc to try to understand the map?\n\nDooM!.......................Layout of map that even Blizzard copied for Diablo!\n\nYou like action? You like shooting? You like running all over maps that looks like a labirinth looking for a key? You like plasma guns that you don't need to reload every 40 shots? You like a end boss that you will have no idea how to kill it? And at least...you like REAL big enemies?\n\nThen DooM 1 and 2 are the games for you...but what about DooM 3?\n\nDifferent but not boring or a fail at all. Where DooM 1 & 2 are more direct action, DooM 3 is a more elegant soft impact game that in some parts will drastically increase when you will be locked inside a room and something like 20 monsters will starts to spawn around you.\nWhere DooM 1 & 2 doesn't care about scaring you DooM 3 will focus more into trying to get you focused on the game, so focused that you will jump form your chair when something will try to hit you from a wall.\nWhere DooM 1 & 2 have a short text story where you will be the only one hero of the situation, DooM 3 will give you a better story and plot experience by adding even a lot of info about this and that in the game, dialogs and recordings too.\n\nIf you will find this pack on a sale...simply get it, it will entertain you for a lot of time and you will hardly get bored of it. Even because when you will finish it you will feel the need to play it again.\n\nOverall:\nGraphic 8/10\nSounds 8/10\nGameplay 8/10\nLongevity 9/10","November 18, 2014","true","47.7"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","62","29","47","11","2"

Mostly. TLDR buy Quake 4, this isn't worth it.\nI already owned Doom 3, but I bought this version hoping it would be more bearable to play. Oh boy was I wrong.\n\nYes the always available flashlight is needed, but the same old Doom 3 bs gets you all the time.\nHere's how the game goes:\nYou go to a mission critical area --> closet monsters come from behind and front of you, some may teleport.\nYou pick a powerup or a gun -->  closet monsters come from behind and front of you, some may teleport.\nYou pick your nose -->  closet monsters come from behind and front of you, some may teleport.\nI do love Doom 1 and 2 and I do realize they had their share of closet monsters and teleporters too. But the closet monsters weren't so annoying or common. And there are no technological constraints to spawning monsters nowadays.\n\nAnd then there's the issue with the weapons: Pistol = crap, shotgun from 1m away = crap (shoved up on an enemys ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's ok), grenade = useless, rocket launcher = meh, BFG = not nearly as fun as in D1 or 2.\nThe biggest problem with weapons is that only zombies react in any way to damage. You can headshot a full clip to an enemy with chaingun and it just keeps shooting or charging at you.\n\nAnd sounds: Weapon sounds are -really lacking punch-. Shotgun deserves a mention of really lacking a satisfying sound. Chaingun sound is surprisingly good and plasma ok, everything else is not. Your character doesn't make a lot of noise when hurt, if any. Imps make same screetching noise that was in Turok 2 and I don't think it suits them well. The fat rocket shooters and crawling wing babies make actually nice atmospheric sounds.\n\nThis version also dumbs down settings way too much. And I don't think the textures are even the 512MB ones that were available with original Doom 3 (even though they should be improved???). Some textures are really pixelated and I don't remember that being the case with the higher quality ones in the original. My LOD bias is was set to highest.\n\nWell at least you get the Doom 1 and 2 wads with this version.","June 14, 2014","false","50.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Now I have alot of bad things to say about this version of the game but before I go forward with my stinging remarks allow me to talk about the few good things about Doom 3 BFG Edition.\n\nIf you dont happen to own a copy of Doom1/2/3 or the Doom 3 expansions and you can pick this up for less than $12 bucks I say go for it. Doom 1 & 2 runs great on a new console without a bunch of mucking about and if you really wanna have some fun you can take 10 minutes to rip the WAD and mod it with Brutal Doom and really have some fast paced, blood and gore Doom action.  Doom 3 has been given a "overhaul" and comes with the Expansion Resurrection of Evil and a whole new expansion called The Lost Mission.\n\nThis is where I stop being nice and break out the hammers for gleeful dissection of this half ♥♥♥♥♥ mess of a product.\n\nFirst of all I love Doom as a whole and have been playing it since it first spawned forth from the minds of those crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from iDsoft. Doom 3 was a flat out amazing game when it came out over a decade ago and sported the best graphics when it came to textures, dynamic lighting and shadows for its time.  So then why does this game look of absolute crap for it being an updated version??? I thought that giving something an "OVERHAUL" ment that it would look far better then perviously....so what the ♥♥♥♥ happened here? The geometry in the game as a whole is awful and anything "round" looks more like swollen polygons, the lighting has been "updated" so now everything is brighter which outright kills the concept of the place being a DARK SCARY PLACE!\n\nYes, I understand that not being able to hold your weapon and the flashlight at the same time was a bit of a faff in the orignal but the dynamics of game play was based around these mechanics. It was clunky but it added to the survival horror aspects to the game. You had to rely on a well placed head thwap with the flashlight to deal with smaller undeads or if you find yourself in a pitch black room full of baddies with nothing more than the trace fire and muzzle flashes to light up the room. Now you have a chest mounted flashlight that uses the F.E.A.R method of running down on battery then slowly charges back up again,,,but now the environmental lighting is ALOT brigther through out the game so you dont really need the damn flashlight. In the orignal there were whole areas in the game that the point was to navigate through a darken lab or industiral complex holding a light in one hand, with your other hand shoved up to your face with a thumb in mouth and praying that the local demon hell spawns wont come out to play "peek-a-boo-now-die"\n\nAnother thing that was senselessly removed from the game was the ability zoom your aim in. I know it may not have been a "true irondight" aim feature but it was great to use if you want to HIT YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING TARGET FROM ACROSS A LARGE ROOM!!! I mean really why has so far this "new updated version" has just been more of a stripping of what made it good and replacing them with child safety mats. Gotta bring this game down to the level of boring "on-rails-follow-the-leader" FPS players of today. They even went ahead and gave it Xbox360 controller support...which is ♥♥♥♥ing awful!!!! hold down the left trigger to run??? RB for "melee"??? oh wait thats right its NOT a melee it just switches to your fist. Are you guys at iDsoft eating paint chip or did you choose to code this game with your heads in a bucket of warm wallpaper paste??? I know you guys can utilize a controller properly I've seen it in your other games sooo WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!!??!!!\n\nWell I guess we can all be happy that the updated textures, widescreen support and character models look better...or do they? The truth is that even with the "updated textures" and all that cack its still not that much of a leap forward compared to some of the High-Res mods found on the internet and if you already own a copy of Doom 3 you can tune it up yourself FOR FREE!!!! Alot of the mods that have been made over the years make Doom 3 look amazing to the point where the old Doom 3 can proudly stand waving its willy in the face of the BFG Edtion. Since these are just mods you still get all these wonderful new addiitions without taking away any of the core gaming mechanics or features that get stripped out in BFG....Hmmmm I wonder which sounds better???\n\nSo basicly this was a lack luster, dumb down, poor retread of a port that is barely a shadow of its former self than being an imporvment. I picked this up at a local store for $10 and I was let down completely. The Lost MIssion was a joke and since I already own all the Doom games plus all the expansions I pretty much paid $10 just for that and in return I got an add-on that breaks the games controls and a weak not scary environment since someone seemed content to leave all the light switches glued in the on position.\n\nIf you really want to play Doom 3 how it was intended just find a copy of the orignal and Google some mods for it. you'll find that the experience is alot more thrilling and if you want to use your controller just download MKcontroller or Xpadder and map it how you like it.\n\nI dont like giving scores for games but if you want an idea of what it would be in this case here it is, while I give the orignal Doom 3 10 out of 10....Doom 3 BFG Edition gets a wet 2 because its watered down ♥♥♥♥!","July 1, 2015","false","8.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/firstinitiallastnamebirthyear/recommended/208200/","firstinitiallastnamebirthyear","You are bleeding.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/firstinitiallastnamebirthyear/","72 products in account","id is my favorite video game company in existance. I consider Doom to be one of the most influencial video games of all time. I was really excited to get this when it came out. I launched the game and was greated by two unskipable cutscenes that must be watched every time the game is started. I thought to myself "Hey, I could skip cutscenes in the original Doom 3; why can't I skip them now?" Let's think of this as a forshadowing for the rest of the game. Right off the bat though, I noticed it does have Steam Play achievements. Those weren't in the original game. That's an improvement,  right? It is also in full HD now, so I can properly run it in widescreen. That's awesome, except for the fact that Doom 3 already looked pretty good.\n\nDoom 3 did and does not need an HD remake. Nothing was really added to improve this game at all. The only real improvements are that it is properly fit for higher resolutions and has Steamplay. This game would have been really good if it came with an official cooperative mode and a playable multiplayer system. Unfortunately, the game feels like it is running on a Playstation 3 emulator. There are next to no graphics options, a console that can only be enabled by cheating, a matchmaking system instead of a server browser, no dedicated servers, and a user interface that wasn't designed for a mouse, amongst other things. Coming from id, the company that defined what pc gaming is today and how games on the pc should be made (if you need an example, play Quake), this is pathetic. You know which games need HD remakes? The classic Dooms.\n\nNone of the games feel optimized at all. It feels like all of the games were just taken from their original releases, thrown into one packaging, and shipped off. They changed how the flashlight works in Doom 3 but didn't make changes to the level design to compensate. It's understandable why they wouldn't add features such as jumping and mouse look to the classic Dooms, but they didn't optimize them for new systems at all. They still run in 320x200 in 4:3 and don't even allow for things like autorun, which was available in Vanilla Doom by editing the config. After Doom's release, id has put autorun in their other games so they've clearly learned that it is more convienent. Why did they not put it in this one? Because that would have taken effort.\n\nThere is no way to play multiplayer on the classic Dooms at all, but if the multiplayer is anything like Doom 3's multiplayer support, you probably wouldn't want to. Even in a LAN connection, it isn't playable. I've posted a video demonstrating this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHpFBmUkDwA\n\nThe classic Dooms have absolutely no way to play custom WAD files, which was one of the biggest things keeping the originals alive. Not to mention that for a "complete collection", it doesn't include Final Doom. Also, if we're considering it an "HD Collection", I guess that's fair because the only thing they did was allow it to run in higher resolutions. The problem is they only did this to Doom 3. Doom 3 came out in 2004 and looked outstanding for its time. It's ten years later and it still looks pretty good in my opinion. It's been 21 years since the original Doom released and it still has no HD collection. It would have been nice to see that one instead, with official multiplayer support on Steam so I could easily connect with my friends and not have to worry about which source port to use.\n\nIn a nutshell, just stay away from this. It's not worth it, and just tarnishes id's name. The only people who are going to buy this are hardcore Doom fans and the few people who have never played Doom before. Hardcore Doom fans probably already own all of these games, and people who have never played are going to get a terrible impression.

I thought BFG Edition is gonna be even better. I thought wrong. New textures are awesome, yeah. New interface is kind of consol-ish, but viable.\nBut they really ♥♥♥♥ed up lighting. It's not dark where it was dark anymore and even more - now they invented duck tape and you can use your gun and a flashlight at the same time. And it's horrible. I was scared as ♥♥♥♥ when I wandered in the darkness with only a flashlight in hands and when there was an enemy - I had to face him in the dark, only flashes from firing my gun illuminated the foe and surroundings. That was scary. That was atmospheric. Now? Now the dark areas are not so dark as they were AND I can use flashlight anytime I want.\nAlso - almost no capacity for ammo. No more running from full ammo to no ammo in one wave of enemies. And it ruins atmosphere as well. Now I can easily complete the game with any gun I want, because I always have 900-ish ammo for it (while in vanilla it rarely was above two numbers). I was forced to use different fighting styles with different guns. I was forced to save up certain weapons for certain enemies and use the ♥♥♥♥ing flashlight when I knew I can deal with them. Let me repeat myself here - that was scary. That was atmospheric. I LIKED IT. And now they took away at least two major atm elements, the game is not so great now... It's good as a shooter, but without athm it just ain't the same...\n♥♥♥♥ BFG Edition. Though it has achievements, widescreen and other cool features - ♥♥♥♥ it. Vanilla Doom 3 is better.

I know, what are the odds?\n\nDo I recommend for retail price? Hell no! Unless you're a huge DOOM collector or never played DOOM in your life. I mean, come on, the game title alone should give that away. Have you noticed the other games are typed as DOOM, while BFG Ed. is typed as Doom? That's because it's not worthy of being typed with all caps, it's not worthy of the title!\n\nWhy, you ask? What's wrong with BFG Edition? Well, for starters, it doesn't include Final DOOM or Master Levels for DOOM II. How can it be "THE ultimate DOOM collection" when it doesn't include everything DOOM? That's pretty minor though, seeing as I believe all that content can be downloaded as mods... if they're even compatible.\n\nThe DOOM 3 port is another set back. BFG Ed. includes a genitally mutilated version of D3. This port has been stripped of its mod support. All the awesome mods available for D3 are incompatible with this version, since it's a newer engine and what not. But not only that,  the flashlight is no longer an equipable item, as it's attached to your armor now. In the original version, you had to think wisely: should you use your flashlight to see in a dark area? Or should you waste your precious ammo to temporarily light the room, so you can defend yourself from the demons lurking around? DOOM 3 was terrifying for that reason  - it was so dark, you could hardly see ♥♥♥♥ without your trusty flashlight. So you had to be smart about how you handled it. To be honest, achievements and the Lost Mission are the only reasons I'm even gonna bother. So I'm primarily playing for DOOM I & II. Once I get all the achievements and the money to buy the DOOM Classic collection, I'm uninstalling the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.\n\nMy verdict: buy DOOM Classic Complete ($15), and DOOM 3 Pack ($12.99) instead. It costs a little more, but even before mods, you get way more content that way. The only thing you're missing out on is achievements and the Lost Mission (which is not available anywhere else). But if it's on sale - grab it!

I can only reccomend this to people who have powerful computers but don't understand how to click-and-drag folders.\n\nBfg edition preserves the original perfectly: It's visually aged like milk, the sound effects are awful, the gameplay is uninspired and the enemies die with their brains falling out comically.\nA lot of these issues can be fixed with mods, which transform the game into an actual well paced and scary experiecne. Hovever, Bfg edition has no mod support, that should immediatley dissuade you from buying it, if you can't figure out mods then get it for consoles, there is no reason to buy this version over the original. Not even Doom 1 & 2, which are practially freeware at this point.\nThe major selling point of a portable flashlight would be really useful if they didn't turn up the brightness of all the levels. It's a change people were cheering for and it ends up ruining the atmosphere when the shadow crawling beasts can be seen in a room that should be pitch black.\nFor a while, I was convinced that Doom 3 was just an awful game until I played the originals with a few simple mods. It's kind of sad considering they made this port to guage if people like me were still intrested in the IP, but it ended up doing the exact opposite.\nGo play Bioshock or Serious Sam 3 instead, whichever experience you're looking for is not here.","January 23, 2014","false","4.7"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

There are hardly any graphical improvements as in all honesty for its time Doom 3 looks AMAZING, it was like the Crysis of the PC games in 2007 but for the Xbox.

Deal with downloads, securty, and debug. Upgrade Doom 3 with several mods.\n\nCost: Time (how much is your life worth to you)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut the end result is about the same when you play the game. The Stock version with mods will give you the closest feel to the origional game but there are more drawbacks then the pro stock preachers will admit. Animation even with mods is off useing todays technology. Unless you have a system that was pulled from Doom3's day the game plays different and the animations, gameplay, feel, and preformance is just a bit off. For example the characters eyes are off pitch during animation causing some glances (like dievous gesture) to make the eye roll into the head.\n\nThe BFG version will end in a different but, equal result (total payout consitered). The BFG version of Doom3 is a watered down shell of what Doom really is. Thankfully the game wasent totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized like the horrible doom movie made with 'the rock'. But a lot was lost in BFG. The textures in the game wernt upgraded as well as they should for a sellable product, but then again we are dealing with bethesda and one should expect nothing more than a kindergarden level paper and paste product from these people. You do however get to enjoy a quick and easy option to play doom3 in hd with high preformance. The upgraded design of the game and ability to set your video without having to edit cfg files is quite nice.\n\nIn the end its up to the player.\n\nDo you have money? Do you have time?

It's a great successor to the previous games but you won't realize it if you spend your time peeking around corners and jumping at the smallest sounds. The game drowns you in ammo because it wants you to play it correctly - running everywhere and shooting everything. The BFG Edition includes Doom 3 with some minor graphics tweaks (some for the better, some for the worse, but only slightly), as well as Doom and Doom II. The best part is that all three games have been given controller support, so if you want to chill on the couch and shoot demons, here you go.","April 19, 2014","true","20.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Doom Shareware ate up many hours of my life as a younger self, with it's maze like level design, a melodically (But shamefully ripped off) delicious soundtrack, tons of guns and running as fast as the speed of sound through those levels.\n\nAs somebody that has tried to play Doom 3 but failed due to none of the widescreen fixes working so I was pretty pleased to hear that the DooM BFG edition had all three of them packaged together with the Resurrection of Evil expansion. So I was able to play Doom 3 finally in widescreen at 1080p with no issues.\n\nDoom 3 is a fairly interesting title as it throws away a lot of the elements that made Doom the classic that many people have fond memories of and goes for a more horror filled jump scare approach, with the iconic monster closets making an appearance, but only as a jumpscare, another thing with Doom 3 is it tries to have more of a story based approach by taking cues from other games that were around at the time (Half Life especially) and having audio logs to put the narrative forward in which Doom 3 predates Bioshock by three years.\n\nMy main issue with Doom 3 however is the linearity of the game. With some tropes that would appear later on in gaming, such as "door won't open unless specific event happens" Though I had a bit of fun with Doom 3, despite characters not being very well fleshed out and motivations not really making sense (ID have never been great with stories) but alas there are things I really like about it, such as the first encounter with the Imp shooting the fireball and the wonderful half mechanical Pinkie running through the glass but despite all this I still feel that Doom 3 is lacking that special something. Despite having things that weren't in the game at launch (Torch being the main thing)\n\nAlso the boss battle with the cyberdemon is pretty anticlimatic.\n\nThe single player is solid but yet unremarkable, with some pretty atrocious sound  in which the main assualt rifle sounds like a childs potato gun and the pistol feels like a toy, but the Chainsaw at least feels like a chainsaw.\n\nMultiplayer is unfortunately not great, with a small community and still using peer to peer networking that side suggests to me that it's a console port... Of a PC game. (Let that sink in for a moment)\n\nOn Ressurection Of Evil. Same story, unremarkable single player filled with reused enemies, gravity gun and a time mechanic that feels like wasted potential  but the hell level and the boss fight with Maledict is solid.\n\nLost missions, they should have stayed lost. Great idea, not enough there but nice freebie.\n\n\nOverall I'd recommend it if it was on sale and you had a weekend free, untill then with it's glaring PC issues (I like having the options for 144HZ monitors and graphics options though, netcode, P2P and No LAN play kills it)\n\n","January 20, 2015","false","36.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

Some of the changes are just stupid, like the game being brighter, the mounted flashlight, the additional ammo makes it much more easier even on Veteran, some parts of the game have been changed, especially in Resurrection of Evil they cut out one whole part in the Hell level, the toxic waste tunnels in Level 05 have been made easier by removing the toxic so you don't run out of oxygen and some of the changes I don't understand, like why were all the other arcade machines replaced by the Super Turbo Turkey Puncher 3 and why was the Maledict fight made easier, why doesn't he suddenly spawn Forgotten Ones and why the falling meteors or rocks (or whatever it is) deal less damage. But that's still not the worst, because the changes in the original Doom and Doom 2 are even worse, like the censored Wolfenstein maps in Doom 2, Nightmare! difficulty being made easier by slowing down the speed of fireballs and the running speed of Pinky Demons to the normal Ultra-Violence speed, the music and sound effects sound weird, you can't use command parameters, you can't use cheats (unless you know how to enable the console), you can't change controls, no multiplayer in the PC version (Why?!) and the red cross on medikits and stimpacks has been changed to a red-white pill because Red Cross owns rights to use a red cross in a video game. And they said they wouldn't change anything about the original two games! From what I've found those aren't even ports of the original DOS version, but they're ports of the XBLA version. The Lost Mission isn't bad, but it's just too short and it doesn't add much to the Doom 3 story. Overall all the games are still enjoyable and if it wasn't for the changes, I would probably even recommend it, but no. I say if you have the original versions of all those games, just stick with them.","March 16, 2014","false","42.0"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

Sure the whole game can get a bit trive eventually as you're basically just going through corridors and shooting stuff up with your weapon of choice but, well, the gunplay is fun and satisfying enough to competently carry the game to the end.\n\nThe BFG edition can be considered an inferior version due to its limited options, gameplay changes and lack of modding when you compare it to buying the original games and modding them to your heart's content: the graphical options are the biggest culprit imho and, as a result, the game stumbles especially when you look at its textures. The fact you'll be finding more items could also disappoint certain players as it'll make it harder to find yourself low on health or rounds: last but not least some things have changed in the original Doom games, namely the medpack symbol and certain nazi imagery removed from secret levels.\n\nI got this for 3$ and, as I don't care much about its limited options and slightly easier gameplay, I found it a blast to play through it again as I wait for the new Doom game. This might not be the best version to get for PC gamers, but it's probably the "easiest" one if you want to have everything in one package and don't want to mod stuff yourself.","April 2","true","16.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

There is also all the expansions of Doom 3 such as Resurrection of Evil and The Lost Mission which is also remastered.\n\n+ The story is detailed yet simple, Becasue its so simple you can choose if you want to collect all the logs and videos which has lots more information about the story. For a FPS the story is well thought out.\n\n+ The graphics are alot better whan before since they updated the textures, shadows, lighting and lots more. This makes the game feel new. They only done this like Doom 3 and the expansions.\n\n+ Controls are spot on. They are very simple and you will quickly learn them. Only weird/bad thing about them is that right click is jump, but you can just change that since you can re-map the controls.\n\n+ Doom 3 is different from most first person shooters becasue the game can seem scary at first but then feel like a FPS, but also can feel like a Sci-fi story/adventure. It has alot more to Offer you.\n\n+ Having Doom 3, Resurrection of Evil, Lost Mission, Doom 1 and Doom 2 is great since there is so much entertainment to be had.\n\n+ Once you have completed the games there is still more to do such as multi-player, leaderboards and Steam achievements. This gives you a few more hours gameplay. The multi-player is a bit hard to start becasue not so many people play it. But if you try then you can create a match.\n\n+ The PC port runs very well and you should be able to max the game out easily. I used to play Doom 3 on my old computer witch only had a i3... No grathics card and I could run it on medium 900p.\n\n+ The environments are very detailed and change from time to time which works well becasue once it starts to get boring the game changes by allowing you to go into space or old parts of the space ship.\n\n- As I just said that the environment changes, the one problem with that is the massive build up. You visit hell towards the end which is great! But its very short which leaves you wanting more. But every other environment is fine.\n\n- The gametime is around 10 to 15 hours. Thats good but you find that its get a bit repetitive towards the end of the game because you just end up shooting then walking, then shooting and again, again and again. It fun but not arfter a while. Thats only a small issue with it.\n\nOverall I think that Doom 3: BFG Edition is a fun game which has lots of thing to offer. I would say its worth the money and if you like first person shooters then you should get this game. I am going to rate it 8.5 out of 10. Almost a 9 but only because there should be more gametime spent in hell which was so fun while is lasted that short amount of time. A great game which I would recommend.","December 20, 2014","true","42.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I played a lot the shareware of Doom. I've Doom Collector's Edition. I've Doom for GBA. I've played Doom 3 and RoE back then. Why do you think I owned that now? Because it contains old Doom for Win7. And because  now, I don't have to switch to flashling. And because there is a new mission. And... I'm a Doom fangirl. Nothing is better than Doom (and Half-Life).\n\nAnyway, Doom 3 BFG Edition is composed of:\n- Ultimate Doom\n- Doom II\n- Doom 3\n- Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil\n- The Lost Mission\n\nUltimate Doom is the original Doom with an episode added later. It means graphics from the 90', no jump button, mythic soundtrack. The only difference is that achievements were added. Not a lot though. You're a Marine sent on Mars after an altercation with your commanding officer. Too bad, you're the last one of the security still alive after something going wrong on Phobos...\n\nDoom II is the sequel of Doom. After beating the demons, you returned on Earth. Unfortunately for you, it seems that Hell preceded you. It's up to you to save mankind! But as for Ultimate Doom, it's the same graphics, new soundtracks, the famous double-barreled shotgun and new enemies.\n\nDoom 3 is a sort of reboot of Doom. You're sent on Mars to replace someone and well, it's the day someone decided that Hell will invade Mars. The graphics are those of mid-2000, with a nice soundtrack, the good old weapons with new designs. But this new version has a major difference: the flashlight is mounted on the weapon, which means that you loose a little of the ambiance where you had to switch from a weapon to a flashlight.\n\nDoom 3: RoE is set two years after the loss of Mars City. A new signal has been picked up and Elizabeth McNeil's team return to check it. Too bad, the bad man from Doom 3 is back and you, as a new Marine, must defeat him. RoE introducted the principle of energy cells to transfer, a new artifact with special powers, the return of the double-barrelled gun and the introduction of the Grabber, sort of Gravity Gun. From the original RoE, the main difference is mainly set in Hell: you have a whole portion cut.\n\nThe Lost Mission is merely a sort of cut levels from Doom. It's just a nice bonus.\n\nIf you want a collection of Doom games, go for it. Because nothing is more fun to see the evolution and collect PDA, listening to them to get codes or reading them to get a good idea of the story, at least, for Doom 3. Because for Doom or Doom II, it's just a question of I shoot-I load-I find a key-I open the last door.","November 27, 2012","true","98.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","7"

Now, if you haven't played Doom before, but want to get into the series, this is the perfect stepping stone in getting your feet wet in the Doom universe. Now, the action is second to none, easily based on actual events so newcomers and fans of this series will rejoice at what Doom 3: BFG Edition has to offer. Now when I had first booted this game up and saw the intro, the amount of emotion, and the amount of detail that it managed to elicit from me, was nothing short of etherial. I truly felt connected to the Doom universe as a whole, but when you finally get through the intro and you remember you are playing a game, you see an abomination on the lower part of the screen that looks like a cross of Coop from Megas XLR and Max from the Blue Tax commericals. The nameless hero you play as has only 2 attacks, shoot and punch. The next thing I want to mention is how remarkable the backbrounds are, the computers bleep blooping in the background truly sells the atmosphere, and I can easily say that this game did not disappoint in the landscape and background design department. At the bottom of the screen you will also see a portrait of the face you are probably making, I know this was the face I made during this entire play session. Health is replenished by eating medical kits, as it took me a good hour to figure this out because instructions are non existant. There's billions of people in the world, but who wants to meet them when you can drink Mountain Dew and play Doom 3: BFG Edition. I have not played Doom 1: BFG Edition or Doom 2: BFG Edition, but I did buy a snapback with the money I had saved, hallelujah. So, in conclusion if you like Doom, you're gunna like this game, if you don't like Doom, you're gunna like this game, if you like video games, you're gunna like this game, if you like putting your hands in your pockets, you're really gunna like this game, you're gunna like this game, it's a good game.","May 14, 2014","true","36.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

There are no new art assets, but there are a few changes. Besides having the option to run at a max 60FPS or max 120FPS, it also features a shoulder-mounted flashlight (although you can turn it off if you wish), Oculus Rift support, and some other graphical options. I have also heard that iD tweaked ammo and health placement, although I can't say what's different since it's been such a long time since I played the original Doom 3.\n\nAt the time of writing, I do not know any mods for Doom 3 BFG edition. Since this uses a different engine than the original Doom 3, this version is NOT COMPATABLE WITH MODS FOR THE ORIGINAL DOOM 3! However, iD recently released their source code for BFG edition, so perhaps mods could be made/ported to this game in due time.\n\nAlthough multiplayer includes deathmatch, CTF, and other modes, it's dead as of time of this writing. It uses peer-to-peer, so it's difficult to see who is playing, assuming anyone is. Perhaps the holiday sales will change that, but I am doubtful.\n\nIf you never owned Doom 1 +2, Doom 3 or any of its expansions, I still have a hard time recommending this.

Taken in small doses, its jump-scare filled corridors can be quite entertaining. And the BFG edition wrapped the entire product in a trouble-free installation, complete with Doom and Doom 2 as a nice added bonus. Its not something I'd ever have bought for full price but, well, you know... Steam Summer Sale.\n\nAt first glance, the BFG edition is a huge step backwards, however. Its default level-of-detail seems to be set for XBox-era graphics, and its annoying tendency to autosave interrupts the game flow with a tasteless on-screen reminder. A few hacks remedied these minor issues, although even then the lighting - once the crown jewel of the idTech4 engine - seems less sophisticated than in its original release. Fortunately, the gameplay remains unmolested. True, its endless monsters-in-the-closets are trite and unimaginative, but - so long as I kept my sessions short - still workable nonetheless. The new "Lost Levels" campaign isn't anything to write about; dull, linear levels that tell no story; its saving grace is that it is too short to get upset about.","November 25, 2013","false","5.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

This franchise brings back so many memories.\n\nThis BFG Edition comes with the original DOOM and DOOM II. I hear a lot of people say that's it's better to get the original DOOM 3 because it's more mod friendly, and get the Doom Classic Complete because it comes with Final DOOM and Master Levels of DOOM II.\n\nWell I already own DOOM 3. I believe it was the first game i got back in the day when I built my first rig and dove into PC gaming. I remember that awesome feeling. The graphics were just beautiful. There was all this talk about how you needed a $3,000- $4,000 PC to run the game on Ultra I was so giddy with my new PC being able to run DOOM 3 in at least High settings. I never got the expansions, so this edition takes care of that. I am looking forward to finally playing them. The biggest difference from the original DOOM 3 and this re-release is the fact that the flashlight is gone. The flashlight added a tad to the game, you chose to light up the room and be vulnerable or walk in the dark but properly equipped. After a while the whole thing was just annoying and you just wanted to ductape the damn flashlight to your shotgun. In DOOM 3 BFG, the flashlight is now integrated into your armor. So far, i really don't miss the flashlight.\n\nRight now I've mostly played the Original DOOM. I love that game. I never played it on PC, I owned it on the SEGA 32x. At the time I really had no idea how watered down the 32x version was. I almost don't recognize the stages because they are not as dull as they were on the 32x. It had been like a decade since i played the original DOOM and for the most part, i still remember a lot of the stages and secret areas. I'm having a blast reliving this game. I got this whole game for $5 on Amazon. I already feel like i got my money's worth.\n\nI never played DOOM II, so i am definitely looking forward to that.\n\nFor $5 I think this was a great pickup for me. I can live with not having the complete edition of the classic DOOM games, and as far as DOOM 3, i never really used mods with it. Maybe I'll get the classic complete on the side later. Only thing that puts me off a bit is that i hear that DOOM Classic Complete runs on DOS Box. The games that are included on this version, don't run off DOS Box.\n\nThe only real con about this game (Maybe others aren't having this issue) is the fact that i cannot minimize the game. The game acts like it's minimized, your windows taskbar comes up on the bottom, but the game is on top of your desktop, so you can't pull anything up, the game is always on top.","December 13, 2013","true","94.2"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

You know why? Because of the changes to Doom 3 and RoE and classic Doom games:\n\n1. Game being brighter. I know a lot of people thought that original Doom 3 was TOO dark, but making it brighter reduces the atmosphere that this game has. Even with lowest brightness setup, the game is a little bit brighter than max brightness in the original.\n2. Mounted flashlight - probably THE MAIN reason why a lot of people prefer this version over the original. Makes sence for console versions (PS3/XBox360), but PC - not so much. I like that vulnerability situation when you hold a flashlight in the original game and there's an enemy in your face. In this version: Enemy in front of you in the dark room; flashlight on; shotgun to the face with flashlight on. Also the flashlight is limited, unlike the original 2004 game.\n3. Ammo. The game quite literally feeds you with an ammo. In Level 4 of Doom 3 campaign i ended up with full shotgun and machine gun ammo. Even on Veteran, it's easy with all that ammo. I think it makes sence for console versions to feed you with an ammo, but for PC - not at all.\n4. Level changes in RoE are just stupid in my opinion: Waste Tunnels have been changed by removing the gas in the tunnels and the helmet in this kind of an airlock, so you don't have to kill Hazard zombies to get their oxygen tanks, well you need to kill everyone you see, but you get the idea. Entire section in Hell, where you need to use an Artifact to puch out a bunch of Mancubi, Hellknights and Imps, is completely gone, The Maledict fight is easier because 1. He doesn't spawns Lost Souls, and 2. The rocks (or meteorites or whatever the hell they are) do less damage.\n5. If you think it's enough of changes? No, because the changes to classic Doom games are even worse: Wolfenstein levels after Map 15 are just "naked", 2 changes to Nightmare! difficulty involves the speed of Demons being reduced to UV speed and the speed for fireballs being reduced. The red cross in Medikits, Stimpacks and Berserk packs have been replaced by red'n'white pill, which is lame. The music sounds weird and awkward, can't: change controlls, open the console, use cheats, play multiplayer. Just, why?\nThe Lost Missions are fine, but they're too short.\n\nConclusion\nDoom 3: BFG Edition is a good way to remember the horror of the original Doom 3, it's still enjoyable, i would recommend it if not for changes, but no. I would say, if you own original Doom 3: Phisical copy or Steam, stick with them, and if you really want to play the remastered version - "Go 2 It", it's up to you. 6/10","August 31, 2015","false","37.7"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","16","28","2","0"

Doom 3 is One of the most controversial games ever made. But still a amazing game and a master piece for the survival horror genre, this is one of the best survival horror games ever made, and its a fact. The most hate about this game is actually the survival horror aspect from it. Because the old doom games was like "killed everything and everyone with powerful guns, find the key and go the next level". This doom 3 makes you scare to find keys, and actually have a story, and is really but really dark, the game have amazing graphics! Even today looks amazing! The game age very well, when you look at it is hard to believe this game have actually more then 10 years, the gameplay is smiliar to quake and half life, with a small tweek you need to use your flashlight a lot. Its impossible to play this entire game and dont jump from your chair one time. This pack have the doom legacy and you can understand the evolution from doom, and also you will understand why many poeple hate doom 3. I love original dooms like the next guy i even remember the time when doom came out and you have 15 disks to install it, and also how the amazing the original games was. But doom 3 is my favourite and in my opinion is the best, and i love the new concept about it. If you are a survival horror fan you need to really play this even if you never played the originals. This game still have things from the old dooms like the monsters, weapons and the "hell" aspect. The game have also one of the best Expansion packs ever made to a game. The expansion pack RoE is also amazing. The reality is. Doom 3 is one of is kind! The only thing smiliar to this is bioshock or FEAR but still not as scary as doom 3.

It's terrible as a sequel to the original Doom games, but it -is- a good game! Please, let me explain. The original Doom and it's sequel, Doom II, are fast-paced shooters in which you strafe about wildly shooting at hordes of demons on a Mars base, with no real plot to speak of, and it's just raw FUN. Doom 3, on the other hand, really tries to...honestly, I'm not sure what the heck they were trying to do. Here's what we got, though: a shooter that cares more about jump scares and being dark; effectively a survival horror game in space with tons of health and ammo drops.\n\nThe game itself is good, despite being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of the original games' tone, because the shooting and some of the creepy tone work well enough to make for an exciting time. That said, the shadows really, really, really suck. They're graphically nice, but this game is DARK. On the bright side (see what I did there?), Doom 3 BFG Edition fixes one very big problem: the flashlight. In the original release of Doom 3, the flashlight is held in your hand like a gun...meaning for you to see well, you can't have a gun out. Guess what's in the dark? That's right, bunches of enemies. This is one of the biggest gripes people had with the game, myself included. People modded in a flashlight that worked while you had your gun out, and in Doom 3 BFG Edition, the developers have automatically made the flashlight/gun combo an automatic feature! The game is now eerily dark, but you do have a flashlight to make it "not suck" to use the technical jargon.\n\nTo quickly interject, the fact that Doom 3 BFG Edition includes Doom (1993) and Doom II is wonderful! I played through both and had a magnificent time. The games were just as good now as when I played them way back when, and I'm very rarely a nostalgia type of gamer. That said, people who didn't play them originally might not like them!\n\nIf you want a game that feels like the original two Doom games, Doom 3 is not it. Enemies are reskinned to the point that most of them look only barely like their original forms, with the exception of a few like the Revenant and Mancubus. Running/shooting is much slower-paced than the original games as well. If you go in wanting the "Doom" experience, you will not get it at all. However, this really was an enjoyable game for me. I definitely recommend it if you'd like a dark sci-fi/horror shooter and aren't expecting "Doom" from it.","May 22","true","55.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

As a huge doom fan from the start, i was very surprised that they were going to release a remastered version of D3.\n\nGraphics (6)\nDoom 1 and 2 are just as you would expect. They look the same as before, but i honestly didn't care. Why? They included new chapters which i never played before and it was really interesting playing doom with the original graphics they had. I'm so used to the sourcepot graphics now that i didn't realize how it actually looked like. So that was nice. My only complaint is how they "Censored" the game. I think it was pathetic to do so. They removed the Cross from the medkit and the wolfenstine levels because they were afraid that it was going to be banned in Germany.\n\nWhile doom 3's shadow engine is amazing, they didn't "Remaster" anything. The graphics still look the same for me. Hell, there are mods that do a better job in terms of improving the graphics out there. That was very dissapointing.\n\n\nSound (8)\nThe sound in the doom games is what makes it so good. They sound awsome, and feel awsome. The music is also kick ♥♥♥!\nThe music in doom 1 is a hell of a lot better than the one in doom 2. I recognize more music from doom 1 than from doom 2, due to the fact that you can barely hear the music in doom 2, or that it just doesn't sound as memorable.\nIn doom 3, if you dont play the game with sound, you ain't doing it right. The sound in doom 3 does a great job at keeping you shivering and careful.\n\n\nGameplay(6)\nDoom 1 and 2 play well and run fine on my computer. Nuff said\nDoom 3 sadly doesn't support my graphics resolution, as the max it does is 1400x600 ( i think, doesn't matter, it has very little choice) while mine is 1600x900. Another annoying thing is how the game tends to lower the graphics quality sometimes. My computer is very good, however, if it is not plugged in, it switches to the integrated, crappier graphics to keep battery life[forum.techinferno.com]. This is a huge problem for me since i face the Annoying plugged in not charging[en.community.dell.com] and i also like to play on the school bus. In the BFG edition, bethesda decided to remove the handheld flashlight and change it for a suit in battery. This not only makes the game easier, but it makes jumpscares less scary. In doom 3, you have to quickly switch weapons if you encounter an enemy, which leaves you struggling and trembling in fear and then making you look for them in the dark, however, here you can just shoot them. Done. Move on. In doom 3 BFG edition, they still haven't fixed the  Alt-Tab problem with doom 3[hardforum.com]. Another problem is that since you have to run back after you completed a mission, you tend to sprint, but the player running feels like a senior citizen trying to powerwalk, which is annoying since you  run really fast in doom 1 and 2[forums.stickpage.com]. The jumpscares in doom 3 also get very repetitive. You see a key on the floor and you say:\n\n"ok, if i pick that up, a monster will probbably spawn"\n\nAnd you pick it up and SURPRISE! A monster spawned!\n\nHowever, doom 3 does have some very clever jumpscares hidden in it.\n\n\nSo to wrap things up:\n\nDom 3: BFG Edition is worth your money if you want an easier experience playing, you want extra episodes (like i did) and if you live in Germany. I liked having all the doom games in one pack (Final doom was not made by ID), but some things that they claim are not very true. I reccomend this for people who want a blast from the past or a game that will deliver quite frequent jumpscares. I quite enjoyed this myself, but some things need to be sorted out.","January 8, 2014","true","12.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

With the seminal Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, and an idTech 5 port of Doom 3 to start with, this package also contains a couple of expansion packs that have never been released before. Namely, No Rest for the Living for Doom 2 and The Lost Mission for Doom 3. In the months following its release, ZDoom and its derived ports have been adapted to be compatible with this version of the Doom and Doom 2 data files, so if you're into modding, you should no longer have an issue running ZDoom mods with this package's version of Doom 1 & 2.\n\nIf there is one thing that really disappointed me about this edition of the game, it's that it does not include other commercial iWADs that were included in previous classic Doom collections and compilations. Namely, there's no Plutonia, TNT, Master Levels for Doom or even D!Zone levels included. It would also have been nice if this was finally the legitimate way to acquire Hell 2 Pay or Perdition's Gate.\n\nConsidering who this is marketed to though, I can't really blame them too much for it. If you've never heard of Doom, I would recommend it. However, die-hard doom fans can very much afford to skip on this, or failing that, wait for a sale if they HAVE to get No Rest for the Living or The Lost Mission.","December 27, 2013","true","16.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Having a mounted flashlight on your armor just ruins the atmosphere like "Dark area and demons *Hit f key* There we go I am safe" Some events like escorting the scientist with the lamp or following the light up IMP experiment tube for light were completly tedious! The whole reason those events happened is cause you had no flashlight with your guns, but now? "OH ♥♥♥♥♥, the scientist died!" Or "Oh fick mich! The tube is already long gone" *Magical F key* Lets just make that scientist and stuff useless cause now my light is shoulder mounted! Not only that?! The game only runs in 1280x720... I could not make it run in fullscreen on a higher resolution or I got a openGL error. I had to go and lower my resolution through my Operating system so I could run in Fullscreen not Windowed...THIS GAME IS A BROKEN MESS!!! This is nothing more then a freaking cash in on the original DOOM franchise before bethesda releases a fourth game.

It went down to $5 in the sale, and since it came with Doom I and II, I figured it was worth at least a try. The main argument against this version is that, hypothetically, Doom 3 with the expansion and a few modifications installed surpasses this version. I have to say - getting Doom 3 working, widescreen, on Windows 7, with mods, is quite the pain in the ♥♥♥, and the benefit is really not that much.\n\nThe BFG addition adds a different flashlight mechanci from the original, and on top of that, the game is brighter in general. The added brightness really makes the game flow a lot better. The flashlight is now attached to your suit, but can't stay on forever, needing a bit of time to recharge. The overall effect is that the game is a bit less tense, but it just plays way better overall. The game is stuck in ultra settings, with no way to adjust the quality downward, and there's a terrible motion blur setting that is fortunately easy to disable. There's also the previously console exclusive Lost Missions, which are a couple of extra bonus levels.\n\nI think this is the definitive Doom collection. If you want to play the Doom games, this is a good place to go. You can have them all under one roof, functional, without having to play with a ton of INI files to get them working well on your modern machine.","December 29, 2013","true","44.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Plus it comes with the most ground breaking fps's of all time, Doom and Doom 2, but in imo should've also came with Final Doom because it has by far the best made and most challenging levels of all Doom games. The only two things I can think of about this game that suck are when you get hit and the shotgun. When you take dmg your view jerks wildly making your view all cockeyed and off and you have to re-adjust. It's bad when you are getting shot but really bad when you get hit in melee. Also the shotgun is the most useless weapon ever put in a video game: you can be two feet away from a basic zombie and your shot won't kill it because the weapon spread is so incredibly wild. I can stand nearly against a wall and fire and the bullet marks cover about a 4ft radius. There have even been user made mods to correct it because it's so bad. Use them because otherwise the shotgun is useless. But the rest of the weapons in the game are solid and satisfying when you fire them.\nSome people dislike this because it is nothing like the original Doom's. I would give it about a 7.5/10 compared to the original Doom games being a 10/10. Hopefully the new Doom game will recapture the magic that this game left out. Still though, the guns and monsters are faithful to Doom and that is what makes this game a fun playthrough.\nThis game is still a good classic. Pick it up for a lot of fun and a lot of scare moments that will have you sh-tting your pants.","February 9","true","21.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played it a decade ago, before steam existed and it is the same gameplay and graphics with that old one. But of course, the problem is not them claiming that it has better visual things generally, it is because the so called "lost missions", are virtually the same rooms with other parts of the original game and its expansion. At almost every turn, you see a "Frankenstein" fragment of what you saw before. A rip-off, a re-heated soup. They just needed a bait, in order to lure the old owners of the game, to buy it again. And lastly(as far as I can remember at least), if you make the mistake to enable the console, you must say goodbye to the achievements. Without any warning, when you are about to make an achievement, THEN and only then, you will be informed that the console has been enabled and so the achievements have been disabled. There are some painfully time/nerves wasting "solutions" offered by steam and/or the game' s makers, but you will end up being able to make only some achievements and not others. I had about one year to play it, exactly for this reason and now that I bothered to continue  playing it, it did the same $h!t. Untolerable!

You get DOOM 3, yes, but also more of the same asskicking gameplay in two awesome mission packs (Ressurection Of Evil & Lost Mission) and, on top of that, DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 are added on just for old time's sake so you can relive where first-person shooting really began.\nIf you're brand new to DOOM and you're a first-person shooter kind of gamer, well, are you in for a treat! - DOOM 3 is said to be one of the best FPS games ever, developed by the people who actually popularized the genre: id Software.\n\nThe story in short:\nIt is 2145 and humans, under the auspices of the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), have established a research facility on Mars.  Employees are mostly engineers, scientists or soldiers.  Research is being done in the fields of biology, space exploration, teleportation and weapons development.  Furthermore, exciting evidence has been found of previous inhabitants: an alien civilization that was destroyed by a vicious and seemingly unstoppable enemy.  Incredible times.\nHowever, a growing unease has filtered through UAC personnel.  Rumours are abound of strange things happening,like unexplained voices and otherworldly creatures roaming the facility, sometimes resulting in accidents or even loss of life.  In addition, the facility, under Dr. Malcolm Betruger, is running an ever-increasing tab on the corporation's resources and Earth has sent a representative to investigate.  It turns out that Betruger, through his work in teleportation, has opened a portal to another dimension and in so doing has enabled hostile creatures to come through to Mars.  In reality, these creatures are demons and the place they come from is ... hell.  They are the same malignant creatures that destroyed the ancient Martian civilization.\nYou play a marine, freshly imported from Earth and dumped into the chaos, on a crusade to stop the evil from invading the Mars facility and, ultimately, Earth.  You have a range of weapons to your disposal, but you will also have to gain information and access to other parts of the facility to complete your task.  You do this by collecting PDA's from personnel, dead and alive, scattered throughout the base.  Since the main portal is situated in hell itself, you will have to travel there (following in Betruger's footsteps) and retrieve a powerful artifact called the Soul Cube which can be used to defeat the enemy's mightiest warrior (as well as assist in the downfall of many other along the way) and close the portal.\n\nThe game can be divided into three large sections: 1) the Mars facility, 2) Hell and 3) the Mars facility revisited, although in the latter part the Mars base and hell ultimately becomes indistinguishable from each other.  Once in possession of the Soul Cube (you bring it back with you from hell), demon attacks become more vicious and your strategy in using the artifact to your advantage becomes key.\n\nSlight changes have been made to the original DOOM 3 (for example, certain triggers and enemies have been taken out and some of your weapons sound a bit different), but you may not even notice it.  The biggest change maybe is how the flashlight works: it is not handheld anymore but a fixed item, so you can use it while you're actually shooting (a definite plus), like in QUAKE 4.  However, the flashlight dies after about 30 seconds and then needs to recharge (in a few seconds) before it can be used again.  Whether this is a good or bad thing probably depends on individual opinion.  Of course, the benefit would be that you don't ever need to manually turn it off, maybe saving you some seconds to concentrate on enemies.\n\nMission Pack 1: Ressurection Of Evil (RoE)\nYou play as a different marine who finds a new artifact on Mars but in the process opens another gateway to hell.  An old enemy, Malcolm Betruger, revels in the prospect of newly invading the world.  Three bosses ("hunters") are released that you will later have to defeat one by one.  You get instructions from Dr. Elizabeth McNeil to destroy the artifact, which (of course) must be done in hell.  So, once again your character travels through the complex on Mars untill you find a portal to hell.  Enough said, no more clues.\nSome new weapons are introduced: a "grabber gun" and Sarge's shotgun (find the cabinet code first, though).  The grabber gun may not seem like much, but it will make life easier.  It is used to move object (like crates, boxes, drums and stones) and to catch fire balls mid-air and throw them back at enemies.  It can be used to directly kill small enemies and pick up items that are out of reach.  Sarge's double-barrelled shotgun is a valuable tool at close range, boasting more punch than the game's regular shotgun.  It fires two cartridges at once, which are replaced manually by your character in about three seconds.\nA few new enemies make their appearance, including a tougher kind of imp that throws white-blue fire balls.  There also is a new large, slow-moving enemy with a powerful ranged attack, but one can easily use its lack of speed to one's advantage.  It may involve guerrilla tactics, running for cover or making sure to have some obstacle between you and your foe when you're not shooting.\n\nMission Pack 2: Lost Mission\nYou play as the only surviving member of Bravo team (remember them from the original Doom 3?) who got wiped out while on a mission - it all starts with a replay of the cut scene from the original game, showing the demise of the team by the hand of some maggots/imps (it is the same incident that damages a cooling rod in the reactor, the one that is replaced by your character in the original game).  Having survived the attack, you then roam the facility continuing the fight on your own.  You link up with a scientist, Dr. Richard Meyers, who informs you of a problem: it so happens that there still exists a working teleporter in "the other dimension" (hell) that could assist the enemy's ultimate goal: invading Earth.  So, once more into the breach you go.  You find your way to hell and reach the portal, fighting enemies large and small, until you face off with a copy of an old enemy from the original game - the Guardian (no seekers this time) - to achieve your goal.\nIn Lost Mission (as in RoE) you get to travel through other, quite scenic parts of hell (obviously, the place is quite expansive).  Your journey even includes a short boat trip on molten lava.\nThere are no new artifacts (also no Soul Cube).  Sarge's sawed-off double-barreled shotgun as well as the grabber gun from RoE make a return.\n\nAll in all, "Doom 3: BFG Edition" is one of the best FPS game bundles you can buy.  It is an extensive, zombie-shooting, demon-hunting experience that should keep you coming back for more until you've cleared out hell of all its evil, and then do it all over again.\n\nEnjoy big time.","November 26, 2014","true","73.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Sadly no Final Doom or Master Levels, but essentially this was designed specifically for the console players. But since they released it also for the PC, so should you buy the original games or this?\n\nDoom 3:\nAll of the changes that have been made is a mod for the original game. Widescreen support? Mod. Flashlight strapped to gun? Mod. HD Graphics? There's a mod that makes it look better than this re-release. Seriously. They have also made everything more bright, which many say, including me, that it ruins part of the scariness of the original. Also the Lost Mission isn't that good, it's not really worth your time. In fact, the only thing that I can say is better than the original is that the loading times are a bit better. (also they removed the ability to open console so that's cool)\n\nClassic Doom:\nWell, you have your classic Doom 1 and 2. The changes they have made are interesting, they have censored some of the graphics in some sprites and textures, they have REMOVED CHEATS I repeat REMOVED CHEATS. I don't understand why they would remove cheats, I suspect since they initially were making Doom 3: BFG Edition for the console players but decided to put it on the PC. Also there is NO MULTIPLAYER I repeat NO MULTIPLAYER even though in the interviews for this game they clamed that Doom 1 and 2 would have multiplayer. Why? Who knows. Maybe they just didn't want to bother, I have no idea. Also some people claim this to be important but THEY HAVE LOWERED THE DIFFICULTY IN NIGHTMARE. Aka Nightmare is allot more easy now. They have made some other small little changes, but other than these major things, the game is still pretty fun.\n\nConclusion: If you want to play Doom 3, don't get this. If you get the Doom 3 Pack on steam it's allot cheaper. Plus it supports a huge amount of mods, while this doesn't. If you want to play Doom 1 and 2, don't get this. Get the original games, then once you bought them don't play them in steam. Extract the wad files and install a source port (ex. ZDoom) and then play away in whatever resolution your monitor is in!\n\nBut, if you are looking for a Doom 1, 2 and 3 pack... Well... Technically it is cheaper, but the wad files you get with this I heard didn't work with source ports for some odd reason and there still are no mods for Doom 3 so I would recommend the original.\n\nTL;DR This isn't worth the money. But I'm rating it up since it's Doom.","January 4, 2015","true","7.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Doom 3 is ... well it's a good shooter, but it gets VERY repetitive as time goes on. It could do with being about half as long. There is no multiplayer community to speak of. That said, I consider the BFG edition an improvement on the original - the inability to use a flashlight at the same time as a gun might be okay in moder rendering enegine, but in the original game, anything that is in the dark is completely invisible, making navigation rather ... difficult.

Start the game, and you select which you want to play from the main menu, so it’s all very neat and tidy. But apart from that, really, there seems little point in this edition. The changes id made are rather trivial. They made DOOM 3 scenes a little lighter, but less scary in the process.  Lets be honest, do we really care that we can now see the miles and miles of bland pipes that make up all the DOOM 3 backgrounds? They would have done better changing the sounds, which are rather bland. But anyway, is it worth it? If you already have the games, then no. There aren’t enough changes to even justify a sale price!

It is fairly claustrophobic and tense at times.  This game keeps on spawning Imps and stuff behind you, or when you open the door there is always something jumping.  It just gets too repetitive. Deadspace got more wacky and frustrating towards the end, but this one is better than 'Deadspace' series.   I also feel that although Doom 1 and 2 were far older tech, they definitely had a more disturbing and hellish environment.  But within the genre, I still like Amnesia far more.\n\nThird is FPS - while it has good mechanics, I don't like the guns much.  The monsters shaking and hitting you from all around is a bit too much.  Imps were too strong compared to before and I couldn't enjoy Cacos or Pinkys as in previous versions.   Also it is mostly closed area combat whereas in Doom 2 it was open space.  You could run around and start getting them to shoot each other- it was a frenzy.  This one is basically being boxed out to a spot.\n\nFourth, is Doom 3 vs. Doom 3 BFG Edition.  I did not see a huge graphics upgrade between them but flashlight being turned on in addition to the gun is a huge plus.  Why would you fight hellish creatures with a flashlight in one hand, but turn it off to shoot???  Also, Doom 3 plus Ressurection should have been a single game.  It is a single story and I think they got too greedy with this.  10 hrs of gameplay plus 5 hours DLC?? But at least they follow each other.  However Lost Mission DLC is definitely a lost cause- It is by far the worst DLC I have seen in any game.  This is the definition of 'linear game' because you have no choice other then move forward.  And this is dull.  It feels like they gave this to their Juniors to develop - many of the same maps reused and just monsters respawning.  So if you played Doom 3 and or Resurrection, you don't need BFG Edition.  But if you start from scratch, I would go with BFG but not play Lost Mission.\n\nLast is the enjoyment factor. Do you really want to waste 20 hours of your life here?  Comparing it to other games like Bioshock Infinite, Tombraider, Skyrim etc, this is just not fun enough,  You know that something will jump or spawn somewhere but basically that is it.  I turned to Godmode after a while not to lose time anymore and that was a right decision.\n\nSo overall as a game it is OK and playable for horror seekers, but I think in 2014 we have far more options to enjoy.   It is not a bad game but you just want it to end after a while :)","September 13, 2014","false","11.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

However, when I first bought it, I really just wanted Doom 3.\n\nThe reason for this is in the old Doom 3, you were able to create custom maps and load up mods for the game to spice it up after you get tired of the campaign. I mean, the missions are almost all dark cooridors with enemies that ambush you at every turn. Carmack himself stated he wanted to make the next Doom game scary, and so he sacrificed the gameplay for this. Yeah, the horror game gimmick is there, but it wears off fast. After ten missions of it, you expect having closets full of Zombies open after walking into a room where all of the lights go out because you touched an armor vest lying on a table. The reason why there was a map editor there at all was probably to encourage players to make their own levels if they were dissatisfied with the unchanging gameplay of the missions.\n\nThe BFG edition comes with Doom and Doom 2, which have extra missions you can play, but no multiplayer. The only game that comes with BFG edition is Doom 3, and I was a little disappointed with it for the reasons mentioned above. Despite that, the game is easier to play with the flashlight attachment to your weapons instead of needing to take it out to see what you are doing. Shadows in the new version are nicer, and there is a lost mission campaign to go along with the main campaign and the Ressurection of Evil addition.\n\nI recommend this game to players who mostly use Steam, or if you don't know how to map or mod. But if you are like me who would rather make my own custom maps, or have fun with fan made modifications and addons, I would rather just get the original Doom 3 game.","January 13, 2014","false","33.5"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

Doom 3 BFG edition is great for original fans of the doom 3 game/original dooms, but don't have the original disks to install (or floppy drives), and also want a little extra 'lost mission' campaign to throw in. This is also great for people who have never played doom 3 before.\n\nThe graphical enhancements to the doom 3 game annoy me a little (too bright now), but the enhancements of the original games make them much more playable. It's hard to see when we're so used to modern shooters. There are a lot of sweet mods (brutal doom for example) out there for the original doom games too, so players can enjoy the most recent doom games, and download some sweet mods as well.\n\nThis is definitely not a doom 3.5, to be perfectly honest. I believe that everyone else will probably agree with that as well. This is, however, a good all in one package with a cool (but short) extra new campaign thrown in. Some of us doom fans may have never owned doom 1 and doom 2 (plus the expansions), so it's nice to finally have all of those in an easy to reach steam title. The modding community (still alive today) for original doom and doom 2 adds a lot of value, in my opinion.","April 8, 2014","true","36.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Loads of achievements and many are actually quite fun to complete, like Doomed Collector, where you need to find all of the PDAs in the Doom 3 campaign. Multiplayer is included, but at time of writing, the playercount is sparse. Setting up a match is easier than pie and takes not even minutes before you're jumpin' and jukin' and shooting your friends.

Some say it was a success, others a failure.\nRegardless, it developed a cult following.\n\nDOOM 3: BIG ♥♥♥♥ING GUN EDITION is the same game you enjoy from 2004, except with a few tweaks.\n\nThis game has always been a Western take on the Eastern "Survival Horror" genre. It being Western-developed at the time meant more action oriented than what you were used to in a "Survival Horror" like, say, Resident Evil.\n\nWhen this game was originally developed they tried to separate it from the rest of the franchise by making it more visceral and scary. This edition still retains all of the same atmosphere and tension you remember, but they revamped the gameplay to make it like they actually wanted it the first time around: like Doom I and II. The game has more ammo drops and the gun locations have been somewhat changed making them a little easier to find. The textures have all been redone and upgraded, as well as the lighting. This is another spot that makes it different from it's initial release. Upon comparison you will notice the original 2004 was noticeably darker. That being said, they didn't have as great of an engine to show off back then, either. The AI have been upgraded to be more responsive and ferocious as well.\n\nThis game comes filled with extra content. Not only does it come with DOOM 3, it comes with DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil, an all new expasion pack - DOOM 3: The Lost Mission, as well as the original DOOM I and II!\n\nThis is the definitive collection of DOOM, I highly recommend it.\n\n10/10","December 20, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's Doom.  Through and through, it's an ID Software Doom game.  Over-the-top represenation of the UAC and what Hell looks like, right down to the name of the monsters.  A word to any AAA developers, this is how you're supposed to make a very immersive FPS with scary elements.  Yes, there are jump-scares, but a lot of the atmosphere is just as scary as well (the sounds are absolutely amazing).\n\nMy only grip with the game is the gun order is not the same as the original Doom.  The original Doom was:\n\n1 - Fist/Chainsaw\n2 - Pistol\n3 - Shotgun/Double-Barrel Shotgun\n4 - Chaingun\n5 - Rocket Launcher\n6 - Plasma Rifle\n7 - BFG 9000\n\nI guess they were out-of-order since a few new weapons were introduced (hand-held grenades is one of them).  Regardless of that small gripe, this game is totally worth every penny.  A total steal when on sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dickraiden/recommended/208200/","dickraiden","Scara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dickraiden/","137 products in account","So this game is another id/Bethesda duo game. I'm gonna try and keep this short because I feel kind of embarassed when I write super duper long reviews.\n\nLet me start off by saying I ♥♥♥♥ing love Doom. I do my best to share it with and introduce it to my friends because I want other people to discover this amazing series. Let me tell you a story about Doom 3, a true story.\n\nDoom 3 did not tickle Scaramouche in the pickle department. No, sir. He wanted it very bad, but when he saw the reviews he was very easily turned off. The game did not seem close enough to older Doom games and when you have a gap like the massive gaping wound between Doom 2 and Doom 3 there has to be some connection, and here everything seemed awfully different.\n\nYears later, Scaramouche actually bought this game during a summer sale - the Doom 3 BFG edition, not the standard. At this time all Mouche had was a laptop from 2008 but he figured that would be enough to run a game that came out around that time, especially with utilities like HiAlgoSwitch and whatnot. To his dismay, however... the game did not run at all.\n\nDoom 3 and Doom 3: BFG Edition will only (ONLY!) run on computers with graphics cards that support OpenGL. While this does promise some decent graphics this is pretty uncool for people like Scaramouche.\n\nWell finally Scaramouche got a desktop computer with much better specs, installed Doom 3: BFG Edition, and ran it.\n\nIt was nothing like the Doom 3 that Scaramouche had dreaded. This game was a different beast. Doom 3 standard seemed more like it would fit in with more generic modern horror games but Doom 3 BFG Edition was different. It had all of the spooky scariness of modern horror gaming and the spooky scariness of older horror gaming - Like old Doom. Scaramouche was very pleased and proceeded to play through it all as fast as he could as he went about comparing the two versions. The better flashlight and the tweaked balance were both great in his opinion. He was compelled to finish the game, and a few months later, he finally got around to recommending it.\n\nOkay so... during our little story here we already talked about some stuff I liked about this game and honestly that's all I liked about it and it was enough for me to give it a solid rating. The old Doom feeling, the new updating lighting and graphics, the flashlight change (In Doom 3 you can't use a weapon while you have it out but in BFG you can) and the slight changes to balance all work in BFG's favor.\n\nHOWEVER COMMA\n\n... This game... brings a massive change in style to the Doom franchise. The enemies look oh so EXTREMELY different from the classic Doom games. They all have a more demonic look but... it... the enemy design didn't feel like Doom. It wasn't all cartoonish and badass, it was just... real-♥♥♥.\n\nFor example, I spent all game looking for Barons of Hell/Hell Knights and didn't see any - until I realized that I had, when I looked through the Doom wiki for stats on the Baron of Hell in Doom 2, ironically. They look SOOO different. They aren't big red guys with super cool giant horns wearing khakis. They're huge, buff Doom 3 Imps. And yeah they were supposed to be like huge, buff Doom Imps in Doom 1 and Doom 2, but they didn't just look like strong imps, they looked like Barons of Hell.\n\nYou saw it out of the corner of your eye and thought "Oh god, now he's gonna shoot green ♥♥♥♥ at me right?" but you don't in Doom 3, you see it out of the corner of your eye and think "Ah okay just an imp, I'll dodge that ♥♥♥♥ while I kill this Revenant because it's more important" and he ♥♥♥♥s your ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnd that's not all the change in look for all of the monsters does. The harder difficulties are recommended for Doom veterans so I was like "Well I've beaten Doom on Nightmare a couple times this shouldn't be too bad" but I got rekt on like the just barely over normal difficulty because I didn't know what the ♥♥♥♥ the enemies were gonna do because they LOOKED DIFFERENT BUT DID THE SAME DANGEROUS THING.\n\nAlso, even if you do have all of the badass weapons and speed and strength of the Doom Guy lineage, it doesn't really fit if the art style doesn't make you feel like a  BADASS DOOM GUY , it just makes you feel like... a guy. And it's not just the art style, other things contribute to it. The entire time they keep calling you "MAHREEN," not "Soldier" or "Hero" or anything like that. It's always "MAHREEN, YER FINALLY BACK FROM HELL, NOW GET IN THIS AIR DUCT AND CRAWL TO THIS POSITION!"\n\nYou are treated like ♥♥♥♥ in this game.\n\nHalfway through the game they give you a major decision and ACTUALLY LEAVE IT UP TO YOU to decide based on what you know (Don't worry you actually do have a lot to work with in the thought department), and there is a right answer and a "wrong" answer, but either way, they treat you like you didn't just BLOW THROUGH A HOARD OF DEMONS AND FIX A BUNCH OF ♥♥♥♥ ALL OVER THE FACILITY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, ALL BY YOURSELF PLUS LIKE TWO LITTLE ROBOTS THAT SHOOT THINGS A LITTLE AND THEN DIE. Like SERIOUSLY it's like if your parents leave you at Grandma's for a week and she keeps dropping ♥♥♥♥ and like she can't take care of herself so you have to help her with everything and after a week of ♥♥♥♥ing pain sweat blood and tears helping your grandma who you love she doesn't even thank you one time, she just gives you more ♥♥♥♥ to do and doesn't let you play Doom 3: BFG Edition at all, even though it's like your favorite game or something.\n\nAnd the entire time one part of you wants to tell her that she's a ♥♥♥♥♥ but the other part of you enjoys it because it feels good to work for something, even when you don't know what it is.\n\nAnd then your parents come pick you up and they're like "Did you have fun?" and you tell them you did anyway because hard work makes you feel good and then they're like "Thanks for putting up with this" because they know how hard it must've been, and you gotta smile thinking about it because even though she is a ♥♥♥♥♥ you got to bond with your dear old grandma, and while she's senile and cruel, you understand what it's like kinda and you know what SHE has to deal with.\n\nWHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ HAVE I BEEN TALKING ABOUT? TUNE IN RIGHT HERE TO FIND OUT\nDoom 3: BFG Edition fixes the problems of Doom 3 and still delivers the excellent Bethesda-grade storytelling and the kind of gameplay that only id can deliver. While it may he hard and unrewarding/unforgiving, it's a bit of a long haul to the end that may will take up a lot of your time, and it doesn't feel as cool, quirky, and stylized as older Doom titles, it delivers an engaging experience that keeps you drawn in the entire time, regardless of opinions you have about the standard edition.\n\nI give this game an 8/10. I took off one point because it doesn't feel like old Doom, and one more point because there isn't any super cool music in the background most of the time.","July 19, 2014","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Highly recommend playing it with quality headphones because the audio in that game is top notch. The graphics still look all right considering its age.\n\nThe Lost Missions extra missions for Doom 3 were fairly challenging on Veteran, but not super hard. They have some good sequences though that made them worth playing.\n\nOverall, highly recommend playing through the Doom 3 content at the very least.

Just $20 and you get an improved version of Doom 3 with two expension packs as well as Doom 1 and 2. Doom 3 keeps the same horror jump scare feel although it is more action based now since the flash light is now a shoulder light and there is more ammo then you can use. Now for the bad: it crashes. A lot. About every 20 minutes it will suddently stop working. It shouldn't be my hardware. I am running an a10 5750m APU with the 8970m GPU which runs this game at FULL settings with AA.

There is no reason why anyone should get this version. The multiplayer setting of Doom 3 BFG is so absurd that I have to assume the devs decided to make the worst ♥♥♥♥ing game ever. I'll try to keep the list of horrors to a minimum:\n\n1. No dedicated servers: in other words, you can only play with local people or else the lag will make you want to kill everyone in sight. Seriously, the game pairs you up with ANYONE. Regardless of the area in the world you are. Average ping here is about 250.\n\n2. Absolute lack of multiplayer settings: WOOP. There is pretty much only 3D settings. As in no option for your in-game name (uses your steam name), team switches, votes...\n\n3. Microphones are always on.

JUST DON'T!\n\nThe BFG Edition includes:\n- Doom 1 and Doom 2 playable fom the startscreen of the game.\n- Doom 3 Console Edition which is less creepy and brighter than the original.\n- Doom 3 Resurection of Evil (The Addon)\n- Lost Mission (7 or 8 new SinglePlayer maps)\n- A few Achievments for Doom 1, 2 and 3 + Multiplayer\n\nThe first thing i notice during playing the first chapter of Doom 3 is that everything is brighter and the textures don't look as good as they are in my memories. Also a shotgun mod I used years ago diden't work so I did a research on the BFG edition. The BFG edition is a port of the Xbox and PS edition of Doom 3. They portet the game to a newer engine that is also used in the game RAGE. I guess that's why the models are not as good as the 2004 PC edition, thats why everything is brighter ergo less creepy and thats why it's maybe not possible to mod the game after all.\n\nThat means no Hi-Def Texturepacks or any other graphic booster mod will work. The source code of the BFG edition was released but that don't change the fact that the beautifull graphic mods won't work at all.\n\nSo if you really like DOOM, buy the original PC edition and the Addon + the Doom 1 and 2 pack and you get a creepy game, modable that it looks like modern games and the classic DOOM levels PLUS you safe yourself some money!\n\n\nAbout Doom 3 itself:\n----------------------------------------\nIn the year 2094 or so supplies on earth runns out and humanity is trying to convert moon sand or in this case mars sand into water and fuel. They build a large station on mars with research facilities, fuel and water generators and so.\n\nThe crew somehow begin to act crazy and some rumors are all over the station, so you, a marine, came along to find some guy that is missing and the game begins.\n\nIt's like a merge of Half Life, Deadspace and SystemShock 2. At the end you carrie more than 9 weapons. the PDA system allows you to read e-mails or listen to audio-logs of many PDA's you (need to) find. Many of them contain information to open key-coded doors or lockers. The flashlight is your best friend since the station is falling apart. The enemy spawn system is a bit oldsql but with the dark levels and the near invisible enemies, it's creepy like Deadspace.\n\nThe story is pretty solid and reminds a bit of Half Life 1. So you start with no gun at a "normal" day of work and it turns all into a big action loaded horror game. There are also noticeable Doom 1 elements in Doom 3. For example the fireball throwing enemie and the marine-zombies.\n\nIf you like horror generes, if you liked doom and if you are willing to download some extra texture packs, this is classic egoshooter game for you that brings really fun and can easely be moded to look like actual shooters. but DON'T buy the BFG edition like I did ;-)","August 4, 2013","false","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But upon later inspection, or purchase, you will notice the flaws in the DooM 3 BFG. DooM 3 BFG is alot less compatible then just DooM 3. It will likely hate your graphics card, I tried this on 3 DIFFERENT COMPUTERS, I had problems with them all. If you are looking to mod doom 1 & 2 I would not recommend this, the wads have been censored and modified. As for doom 3, just buy the classic DooM 3. Trust me, it will probably WORK. The only way i could get DooM 3 BFG to work was only on one of the three computers i tried it on. I got it to work, but i have to enter multiplayer every single time i start the game, before going to the singleplayer/campaign, or it just crashes; Speaking of the multiplayer, that's dead too. You might as well get the originals seperately. They at least work the way originally intended and are moddable.","January 6, 2014","false","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I also played first time when it came out, original edition, not BFG. Back then graphics were somehow awesome, but in 2015 it feels outdated (what a wonder :D).\n\nI loved Doom I and II and Doom 3 was a move I did not like. They changed they design completly so in my Opinion this game could be called "Boring Monster Slasher", "I need to reload", "Oh crap, you got me this time" or anything else but not quite Doom. Walking through this game was nice at first but gets old quite fast. Open door, step back, kill the monster, reload, wait for another 1-2 monsters, reload, open next door.\n\nGet it on sale and get Doom I and II with it, which is quite nice.

JUST DON'T!\n\nThe BFG Edition includes:\n- Doom 1 and Doom 2 playable fom the startscreen of the game.\n- Doom 3 Console Edition which is less creepy and brighter than the original.\n- Doom 3 Resurection of Evil (The Addon)\n- Lost Mission (7 or 8 new SinglePlayer maps)\n- A few Achievments for Doom 1, 2 and 3 + Multiplayer\n\nThe first thing i notice during playing the first chapter of Doom 3 is that everything is brighter and the textures don't look as good as they are in my memories. Also a shotgun mod I used years ago diden't work so I did a research on the BFG edition. The BFG edition is a port of the Xbox and PS edition of Doom 3. They portet the game to a newer engine that is also used in the game RAGE. I guess that's why the models are not as good as the 2004 PC edition, thats why everything is brighter ergo less creepy and thats why it's maybe not possible to mod the game after all.\n\nThat means no Hi-Def Texturepacks or any other graphic booster mod will work. The source code of the BFG edition was released but that don't change the fact that the beautifull graphic mods won't work at all.\n\nSo if you really like DOOM, buy the original PC edition and the Addon + the Doom 1 and 2 pack and you get a creepy game, modable that it looks like modern games and the classic DOOM levels PLUS you safe yourself some money!\n\n\nAbout Doom 3 itself:\n----------------------------------------\nIn the year 2094 or so supplies on earth runns out and humanity is trying to convert moon sand or in this case mars sand into water and fuel. They build a large station on mars with research facilities, fuel and water generators and so.\n\nThe crew somehow begin to act crazy and some rumors are all over the station, so you, a marine, came along to find some guy that is missing and the game begins.\n\nIt's like a merge of Half Life, Deadspace and SystemShock 2. At the end you carrie more than 9 weapons. the PDA system allows you to read e-mails or listen to audio-logs of many PDA's you (need to) find. Many of them contain information to open key-coded doors or lockers. The flashlight is your best friend since the station is falling apart. The enemy spawn system is a bit oldsql but with the dark levels and the near invisible enemies, it's creepy like Deadspace.\n\nThe story is pretty solid and reminds a bit of Half Life 1. So you start with no gun at a "normal" day of work and it turns all into a big action loaded horror game. There are also noticeable Doom 1 elements in Doom 3. For example the fireball throwing enemie and the marine-zombies.\n\nIf you like horror generes, if you liked doom and if you are willing to download some extra texture packs, this is classic egoshooter game for you that brings really fun and can easely be moded to look like actual shooters. but DON'T buy the BFG edition like I did ;-)","August 4, 2013","false","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game comes packaged with Doom 3 and it's expansion pack as well as a new small campaign that is interquel to the main game. Additionally small graphical and gameplay tweaks are made that enhance the overall experience, such as being able to wield a weapon and use the flashlight simultaneously. A revamped save system also makes the game more forgiving on the harder difficulties. You will also find bundled the first two original Doom games complete with the "Thy flesh consumed" and "No rest for the living" expansions for Doom 1 and Doom 2 respectively. Minor control tweaks are evident and are far more comfortable than older PC ports of the original two games. The graphics may seem dated by today's standards but they have a certain punk charm to them. More than anying this bundle shows how well the Doom trilogy has aged and I cannot praise this collection enough.","January 9","true","50.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Initially I had a few problems with screen-tearing and random stutters, but after changing the in-game refresh rate to 120hz and turning off v-sync, my game plays perfectly and looks pretty damn nice too. I feel as if people just love to complain about any little thing, COMPLETELY disregarding all of the positive aspects and accomplishments. If you prefer to play DOOM 3 non bfg edition with mods, thats completely fine. I got this version because it came with everything I wanted in one simple package, including DOOM 1, 2, and 3, and all of the expansions for DOOM 3 for just 3 bucks, it was a steal.\n\nNow, time to pee myself again and enjoy every second of it.","February 23","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To be honest, the only reason it's so good is because it's Doom 3. There is nothing too special about this new edition that makes it unique. Unfortunately, do not expect to get Doom 1 and 2 in this package as id Software and Bethesda advertised. The copies of D1 and D2 in this game have been defiled and censored. I seriously question the common sense of whoever made the descision to go back and censor a 20 year old game. All the Nazi refereces have been removed from the secret levels of Doom 2 (the D2 secret levels were basically recreations of levels from Wolfenstein 3D, a game that took place in a secret Nazi castle during WWII). By censoring those levels, all meaning was taken from them and now they just look like stupid blue corridors.\n\nStill, because you can get a graphically enhanced version of Doom 3, plus the Resurrection of Evil expansion pack and the all new "Lost Mission", the game is worth the $20 price tag that it holds at the time of writing. $20 is much less than you would spend to buy new or even used copies of D3 and RoE. I would pick it up if you liked D3.

Higher resolutions and slightly higher res textures. The game runs better.\n\nCons: (This was a con for me, other people might like this) the game is much shorter and easier since you can now use a gun and a flashlight at the same time plus there is much more ammo and the game is brighter (why add a shoulder mounted flashlight when the game is already much brighter?). There is no mod support. Remember the cool Wolfenstein levels in Doom 2? Well they have been censored way too much, look up doom 3 bfg censorship on youtube to see what I mean. If you want 16x AA you need a NVIDIA graphics card.\n\nSo all in all, you could just mod the original to look way better than this.

Graphics are normally extremely important for FPS games however in todays market they are part of the bigger picture.\n\nIt's been years since I played the original Doom3 & RoE, but since I've made the move to Steam I have committed time to completing the BFG edition.\n\nSure the graphics, physics, options and all of that have been decreased but there have been achievements otherwise such as Oculus Rift compatibility. The graphics are standard instead of incredible, unfortunately there's currently no mod support unless somebody was to implement it using the source code (publicly free).\n\nThings that braught me to this one instead of Vanilla were the extras, nicer menus, the lost episode and achievements. I can always switch to Vanilla with HD textures as I own all of them - but then again I'm a huge id Software fan going back more than 20 years now and frankly I would follow them into the ground, I do love their style.\n\nFaults? The story as everybody says is crap but it suffices. It really could have used features (even hidden) to allow mods, different texture qualities etc. Ultimately it's not a bad release, the guys complaining about how bad it looks clearly haven't made games like this before and don't have the same appreciation for the quality of gameplay and this game was constructed to be played on virtually any semi-gaming system. What they (and Carmack as programmer) set out to achieve was achieved.\n\nThe latest Wolfenstein game is the best game I have played since the release of Doom 3, and if that's anything to say for Doom 4 I truly cannot wait for its release next year!","July 27, 2014","true","25.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schwamontee/recommended/208200/","schwamontee","schwamontee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schwamontee/","9 products in account","Nearly all the Doom releases so far, in one package, with steam achievements. The Doom 3 in this edition is “remastered,” though not to everyone’s liking; the old Dooms are almost vanilla with a few odd tweaks that most people won’t notice. Doom purists and those that are looking to mod are both advised to avoid this.\n\nI do recommend this for: 1) total Doom newbs looking for the simplest path forward to prepare their souls for the upcoming Doom release, 2) old-school gamers that want to replay the entire series on a modern machine through one interface and don’t want to fuss around with mods, and 3) steam achievement hunters with strong nostalgia for the series. However, I recommend this edition only if it is dirt cheap; several high-profile critics and a ton of series fans justifiably slammed it at launch for being a bad deal (to say the least) and it’s impossible to argue with that logic at the launch price. Bought dirt cheap on the other hand, no worries.\n\nEveryone else interested in the series will likely be happier avoiding the older titles altogether and waiting to see if the upcoming reboot is any good.\n\nThings to note:\n\nOnline multiplayer seekers: There are two Doom 3 editions on steam (BFG and standard) and they do not have interoperable multiplayer. Doom 3’s multiplayer was never anything special and the core game is over a decade old, so expect either version’s online scene to usually be totally deserted, though both versions do have players and you can stumble on an open match now and then. Doom 3 multiplayer runs notoriously bad, but if you are willing to rough it (e.g., you fondly remember the days of dial-up multiplayer) matches can be fun and unpredictable in short bursts. Seriously competitive types or those that require smooth performance to have fun will just get enraged and are advised to avoid Doom 3 multiplayer entirely. The older Dooms do not have online multiplayer through steam.\n\nSteam achievement hunters: beware the multiplayer-dependent achievements. Note the above caveats about multiplayer and plan to either bring a couple of friends along for the ride or to join the Doom multiplayer community group in steam and actively find people to play with if you want to 100% this.\n\nA rundown of the D3BFG package for newbs to the series:\n\nIncluded in the D3BFG pack are Ultimate Doom (Doom + TFC), Doom II, and Doom II’s NRFTL expansion. Just think of all of these as more of the same game. These original Dooms are simple but satisfying monster shooting galleries where navigating the levels is itself sometimes a puzzle to be solved and difficulty ramps up as you progress with bigger and trickier ambushes of tougher and crazier monsters.\n\nThe main focus of the D3BFG pack however is Doom 3 and its expansions ROE and TLM. Doom 3 was a reboot to the original Dooms; the story, feel, and gameplay are somewhat different. Doom 3 is a hybrid between a typical FPS game of that era and a simplified survival horror game of that era. The highlights in these games are creepy atmosphere, a few good jump scares, and some cool monsters.\n\nA quick way to get a taste of the typical gameplay of the series without dedicating a lot of hours to it is to skip straight to the last expansions for each game engine (NRFTL for original, TLM for reboot) and try to beat them on hard difficulty. These expansions provide a shorter, more condensed snapshot of the core games for those short on time. Play NRFTL on Ultra-Violence and play TLM on Veteran (1 step down from Nightmare in both, which is ridiculously hard in the original and overly frustrating in the reboot).","June 20, 2015","true","66.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is perfect.","February 17, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Brilliant game play, fast action and decent map designs. What you'd expect from a 90s shoot em' up game. DOOM 2, my personal bread and butter out of the lot. Much like DOOM 1 but with better maps and more enemies. and DOOM 3 which, while good, I personally don't think it's as good as 1 and 2.  Possibly the fact that the 3D environment doesn't give the same feel or there isn't demons in your face 24/7 although their is no real shortage of action.\nIf I had to rate the series as a whole, I'd give 10/10. It's worth a buy for sure, full of mindless violence and a somewhat interesting concept and story, although nobody cares about that, we all just want to shoot things.\n\nTL;DR. You get to kill tons of things and is a fast paced action pact game. Worth the buy.","September 15, 2014","true","15.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Why, because the devs decided to make a horrible port and let it rot on the internet. I swear when this happens, its because someone didn't really care that their game was going to die if they decided to do it. I bet I could get the CD version to run in fullscreen without being forced to run in a small window. Sure, that looks good, and runs well, but I want some emersion, and seeing a box outlining the screen is Terrible. No one wants to see a screen reduced to a small pile of crap on you computer. And for those if you must know the way to run this game properly is to go into the properties on steam, set up the launch options to launch the game this way: +Set r_fullscreen  0. Like I said though, you're only getting a small screen. Some peole might luck out and put in 2-4 inplace of 0 and get their fullscreen, but me, guess I'm unlucky. Uninstalled it right after too because either way, if I am going to play a game in a small window I better be recording it or some other reason because I wouldn't have to run it just to play it in a window.\n\nAlso, just incase you made it this far on my little rant, I never really leave a review unless it KILLS me to see a game fall into the trash bin, and yes my laptop is REALLY good and close to the "Up-to-date" quota to play a game like this.\n\nMy main specs:\n\nIntel i7 core processer\nNvidia 850 GTX\n16 RAM\n\nAnd honestly, that's practically all I would need to run this game.

It's now just shooter for nostalgic people, but I think it's not worth enough to anyone who haven't played Doom 3 back at the release year.\n\nThe first part of the game, most memorable for me, felt more like a survival horror than a brutal action since player had limited ammo and a flashlight that couldn't be toggled - if you wanted light, you just had to hold flashlight instead of weapon. That boosted the effect of many jumpscares or secret minirooms where enemies are hidden. But now you just turn on the light and shoot everything without any stress - the enemies have terrible AI anyway, so expect getting into problems only when you get overwhelmed by amount of stupid enemies (in the late game).\n\nSadly, I feel the graphics aged worse than in the original Doom 1 and 2 - if you are going to play the game, don't expect anything pretty or interesting. It's an ugly mars base with aliens. Oh, that even sums the whole story theme the game is about (think of the story like it'd be a porn script, it has similar depth).\n\nI hoped I would enjoy the game in the same way like I did years ago but I can't. There are many better mindless shooters currently, so I'd rather recommend you to check Serious Sam (HD) or Painkiller series. I believe this was only fast reedition to get more money for upcoming sequel, so I'm looking forward to play the new DOOM!\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 1","false","1.3"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","4"

Think back to the years of the early '90s (there were other ones in the '70s that were First-person and sort of involved shooting things but thse were arcade-only and didn't really revolve around the First-Person view) people were just checking out this kickass game called Wolfenstein 3D, a game largely credited as the Grandfather to all FPS video games. Wolfenstein 3D was focused mainly on the shooting of nazis (nobody would hate on that) and had revolutionary 3D graphics, kickass themes, etc. After the huge success, id Software created another FPS a year or two after Wolfenstein 3D. That game was DOOM, the FPS, where you are a nameless space marine on Mars battling demons from hell, as well as possessed corpses/marines, and cyborg-demons. It featured a radical soundtrack, impressive graphics (which still hold out to this day) and tight gameplay and action. It was non-stop, balls-to-the-walls action that made the players feel like a badass. After that, id software released DOOM II which still featured the main mechanics that made the original a success. It featured an improved visual, new items and weapons, and a larger soundtrack, yet was not as outstanding or culturally effective as it's predecessor. Then after many years, on August of 2004, DOOM 3 came out. It was more focused on horror and careful strategies then the run-and-gun idea of it's predecessors. It was praised for it's tension-rising atmosphere and horror, yet got negativity and criticism for it's lacking of the run-and-gun mechanic (which many loved about in DOOM 1 & 2). The entire trilogy is well-loved and enjoyed constantly. Hell, people would play this all the time AT WORK. This is the collection of not only DOOM 3 (a remastered version with some things being improved or taken out and improved graphics), and the collection also features the first and second DOOM games! If you want sci-fi horror with action sequences and gun-usage, go to DOOM 3. If you want to run-and-gun and venture through the bowels of hell and return with your life and soul intact while being titled as "the dude that killed all the ♥♥♥♥ing demons on mars and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of some huge demons with cybernetic attachments", then go to DOOM I or DOOM II for that matter. This collection improved on what we loved about the franchise, and allows us to re-immerse ourselves into it all over again.","August 15, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I would almost agree on "Who does not know Doom is not a true PC-Gamer.". Doom 3 is a very old game taking place on Mars planet in a scientific research facility led by the UAC, which is sort-of sci-fi. Doom 3 is one of the best examples pointing at horror-involving, unexpected creepy events and dark areas.\n\nPro's\n+ Graphics are pretty good for it's time of release (not steam release) and yet they are still pretty good.\n+ Long gameplay (/w RoE)\n+ Creepy, scary, dark, horror, madness, living nightmare, hell on -earth- mars...\n+ Sadistic and creepy and scary surprises\n+ Demonic foes. And the Cherubs I like to kill.\n+ Flashlight is mounted on the armor of the protagonist BUT it's lifetime is very very short! It recharges rapidly at least.\n+ Dr. Betrüger (and his laugh)!\n+ I like the idea, that most weapons have an ammo monitor and a warning sound of running low. I also like the Plasma Gun the most and it's sound design aswell.\n+ Runs good even on stone-aged low-end PC's!\n+ Adrenaline! The protagonist is... "having mad headaches"?\n+ Damage bodies and corpses and they will gib out and disappear in a skelletal shape. That's a show!\n+ Suitable for children ;) - No that was a joke! But I had my great time in my childhood with Doom 3!\n+ Okay I got to say this: I love the interactive touchscreens you will encounter in Doom 3 & in Quake 4!\n\nCon's\n- Since it's a very long game it is basically FPS only making it possibly boring on some points.\n\nGood ol' masterpiece of FPS.","May 26, 2014","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I figured from the start that, due to my laptop's history of not running very detailed games well, Doom 3 probably wasn't going to work. I was right. It loads up, but it makes my computer run really hard, which would eventually make it overheat and shut down. Also, it's so choppy that I couldn't really move. But I can't blame the game for that because I'm very certain it's just my own computer. Even still, just getting to play Doom and Doom II with a controller was well worth the 20 bucks I payed to get this collection. I can imagine that, if you have a machine that CAN run Doom 3, you'll probably enjoy it as another nice little bonus, or the other way around for the first two. I had a blast and don't regret this purchase. Maybe someday I'll have a more powerful computer to play Doom 3 on, but even for now, Doom and Doom II are more than enough, especially since THOSE are what I was interested in in the first place. So there you go. Even if you don't really want Doom 3 or can't run it, but still want to play the first two with a controller, this collection will still work for you and is well worth the price tag.

The core problem here is the level design; the levels are cramped and bland, the solutions to several mandatory puzzles are painfully obtuse, and overall simply figuring which way is "out" is an exercise in both tedium and frustration.\n\nHeck, even the actual gameflow that made the first two Doom games the timeless classics that they are is completely butchered. Your nameless marine stumbles around at a pace that makes a Call of Duty protagonist look like Usain Bolt, most enemies take way longer to kill than they reasonably should, and any sense of weapon balance is thrown right out the window. And for what, exactly? Dark rooms (countered by a flashlight that runs on a rapidly recharging battery) and jump scares. Yes, you'll often be ambushed by enemies who literally spawn in right behind you, leading to an ungodly amount of insanely dull firefights.\n\nIt's particularly jarring since the BFG Edition comes packaged with the first two Doom games, which play entirely differently, and are, for that matter, infinitely better in almost every respect. Heck, they're both so darn good that I would recommend buying BFG for them alone-- except that they're on sale on Steam in other capacities, and much cheaper to boot.\n\nHow the mighty have fallen.","November 29, 2014","false","14.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Now any DooM fan would ask, "Why the hell do I need this when I already have every game in my possession?" Well BFG Edition boasts achievements, a checkpoint system, and gasp(!) better rendered lighting! Also a shoulder mounted flashlight... a mod that has been out for the original DooM 3 since the game came out in 2004. Look at the date on this: http://doom3.filefront.com/file/The_Pistol_Flashlight_Mod;29008 Well for some reason my old man decided to throw down some money for the BFG Edition when it first came out and... it didn't work on 2 different computers. It gave him nothing when he tried to boot it up, and it gave me the iD Tech blue screen of death. It had nothing to do with OpenGL mind you. So when we finally got this piece of ♥♥♥♥ working on a third computer, the only thing that was immediately noticeable was the fact that it was completely ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable due to the absolute ♥♥♥♥ FOV. After destroying my eyes I find that the "upgraded textures" was a complete lie. I have a feeling that the checkpoint system was made to make the game 'scarier', but that's thrown out the window with the ducktape flashlight. So the Lost Mission, was that any good? Heh... yeah, if you consider copy/pasting from the base game good. The original DooM games were... well Doom.... but they were censored! I understand the one about the red cross being replaced by a pill, the American Red Cross politely asked to remove the logo from the medpacks and iD did so. What baffles me however is the fact that the Wolfenstein levels were changed to remove anything Nazi related for the German release of the game, as per standard for the country. The changes however were kept for the International and US releases of the game... what? Did Bethesda, one of the richest videogame companies right now, think it would be too costly to release different versions of the game for different countries? What money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! Final word: Don't buy this. Seriously, just buy all the original games here off Steam, or track down physical copies that probably sell for cheaper.","November 25, 2013","false","41.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"I can hold a flashlight, aaaand shoot!" said Doomguy.\n"I dont care!" Said I, before loading up Doom 2.\n\nDoom 3 has had barely any face lift, so sometimes slightly draggy on higher settings, blame that on the unoptemised engine at the time. Doom 1 and 2 run smooth as butter. "Relive the fun!,(Doom 1) The excitement!, (Doom 2) The blood chilling jumpscares! (Not really scary, just Doom 3 trying to fit in, instead of stand out.)"\n\nIf you love the originals, then go for it. It includes all the expansions to all Doom games so far. I say "so far" because we all know Doom (We all know its Doom 4, Bethesda, don't be afraid of numbers.) is going to be toxicly laced with DLC and Pre-order culture.

Perfect time to stay indoors and play a horror game.\n\nI'll admit this is only mildly spicy as far as true horror gaming goes. Demons jump out and startle you but you can't really be *scared* when you play as Doomguy. He's a walking, non-talking, demon-mashing machine. And when you get the double-barrel/super shotgun? Forget it. They shoulda never given you this boomstick. And the BFG 9000? Oh my...\n\nI want to make special note of the lighting and shadowing. Very, very well done. I don't know enough about graphics rendering and CGI to speak in technical terms about it but I really like the way the developers handled the darkness in this game. In Dead Island I upped the Gamma settings so I could see a little easier in really dark locations but that doesn't work in Doom 3. When something is in the shadow it is totally black until you shine the flashlight on it. This really got me one time when I tried to be slick at the beginning. I was practically chest-to-chest with an Imp standing in a dark corner and I didn't know it was there until I turned on the light. (Apparently it was really dedicated to making me jump because he didn't agro at all until he was sure I'd seen him.)\n\nDoom 3 is an excellent reboot of the Doom franchise. I don't fault the developers for drastically changing the tone from shoot-em-up to survival horror. Doom 1 and 2 are solid classics, but I don't think the power-ups and colored key/door gameplay would have transitioned well to the modern era.","October 2, 2015","true","99.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

This version (BFG Edition) has terrible vertical sync issues and lower resolution textures than the original. They've also censored the Red Cross symbols and removed any Nazi references from the Doom II Nazi bonus levels. The biggest divergence from the original though, is allowing you to use a flashlight at the same time as your main weapon. Granted this was a frustration in the original edition, but it did make the game a lot creepier.\n\nIt's saving point is if you want to play the retro games Doom I & II on Windows 8. The regular Steam versions of these games won't run (DOSbox crashes) in Win 8. You can always just download ZDoom however if you own the original game files so this isn't much of a pro feature. Get this if you like Steam acheivements and don't mind that it's an inferior edition to the original.\n\nNote: they reduced the textures and adjusted much of the lighting to make the game playable on the PS3 and xBox 360. If this version did not have tearing (vertical sync) issues, then it might be a viable alternative for older PC hardware but it's a mess.","August 11, 2014","false","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It has a faster, more efficient engine and comes with Doom 3 expansions Resurrection of Evil and the Lost Mission, and the first two games in the series. Lost Mission certainly does recycle art from the main campaign, but it's reasonable because the mission takes place in the same locations, concurrently to main campaign. However, all is not acceptable for this BFG edition. For example, mods for the original version of the game are unfortunately incompatible. The developer has released the tools to develop mods for this version, but as of this time, there is no easy way to upgrade the shocking textures of the vanilla game.\n\nAs for the older games, there have been slight edits to remove Red Cross trademarked material, but other than that, there are no obvious improvements. In the end, the controversy around this game is a shame, because this is a solid and enjoyable experience that is superior to the original release in many ways. Unfortunately, the game is buggy, such as when it thinks the console has been used when it hasn't; this deactivates achievements and wastes your time. It seems that the best Bethesda can offer is 'reinstall the game', and it's up to us to 'deal' with it.

But do I recommend it to others? The game comes with DOOM and DOOM II, two of my favorite games of all time. I would HIGHLY recommend you purchase both of those titles, even if you decide not to buy DOOM 3: BFG Edition. The DOOM 3 part of DOOM 3: BFG Editon is DOOM 3, but with minor gameplay and graphical updates implemented. It additionally includes the two expansion packs for DOOM 3, Resurection of Evil (RoE) and The Lost Levels, and the expansion pack for DOOM II, No Rest For the Living. To allow the game to sell in Germany, the Wolfenstien 3D levels in DOOM II were additionally censored to remove the Nazi enemies and pictures of Hitler and Swastikas.\n\nDOOM 3 is a very fun game in my opinion. The games difficulty ramps up at a bit of a slow pace, but the game picks up near the end. It took me around 30 hours to complete the entire game of DOOM 3 (Not including any of the expansions or DOOM and DOOM II). The game offers a ton of enemies and weapons, and many people will try to compare it to the original DOOMs, saying that it is "bad in comparison". DOOM 3 is very similar to DOOM and DOOM II, but has a large change in pacing. Enemies are stronger and come in smaller quantities, you run and walk slower, with a stamina meter implimented to prevent you from always running, and enemies attacks are slower to compensate. Areas are smaller in size, with less dodging room, and the game encourages exploration at a slower pace to spot details in the environement. Whether or not this change was good or bad is up to you, but I feel it didn't kill the experience.\n\nAt several points in the game I got lost (the game has no map system) or stuck doing a time-wasting "mini-game" (such as using a crane to remove toxic barrels), which dissapointed me somewhat. Additonally, the final boss fight was way too easy, and some of the enemies had bad visual changes, such as the Cacodemon, or were weakened, such as the Arch-Ville, who no longer charges up a fire attack when you are near him and summons new monster rather than reviving dead ones. If I was able to change DOOM 3, I would in a lot of ways, but the experience to me was still enjoyable.\n\nI would recommend this game to someone who likes first person shooters, games that encourage exploration, scary games, and both casual and hardcore gamers.\n","July 16, 2014","true","38.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is just an amazing experience!\n\nDoom 3 is the masterpiece of survival horror adventure and technological masterpiece of ex generation (ps3,xbox360). You can see how many titles out there (Half Life 2, Resident evil 4, dead space) r in fact influnced by the horror design featured within doom 3.\n\nThis remaster version enhanced the experience which I could not possibly before. It runs so smooth like no other fps out there on low spec modern machines.\n\nIn my memory, I could not have the right hardware to run the game at medium setting back to 2004. The mainstream monitor scale was 4:3. I bought the world first 16:9 widescreen laptop Sony Vaio in 2004. After several years release of doom 3 , I read everywhere people r buying new hardware to build a high end pc to run doom3 in ultra.It is nearly 10 years after the epic release. Now I am able to run it on a laptop with 650m 1gb vram at 1440p max at 60fps.\n\nOne thing worth to mention is that I did NOT play doom 3 much deeper than 30minutes progress in 2004. I was scared by the ultra realistic creepy monsters.\n\nIn 2014, it is still scary as hell but due to better maturity mind now I can play the game without hiding underseat. Another factor could be my soul has already survived through other horror games these years (eg.resident evil 4, dead space 3).\n\nAs an epic masterpiece,  Doom 3 is still providing an authentic scary experience and fresh if you did not play it (much) before like me previously.","July 19, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Originally did not like this game, but grew to love it due to the environments. I think I like BFG Edition even more. I've read all the complaints. Some of them are valid (or were valid before fixes were implemented) but a lot of them weren't... such as brightness levels (looks better now), ammo count (it's true that the whole PDA thing is optional now most of the time because you're never short on ammo, but it means the game is more action-packed and faster-paced), reworked menus (they look and control better now, in my opinion -- also like the new Doom 3 logo much better). Etc..\n\nIt also controls better. Seems much more responsive and faster due to the increased framerate and probably other improvements they made. Motion blurring is a nice addition, too.\n\nClassic Dooms are ported well and appear high resolution (can see sprites clearly at a distance). Also controls well with everything set up for modern WASD controls. The "No Rest for the Living" episode by Nerve is quite good (already available on Xbox 360). Overall this port is a lot better than some of the detractors said it was. Even the music in Doom Classic seems pretty good-- I notice it has Gravis sound files in the Steam folders.","December 20, 2013","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Well worth the purchase.  I am very surprised by how enjoyable this game is.\n\nAt first I thought this game would be the same old shooter with jump scares and hidden hallways, and I was right....\nHowever, the way they carried the sub-par story through the game is spectacular, and makes all the difference.  Everything has its place, and the video logs and emails through your PAL bring a fantastic level of emersion.  I like how the game is able to poke fun at itself, at science, and even at something unexpected like work politics or D&D.  The levels are fun; fighting the creatures is fun; the game is fun.\nWhat I enjoyed most is despite how far the game has come since Doom II, the game kept much of the spirit of its predecessors throughout.  It actually reminded me of playing a Doom II level.  I love the unique ways they make the monsters blind side you, and just when I thought I got the “jump scares” figured out, Doom 3 in classic fashion surprises you.  The game literally had me checking every corner of every room before I progressed for tucked away hidden monster waiting to ambush.  The darkness, although a bit much, was still extremely appropriate and well done.  I’m so glad they made the flashlight something you wear, rather than an item to switch in and out with like they had on the previous Doom 3 (TERRIBLE IDEA GUYS!!).  The use of light and space was masterful and suspenseful.\n\nWhat I don’t like about Doom 3 is there are only a select few collection of monsters to encounter.  Once you’ve figured out how to deal with them, the only challenge left is managing an entire room’s worth of them.  I would love to have seen twice as many different types of monsters as was shown (especially since this is a reboot).  I also didn’t like the ending.  It didn’t feel “epic” enough.  It was very easy.  There weren’t too many side characters to interact with, nor were there very many puzzles.  Remembering a scrap paper’s-worth of Storage Container access codes does NOT make it a puzzle. :/  Finally, while the animation of the monsters was beautiful, the animation of the npc’s and yourself was abysmal.  Some of the worst dubbing I’ve seen with newer-generation graphics.  The character designs of npc’s were boring, re-used for multiple different characters, and distracting.  With the reboot they really should have upgraded the animation quality, if nothing else the speech animation.\n\nRegardless of the above, I overall really enjoyed the experience Doom 3 has to offer.  I am happy with my purchase and my game.  I’d give it a 7.2/10.\n","May 11, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I didn't see the comments regarding issues on AMD systems, but I've played for a couple of hours now and I haven't run into a single glitch, bug or crash. Not even a stutter in framerate. This is on a 100% AMD build (FX-8350 and Radeon 7950). I'll update my review at a later date once I've done a full playthrough of this version, but so far no problems.\n\nSo it runs fine, how does it look? Well, Doom 3 holds up pretty nicely, actually. I don't mind playing classics with dated graphics (I play through the original Doom games once a year) but this still looks nice even today. I think it's down to the hard shadows and the moody lighting. They've tweaked things in this BFG Edition, making things less dark, but it isn't bright, it's just... well, less dark! It's still dark as hell though, so don't think for a moment that they've ruined it by turning all the lights on, they haven't, it's still Doom3 and you'll still use your flashlight a lot.\n\nGameplay wise it's solid. If you like old school shooter action you'll probably love Doom 3 BFG. It's cramped and dark and things jump out at you regularly. At first it's simply a case of turn and shoot, but things soon amp up and you'll quickly find yourself ducking and weaving around fireballs, crouching behind cover and running around pillars to get that all important point-blank shotgun kill. In many ways it's just like the original Doom, only now you can't strafe from a safe distance, it's all up-close and personal - the hellspawn are rarely more than 10ft away from you in this game and your reaction times will be tested more than they ever were in the original.\n\nDownsides? There have been couple of times where I found myself wishing I had a melee button to knock enemies back, but I know that would change the gameplay siginficantly. Not having a melee means even slow, lumbering, unarmed zombies can do damage if you let them get up close, and if you don't keep your wits about you, that can happen easily. You need to check every corner, keep your flashlight juiced up, keep your ears open. It's what makes Doom 3 Doom 3.\n\nDo I recommend Doom 3 BFG Edition? Yes. The core gameplay is solid and the game still has the ability to put the ♥♥♥♥♥ up you. Don't expect a sweeping, epic storyline. Don't expect to see huge awe-inspiring vistas that stretch for miles - this is Doom 3 and everything is within spitting distance (not what you'd want when the minions of hell are after your blood).\n\n4/5","June 21, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I didn't see the comments regarding issues on AMD systems, but I've played for a couple of hours now and I haven't run into a single glitch, bug or crash. Not even a stutter in framerate. This is on a 100% AMD build (FX-8350 and Radeon 7950). I'll update my review at a later date once I've done a full playthrough of this version, but so far no problems.\n\nSo it runs fine, how does it look? Well, Doom 3 holds up pretty nicely, actually. I don't mind playing classics with dated graphics (I play through the original Doom games once a year) but this still looks nice even today. I think it's down to the hard shadows and the moody lighting. They've tweaked things in this BFG Edition, making things less dark, but it isn't bright, it's just... well, less dark! It's still dark as hell though, so don't think for a moment that they've ruined it by turning all the lights on, they haven't, it's still Doom3 and you'll still use your flashlight a lot.\n\nGameplay wise it's solid. If you like old school shooter action you'll probably love Doom 3 BFG. It's cramped and dark and things jump out at you regularly. At first it's simply a case of turn and shoot, but things soon amp up and you'll quickly find yourself ducking and weaving around fireballs, crouching behind cover and running around pillars to get that all important point-blank shotgun kill. In many ways it's just like the original Doom, only now you can't strafe from a safe distance, it's all up-close and personal - the hellspawn are rarely more than 10ft away from you in this game and your reaction times will be tested more than they ever were in the original.\n\nDownsides? There have been couple of times where I found myself wishing I had a melee button to knock enemies back, but I know that would change the gameplay siginficantly. Not having a melee means even slow, lumbering, unarmed zombies can do damage if you let them get up close, and if you don't keep your wits about you, that can happen easily. You need to check every corner, keep your flashlight juiced up, keep your ears open. It's what makes Doom 3 Doom 3.\n\nDo I recommend Doom 3 BFG Edition? Yes. The core gameplay is solid and the game still has the ability to put the ♥♥♥♥♥ up you. Don't expect a sweeping, epic storyline. Don't expect to see huge awe-inspiring vistas that stretch for miles - this is Doom 3 and everything is within spitting distance (not what you'd want when the minions of hell are after your blood).\n\n4/5","June 21, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's Doom 3, the expansion pack Resurrection of Evil, some previously-unreleased levels called The Lost Mission, and the XBLA ports of Doom and Doom 2, complete with a new Doom 2 episode, No Rest for the Living. All of this, with all of the achievements from the Xbox 360 games. If you're into Doom, this is a great package. Doom 3 isn't the looker that it was on release, but the gameplay is still fun. Despite the monster closets, which are rampant through the main Doom 3 campaign, the action feels great. The original release of Doom 3 required you to choose between holding a weapon and holding a flashlight, which was sometimes inconvenient as there were a lot of dark areas in Doom 3 that were full of monsters. For some people, it was annoying enough to stop playing. BFG edition lets you use the flashlight at any time. Also, No Rest for the Living is a fantastic addition to Doom 2.\n\nOverall, it's a great package for anyone who likes Doom. I'd also recommend it to anyone who likes classic action games.","March 8, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Maybe the graphics are not that bad, but it is as though you are just running around the same place over and over. A.I. is horrible and even though some parts of the game are kind of scary, you can tell the game was kind of cheaply made. The gameplay is just tedious and I miss the long ranged shotgun from the original Doom 1 and 2, that was just so overpowered and yet, so satisfying to kill enemies with. The shotgun is almost useless unless you are close to the enemy, and the story...is almost non-existent. It is just one of those mindless shooting games, but really, even though Doom 1 and 2 belong to that category, they still are far superior to this. I'm glad BFG Edition at least includes both 1 and 2. For Doom 1 and 2, I give 9/10. For 3, 5/10.","June 4, 2013","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I would almost agree on "Who does not know Doom is not a true PC-Gamer.". Doom 3 is a very old game taking place on Mars planet in a scientific research facility led by the UAC, which is sort-of sci-fi. Doom 3 is one of the best examples pointing at horror-involving, unexpected creepy events and dark areas.\n\nPro's\n+ Graphics are pretty good for it's time of release (not steam release) and yet they are still pretty good.\n+ Long gameplay (/w RoE)\n+ Creepy, scary, dark, horror, madness, living nightmare, hell on -earth- mars...\n+ Sadistic and creepy and scary surprises\n+ Demonic foes. And the Cherubs I like to kill.\n+ Flashlight is mounted on the armor of the protagonist BUT it's lifetime is very very short! It recharges rapidly at least.\n+ Dr. Betrüger (and his laugh)!\n+ I like the idea, that most weapons have an ammo monitor and a warning sound of running low. I also like the Plasma Gun the most and it's sound design aswell.\n+ Runs good even on stone-aged low-end PC's!\n+ Adrenaline! The protagonist is... "having mad headaches"?\n+ Damage bodies and corpses and they will gib out and disappear in a skelletal shape. That's a show!\n+ Suitable for children ;) - No that was a joke! But I had my great time in my childhood with Doom 3!\n+ Okay I got to say this: I love the interactive touchscreens you will encounter in Doom 3 & in Quake 4!\n\nCon's\n- Since it's a very long game it is basically FPS only making it possibly boring on some points.\n\nGood ol' masterpiece of FPS.","May 26, 2014","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With a focus now on horror as well as gunplay the game widens its scope to many fans disappointment. However the graphical quantum leap from the original 1-2 lends its self to the horror atmosphere quite well. The scares may be few (if there at all) but the atmosphere is immesrive and the gunplay is fun (when dealing with the non human enemies anyway).\n\nThe game invokes total recall flashbacks from mars and even gives a nod to blade runners 2019 blaster. Keeping features from the original, doom marine still hauls a small armies worth of weapons including a chain, plasma gun and even the beloved chainsaw.\n\nUnnecessary cutscenes occasionally pop up and temporarily break all immersion as if halflife never happened as far as the devs are concerned. Doom marine also appears to own gordons short battery flashlight which becomes crucial in darker parts of the levels... only gordon was never exposed to as much dark, thankfully it's quick to recharage and not much of an issue. Another trivial but noteworthy complaint is how quickly bodies disappear almost immediately after they hit the ground. as if the germs on the floor were more deadly than your bullets.\n\nDoom 3 is fun just don't expect the same speed or intention of the originals. If you're a doom vet and long to zip around the halls like the glory days, this game's not for you (there's even a sprint bar now). As it stands alone though doom 3 is worth playing.","August 20, 2015","true","32.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

After almost 18 hours playing through Doom 1, 2, and 3, this is my final verdict following all three games.\n\nDoom (the original game)\n- Doom was a great classic, I recommend it to any traditional PC gamer looking for some old school entertainment.\n\nDoom 2\n- The second game in the Doom series has a lot of similarities with the original Doom installment. Only I found the game much harder than the original. Even on a normal difficulty enemies are much more difficult to take down and heath is much harder to find.\n\nDoom 3\n- Dooms third installment was something else compared to the other two games. Id software did a good job of innovating while staying true to the original Doom feeling. Id managed to step out and innovate their game by changing the traditional level design to a more realistic take on the Mars research base. Though the level design not only made me feel more immersed in the game, it also had a couple of down sides. When given an objective the player would need to move through a series of rooms until he / she reached that objective. But doing so would get repetitive as the level design follows the same four steps : enter room -> enemies spawn -> player kills enemies -> player enters next room. Along side this most of the enemies become very simple to kill as two shots from a shotgun will likely take most enemies out. I'm happy to see that a classic game company like Id software had the nutz to change up their game from a run and gun, to more of a moderate paced shooter, with some creepy horror aspects mixed in. Oh and this game had a bad ♥♥♥ ending if anyone was already wondering.\n\n[Final verdict]\n\nAfter many late summer nights and alot of game saves i'm happy to say that Doom 3 BFG edition wasn't half bad. Doom 3 has had a graphical overhaul since the release of BFG edtion and a small number of  in game tweaks, such as the ablity to use a flash light with your gun, and a couple of enemy model changes. I cant say Doom 3 was close to as good as some games ive played, but I think along with the graphics upgrade and Doom 1, and 2 being included, I think BFG edition is well worth the money paid.\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading folks\n- Mojo","June 28, 2015","true","18.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is no longer the game that Half Life 2 made look like a gaming relic upon its release.\nDoom 3 BFG edition takes the original game and makes subtle tweaks to it.  Each of these tweaks combine to make the core game a whole different experience for the player.\nThe original game was a slow, methodical  shooter.   It was more of a first-person survival horror game than an action shooter. The game gave you just enough ammo to survive if you checked every nook and cranny and opened every locked cabinet.    Miss too many shots, and you had to rely on your fists.   You never felt safe.  You never felt in control of the situation.   It was a great game, but it never felt like "Doom".\nDoom 3 BFG edition addresses this in various ways.\nFirst, the game is brighter.   The original games' shadows were the centerpiece to its graphics engine.   It was like nothing you ever saw before.   Today, it's run of the mill stuff.   BFG edition reduces the shadows.   This changes the feel of the game immensely.\nSecond, they added ammo.   Playing through Doom 3 BFG edition, I don't believe I ever had a situation where I felt like I had to conserve ammo.   The ability to feel free to blow the crap out of enemies made Doom 3 BFG an absolute blast.\n\nSo, should you buy this game?\nIf you have never played Doom 3, I would suggest you play it first.\nIt's an game that every gamer should experience.   It's a masterwork of atmosphere.  The ammo deficit is also masterfully done.   It rewards firing accuracy and slow movement.    It's survival horror at its best.\n\nBut...after you have played the original doom, go back and play the BFG edition.   It will make you appreciate just how well Doom 3 did what it was designed to do, and how amazing the game was/is.\nBut, coincidentally, while playing the BFG edition, you may have a whole lot more fun being a demon killing machine instead of a hunted target.","April 30","true","50.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

The graphics are nice, as well as the majority of the sound design. The double barreled shotgun leaves a lot to be desired though, as well as the Grabber in the expansion campaigns.\n\nThe classic games are still fun, but the labyrinth-like levels might frustrate people who are used to the linear design style used today. It seems as if they gradually become more annoying the farther you get though.\n\nIf you want more bang for your buck, you might want to pick up the standalone games when they're on sale - so you can look into modding 'em. If that's not your thing, I'd still recommend this.\n","May 7","true","21.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Personally, I like DOOM 2 better. Not sure why, but I do. But that isn't what this review is about DOOM 3. But I'll quickly go over DOOM 1 and 2. Both games are pretty similar. If you like one you'll like the other. They run very well, and have great replay value.\n\nDOOM 3, though.\nIn terms of gameplay, I think that DOOM 3 is pretty fun. Very challenging, but not bad. The story is the same as DOOM 1's. I haven't played DOOM 3 before BFG Edition, so the only difference I know of is the flashlight being attached to weapons. I personally don't mind that. DOOM 3 has 2 problems that really makes me want to not recommend BFG Edition. The performance. First off, I can run this game. Maybe all of this is because I'm running it on a Windows 10 laptop. I'm not sure. But the game will run smoothly for a few minutes at a time, then the framerate will drop and the resolution will, too. So in other words, it gets blurry and lags. It normally happens briefly, but at the worst times, like when a big enemy appears or a door opens and a demon is standing there. This gets on my nerves a lot. Also, DOOM 3's weapons feel a little weak sometimes. Not the chaingun, or the plasman rifle, but mainly the pistol and shotgun. The pistol does absolutely nothing, unlike in DOOM 1 and 2. The shotgun feels underpowered against some enemies, which gets annoying.\n\nI normally don't end my reviews with number scores, but I feel like that's the best way to do the verdict for this one. DOOM 3 BFG Edtion gets a 7.5 from me. DOOM 1 and 2 are worth your time, but you can get those for a lower price on Steam by themselves. DOOM 3 has some issues that I wish could be fixed. If you're hyped for DOOM 4, and want to play all of the DOOM games before that one, just buy BFG edition for XBOX 360 or PS3 if you really want the entire franchise in one bundle.","April 13","true","6.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Otherwise don't bother.\n\n90s level and story design without 90s bodycount + it's a dull darkness simulator with cheap and cheesy "scares" and "surprising" enemy spawn right behind your back. Another popular thing is an imp right behind a door waiting to leap at you when you open it so you can't possibly evade him, a real treat on high difficulties when you're currently on low health. This actually leads to another thing about this game. You could get rid of the leaping imp with one shotgun shot but unfortunately this game gives you the most useless shotgun in the history of videogame firearms. However, if you really want to play through this, the Resurrection of evil expansion gives you a doublebarrel which deals actual shotgun damage unlike the whatevergun you get in the original doom 3 campaign.\nIt only gets worse when the game tries to get "clever" and introduces some weird "puzzles" that usually involve operating some buttons and the only thing it does is slowing the gameplay down. Fortunately it doesn't happen that often.\nAnyway the game was a lazy 90s shooter and a pitch black darkness engine demo back then and it still is now. As for the oldschool dooms that come with the package, there's nothing to say since like everyone in the world have played them at some point or another.\n\nTLDR: I'm not saying it's the worst game ever but it really is worth only for doom fans as you get all dooms in one package.","November 23, 2014","false","12.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

All I did was change my FOV, and this is what happens?\nIf you don't care about achievements, that's all fine and good, but that is part of the reason I wanted this game and being told off for changing FOV is not appreciated.\nStrike 1.\n\nCan you believe it? They removed the ZOOM function for everything. You can NO LONGER ZOOM in a first person shooter. You could zoom in doom 3 and pretty much every other FPS, but here? NO!? WHAT?\nStrike 2.\n\nSo, the flashlight is now built into my gun, I no longer have to change to a flashlight to use one, I can simply turn it on all the time. Well, Doom 3 just lost it's atmosphere which is one of the best parts of the game.\nUsing a gun in the darkness while zombies come at you, while being blasted by fireballs  tossing imps is stressful, especially in the dark. Flashing lights, and blinking computers illuminate the battle, and you swap to your flashlight to get a quick glance as you run away and reload your gun. But now, I can have a constant flashlight on all the time as I easily see everything and fire away fearlessly. This is a hit and miss, but for me, it's a MISS.\nStrike 3.\n\nI wonder if the addition of Bethesda to this game somehow ruined it? I'm going to go with yes.\n\nAvoid this game! If you are going to play Doom 3, PLEASE, get the original instead. It's cheaper and it's MUCH better.\n\nAs a dedicated fan of Doom 3, please, take my advice and save your money.","June 3","false","1.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_dee_el/recommended/208200/","the_dee_el","dL!!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_dee_el/","253 products in account","The multiplayer in the original Doom 3 is a lot of fun and has a high skill ceiling. The multiplayer in D3BFG is almost the same thing, but worse. In Doom 3 BFG Edition, you can't call votes, so to change maps in a private match, you have to leave the match and start a new one, but if you're doing public games, then you're usually locked into the same map for several matches in a row; you can leave a public match all you want, but clicking quick match to try and get a different map will likely just put you back into the match you just left. The way public matches work is terrible, you click quick match or find match and if no one is playing, you become the host and are put into an empty lobby. The game then randomly cycles through maps and then when someone joins it locks into the map and then you wait a long thirty seconds before you can start playing. That's right, if you're starting a public match, you can't choose the map. As far as I know, starting a private match will keep that match open only to those who are invited, so starting private matches result in truly private matches, so that's not even a workaround.\n\nThe game is a laggy mess. It has no dedicated server support, instead it has a system where one guy gets to be host and has 0 ping and then most of everyone else has some ridiculously bad ping like 350. If you're lucky you'll get 150 ping, which is still awful. If you're not hosting, you probably have a terrible ping, and because of that terrible ping, rockets and plasma become useless weapons and you pretty much have to rely on hitscan weapons like shotgun, chaingun, and machine gun. Speaking of machine gun, everyone spawns with the machine gun (MG) in this game. Some servers in the original Doom 3 spawn you with the MG, and it's not a problem in the original Doom 3 because that game isn't laggy, and actually has servers. However, spawning with MG in Doom 3 BFG Edition brings on truly frustrating gameplay where everyone spams MG off of spawn AND ACTUALLY SUCCEEDS IN GETTING KILLS WITH EASE. I'll explain.\n\nIf you're shot in the back with MG, you're probably going to die no matter what you do. The terrible netcode just does whatever the heck and then you're blasted with MG damage all of the sudden. The amount of screen shaking you get when you take MG damage is very high, and your movement can actually be hampered. I'm convinced that the ridiculous knockback and the excessive jolting of your view were not intended to be so awful; being dealt all of that stuff at a strangely rapid rate has to be a result of bad netcode and lag. It's very disorienting. Ducking behind a corner or trying to retaliate usually won't help, you'll just die. The original Doom 3 has some screen shaking when you're hit by MG, but the BFG Edition is just way worse. Another bad thing about the BFG Edition is that up to eight players can play at once in a match no matter what map is being played; the MG spam reaches truly obnoxious levels when you've got eight people running around a small map, like Delta Labs.\n\nThe chaingun was nerfed. They decreased the firing rate and didn't even lower the spread, so good luck hitting anyone that isn't running in a straight line. The double barreled shotgun is utterly useless when you're playing in a match that you're not hosting; you fire the gun, the pellets fly out half a second later, and then usually the gun doesn't even autoreload like it would if you were hosting. Obviously these issues with the double barreled shotgun are caused by the poor connection that you'll get when you're not hosting.\n\nThere are leaderboards. Each multiplayer map has their own set of leaderboards; every mode that can be played on a particular map has it's own leaderboard. For example: the map Delta Labs has four different leaderboards associated with it; there are four modes that can be played on that map. But the CTF maps were designed for CTF play only, so the CTF maps only have leaderboards that cover the CTF mode. To move up the leaderboards you have to meet some bizarre criteria. From what I've heard you have to win several matches in a row, and the more matches you win in a row, the more points you get, and the more points you have, the higher up the leaderboard you are. You don't get to see how many points you're accumulating while you're in a match, by the way; that stuff is tracked internally, it's a total mystery to you when you're actually playing. You have to check the leaderboards afterwards to see how many points you have. That's annoying.\n\nTo my knowledge, this criteria isn't confirmed, but I was told that this is what the leaderboards track, and it seems to be true, from my experience. Why do the leaderboards track that? Who cares about winning several matches in a row? High rankings on the leaderboards are a testament to your skill and experience in some way, but couldn't they have made leaderboards that track some other sort of thing? Also, it seems that the only way to get your results submitted to the leaderboard is to host the match, and then keep playing until everyone else leaves. Once everyone else leaves, then you can leave and your results will be submitted to the leaderboard. I'm pretty sure that if you do it any other way (for example, playing in a match that you're not hosting) your match results won't be submitted. Horrible.\n\nI can think of multiple things they could've done with the multiplayer: dedicated servers, ranked modes, ranked matchmaking, statistics tracking, and leaderboards that actually matter. Instead they put ZERO effort into the multiplayer component and in the process actually made it WORSE than the multiplayer in the original Doom 3. I can't believe they charged $40 for this at one point.","December 16, 2015","false","337.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

I breezed through it on Veteran difficulty. If you've never played it before I'd recommend the original instead. If you have played the original, well, it's still Doom 3-- lengthy campaign, fun combat, runs like a dream on modern systems and the new achievements make it worth another go-around.\n\nAlso included is the first expansion pack, Resurrection of Evil: a quality add-on, but also simplified in depressing ways. Certain areas have been removed for whatever reason, and you no longer need oxygen to traverse the toxic sections, completely removing the suspense. There's the Lost Missions, a brand new expansion exclusive to the BFG edition, which is essentially the "Blue Shift" of the two in which you play a surviving Alpha Squad marine attempting to shut down the portal. Highly recommended if you can't get enough Doom 3.\n\nThen there's Doom 1 and 2. These are both legendary shooters that have been modified to run on modern computers without the need for source-ports like Zdoom or Boom. Unfortunately, that means they also lack a quicksave function, crosshairs, or the ability to jump. The aiming system is also a little off. I did appreciate the new variety of monster dialogue, a healthy combination of remixed growls and grunts. Doom is far from perfect-- sometimes it takes one shotgun blast to kill an Imp, but other times it takes two. The second two episodes feel thrown together and pale in comparison to Knee Deep in the Dead and the more recent Thy Flesh Consumed . Lastly, the invisio-sphere is still the most useless powerup in the history of FPS. It causes enemies to miss-- sometimes. If you like to strafe left and right like an OLDSCHOOL FPS PLAYER this means that nine times out of ten you will sidestep DIRECTLY INTO ENEMY FIRE.\n\nDoom 2 is a tedious bore and I could never understand the appeal of it. The maps are giant mazes that lack any sort of context. I only ever used it to mod levels with the new enemies and Super Shotgun. This version, however, contains another brand-new episode, "No Rest For The Living," that is stellar and worth the full price alone.","August 6, 2015","true","45.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_dee_el/recommended/208200/","the_dee_el","dL!!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_dee_el/","253 products in account","The multiplayer in the original Doom 3 is a lot of fun and has a high skill ceiling. The multiplayer in D3BFG is almost the same thing, but worse. In Doom 3 BFG Edition, you can't call votes, so to change maps in a private match, you have to leave the match and start a new one, but if you're doing public games, then you're usually locked into the same map for several matches in a row; you can leave a public match all you want, but clicking quick match to try and get a different map will likely just put you back into the match you just left. The way public matches work is terrible, you click quick match or find match and if no one is playing, you become the host and are put into an empty lobby. The game then randomly cycles through maps and then when someone joins it locks into the map and then you wait a long thirty seconds before you can start playing. That's right, if you're starting a public match, you can't choose the map. As far as I know, starting a private match will keep that match open only to those who are invited, so starting private matches result in truly private matches, so that's not even a workaround.\n\nThe game is a laggy mess. It has no dedicated server support, instead it has a system where one guy gets to be host and has 0 ping and then most of everyone else has some ridiculously bad ping like 350. If you're lucky you'll get 150 ping, which is still awful. If you're not hosting, you probably have a terrible ping, and because of that terrible ping, rockets and plasma become useless weapons and you pretty much have to rely on hitscan weapons like shotgun, chaingun, and machine gun. Speaking of machine gun, everyone spawns with the machine gun (MG) in this game. Some servers in the original Doom 3 spawn you with the MG, and it's not a problem in the original Doom 3 because that game isn't laggy, and actually has servers. However, spawning with MG in Doom 3 BFG Edition brings on truly frustrating gameplay where everyone spams MG off of spawn AND ACTUALLY SUCCEEDS IN GETTING KILLS WITH EASE. I'll explain.\n\nIf you're shot in the back with MG, you're probably going to die no matter what you do. The terrible netcode just does whatever the heck and then you're blasted with MG damage all of the sudden. The amount of screen shaking you get when you take MG damage is very high, and your movement can actually be hampered. I'm convinced that the ridiculous knockback and the excessive jolting of your view were not intended to be so awful; being dealt all of that stuff at a strangely rapid rate has to be a result of bad netcode and lag. It's very disorienting. Ducking behind a corner or trying to retaliate usually won't help, you'll just die. The original Doom 3 has some screen shaking when you're hit by MG, but the BFG Edition is just way worse. Another bad thing about the BFG Edition is that up to eight players can play at once in a match no matter what map is being played; the MG spam reaches truly obnoxious levels when you've got eight people running around a small map, like Delta Labs.\n\nThe chaingun was nerfed. They decreased the firing rate and didn't even lower the spread, so good luck hitting anyone that isn't running in a straight line. The double barreled shotgun is utterly useless when you're playing in a match that you're not hosting; you fire the gun, the pellets fly out half a second later, and then usually the gun doesn't even autoreload like it would if you were hosting. Obviously these issues with the double barreled shotgun are caused by the poor connection that you'll get when you're not hosting.\n\nThere are leaderboards. Each multiplayer map has their own set of leaderboards; every mode that can be played on a particular map has it's own leaderboard. For example: the map Delta Labs has four different leaderboards associated with it; there are four modes that can be played on that map. But the CTF maps were designed for CTF play only, so the CTF maps only have leaderboards that cover the CTF mode. To move up the leaderboards you have to meet some bizarre criteria. From what I've heard you have to win several matches in a row, and the more matches you win in a row, the more points you get, and the more points you have, the higher up the leaderboard you are. You don't get to see how many points you're accumulating while you're in a match, by the way; that stuff is tracked internally, it's a total mystery to you when you're actually playing. You have to check the leaderboards afterwards to see how many points you have. That's annoying.\n\nTo my knowledge, this criteria isn't confirmed, but I was told that this is what the leaderboards track, and it seems to be true, from my experience. Why do the leaderboards track that? Who cares about winning several matches in a row? High rankings on the leaderboards are a testament to your skill and experience in some way, but couldn't they have made leaderboards that track some other sort of thing? Also, it seems that the only way to get your results submitted to the leaderboard is to host the match, and then keep playing until everyone else leaves. Once everyone else leaves, then you can leave and your results will be submitted to the leaderboard. I'm pretty sure that if you do it any other way (for example, playing in a match that you're not hosting) your match results won't be submitted. Horrible.\n\nI can think of multiple things they could've done with the multiplayer: dedicated servers, ranked modes, ranked matchmaking, statistics tracking, and leaderboards that actually matter. Instead they put ZERO effort into the multiplayer component and in the process actually made it WORSE than the multiplayer in the original Doom 3. I can't believe they charged $40 for this at one point.","December 16, 2015","false","337.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Pre-ordering it back in 2004 and being so excited to load it up the day it released.\n\nI love the change in style. The slower pace, the horror themed to the hell invasion. Doom 3 always will be one of my favorite games.\n\nBut, the BFG Edition... how does it stand?\nWell, in contains not only Doom 3, but it's official expansion Resurrection of Evil, and the new add-on the Lost Mission. And it also contains the Ultimate Doom and Doom II: Hell on Earth. That alone makes it a great package.\n\nDoom 3 and RoE are just as great as they were before. But, small changes stand out that make this release not as great as the original.\nFor both D3 and RoE they've adjusted the lighting, making the games brighter. Which, while addressing some complaints, actually takes away from the game's original atmosphere.\nAlso, they've increased the amount of ammo present in the game world. The original releases already featured way too much ammo. You can have almost 200 shotgun shells by the end of the second level in Doom 3.\n\nThat combined with the fact that they've actually reduced the number of enemies in certain encounters, and made a few of the boss fights easier... what was already a pretty easy game has been turned into a cakewalk.\n\nAnd, the Lost Mission... is awful. A cobbled together campaign made up of bits and pieces of levels from Doom 3 and RoE. It lacks the originality of the original releases, and the feel of polish and fun. A nice addition, but, ultimately... a wasted effort.\n\nThe BFG Edition is worth the price to have the entire Doom series in one title, but, if you already own the original releases... you've already got the better versions.","August 2, 2015","true","28.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Graphically it was and is still stunning.  I'm now playing it again, it has a great atmosphere to the game, and actually whilst different styles to the game the Dead Space series I think owes a lot to Doom 3.\n\nDoom 3 is pretty linear in it's game play, the maps lead you through it, you don't have to search endlessly for clues or keycards (which actually I like, as it keeps the action going)...\n\nAfter a while you do get used to Monster popping up behind you and you quickly learn to be cautious.\n\nGraphically it still looks great despite it being 10 years old and Gameplay wise it keeps you hooked as you roam the corridors wondering where the next Monster will come from.\n\nAs for the updates to this edition, there is some negativity about the auto save feature taking you out of the action and to be honest it only really saves at moments where there isn't any action so its not an issue really.

This edition contains Doom 3, the expansion pack Resurrection of Evil, a new expansion called The Lost Mission, Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, and the Doom 2 expansion No Rest For the Living. All of these games have full Steam integration which includes achievements, leaderboards, and multiplayer support (which is dead by now because Doom 3 multiplayer always sucked ♥♥♥♥).\n\nDoom 3 and its expansions are remastered in new HD graphics (I personally don’t see much of a difference).  In fact I’ve noticed that the environments are a lot brighter in Doom 3 which really kills the atmosphere that originally made the game so scary. The textures are noticeably enhanced, but not enough to really warrant paying the retail price.\n\nThe Lost Mission is short and uneventful. Essentially just a few more recycled corridors from Doom 3 with nothing new or special. I was expecting a significant expansion like Resurrection of Evil, but it was far from it. I’m happy to be playing the original Doom games though. They run perfect on Windows 7 with great controls and even have achievements. For the first time ever, I’m actually going to finish Doom 1 and 2. It’s fun to play games that defined a genre and the Doom 3 BFG Edition allows just that.\n\nOn the whole, it’s a nice edition, but the drawbacks from Doom 3 and the disappointing Lost Mission expansion really let me down. Although they aren’t terrible, they’re still enough to put off fans of the series.\n","June 15, 2013","true","19.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I remember everyone including myself hating that it was a separate item.  Such a stupid way to force environmental tension that ultimately wears off after a few scripted encounters.  Pure frustration.  So, I'm glad they scrapped it.  Other than that, it still holds up well as a school shooting training simulator.

So I'll summarize what I felt about all 3 of them.\n\nDoom 1: One of the first shooters ever made. It's actually a lot of fun. The first thing I noticed is that you can't jump or aim vertically. You basically strafe and shoot at enemies and use the shotgun as much as possible. You get a minigun, a rocket launcher, a plasma gun, and of course, the BFG to kill progressively more difficult swarms of enemies. There's not much of a story and the levels are very arcade like in structure. The music fits the era it was made: 8-bit rock music.\n\nDoom 2: Nearly identical to the first Doom but with what seems like more difficult levels. There is a new shotgun which has a higher spread and damage which is great for taking out lots of guys fast, but reloads slower. There are a lot of new enemies that are much harder. You'll face some of the bosses from the first game in almost every level. Doom 2 is like the challenge mode of Doom 1.  There's also more of that 8-bit rock music in every level.\n\nDoom 3: It's making me crazy dizzy. I just set the FPS lower because the 120fps made me so sick. The gameplay is pretty narrow compared to the last two. You're stuck in very narrow corridors similar to Dead Space. I've noticed some similar enemies from the original two games, just now they've been given a more modern look with better graphics and physics. Unfortunetly, even this game is starting to show its age. The textures are basically absent from this game. There's also a more obvious atempt at having a story to this game. I haven't finished the game so I can't say whether or not the story is any good, but it's more interesting now than it was in the past two games. The 8-bit rock music is finally gone. Almost seems like a shame as now the game feels like a typical horror game. It feels like Doom had a baby with James Camerons "Alien."","January 2, 2013","true","26.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But Doom 3 itself is a letdown. It has realtime shadows, which are awesome. As a result, the entire game is too dark. Like, dark enough that you can't even see the monsters you're supposed to be shooting at. I realize D3 is a bit of a survival horror game, but literally not being able to see the monsters attacking you is a problem. Lighting aside, there aren't enough monsters. Have fun killing the same imp over and over again every time you round a corner. This game goes for "scares" by spawning enemies behind you, shaking your view, and hiding things in shadows. It also has lots of gross ambient sound effects and visuals, which are more unsettling than scary.
