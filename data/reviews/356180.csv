I think, for the lack of content, its quite expensive on its actual state and seeing how slow progress, it seems that this game wont ever be anything great.\n\nOf those two hours of gameplay we must take into account that its really a lot less. The game itself contains only two very small levels which you cant even explore freely because you get magically teleported back. Those two hours of gameplay its only due the slow pace at which the game tells you what to do on every step. There is nothing chagenging at all, no way to do something wrong. You just simply obey and push the button that you are told.\n\nThe game gest boring easily when you notice that no matter which tool you will use to "get" data, it still the same on every case and all of them just make you go near the dinosaur and click a button. Its also pretty sad that lacks any kind of exploration. All you do is move in a little "pool" with only two species of dinosaurs which arent even interesting to start. Their behavior is also pretty bad done. They often go inside rocks or even out of water. It doesnt matter how agressive they are, they will hardly eat you due their limited IA that makes them swim in circles around you before even being able to reach you with their mouth. Which isnt even a problem as you never die, just get teleported few meters back.\n\nTo be a game where you mostly watch like if it were a documentary, the lack of content as well as the environment makes you dont want to play for long. There is absolutely nothing to explore, it lacks something impressive to watch. I wish it had some cool under the sea structures like caves, coral rifts, dark deep areas, etc.. but no. Something pretty annoying is the blue effect. Im not sure why everything inside water is blue, water isnt blue after all. It should be pretty dark on the deepest areas.\n\nAlso, take into account, that half of the game duration is based on the first level which is the free demo that you can download anytime. I recommend you to download that and play, you wont get "more" from playing the actual game anyway. I have spent more time and felt more realistic just playing the demo Neptune Flux which gives you a way more inmersion than this "3D museum simulator".\n\nDespite of being an early access game, if we take into account its price, we are just looking to a very poor game. I got very impressed by the demo because it looked like a nice start for a cool game. Then you realize that all the game have to offer is just that simply start.","February 6","false","2.1"," 61 of 76 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","61","76","3","2"

I know I would. Ok I know VR visuals look more like an N64 than we would want but come on and suspend your disbelief and have some fun. I jumped at the chance at trying this interactive learning experience. Instead After a few hours exploring Im dissapointed at how terriblely badly the scanning system, which is the core "game play" mechanic in Time Machine VR has been implimented. Points deducted for a very hit and miss programming which ends up turning an experience that should be magical into a frustrating one.\n\nAfter the 10th time trying to capture the feeding behaviour of a massive beast that I was clearly seeing but for some (unexplained) reason Time Machine VR was telling me I wasnt capturing had me exiting in frustration. Couple this with every gamers dread, the unskippable exposition scene! and I was wondering if A, had these guys played a game before never mind developing one and B why these eye rollingly rudimentary problems are following us into the brave new world of VR and stinking it up like 200 tons for rotting dino-fish.\n\nNot polished enough to recommend but nice models and animations are worth seeing, just not at this price so just try the demo instead.\n\n*Update* Now tested on Vive and has horrible graphical latency, conclusion: AVOID","May 9","false","2.2"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","44","54","0","1"

After 20 mins of playing and thoroughly enjoying the game the motion sickness started.

Time Machine VR is pretty much everything I want from a VR experience being both educational and thrilling (seriously the Pilosaurus scares the crap outta me). The headtracking is very smooth and I haven't experienced any nausea. As it's early access there are a few bugs here and there but doesn't detract from the experience, also runs great on my modest GTX680. Overall it's been one of my favourite experiences so far on the DK2 and well worth the asking price.

The VR graphics are amazing, a real sense of actually being there with all the vulnerability that would accompany that.\nIt can also be a great tool for people who suffer from a fear of heights and want a program that de sensitises them.I have discovered that the Time Machine VR game is great for getting the old acrophobia going. When you are at the base station which is sometime in the future there is a building made from steel girders etc with towers supporting satelite dishes. Land the pod at the front or back of the building then get out of the pod by simply standing up ( for this game you are seated) then take a step forward. From then on it feels like you are standing outside. Then using the controls on the X Box controller move straight up slowly to the roof of the building, it feels like you are on an elevator platform and totally exposed. If you have a fear of heights i guarantee this will get your palms sweating. When you are on the roof do a simulated walk around the perimeter of the building and if you dare have a look down. I could hardly do it to start with and the feeling i get is exactly the same as if i was really on top of a building. Iv just tried it today and i am just starting to get used to the feeling. I am going to do this for around one hour per day then when i can eventually do it without fear i will put the de sensitisation theory to the test by walking around somewher high in the real world.\nI would imagine that this part of the game was not intended for what i am using it for but it certainly generates the same fear as i get in the real world. Imagine what the develoers could could put together if they intended it to be a therapeutic tool, maybe a one for the futer eh?","April 20","true","17.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","4"

I would recommend it though.\n\nPro: Pretty good looking game, although no AA.  I understand they are worried about frame level droppage.\nRe-allignment is easy since its not a room scale game\n\nCons:\nI don't like that when you load it drops back to the HTC Vive main room.  You should keep the user in the game\nat all times even when loading.  Just show a picture of one of the creatures or something.\n\nThe controls for the HTC (touchpad right side mainly) are not accurate enough.  You should give the user an option to calibrate.  Driving the pod takes some getting use to.  I want to move my hands to far in each direction\n\nYou don't let the user explore, or if I'm lost trying to find the pad you say "Out of area" and throw us back at the start.  We are capable of going out far and we are sure capable of back tracking :) don't take the freedom away from the user.\n\nIts still fun to explore and I'm sure any dino loving kid will just have a blast!\n","May 21","true","2.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

Plus once you go through all of the portals, the story is "technically" done, and then in order to reach 100%, it becomes a grind where you literally have to scan everything to get there... It's cool to begin with, but the "10 hours" of gameplay will literally be "two hours of interesting content" then probably "8 hours of grind" at least that's what it appears to look like... If that is also the case, the price is rather high.\n\nPlus, don't expect to see any land creatures.

The headtracking, amazingly smooth, graphics look beautiful in the rift. Its noticable this is in early access, I really hope the story arc gets more and more added, more levels, creatures, mechanics. Even at its current state I would recomend this game to anyone with an oculus rift as it is an absolutely fantastic experience that everyone should be able to play at somepoint! The only complaint I have about this is the fact that creatures can swim through rocks as if they werent there most of the time, so that makes scanning them rather tricky sometimes as if you have to scan one particular creature and its out of the map in some rocks... its a tad annoying but you get to see the amazing scenery so its all good~ I dont think its planned but the ability to see some land creatures would be nice but aquatic creatures is absolutely amazing anyway. You get an amazing sense of scale when playing this, like in the first part you have to swim into this massive creatures mouth. I felt like a tiny fish compared to it. An amazing experience, well worth the money as well. I know there is some complaints with keyboard and mouse support, personally I think a controller is the way forwards for vr games anyway so I have always used the controller. Nice to see though that the developers are adding things like keyboard support though which they may have already added when I type this tbh xD. But this game, 10/10 best oculus rift experience I have ever had.","November 24, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

I love the feeling of truly being submerged underwater. The graphics are beautiful, and I can't wait to see what it looks like and how it feels on the commercial release of the Oculus hardware.\n\nI do have several criticisms however, especially as it pertains to the game moving forward. While there is a good amount of content in Early Access so far, I can see this getting very montonous if the entire game is underwater, or even if the character is always limited to his pod. I understand that this is part of the game, but it will get annoying quick, trust me. Also, for the above-water parts, I truly believe the character should be walking/running as opposed to hovering in his time caspule. It may serve better to confine those parts to within one building. There isn't really a need to fly over the entire landscape here. Perhaps once as part of a visual effect, but not as a long-term game feature. The pod moves far too slowly. I can see the speed of the pod being doubled, especially since you can always slow down time to catch up with the creatures you're going to be scanning.\n\nAlso, I hope we visit new environments! Not just time periods with dinosaurs, but perhaps with prehistoric mammals, and even important human events throughout history. Perhaps there are other researchers looking to utilize this technology? Political and social scientists? Anthropologists?\n\nI wish you all the best. Good luck!","December 14, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It is mission based with an original plot that justifies your presence in the game - you are not merely an observer.\n\nAlthough it is "early access" they have developed a good backstory and some interesting gameplay mechanics. The visuals are quite well done and I felt more presence than in most of the demos I have tried for the Oculus DK2. Scooting around in the little probe and seeing the surface of the water high above and the sea bed below and around you is very immersive - everything feels really big. I felt quite vulnerable when the larger dinosaurs got close! The game looks very promissing so far and runs very smoothly on a 780Ti, but there is still plenty to improve on.\n\nMy main beef is with the lack of colliders in the sea bed. The dinosaurs often swim straight through solid rock, even dissapearing completely and this looks really bad. I hope the developers concentrate on fixing that before adding any more content.\nSecondly is the probe/submarine movement. While this is not unrealistic for an underwater vehicle, the top speed and especially the turning speed are too slow for the required gameplay. I found myself spending a lot of time turning in circles trying to chase a target and it eventually made me a little nauseous.\nThere are other smaller gameplay issues that will be easily ironed out, like sometimes it isn't clear which scan method you are supposed to use, but nothing really gamebreaking.\n\ntldr:\nImmersive early access game that looks good and runs judderfree (on a 780Ti). Needs to improve animations  before adding more content to make a full game.\n\n\n\n","December 23, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The movement in game is gentle enough to provide a comfortable experience for most people, and the game's premise of underwater exploration is perfectly suited to the sense of wonder that a good VR experience can generate.\n\nOn my Win 10 setup with DK2 on an nVidia 780TI the game rarely drops below the ultra-smooth 75 FPS so judder is rare - although most common in the mission hub environment, so don't be put off by the hub experience, the rest is great.\n\nA good use of a control scheme (X-Box One Controller is perfect) and VR headset to provide an imersive interactive experience inspiring a sense of wonder.

A few suggestions though; the Vive controls for strafing and turning should be swapped, the left trigger should move the pod (including strafing) and the left touchpad should rotate the pod. In addition to being more intuitive this would add the possibility to rotate vertically (maybe an option for advanced players).\n\nSecondly, when loading new areas the player is often briefly sent back to Steam's VR lobby. If possible try keep the player inside the pulsating pod while loading. Lastly, I realise that VR is very resource intensive but adding more graphical effects like particles, god rays and more flora would be great for those who can run it.\n\nOtherwise, the pod concept with it's subtle hexagonal grid is a very immersive experience. I hope to see more games from this developer in future.","May 25","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
