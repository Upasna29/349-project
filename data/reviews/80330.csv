Even after playing it 3 times in a row (gameplay, classic commentary, then both commentary for final achievement) I'm still fascinated by this game.\nBlackwell Legacy is the first game of the Blackwell series, first game (for a long time, if I remember well from the commentary) of  Dave Gilbert. It's a supernatural mystery-detective story  (Ghosts!) and gameplay-wise it's a mix of visual novel (Quite a lot of talking, big amounts of info, cutscenes) and point-and-click adventure games. These genres mix really well the solid story - there is always something to pay attention for, or something to do.\n\nThis will be a little  unconventionally long part of a review compared to my other review - I want to "meet you" the developer, because I feel the game's most admirable part is the devoted work and attention to small details from Dave.\nMaybe as you noticed that on Steam quite a few reviews mention that Legacy is a little weaker compared to other games of the series - it's the first one.\nThe greatest thing could happen to this game is Dave's commentary. While it could seem like he made mistakes in development, but "it's understandable, people tend to miss up things at first try, he'll do better for the next time".\nBut there are the commentaries.\nSeriously, listen to both commentaries, but only AFTER playing the game. This guy gives incredible amounts of info, background stories about characters, voice actors, artists, dog leashes ( ;) ) and things like that. Dave knew that some parts of the game aren't perfect, he knew the problematic spots, and was worrying about making certain decisions. If you listen to the commentaries you'll know that he planned the concept, the voices, the pictures really throughfully, did his best to program certain parts (Leash), be accurate with locations (Washington Sq. Garden) and at the same time, he told us why Nishanti doesn't have an accent, why the lights were flickering at the hospital only at certain times, and so on, and so on.  Not to mention the reflection in the 5-year-anniversary commentary, in which he proves he learned a lot from his past mistakes and from user backfeed.\nAbout the game: Gorgeous pixelgraphics, if you love the style, you need this game. I'm not sure if I've seen a world as detailed and well-executed (in terms of graphics) amongst other pixelgraphic games.\nThe voice-acting and music is perfect. Great voice-actors make the deep and well-written characters come alive and help Rose's and Joey's inspection, and besides some ... problematic (?) points of the story the game is pretty straightforward, you can't really get lost for like, forever :)\n\nAs a conclusion: The game's base price is 5$/€. That's absolutely correct price for it, on sales the game is a must-have if you've been eyeing it. I would say the gameplay is 2-5 hours (Sorry, I'm bad at guesses) if you look at everything and listen to every conversation. Replay value consits of one extra gameplay with commentaries active - can be about 2 hours with tons of intresting info about the game. I enjoyed the commentary more than in other games the new game+ option :)\nI most definitely recommend this game - it's a gorgeous-looking, well executed - thought little short - adventure game with deep story that paves the way for the following chapters of the Blackwell-saga.","February 21, 2015","true","22.4"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","1"

It's short, full of long info dumps and has frustrating puzzles. To top it off it sometimes fails to give the player any sort of direction or goal, leading to the "try everything" method of gameplay progression so common in old adventure games. Ahh, the nostalgia.\n\nInfuriating progression aside, the story is solid and entertaining. Nothing groundbreaking, but it does a good job of introducing characters and plot threads that get expanded upon over the next four games. There's a healthy amount of snark too, which helps balance out the otherwise grim nature of the story.\n\nIf you can forgive a lot for the sake of a good story, then Legacy is for you. If you can't, then you might want to consider picking this one up when it's on sale or in a bundle. Alternatively, you can try watching a playthrough and skipping to Convergence, which is where the series really picks up.\n\n(Also worth noting are the two commentary tracks that come with the game; the original track from 2006, and one from five years later after the release of Convergence. Both are interesting to listen to if you're interested in game design... or if you really just ♥♥♥♥ing hate dog leashes.)","October 8, 2014","true","7.0"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","27","27","2","3"

As a genuine lover of adventure games, I've always been curious and expectant. This old school, Sierra style adventure game promised to give me a good time and snatch a spot in my list of memorables, I could tell even with one look. Now that I found some spare time to explore the world of Rosangela Blackwell, I am not disappointed.\n\nAs you may have guessed so far, Rosangela Blackwell is our heroine. She is a shy, misanthropic yet smart young woman who lives in New York City, all by her lonesome. She writes book reviews for a local newspaper and tries her best to avoid any social contact. She is a silent one, who prefers a quiet and uneventful life, in her quiet and uneventful apartment. Passing of her aunt - and her only living relative that she knew of - marks the beginning of a drastic change in her 'not so silent anymore' little world. Following strange headaches and flickering lights, Joey Mallone makes an appearance and pulls a "Ghost Whisperer" on Rosa. Yes, Joey is a ghost - or rather a ghost guardian, self-titled as "The Blackwell Legacy" - who's been appearing to Blackwell women for generations now and drives them to help lost souls find peace. So, Rosa's actual story begins.\n\nThis first game in the series serves as an introduction rather than a full throttle game. We learn about Rosa, Joey, get clues about their backstory and solve a simple, exemplary case real quick. It's more like Ghost Whispering 101. It's a cute game, with some deadpan humor and interesting story waiting to be built more elaborately in the future. Puzzles are ordinary, and with some attention to detail nothing would excuse you on being stuck. You collect clues, combine them and make appropriate suggestions to appropriate characters to progress.\n\nThe game also contains a commentary option that appealed to my taste, in sense of presenting behind the curtain information about the development process, straight from the mouth of the horse, namely Dave Gilbert. I found his statements, apologies on recognized mistakes in either the development or story purposes, personally given thanks to visual and recording artists particularly charming. Any error or annoyance that I may point out, is already recognized and explained by Dave Gilbert himself, so... nothing for me to be distasted about anyhow.\n\nI'll be looking forward to the next game in the series, Blackwell Unbound to discover more about both Joey and Rosa. If you are into adventure games also, I recommend for you to give some attention to The Blackwell Legacy whence you wonder what to play next time. It invoked pleasant memories of classic Sierra adventures like Space Quest or Police Quest, and rewarded me with further expectation.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 16, 2015","true","6.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/recommended/80330/","jedo","Black Mage Jedo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/","3564 products in account","The Blackwell Legacy is a short and sweet point-and-click adventure game wherein you help wandering spirits pass on to the afterlife by helping them realise their current situation. It features puzzles that require decent comprehension, a good amount of research, and involvement with all participating characters. After playing it for 2 hours, here's what I think..\n\nPros:\n\n- sensible achievement design (There's an achievement for not talking to your Spirit Guide while in the presence of others. This makes complete sense since the main character has insecurities about being viewed as insane.)\n- the game makes good use of notes; they really look for the ability to put two and two together\n- short and sweet (Only one case is covered but it is quote memorable due to the nature of all the different characters the developer managed to fit in.)\n\nCon:\n\n- quite a few parts of the game did not require much (if any) object interaction\n\n___________\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is looking to start playing point-and-click adventure games. It's a great starting point. It's well-made and short (not tedious) so it will ease you into the genre.

The series pretty much plays like 5 chapters of a single game, so this review is the same for each.)\n\nYou play Rosa Blackwell, who much to her annoyance has inherited the family spirit guide- Joey Mallone, a 1930's gangster type who absolutely insists she spends her evenings resolving supernatural oddities by calming the ghosts causing them and helping them move on to the next world. Of course, only Rosa can see and talk to these ghosts, so traipsing around New York apparently talking to herself is the order of the day.\n\nRight off the bat, Blackwell is sure to evoke nostalgia in those of us who played adventure games back in the day. Remove the voice acting and you could convince me these were hidden Amiga gems that were recently unearthed. The pixel art changes in style between each game but is always crisp, clear, and remarkably detailed- some animations are a little choppy but that's kinda nostalgic too.\n\nThe games are easily comparable to the Phoenix Wright titles, and I'd say anyone who enjoyed those will have a good time here. The focus is much more on the story than the puzzles, which usually involve gathering information from the right places and using it to help the ghosts realise their time in the mortal world is over. It rarely falls into the adventure game traps of obtuse puzzles that make no real sense, and the times it does are almost entirely in the first game- in-game commentary from the developer notes that he's well aware of these early stumbles and actively avoided them later.\n\nProbably the point that will discourage those who watched the trailer is the voice acting, which early on is admittedly amateur and clearly done on home hardware rather than in a studio. Please, PLEASE do not let that turn you off the series. If it's a dealbreaker you can turn voice acting off completely in each game, and after the first two games it gets markedly better. I was unsure on Abe Goldfarb's performance as Joey to begin with, but by the end of the series I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Just.... Just weather the storm and it'll pay off later, trust me.\n\nAll told you're looking at 15-20 hours for the five games (though that depends a lot on how good you are with solving the mysteries) and achievement hunters will play through each one twice, though the second time through is a lot quicker. I became very attached to Rosa and Joey in my time with them and I'll miss them now their adventure is over.\n","August 23, 2014","true","7.2"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

While the story and the characters (and when I say characters I mean the protaganists) are well developed and some of the puzzles are well thought out, there's a lot of backtracking and a few puzzles that just don't work and the game refuses to help assist you, with no hints or advice.\n\nThe story involes Rosa a young girl in New York whose only relative, her Aunt, recently passed away having spent most of Rosa's life in a mental ward. Whilst investigating a local suicide for a newspaper article Rosa encounters the ghost of Joey Mallone who explains that like her Aunt she is a medium and must help lost sprirts move on.\n\nThere's more to the story in the game, and it also develops further over the sequals, so to say anymore would be spoling it. The game is fully voice acted and Rosa and Joey's actors put in excelent performances, though the rest of the characters vary from poor to good. The graphics are relaible, with charcter models and backdrops looking a lot like older P&C adventures, but still seeming fairly modern.\n\nI got stuck once or twice at some of the previously mentioned poor puzzles (THE F&%*ING DOG LEAD) but there are plenty of guides online to help you out. The game is quite short and will proably take aywhere between 2-4 hours to complete first time round, however there are 8 achivements to earn, only 3 of which you get for just playing the game to completeion as standard, and a commentary mode by the creator (wherein he talks about the creation of the game the difficulties and what he learnt from it) which adds extra playtime.\n\nQuick Sumarry:\n+ Intresting Story and Charcters\n+ Some clever puzzles\n+ Good voice acting for the main protagainsts\n+ Great music and decent graphics\n- Some really frustrating puzzles\n- Too much bactracking\n- Alot is just set up for the sequals.\n\nScore 7/10","November 26, 2013","true","10.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

The Blackwell series definitely has a special place in my heart. TBL tells the story of Rosangela Blackwell, who "inherits" Joey, a spirit stuck with the Blackwell family, and they both go about solving mysteries and investigating cases related to ghosts who have problems moving on to the afterlife. While it's probably the least interesting game in the series, it's really fun and brings you back to old-school adventure games, while still bringing fresh elements to the table. If you're into classic point-and-click games, you most definitely have to try it! I had played it a few years ago and it was still fun to replay it now.\n\nPros:\nDespite having ghosts and all, characters are very realistic, well-developed, deep, interesting, funny, and loveable\nThe story is interesting and solving the mysteries is really fun\nMost puzzles are kept to a sober level of difficulty, but there's no handholding, either\nThe dialogues and the voice acting are really outstanding, I can't stress it enough\nHas a very interesting mechanic in which you combine clues instead of items to solve puzzles, and that works really well with the investigation theme\nBeautiful retro graphics\nBGM is also very, very nice\nCons:\nMy main complaint is about the audio. Sometimes, the music is too loud and you can't hear the characters' voices really well. These, in turn, are set to different volumes, and the quality of the recording is not always good. The end result is weird sometimes.\nThe low resolution annoys me a bit (you can set it to 1280x960, though, but that option is hard to find)\nTBL has some small flaws expected from unexperienced devs, but I didn't even notice most of them until the dev brought them up in commentary mode.\nBought on: PC and Android Bundle 11 by Humble Bundle for an average of US$ 0.55 (roughly R$ 1,46). It's also totally worth its full price, which isn't high at all!","December 30, 2014","true","5.9"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

To put it succinctly, I was not disappointed. This game is proof the point-and-click adventure genre is in the midst of a resurgance and not relying on the old stalwarts to do so.\n\nYou're thrown into things fairly rapidly in The Blackwell Legacy, but not so much that it feels too rushed. As Rosangela Blackwell, a down on her luck journalist scraping by in New York City, you're suddenly greeted by the spectre of Joey, a ghostly fellow who seems a few decades out of place. As the game progresses, you learn why Joey's decided to hang out with you, that you might be connected to him somehow, and what you and Joey are meant to do in the world. As it stands, New York City has a lot more going on behind the scenes than anyone expected.\n\nI'm keeping things especially vague due to potential spoilers, but the story in The Blackwell Legacy is very solid. A tightly knit tale that lays out a spread of characters bound to return in future Blackwell titles, Legacy still manages to stand well on its own, proving more than just a mere set-up for the series. As for gameplay, it's fairly standard point-and-click fare, with the added twist of an online (in-game) search engine thrown in to both fit the setting and avoid more ridiculous combinations of exploration and item scrounging. It's a bit frustrating that you need to return to Rosa's apartment every time you need to conduct a search, but it's still handy having it available.\n\nOne of the biggest delights (and tips) going into things, at least for me, is how Joey and Rosa both have distinct abilities and uses for the various situations that come up. While you primarily control Rosa this time around, I highly recommend keeping tabs on Joey's wanderings around each scene, as these frequently tip you off as to things you need him to do to progress. That, and sometimes, it's just funny.\n\nThe voice acting is extremely on point, as are the visuals representing those voices and the writing behind them. The Blackwell games changed artistic hands as each follow-up was released, but the core style is always consistent and the entire thing feels like variations on a theme rather than hiring whoever was available.\n\nAbsolutely take The Blackwell Legacy for a spin, and save yourself a few bucks by getting the whole series bundle.\n\n(Note: I'm aware my profile shows no achievements for this game despite having 14 hours on record. I'm not sure if I played it on another platform before it came to Steam, or played it on Steam prior to it getting achievements, or let it run at some point to collect the cards, but I submit this video as proof I have played the game through.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/80330/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","It's a good concept. A loner girl solves ghost mysteries with the help of a smartly dressed family heirloom ghost and then sucks ghosts into an afterlife gateway in her brain. All wrapped up in a tasty point-and-click adventure game package! Hell, put like that, it's a GREAT concept.\n\nI don't know what happened between concept and reality, but it should have looked both ways before crossing the street.\n\nThe Blackwell Legacy manages to spur my advances at every turn. I want to love it for its concept, I want to love it for what it aspires to be. But it's got so many issues it's dealing with, and it knows I don't find it pretty, and it doesn't think anybody could love it, so although it permits me a date, the date ends early with both of us going home alone, crying.\n\nI hope that metaphor made sense to someone, because I'm not proofreading it.\n\nAt the very outset, red flags go up. In the opening cutscene, our heroine offers some clunky dialogue to an urnful of ashes, and we're shortly thereafter given control in front of a dull building with nothing to meaningfully interact with outside of a frustrating 20-something barring us access to our own apartment because he doesn't recognize us. It's a bad note to start on. Already I want to punch something and I've only been playing for two minutes (and as I don't recall this person ever being set on fire, I can safely say that the situation doesn't end satisyingly enough).\n\nSoon after, you encounter another hurdle. Puzzles in The Blackwell Legacy don't work like those of a traditional point-and-click. Which is fine; innovation is commendable! But it doesn't really know what to replace them with. Solving problems usually consists of one of two things: clicking dialogue subjects at people and on each other in order to eek out a tiny bit more plot to go on, or fiddling with the world around you. Here, at the beginning of the game, you do the latter, and it's entirely too unintuitive for being the first puzzle of the game (or any puzzle of the game). And it's here, also, that you discover another major issue: your character kind of sucks.\n\nRosangela, the protagonist, is herself one of the biggest obstacles in the game. I understand the point of watching a character get over their personal problems. But it almost seems like her personal problems are simply an excuse for having Rosangela refuse to do most of the things you want her to. I don't think I've ever had a character in my control say the word "no" so much in a single game, and this one's only two hours long.\n\nIt gets better, but only in some aspects. The mediocre writing lasts the entire game, and the voicework never improves very much. Believe me, I understand that, this being an indie game and all, professional talent was not in the budget. But also believe me that Kelly, a girl you visit in her dorm room before long, is a baffling vocal mystery. I cannot tell whether she is a voice concocted by a severely inexperienced voice actress, or if somebody played themselves and actually sounds this agonizingly stupid in real life.\n\nI hate Kelly's awful voice. Did that come across? I don't want to leave any doubt. Honestly, how do you even close your nasal passage tight enough to make a simple "no" come out as "dohwwh"?\n\nThe ending's alright enough, and Joey's decently voiced for a cast which sounds like it probably consists of volunteers. Now and then I became interested in the story, which, with better presentation, may have hooked me the whole way through. But boy does the pacing need some work. Nothing says enthralling gameplay like a 25-page folder of exposition. And I hinted at it towards the beginning, but the locations in this game are just uninteresting to look at.\n\nI tried to give The Blackwell Legacy the benefit of the doubt so many times through the two hours it took me to finish it. I want to love point-and-click adventure games, and the basic concept here was so promising. But in the end, so much needs to be fixed for this game to be good that it's probably better that they just moved onto other games instead of trying.","November 25, 2013","false","3.0"," 43 of 75 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","43","75","0","5"

Puzzles are sort of "L.A. Noir" in nature. You interview NPCs to acquire information on particular subjects, and the important information you find is jotted down in a notebook. You can then use the idea in your notebook like inventory items during interviews with other NPCs to pry for new information. You can also combine ideas in your notebook if you think there is a connection, which can create new ideas and generate new leads to investigate. There are also inventory type puzzles, but the interview puzzles are the main attraction.\n\nSolution Quality: Very good solutions to puzzles and solutions make perfect sense. (Just make sure you exhaust all dialogues!) I never felt like solutions were illogical or overwrought nonsense. It's safe to say that this game avoids the hugest problem that games in this genre usually have.\n\nStory/Characters: Very good! In fact, this point-and-click emphasizes these aspects the most, so if those are the most important thing to you in a point-and-click, then you don't wanna miss out on the Blackwell games.\n\nDialogue Quality: Very good! Lots of dialogue to explore, and the character dialogue is well-written, believable, and interesting.\n\nLength: Very short! Games in the Blackwell series are more like "episodes". You can take one down in one or two hours if you know your way around a point-and-click.\n\nVERDICT: As far as the point-and-click genre goes, you absolutely don't want to miss these---especially if story and characters are your favorite part.","May 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

She's become an antisocial shut-in, her work as an amateur book reviewer for a local paper is beginning to suffer, and her only relative has just passed away after succumbing to what might possibly be hereditary madness. And as if that wasn't enough, she's begun to see and hear a smart talking ghost who has revealed himself to be something of a family heirloom.\n\nThis is The Blackwell Legacy, the first of five chapters chronicling the events of Rosa and her new life partner, Joey, who have quickly become shackled together and must now make the most of their predicament. Perhaps not an entirely original premise, but that fact seems to be entirely lost on Blackwell, which disregards any accusations of being cliched in order to tell an expertly penned and even more impressively acted narrative that quite frankly transcends the game it's attached to. Characters are written and voiced with a deeply personal feel, easily engrossing you in their lives and making you care about their outcomes despite the game lasting little more than a few hours. The plot is slow to unfold, but as the first game in the Blackwell series it acts almost more like a prologue, spending most of the time introducing you to the characters that you'll be seeing for the next four games, and in that regards is entirely successful.\n\nIt's a tad disappointing then that the actual adventure game elements so often fall into the same issues that have plagued the genre since its inception. Most annoying is how often you are left without any direction or indication of where you are supposed to go, what you need to say, or who you should be interacting with. This left me consistently walking in circles as I tried every option I could, only to realize I'd missed something a ways back that seemed entirely unrelated. It's tedious and confusing, and really got in the way of the best part of Blackwell, which is its story.\n\nEven so, it's worth pushing through the convoluted puzzle logic in order to experience the surprisingly excellent narrative, which not only delivers a highly intriguing story in its own right but sets up so much potential for what is to come of the series. I wasn't sure quite what I was getting into when I decided to checkout The Blackwell Legacy, but am certainly glad I did and am eager to see where it might go next!\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","August 19, 2014","true","3.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

Without that voice acting and writing, this would be a pretty generic homemade game. It's the voice acting that pulls you in. The game lives and dies on its voice acting. Stranger still, the close up portraits presented to give a better look at the pixelated characters move their mouths in a way that doesn't match what they're saying, but it's not jarring like it should be. It doesn't seem to matter. The story is somewhat generic as well, but the writing gives the characters life. It's not about the well-worn story of a spirit medium's awakening and duty, it's the story of Rosangela and the mystery surrounding the Blackwell family for its third generation now. And it works. It all just works. It's a very short game. It would not be unreasonable to play start to finish in one sitting, but that means it doesn't overstay its welcome and the next game in the line will satisfy any need for more.

A bit frustrating to solve the puzzles (even if you have made a correct deduction, you can't do anything with that deduction unless it's been "recorded" in your notebook - this stopped me up a few times in the beginning).  The game really wants you to solve the puzzles in a step -by -step manner, and if you get ahead of it or go out of order, you're forced to retrace your steps simply to get the correct piece of "evidence" in your notebook.  There is really very little free will; your choices are steps that lead you towards an ending, and do not have a bering on the plot other than to speed you along or slow you down.

It definitely relies on having a sequel rather than standing on it's own very well. It hardly feels like little more than a quick prologue to the games that follow it. It's good that the games are being sold in a bundle.\n\nEven with how short it is, I definitely love the characters, story, and the humor. But the puzzles in the first game are so horrendous that I have to give it a thumbs down. I'm just going to list out the three I couldn't have figured out without aimlessly screwing around forever. At least the following game has you use some logic, rather than being a festival of trial and error.\n\nSPOILERS BELOW\n\n1. Talking to your neighbor\nI ask you, how is this so hard? Firstly, it's insane you have to go through this in the first place. Secondly, she's your frigging neighbor. Wave at her, say hi, anything. I know you're not a social butterfly, but it doesn't take much to catch a person's attention if they happen to know your face anyway. Also you are being blocked out of your own home. Either way, the last thing I'd think to do is circle around a lamp post to get her dog's leash caught, just so it would bark at me and catch her attention. Also why does she cut the leash to get her dog loose?\n\n2. Steal the damned notebook\nOk, stealing from the dead, nice. How does 'metal face' over there keep us from taking it when she isn't even looking at us the entire time? Oh, and I can pretend to use her phone so you can talk to Joey? That's a clever and sensible solution, I give props for that. Now why the hell can Joey not think of a way to distract her on his own? I have to tell him to do the one thing that he can physically do, which I can only know about if I exhaust all his dialogue options at the apartment before hand. I guess spending years hanging over a comatose madwoman can turn you into a really forgetful schmuck.\n\n3. Take the dog for a walk\nWhat? Just politely ask to take the dog for a walk. Why does everything involving your neighbor have to be a federal ♥♥♥♥ing issue? So not only do we have to drug her dog to make it have to pee, in order to actually get the drug we have to think to randomly revisit someone after just having spoken to them and exhausted their dialogue options. As far as I know that's the only way to get the pills from them.\n\nEND OF SPOILERS\n\nAll I can say is that The Blackwell Legacy is a very rough start to what seems to be an otherwise good series. Unbound is pretty good and I'm certainly hopeful for the rest of the series as I continue to play through it. I would recommend playing the first as it's necessary to play the beginning of any series you're getting into, but you'll probably want to just look up the answers to some of the more crazy puzzles for this one.","October 15, 2014","false","7.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Also, plain ugly, but one does not play point and clicks for stunning graphics, does he/she?  Well maybe the Daedalic titles, but that’s an entirely different story.\n\n‘Blackwells’ should be approached mainly by those who want to experience a nice story. I’m  aware that these games probably exploit  every single cliché known to detective- ghost fiction and  can be unbearably cheesy at times, still they are presented in an interesting way, the protagonists are likable, and generally they offer more depth than initially meets the eye if you are willing to look around (or listen to the commentary).\n\nAs if to make up for the atrocious graphics, the music is plain gorgeous.  Saxophone, piano and lots of rain in the background – a typical noir mixture and it serves its purpose perfectly.\n\nNot without a reason I initially called these games short and sweet: finishing them took me 2 hours each (and it needs to be mentioned here that I have this nasty habit of leaving games running while I proceed to do something else), which is not particularly impressive. Furthermore, ‘Blackwells’ lack typical point and click puzzles – story is driven mainly by conversations with other characters, doing the detective work, switching between the characters and occasionally using an item or two. This results in games being rather easy to figure out – which can be good or bad depending on one’s standpoint. In my opinion the Blackwell Bundle games are perfect to play to unwind after a hard day’s work (school, saving the universe or whatever … ).\n\nIt can be argued that 4.5 Euros is quite much for 2 hours of gameplay, so it is much better to get these in a Blackwell Bundle than buy them separately. To sum up: In my opinion, these games deserve a strong  7 out of 10 and I should certainly play the remaining installments of the series ( Deception and Epiphany ) in the future.\n\nWersja polska\n\n\nGdybym miał opisać gry wchodzące w skład Blackwell Bundle (czyli pierwsze trzy części serii Blackwell: Legacy, Unbound I Convergence) prawdopodobnie powiedział bym: szybkie i słodkie. I do tego paskudne jak zimowo-jesienna noc z deszczem i śniegiem, ale kto gra w przygodówki dla grafiki? No może poza niektórymi grami ze studia Daedalic, ale to zupełnie inna historia.\n\n‘Blackwelle’ są dla tych którzy potrafią docenić ciekawie opowiedzianą historię. Pomijając oczywiście fakt że seria eksploatuje chyba każdą możliwą kliszę znaną z opowieści detektywistyczno – nadprzyrodzonych i potrafi być nieziemsko tandetna od czasu do czasu. Niemniej większa część przedstawionych historii pozostaje interesująca, bohaterowie zasługują na sympatię , a opowieść oferuje znacznie więcej głębi niż na początku się wydaje jeżeli tylko graczowi zechce się odrobinę poszukać (lub na przykład posłuchać komentarzy twórców).\n\nJakby w zamian za paskudną grafikę, gra oferuję muzykę która jest najzwyczajniej w świecie cudowna.  Pianino, saksofon i deszcz w tle – niby typowy noir a w klimat rozgrywki wpasowuje się idealnie.\n\nNie bez powodu wspomniałem wcześniej że seria ta jest ‘szybka i słodka’. Ukończenie każdej z gier zajęło mi mniej więcej 2 godziny (i trzeba tu wspomnieć że mam zwyczaj czasami zostawiać gry uruchomione kiedy zajmuję się czymś innym). Co więcej, w ‘Blackwellach’ nie ma tradycyjnych puzzli typowych dla point and clicków – historię napędzają przede wszystkim dialogi i łączenie faktów w notatniku bohaterki, czasem trzeba też przełączyć się między postaciami żeby wykonać jakąś czynność czy użyć jakiegoś przedmiotu –  gry prawie przechodzą się same. To nie koniecznie wada, taka konstrukcja i długość  sprawiają że seria jest doskonała na szybką sesję po ciężkim dniu w pracy ( po szkole, ratowaniu wszechświata czy co tam jeszcze …).\n\nOczywiście, 4.5 Euro to całkiem sporo za 2 godziny gry – kupować w paczce i po przecenie. Podsumowując: mocna siódemka – skończę pozostałe gry z serii jak tylko nadarzy się okazja. Wieść niesie że wyglądają o niebo lepiej i są dłuższe.","May 5, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters are well written and voice acted, the story is interesting, and the puzzles are generally pretty intuitive, with few of them possessing that adventure game logic where you're forced to figure out what the designer wants you to do as opposed to what makes sense. The graphics are definitely old school and you could be forgiven for thinking the game was made in 1995, not 2012. But they definitely fit the game, with good art design for both characters and environments. The only real complaint I can make is that the game is on the short side. My first time run-through was less than 3 hours, and although there are achievements and a commentary mode to go through, it's not going to keep you busy for days and days.

It's too full of gameplay problems and not something I'd pay good money for.\n\nBugs, bugs, bugs galore    The game crashes whenever you click outside of the notebook area while in the notebook.\nIn the notebook, some of the longer "hover text" is cut off, so you can't read the whole thing.\nYou can't overwrite previously saved files, so your file list just keeps getting longer and longer. And considering how buggy this game is, you need to save often in case it crashes.\nIf you save during the last interactive scene in the game, it hangs. My cursor became a "clock" icon (which means "wait") and never changed back, so I had to force-exit the game.\nYou can find more bugs (including those I mentioned above) in the Discussions section for this game.\nThe story wasn't good enough to compensateFirstly, the opening puzzle was pretty dumb. (There's even a thread about it here.) Secondly, I was expecting more. When the game ended I was like, Wha... that's it?! Content was kind of sparse, and the story turned out to be really one-dimensional.\n\nThat aside...I did like the characters, the way they were drawn, the great voice acting, the animation, and the way certain puzzles had to be solved - there was some creativity involved here. I also liked the locations and background scenes, especially the park at night which did successfully evoke an eerie kind of mood.\n\nThe verdictPlay this only if you're going through the entire Blackwell series and feel a need to know all the stories.","April 8","false","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Stumbled across this as a reddit recommend during the summer sale. Played  shortly after Perfidious Petrol Station (similar style game) so was in the mood for retro gaming.\n\nReviewing both the first and second game as they are very similar and i played them back to back.\n\nImpressions: Anyone whose played the first two Blackwell games will point to their lo-fi charm.. Blackwell  captures the days of SCUMM/Lucasarts perfectly... all too perfectly with it's qwerks, dead-ends, glitches and clunky interface. But as ever it's the story and characters that need to stand-out and within 5minutes I was hooked on the plot and invested in the characters.\n\nThe Good:\n* Superb story in a world that feels lived in.\n* Original gameplay ideas that are fun to explore.\n* Great characters and cases that make logical sense.\n* The Notepad mechanic is genius.\n* Recaptures the days of Monkey Island.\n* Achievements make replay more fun.\n* Commentary is fun and enlightening.\n\nThe Bad:\n* Voice acting can be a little off (part of the charm).\n* Can get deadended because you missed clicking one thing.\n* Save/Load interface is awkward.\n* Can't ALT+TAB on Win 7 without locking up and CTRL+DEL.\n* Some visuals are stretched by widescreen monitors.\n* Some lines unvoiced or used in error (very few).\n* Commentary is spoliery don't listen on first play-through.\n* Short length but value when bought as a pack.\n* Bonus features has audio swearing not in the main game.\n\nRecommended for: Old school P n' C fans who value plot and characters over glitz. Ideal for nostalgia hounds and teens who like the supernatural.\n\nConclusion.\n7/10.

This is a point and click adventure game, with an emphasis on detective work.\n\nIn The Blackwell Legacy, you mainly control Rosa Blackwell, a newspaper writer asked to do a story on a recent suicide at the local college. Throughout the course of the first day, you learn that Rosa has a family legacy in the form of a ghost named Joey. In the course of the adventure, you control Rosa and Joey as you try to solve the mystery of the college suicide. At certain points, you can switch to controlling Joey when you need some ghostly assistance.\n\nWhile Blackwell Legacy controls like a typical point and click, much progress is made through your interviews and questioning of individuals connected to the case. You have a notebook in addition to your inventory which is used to track clues. Clues can be combined in the notebook if there is a connection, and you can bring up your notebook to question individuals further. As new information is found about clues, it is added to the notebook.\n\nThe retro graphics are well done, although I am not a huge fan of the style. It doesn't take away too much from my enjoyment of the game. I would prefer well done retro graphics than bad modern artwork.\n\nThe voice actors could use some improvement. Joey is serviceable, but Rosa's actor sounds like she is completely disinterested the entire time. Hopefully she improves in later games in the series.\n\nThe Blackwell Legacy is an enjoyable, short detective adventure game. Expect the game to only last a few hours. There are the beginnings of a great adventure series here. The notebook feature in particular was fun to use when questioning witnesses. I could also see Joey as a controllable character being used in interesting ways in future games. I recommend this game, not only because it is enjoyable in itself, but also because I expect this to be the first in a great series.\n\nGrade: B","September 3, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You play a reluctant medium who discovers that each female generation in her family is haunted by the presence of a wise cracking, 1920s, ghost. So, naturally, you use this information to solve mysteries and help restless spirits resolve issues in their lives and move on. The perfect premise for an episodic adventure game.\n\nThe tone of the game is largely pretty light, but to its credit it's not afraid to go dark (madness, suicide) or hint at some much bigger issues that video games usually don't (what happens after we die). Plus, the puzzles are all based in real world situations and logic (so there are no absurd "tie a string to your cat and send it under your couch to grab your wallet" puzzles).

The puzzles were easy enough to figure out, but not so simple as to be pandering. Sometimes, you had to think of 'how would I complete this in an adventure game?' versus solving a problem in real life. So a little more Day of the Tentacle, a little less Grand Theft Auto. There was little not to like, with the graphic style and execution fitting together perfectly- in my humble opinion. The only thing that put me off a little- at first- was the voice acting, but I quickly got acclimated to it.

All are point and click made in the AGS engine. As the first of the serie, Legacy is somewhat limited in scope and gameplay. However, it is still a very fun game, and an introduction to a fantastic serie of games.\n\nContrary to many point and click during the 80s/90s this one strives to stay realistic, with interesting puzzles and no "crazy puzzle logic". The story carries it well, and the puzzles have just enough difficulty to make you think, without being frustrating. The great soundtrack and the fully-voiced characters make the world feels real and interesting.\n\nOn the downside, the game does carry a bit of a "first game" stigma. There is a limited number of locations and characters, and the "introduction" (before the ghost comes in) is a bit too long. Theses small flaws are definitely noticeable, but not too bothersome.\n\nDespite this, Legacy is still a nice adventure to enjoy, and it's a good introduction to a fantastic serie, with the next games being way better.\n\nNote : Dont worry about my low playtime, the game is longer than that : I've mostly played it on my phone.","October 7, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/recommended/80330/","yukichigai","Y|yukichigai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/","463 products in account","The Blackwell Legacy is a great example of an older game genre - in this case, Point-and-Click Adventure - brought forward into the modern era of gaming. There's a certain undeniable charm to the old Point-and-Click Adventure genre, but with that charm often comes a lot of baggage: esoteric puzzles, picky controls, and solutions requiring advanced knowledge of completely unexplained game mechanics.  The story may be compelling, but you spend so much time tearing your hair out in frustration that the enjoyment is dulled a bit.  With that in mind, what makes The Blackwell Legacy such a good game is that it (mostly) avoids these pitfalls while providing an interesting and deep story for players to enjoy.\n\nNow that is not to say it is a perfect game in that regard.  A few of the "puzzles" (such as they are) do require you to do some thoroughly unexpected things that only make sense when you've exhausted all your other options.  For the most part though, the game presents you with obstacles that can be solved using plain (if convoluted) logic, rather than the dodgy "Adventure game logic" that so many of us seasoned Adventure game veterans are used to.  When you solve a puzzle you feel as though you actually solved something, rather than just mashing through combinations until something stuck.\n\nStory-wise, The Blackwell Legacy provides something interesting with a lot of fairly original ideas (or at least combinations of ideas).  The protagonist, Rosangela Blackwell, is neither a blank slate nor an overdramaticized bundle of one-liners, with a personality that is rather unique for a player character.  Her ghostly sidekick Joey has his own personality as well, providing a welcome contrast to Rosa without clashing unduly with her, and the interactions between the two are thoroughly enjoyable.  Rather than just being two shallow personalities thrown at the story, both Joey and Rosa have well-developed backstories, though we only get glimpses at smaller parts of the whole.  Still, it's enough to give both them and the world they inhabit a depth that would otherwise be lacking, making the story something you are more likely to care about.\n\nThe story itself is reasonably straightforward once you know it all, but is presented at just the right pace such that you are drawn in and eager to know both what happened before and what happens next.  Unfortunately, the story is also a bit short, easily completed in a handful of hours or less.  There's nothing wrong with this - it's meant to be an episodic title with a price point to match, after all - but with such developed characters and mechanics the brevity of the plot leaves you strongly wanting more.\n\nNow with all this positive prose I do have to mention (or perhaps reiterate) that this game is not perfect.  Some few game mechanics are a bit obscure or are implemented poorly, and at many times the plot is delivered via a massive bit of verbal exposition (read: some dude talking at you a lot).  These elements aren't dealbreakers, but they do detract from the game's overall quality.  That said, they are not the majority of the game, and if you listen to the game's commentary creator Dave Gilbert explicitly admits that many of these mechanics were a mistake.\n\nAt the end of the day, The Blackwell Legacy is a very well made, well scripted, and well designed Point-and-Click Adventure game.  More importantly, it's also an enjoyable game, even if it may be the weakest game in the series.  If you have any love for the genre you owe it to yourself to pick this up and set aside a few hours to play through it.","March 28, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, naturally, you use this information to solve mysteries and help restless spirits resolve issues in their lives and move on. The perfect premise for an episodic adventure game.\n\nThe tone of the game is largely pretty light, but to its credit it's not afraid to go dark (madness, suicide) or hint at some much bigger issues that video games usually don't (what happens after we die). Plus, the puzzles are all based in real world situations and logic (so there are no absurd "tie a string to your cat and send it under your couch to grab your wallet" puzzles).

All are point and click made in the AGS engine. As the first of the serie, Legacy is somewhat limited in scope and gameplay. However, it is still a very fun game, and an introduction to a fantastic serie of games.\n\nContrary to many point and click during the 80s/90s this one strives to stay realistic, with interesting puzzles and no "crazy puzzle logic". The story carries it well, and the puzzles have just enough difficulty to make you think, without being frustrating. The great soundtrack and the fully-voiced characters make the world feels real and interesting.\n\nOn the downside, the game does carry a bit of a "first game" stigma. There is a limited number of locations and characters, and the "introduction" (before the ghost comes in) is a bit too long. Theses small flaws are definitely noticeable, but not too bothersome.\n\nDespite this, Legacy is still a nice adventure to enjoy, and it's a good introduction to a fantastic serie, with the next games being way better.\n\nNote : Dont worry about my low playtime, the game is longer than that : I've mostly played it on my phone.","October 7, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As one of the very first games from Wadget Eye studio, it had to. You have to solve puzzles made by a developper who is new at this, with new mechanics. It's hard to figure the developper's logic, sometime. But that's part of the studio's learning curve.

It's not exactly a throwback to better times, though the graphics surely hark back a bit to more innocent times; rather, it's a challenge made (and met) to create a small-studio game that remembers how much fun it was, on many levels, to play computer games when the field was young.\n\nWhat I mean is that there used to be an instant joy in recognizing familiar things, writ small and played back on the monitor.  This game is set in a New York City that resembles the real one, with characters who are off-beat and individual without being unruly stereotypes.  This game is not realistic, of course - it's a point-and-click adventure, and there's nothing less real than these - but it is drawn from the world around us, grounded in a life that we (or at least the New Yorkers in the crowd) will recognize as real.\n\nIt will run you a couple of hours to finish, at least if you're as slow as I am, and there are only a few main puzzles - which does not mean that I didn't get stuck in one.

Mostly the series are good, or good enough, decent at best in other cases. However, there are rare cases where you'd actually become hooked to a series.\n\nThe first time I began playing this game I only did so because of the Steam icon. I already had the game on a bundle at some point in time, but like most games I got in indie bundles I never touched it. That was, until I was going through my Steam library, looking for a game to play. The one thing that caught my eyes though was the aforementioned game icon, which was basically an icon of Rosangela Blackwell. As the screenshots already show, it's the redhead woman who wears glasses, two of my favorite things when it comes to women. But, okay, it did pique my interest a bit, would it manage to keep me interested?\n\nThe story begins when Rosangela's aunt, who had been committed in a mental hospital, had passed away recently. However, Rosangela soon discovers that she's a medium when Joey, a spirit who is always bound to his medium, is now bound to Rosangela, and that her aunt's descending into madness wasn't just a coincidence. Together with Joey, Rosangela now must help spirits cross over to the other side.\n\nThe game is a classic point and click game, with a unique clue system, which basically is the same as how items are combined in most point and cick games, except now the clues are gathered through conversations. Now, while I say it is unique, it also really doesn't add a lot, although it makes the story flow better, due to the protagonist not suddenly gaining new information without you knowing where it comes from. This however does cause a bit more trial and error, and some puzzles that perhaps in hindsight sounds clever, but will cause you to get stuck for some time.\n\nBut there are also other points in the game where you'll get hopelessly stuck because you haven't triggered certain conversations yet. Most of them seem like the standard flavor conversations, ones that seemingly are only there to immerse you in the word and add no value. Now, given, the achievements do give away what you might need to do in order to advance, but it's still a pain at times.\n\nHowever, most point and click games are both about the puzzles and about the story, especially the story, and on both acounts it definitely delivers. The game uses some clever puzzles to solve things, including the aforementioned clues system. There are some puzzles which require you to time things.\n\nThe story itself is good. It's not the best, but as a start of a series, it did get me hooked. It's engaging, and at times genuinely scary. The climax I found a bit underwhelming, because it kind of takes away the mysterious air the game had throughout the game.\n\nThe game has two audio commentaries, one being the regular, the other a retrospect, made five years after the game's release. There are other small things which have to be unlocked by entering a code.\n\nThe Blackwell Legacy is a great game for point and click adventure gamers and those who are really into engaging stories. While it has its flaws and bugs, there's nothing really game-breaking present. If you're looking for an old-school adventure game, this is the one to have.","November 25, 2013","true","7.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Notebook, well, combining some choices led to red herrings - but they weren't relevant in gameplay, they could only lead you to a merry ride inside your brain. Especially one comment of Ally about Adrian was a bit confusing. Some clues are irrelevant ramblings.\n\nWhat is bad? Hard to say. The first Riddle is not a good starter, true.

As you should know by now it's about a women "haunted" by a ghost who solve supernatural mysteries together.\nI did not know anything about it before I played and have to admit I was pleasently surpised by how it turned out. Won't touch too much on the story as it's basically the only reason for playing, so I'll leave it at that it was enjoyable, interesting, and quite unique.\n\nGameplay is pretty subpar if you are used to adventure games, though it has it's unique twists.. My biggest problem with the game stems from some of the truely counter intuative puzzles you'll come across and extremely frustrating points where you find yourself knowing exactly what you have to do but no idea how to make the limited options you have work for you. Generally it leads to you facepalming as you missed that one random thing you did not try from trial and error, which sounds standard for the genre but I found especially mood dampening in this one.\nI'd say it mainly is due to the unique note pad feature. While cool and useful it sometimes can be frustrating to work with.\n\nThe writing is well done and voice acting mainly well done, with some mic issues that they should have never let into the finished game. Sometimes the dialogue sounds a little forced or half-hearted, but over all I find it better than some games. Considering most of the game is just dialogue scenes this is very welcome.\n\nIn the end I have to say I'm looking forward to playing the sequels and am glad to hear another one is being worked on. Even with Blackwell's issues I find I enjoyed it and it's not often I beat a game in one sitting, though clocking in at around 3 hours it's not saying much.\nIf you enjoy story heavy adventure games this is obviously a game to get. If you're looking for a lot of puzzles and inventory managment you'd best look elsewhere.","January 10, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are intentionally designed to recreate the 90s style of P&C games and it does a good job. Whilst people may get annoyed that they are not modern enough, it does add to the feel of the game quite well.\n\nYou can look at the videos on Steam to see a rough idea of the storyline so I won't cover that here but the gameplay is typical P&C stuff. This was the designer's first attempt at a commercial game (he says so on the included commentaries) and it shows to a certain extent. One thing that annoys me with this type of game is when you can see how to do something but you can't do it. Not fully exploring dialogue options or combining clues (one of the game's cool but sometimes frustrating features) can mean you can't complete a puzzle. When you finally do, the frustration you feel at not having been able to do it before is sometimes greater than the satisfaction of having done it.\n\nThe game is only short, couple of hours maybe, but there is a level of replayability due to the commentary options. There are two commentaries available, although they really should be used for a second playthrough as they contain some minor spoilers. The game's creator speaks at length about things he wishes he could have done differently amongst others. His own admittance of things he could have done better make me feel strangely less annoyed by them and definitely earn himself and the game an extra point.\n\nThough only short, the game is recommended for P&C lovers and achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s (they can all be done relatively easily and quickly) otherwise maybe I would say try something else.","July 19, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That wouldn't be too bad if the game were more than an interactive cutscene during that time, but there's barely anything to do that makes that time feel worthwhile. It's like a horror movie that spends half the runtime setting up the fact that it's a horror movie.\n\nThe voice performance falls flat. The acting for Joey is pretty good, actually, but Roseangela's performance is awkward and sounds like a high school drama tryout. This frustrates the lackluster dialog for her character and the end result just feels like a lifeless character, bored almost by the strange events in her life.\n\nThe ending actually left a sour taste in my mouth. When I played through it, it felt like something was missing, some part of it wasn't working. I found myself fumbling in the final scene with nothing more I could really do. Then a time ran out as though some puzzle failed and the ending began. Come to discover that there's an achievement there most everyone was able to get. Even looked up the solution, but it simply didn't work. The game was broken. I reloaded a save to try it a few more times. No luck. That burned away my desire to replay this one through with the commentary.\n\nI'd round this out at more of a "thumbs meh" than a thumbs down. Since my only options are yea or nay, I can't really see past these flaws to recommend it.","January 21, 2014","false","3.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The writing is shoddy sometimes, the dialogues don’t really feel natural, the puzzles are a bit far-fetched, so overall it’s not a “professional” game.\nBut what it lacks in sheer professionalism it makes up in passion.

The dialog is terrible, the voice acting is atrocious, and the story is corny. The protagonist, Rosangela, is so sour and boring that I found it difficult to care about her family or her predicament. I thought her pal Joey was tiresome and did not hit the charming, old school gangster schtick they were going for. There are some ridiculous conversations in a mental hospital ("we had to gag the patient") showing the writers weren't really familiar with the subject matter. The puzzles are just OK - they're not particularly imaginative. There is a lot of "make work" back and forth clicking to solve things. There was some filler, such as repeated dialog scenes when opening and closing conversations.\n\nI could accept the game looking like it was made in 1998 (it was actually released in 2006) but it doesn't work very well. It doesn't seem optimised for higher resolutions, and it frequently would start bugging out on me so I'd have to quit the game and restart it again. I'm not sure it works well with Steam - I played for over 3 hours and Steam is showing that I only played for 2.1. The credits at the end are not skippable and you must watch them unless you want to force close the game.\n\nIf you're really bored and want to spend three hours solving some basic adventure game puzzles, and this game is on sale for $0.99, then go for it.

In fact, most of the games in the series tend to have *just enough* to keep you going. However the entire series builds up to a disappointing and almost nonsensical conclusion that will sour the overall experience on top of many unresolved plot lines and convenient storytelling. The payoff isn't worth it, and retroactively breaks the semi-good times there are to be had.\n\nPersonally speaking, what the series needed for a recommendation from me was a solid ending. Not good or amazing, but something that tied all the loose ends up. If it had done that, it would have earned a positive recommendation despite its mediocrity in several areas.

Unpopular opinion time.\n\nDespite all of the fantastic reviews both critically and on Steam, I haven't found enjoyment in this game. I picked it up on a whim during the sale because it was hella cheap, and after reading the game's synopsis and watching the trailer, it looked like it had an interesting premise. And really, even after playing through a bit of the game, it does. The story itself isn't the problem here.\n\nI've found problems with this in other things. The voice acting's pretty weak, and some of the dialogue feels clunky. The art style feels a bit inconsistent; for example, the location selection map isn't in an 8-bit style like the rest of the game is and feels more like a raster image that was enlarged a little too much. Also, the game bugs out a lot on me, too. (Very frequently, the game will suddenly decide to skip over dialogue for no reason, and it often requires me to skip over the game because I need to read the dialogue in order to know what I'm doing.) There have been times where I would do simple things in order to progress through gameplay and would be incapable of making any progress. And so on and so forth.\n\nI'm not even that far in this short game because it keeps having problems and is not sitting well with me. I honestly don't see myself finishing it.

Now, let me preface this review by telling you that I'm a huge fan of adventure games. The stories, puzzles, and careful attention\nto detail are appealing to me. Don't let my bias turn you away, though. If you have even the slightest interest in point and clicks, you should absolutely\ngive this game a go.\n\nThe Blackwell Legacy, from wadjet eye games, was initially released in 2006, but this is a re-release from 2011 with the most obvious update being a change in voiceover for the\nmain character. It's the first in what is currently a four game series and is absolutely essential to the entire experience, so don't just skip to the later games without\nplaying through this one at least once. It features Rosangela Blackwell as the protaganist, a reclusive woman working as a writer for the local newspaper who, as the\ntitle of the game may suggest, acquires a ghost sidekick as a family heirloom.\n\nNow, the first thing you'll notice when you start the game is the seemingly oldschool graphics. This was never too much of a problem for me, but then again I'm not too\npicky about visuals when it comes to video games. Even with the pixellated display, it was very obvious how much care was given to the artistic direction.\n\nThe second thing that I noticed was the fully voice acted script. While it's often taken for granted these days, it's nice to see an indie adventure game, which is text heavy\nas a genre, going to such lengths. That doesn't mean that it's without issues, though. The re-release of The Blackwell Legacy fixes a few of the voice over problems,\nprimarily including the voice actress for Rosangela from the later games, but her well spoken lines are a stark contrast to the much lower quality of the rest of the cast.\nThat's not to say that the actors were bad, but that the hardware was not up to snuff. Many times I was annoyed by hearing breathing into the microphone. A pop filter is\njust a few bucks, there's no excuse.\n\nThe gameplay in The Blackwell Legacy is what you would expect from any adventure game. You have an inventory, walk and interact with objects by clicking around the screen,\nand solve puzzles to progress the plot. The most unique feature is a clue combining system where you click two items in your notebook to link them together, often giving you\na new clue.\n\nMost importantly, the story is great. It deals with very serious issues, including spirits, the afterlife, and suicide. There is still an element of humor injected\ninto the experience, but none of it pulls you away from the world it has built for you.\n\nThe biggest disappointment you'll face while playing The Blackwell Legacy is the length of the game. During my first playthrough without any guides or hints took me\nonly two and a half hours. With such a short playtime, and relatively low replayability since it has a linear story that doesn't branch, you'd expect the game to at least\nsell cheap. Thankfully, it does.\n\nThe Blackwell Legacy is far from perfect, but it was an experience I'm not likely to soon forget. It's awesome story and well developed characters for such a short game\nmake this one worthy of a 7.5 out of 10.","December 2, 2012","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","A fantastic story as well as well written characters. I've always loved these kind of point and click games, bringing back memories from games such as Monkey Island. The story is the kind where it grips you early and then you can't back out from the game, as you need the answers to calm your curious mind.\n\nI love the fact that Rosangela is so socially awkward, it makes her an awesome character and a standout in the game industry where most female main characters are portrayed as sexy and bold. She's also a funny character, as she will question the very same things you do, making her easily relatable to.\nEven the minor characters of the story are relatable to, such as the ghosts who sadly can't accept their own deaths and have to be helped to realize they are dead. They don't just end up as "Random ghost 1", they have their own story to tell and feel their own things.\n\nI guess my only complaint would be that two of the puzzles are hard to solve. One has a solution so farfetched that I don't think any sane person would think it up (Nishantis apartment) and the other puzzle requires you to speak to the spirit guide and get the exact answer you need before being able to get his help to solve a puzzle, even if you know how you want to solve it.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you are a fan of Point & Click games, as well as enjoy stories with well written characters.","June 4, 2014","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Interesting part: The author gives away hints on how some stuff is meant in the commentary section and more stuff as well. He himself states that the notebook is very not intuitive to solve puzzles - I agree. I forgot it most of the time and got stuck (Thanks to the french fans - especially Vic=HKC= for his cool community guide!)\nMe myself felt that the long dialogue with Rosas backstory and family story were very interesting and deepened the plot around Rosa. Shunned by the author as “infodumps” - praised by me as “declare the setting”. Personally I’d wish myself more and better of these cool music switches like when you meet Joey. Pure goose bumps. Played that thing even more times because it was so cool. That was the pt. where I recognised that you can’t save anywhere. Only outside from scripted content and dialogue. So I had to skip through many stuff to get to the pt. of saving in the menue.\nThe open end is instilling hunger for more.\nThe puzzles are very intuitive if you do not forget the mentioned note book and you’re used to adventure game logic. As a veteran you’ll have no problems at all, I guess. (I solved the leash puzzle by accident)\nThere are some downs like dialogue is shown but it doesn’t play or that it plays wrong dialogue at certain times. After 5 years having a reedited version - weak. Harsh? Yes. Still true.\nGraphic qual is kinda inconsistent aswell I can agree to some of my previous speakers.\nCould be because that there went a designer missing in the main part of the game was getting done. So it’s a mosaic of artsy artefacts. I like this mosaic, VERY short mosaic but there are other eps in that series.\nSo all in all: buy et for a laid-back Sierra-like pnc adventure experience with some interesting plot development possibilities.\n~shi\n\n+ retro-like graphics and equipment ~ Rosa’s seems to be from the stone age. Hehe.\n- ... only if you like or can cope with that kind of graphic, that is\n+ relatively good sound qual\n- … Hence it’s an indie game not every VA is a pro but whaddaya expect, huh?\n- not intutive note book ~ too easy to forget\n+ ... notes combining is logic and has a well VA\n+ Setting has a good explanation\n- ... maybe a bit too good for some folks\n+ subtle good sound and music changes\n- ... which were used too rarely\n+ Joey’s Jokes - from bitterness with love:  “Evil doers beware! I’m Joey Mallone and I command the power of light breezes!”\n- Only save- and pauseable in outside from scripts and dialogues\n- some strange dialogue and sound bugs in a after 5 years reedited version.\nBuy endorsement cause:\nGotten hungry from the first part I wanna play the others and would say that you could buy it when it is on sale with the bundle or alone and the last part “epiphany” which is  not in the bundle (right now) so you don’t pay too much of a buck for a mediocre to great game.\n\nGerman:Diverse Stärken und Schwächen fließen durchweg durch diese Geschichte und dieses Spiel. Offensichtlich keine Crysis-Augenweide hat es doch seinen eigenen Charme mit fließenden Details in Bild UND Ton. Diverse Noten beim Synchronsprechen machen deutlich, dass viel Emphase auf die Charaktere und deren Rolle um und in Rosas neuem Leben gelegt wurde. Interessant ist, dass der Autor in seiner eigenen Kommentarsektion sehr vieles noch anspricht und die Geschichte teils vertieft und auf schöne Akzente hinweist.\nDer Autor selbst betitelt das Lösen per Notizbuch als sehr uniintuitiv - dem Stimme ich zu ich bin mehrmals festgesessen weil ich es komplett vergessen hatte. (Danke an die französisch-sprechenden Fans - Speziell Vic=HKC= für den Tollen Communityguide!)\nIch selbst empfand die langen Dialoge in denen Rosas Hintergrundgeschichte und Familiengeschichte Stück für Stück enträtselt wurde sehr angenehm. Vom Autor als "Infodumps" geschmäht - von mir als "Setting erklären" gepriesen.\nIch persönlich hätte für bestimmte Situationen im Spiel noch bessere Soundwechsel gewünscht - Ähnlich dem Auftakt "Hello Joey" in dem man eben jenem zum ersten mal trifft. GÄNSEHAUT! und sofort nochmal die Begegnung mit Joey gespielt weil es so gut war! Mehrmals.\nHier ist mir aufgefallen, dass es leider nicht möglich jederzeit zu speichern. Nur außerhalb von Gesprächen, sodass ich mich schnell durch viel Content skippen musste um Joeys Auftritt wieder zu erleben.\nOffenes Ende macht Hunger auf mehr.\nDie Rätsel sind eigentlich Recht intuitiv und leicht, wenn man das Notizbuch nicht vergisst und sehr an Adventurespiellogik angepasst. Man wird als Veteran keine Probleme haben, denke ich. ( Das Hundeleinen"Rätsel" habe ich aus Versehen gelöst )\nTrotzdem gibt es nervige Seiten und/oder Cuts? - Dialogzeilen werden gezeigt aber etwas anderes wird gesagt, was kürzer ist. Seltsame Dialogfehler weisen auf einen Bug hin, der wahrscheinlich die falsche Soundfile abspielt - für eine 5 Jahre nach release revampte Version ist das ziemlich schwach. Hart, ja. Isso.\nGrafikqualität ist auch seltsam inkonsistent - da muss ich einigen Vorrednern zustimmen. Liegt wohl daran, dass ein Designer zwischendurch flöten gegangen ist und das Spiel zu einer Art Kunstflickenteppich wurde. Für mich trotz alledem zu einem schönen Teppich, der leider VIEL zu kurz ist. Aber dafür sind ja die anderen Episoden der Blackwellserie.\nZum Ende kommend gibt's eigentlich nur zu berichten: Kaufet es für entspannte Sierra-haftige P'n'C Abenteuer und einem interessantem Auftakt für eine Serie, die ich weiterverfolgen werde.\n~shi\n\n+ Retro-hafte Grafik und Ausstattung ~ Rosas scheint Computer ist aus der Steinzeit zu sein. Hehe.\n- ... wenn mann es denn so mag mag\n+ Relativ gute Tonqualität\n- ...nicht jeder Synchronsprecher hatte eine Pro-Ausstattung und es gibt dadurch einige Atemgeräusche. (Deacon)\n- Nicht intuitives Notizen verbinden ~ wird zu leicht vergessen\n+ ... Notizen verbinden an sich ist sehr logisch, gut gelöst und synchronisiert.\n+ Setting wird ausführlich erklärt.\n- ... vllt. ein wenig zu ausführlich für andere.\n+ subtil schöne Soundkulissen und Wechsel\n- ... leider zu wenig eingesetzt.\n+ Joeys Witz - geboren aus Bitterkeit ist sehr erfrischend  “Evil doers beware! I’m Joey Mallone and I command the power of light breezes!”\n- Nur außerhalb von geskripteten Handlungen und Gesprächen speicherbar/pausierbar.\n- Teils seltsame Soundfehler und Dialogfehler selbst nach 5 Jahren reeditierter Version\nKaufempfehlung da: Nur mit dem ersten Teil ist bei mir schon der Hunger nach mehr geweckt\n-> Kauft Spiel oder das Bundle (Am besten im Sale) und Epiphany (Letzter Teil und NOCH außerhalb des Blackwell Bundles) in Sales später ;) um im Falle des Falles nicht zu viel für etwas Mittelprächtiges bis Wunderprächtiges oder gar Doofes gezahlt zu haben.","August 21, 2014","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As such there's not too much to say about it.  The game is broken down into a few scenes and a few small locations, so the amount of content is limited.\n\nSetting wise, the story doesn't really appeal much to me.  I'm just not a ghost-story person, so there isn't much draw there, and the topics covered are also kind of uninteresting too.  The voice acting is passable though, and there isn't any GUI frustration.\n\nI have a few complaints about the game, though.  One puzzle involves completing an interaction with an NPC where at the end you automatically leave the area.  The first step in solving the next puzzle requires returning to that NPC to acquire an item from her you, and you have no logical reason to believe she would have an item you would need much less what that item would be.  There is NO volume slider in the game, and with the audio set to 1/100 in windows the music was booming loud in a few places.  Some puzzles require you to combine topics in your notepad, and you can only do so at certain times and on top of that only do so a few times in the game.  Its not really fun in adventure games when the player has to bruteforce his way through a puzzle by throwing every action at every target, and its kind of dumb here where the NPC wont respond to being asked about A or B, and only to A+B.  I as the player make the mental leap easily, but it doesn't straightforwardly apply in the game.\n\n$5 is a reasonable price point but I can't really reccomend this game on its own, as it doesn't offer much and has a few nagging annoyances.  It might be worth it as an intro for the rest of the series but I could also just see it being skippable since it just introduces the premise and I'm sure that will be summarized in the later games.  I will find out as I continue the series I suppose.\n\nEDIT: Having played the full series, I would very much recommend it as a whole.  This first game is a bit rough, but the full package is worth it.","May 29, 2014","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The fact that Joey is not directly controllable by the player, is probably the main flaw of the game. There were a few puzzles, well a lot of them where Joey is part of it (such as taking some items from that girl's apartment) which were frustrating to figure out until I knew how to trigger Joey to do what I wanted.  other than that, the character's somewhat blank personalities begin to shine through toward the end and this really pushed me to get the other games.

The puzzles are solid and require genuine thought and problem solving. In almost every case, I found the solutions satisfying and got a real sense of accomplishment from working through them.\n\nThe story is just as good as the mechanics. You and your ghost companion have to solve murders and other supernatural puzzles, and help the spirits involved move on. It is a pretty unique story idea, and works very well for a point and click game because you can go back and forth between your human character (who can interact with objects and talk to people) and your ghost character (who can walk through doors and walls, but can't really interact with anything).\n\nNot only are the individual stories in each game good, as the series moves on, and as you work through each episode a bigger story starts to emerge. There is always a sense that the story is progressing, both in terms of the individual case you are working on, and also in the broader context.\n\nI wish all point and clicks would take a lesson from the mechanics, story, pacing, and all the other great things about the Blackwell series.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say is that the individual episodes of the series can be quite short in some cases. Think of this as an episodic game rather than a standalone one.","November 19, 2015","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So I came into The Blackwell Legacy knowing very little about it, aside from the fact that there were already plenty of sequels, leading me to believe that it was going to be pretty good.\n\nMy first hour with this game was not fun. I don't know whether it was just the kinda day I was having at the time, but it definitely took me a while to get into the flow of things. The main character was too cynical & I didn't find her funny at all. Some of the initial puzzles are annoying and completely unrepresentational of what the game ends up being. There is little focus which left me wondering to what end I was having to solve the puzzles that were given to me.\n\nHowever, once you meet Joey and the game actually reveals its purpose, things get a lot better. Honestly, coming into this game blind was a huge plus for me, because this "twist" wasn't ruined for me and helped me see the game in a better light from then onwards. Unfortunately, you're about half way through the game when that happens, so there's as much bad as there is good. Luckily, there're 5 games total. I'm seriously hoping that my experience with these other games in the series will completely lift my estimation of this game overall. A first game in the series will never be the most polished.\n\nOverall, I'm gonna give this game a thumbs up on the basis of the series, rather than just this game in isolation.","November 29, 2015","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Firstly it's way too short and in essense an episodic game.This is the first episode. It's quite short, with very few locations. I do think there could have been more characters/locations despite it only being an episode. It felt like they didn't have the resources to spend time drawing more locations or paying for other voice actors.  All 5 episodes it would make a game that's £15 for the bundle plus £7, which is way too much for 10 hours of gameplay. Only buy the bundle when it's reduced to £4 (which it will be). Unless ofcourse value for money doesn't bother you because it is way overpriced for such a graphically weak short game.\n\nAnyway it's a good premise but disapointing in it's execution. While there was a mystery, there could have been more twists to the mystery. But there is scope for the rest of the series....which I haven't played yet.\n\nThe story telling is good and unlike some reviewers I quite liked the main protoganists. There's good chemistry between the 2 with good voice acting. The music creates a nice atmosphere.\n\nThe graphics are obviously indie and 'retro' but you get used to them. The design is good, it's just very Atari/Amiga days. Initially it put me off.\n\nThe puzzle system is different to most point and clicks, you get info through speach as with many on the genre but workout everything with your notepad. I did like the puzzles for the most, most were logical while a few weren't. But it's better than some.\n\nI'd recomend this game only to hardcore adventure gamers who've played all the classics. And even then I'd only recomend it on offer. It says I played this for 4hours but it was less than 2 as I left the game running. By the end with all the story revealed I just wanted to be finished with it but there were interesting parts earlier in the game.\n\n6/10 - only buy on offer and you need to buy the bundle as this is pretty incomplete as a single episode.","January 29","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I also was not fond of the puzzles; they seemed both contrived and unintuitive, and the journal "deduction" mechanic was not explained properly.  Additionally, I didn't like that certain puzzle solutions will not trigger unless you have previously explored specific dialogue options.\n\nThe achievements are also a bit of a pain to get.  I had difficulty with "Family Historian" because I didn't know to keep re-examining certain objects in order to prompt further dialogue trees, and "Hear Me" was just a long slog to get through - the commentary was interesting enough, and I appreciate the game more now because of it, but the sheer number of interjections combined with the rambling delivery was draining, especially because the game itself is so dialogue-heavy already.\n\nWhat the game did right:\n- The backgrounds and animations were impressive for the technology of the time.\n- The voice-acting was well performed, and I like that there is an unlockable blooper reel.\n- Rosa's awkward smile.\n- The plot was coherent, and it makes you want to play the rest of the series to find out more about Rosa's family.\n- The music was great, especially the dorm track.\n- I liked some of the characters, Nishanthi was sweet and Rosa was endearing (but I honestly could have done without Joey or the rest of the side characters, and even Rosa had some moments where her character actions and dialogue did not quite mesh or make sense).\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 5/10.  I appreciate what they were going for, but I think there are a lot of blatant game design mistakes that detract from the gameplay and make it a bit boring and tedious.  Listening through the commentary, though, it seems like the game designer is aware of the issues, and has used this game as a learning experience going forward.  I'm hoping I will enjoy the next installment more.","December 29, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I was both impressed and disappointed in this game.  The creative answers that the game allows to some of the puzzles (the final puzzle specifically) were quite interesting.  However, sometimes I would not even see the potential answer due to my underestimation of the game's graphical abilities.  (Which was not a problem I had in other older point-and-click RPGs, like The Longest Journey - the graphics didn't interfere with puzzle-solving.)\n\nThe game has a few good characters - mostly the protagonist and the "goth" roommate that you interview.  I was extremely annoyed at my ghost sidekick and another ghost I had to interview had an obnoxious voice, which was modified by an obnoxious filter.

Here's why:\n\nDave, you're a demon in disguise, and I don't like demons.\n\nThat's why.\n\nThe long version:  this is an adventure game, and no matter how puzzle-solving-driven or challenge-driven you might think an adventure game should be, you're wrong.  An adventure game is a story/event driven game.  I repeat:  ADVENTURE GAMES ARE STORY AND EVENT DRIVEN GAMES.  The beauty of these games comes in adventuring through the story, adventuring through the world while unraveling the story, meeting characters and unraveling them, all the while events occur and the plot steadily unravels.  This is the adventure part in "adventure games".  You dig?  The puzzle-solving aspects is the game part in "adventure games".  It doesn't matter how clever or intelligent or unique or smooth your puzzles are, they're little to nothing without the adventure part; the story, the world, the characters.  Hence, this is why adventure games are story/event driven games.  Personally, I don't play adventure games to solve puzzles; I play adventure games to be engaged in a story.  The puzzles are merely perks, or frustrations, along the way.  Nothing more.  Do you understand?  Good.\n\nNow, let's talk about achievements.  They are nothing more than challenges achieved within a game.  In the context of adventure games, there's a lot of room where they can be awarded for story progression and puzzles solved, or not solved, or multiple endings, and so on.  In other words, adventure games really ease up on achievements.  Even awarding one for entering a scene or selecting a dialogue option or initiating an event can award an achievement, and rightly so.  There's a lot of slack with achievements in adventure games.  For action games, such as TF2, the achievement focus is on actual challenges overcome.  Earning an achievement for playing the Engineer once is a really dumb pointless move, but earning an achievement in Blackwell Legacy for meeting Joey is totally okay.  Once again, adventure games are mainly about story and events, not puzzles or challenges.  Which brings me to the Family Historian achievement.  This is a stupidly challenging achievement.  I have to ask:  what made you want people to replay the latter half of the game, or the entire game, over and over again, clicking on just about every possible thing you can click on while travelling to Rosa's apt every single time an itty bitty forward move in the adventure happens just to make sure the player hears every itty bitty detail Joey has on the main character's family.  I don't know wtf you were thinking when you created this achievement, but it's ludacrous and evil, especially in an adventure game, and I have concluded you were under some kind of demonic influence or mindset when you went about creating achievements for this game.  Because, seriously, you want people to enjoy the story in an unspoiled way.  Most people only need one playthrough in a story--most people read books only once.  There's no need to go through the story again and again.  You thought that Family Historian achievement was clever and challenging, well, you were so f-cking right.  But you forgot to see that achievement was also rotten, and a spoiler in the sense that it spoiled whatever joy I had in your story and game.  To the point I will not bother with the rest of the series.\n\nIf you love people, humans, then please don't ever create an achievement like that ever again.  I highly recomment you even remove it.  Please, and thanks.\n\nNow, excuse me while I go shoot myself in the head for shamefully using SAM to unlock that achievement, and thereby spoiling my awesome and legit 100%-ness.\n\nYou f-cking suck, Dave the demon.  And now I do too.\n\n\n\n","March 16","false","7.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/80330/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","The Blackwell Legacy is a point-and-click (P&C) adventure game which replicates the vibe of the classic era of adventure games from the ‘90s thanks to its visual style and mechanics, along with an interesting concept to kickstart the story. However, on its own, it fails to be impressive enough due to being no more than a introductory chapter of the saga, as well as a mere “demo” showcasing the developer’s skills  in using the AGS engine back when this game was released.\n\nUndoubtedly, the strongest aspect of this game is its story. You follow Rosa Blackwell, the protagonist whose only relative eventually dies after years in coma, thus changing her life forever the moment a ghost from the 1930s, Joey Mallone, suddenly shows up in her life. This is where Rosa discovers that Joey was bounded to her family legacy (the title is now self-explanatory) for decades and that his job is to help ghosts or spirits (maybe souls?) who got stuck in some sort of a limbo on Earth after their death to move on to the afterlife. As a result, Joey becomes Rosa’s spirit guide much like her relative and ultimately start working together to solve a recent murder case involving three students, all suspected to have their spirits stuck in a limbo. At this point, the concept sounds similar to Ghost Whisperer, but it is indeed very captivating only as long as you do not set your expectations too high since it will definitely not blow you straight away. Absolutely not in this particular game.\n\nPlaying Blackwell Legacy is a lot more about the story and narrative rather than solving the puzzles. Mechanically, there is absolutely nothing new to expect from this game. You talk to people, select dialogue branches and use items from the inventory (no item combinations though) to solve puzzles. That is all there is to it. There is a notepad feature that allows the player to combine clues which can help in solving the cases. This is a pretty nifty, yet simplistic, way to progress the story and perhaps about the only “new-ish” mechanic. While the game boils down to a “been there, done that” from a technical point of view, the mechanics are nonetheless competent. The only possible issue might be its compatibility with the Steam overlay because if you activate it, the game jumps into hyper-drive -- at least in my case.\n\nThe puzzles are relatively easy as long as you click every possible spot/dialogue, however some do suffer from the illogical/arbitrary syndrome which plagued other similar games in this genre, possibly to bluntly raise the difficulty in some cases. For instance, the infamous first puzzle of the game in the first few minutes is a dreadful puzzle design, something which even the developer apologised in his commentary version of the game years later.  Surprisingly enough, for this type of P&C game, there is a lot more dialogue-based puzzles than the typical item-based ones seen in other games which may or may not suit the player depending on their personal tastes.\n\nThe voice acting is hit-and-miss in some places, with Rosa and Joey perhaps having the better voice actors. Considering the scope of the project though, the overall voice acting is generally acceptable.  On a plus side, the background music is pretty good and does set the perfect atmosphere in certain scenes.\n\nConclusively, Blackwell Legacy is just a slightly above-the-average P&C adventure game thanks to its concept making it to stand out than other similar games, although on its own it is unimpressive due to the simple fact that it was the developer’s second commercial game, leaving a lot of room for improvements. Not only that the game is just an introductory chapter, it is also a relatively short game which should be completed in no more than two or three hours. Investing solely in the story will not disappoint because it is pretty interesting, with Rosa and Joey having an exciting chemistry, but again, it will not blow you away. Maybe because it does not have enough time to flesh out some things. Once more, on its own, I cannot recommend this game because it is essentially like paying the full price of a book and only getting the first chapter.\n\nThe final verdict is to buy the whole saga and play each game one after another instead, particularly the first three, because that is when this game (and the series) actually shines, making it one of the more memorable adventure series of its genre in recent years.","December 29, 2014","false","2.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

In a game where story and character are really important, that's a bit of an issue. Even then, however, the game has some faults. It's not very pretty, even in pixel graphics style, I didn't necessarily think about how nice anything looked. The controls arent all that clear at times, the limited puzzles and overall length however just made me realize how SHORT it is. It wasn't a terrible game, no. It was OK. That's about it. Just OK. But I can't recommend it. Nothing stood out at me as memorable, maybe the next games will.","August 8, 2014","false","7.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Point-and-click adventure games have always been a vexing genre to me. On the one hand, I find myself enjoying the storylines quite a bit, as they seem like that's where most of the effort in making the game goes. That's fine and all, but oftentimes, the puzzles receive the short end of the stick as far as the design attention goes. When I wrote the review for The Walking Dead game (the first long form review I did), I mentioned that one of the things I enjoyed most about the game was the fact that the puzzles made sense. They may not have actually worked in the real world, but they made enough sense nevertheless.\n\nMost point-and-click adventure games that I've played have puzzles that don't make all that much sense. The adventure game purist's perpsective seems to be that having these puzzles adds to the gameplay, making it so that the game doesn't just last an hour and a half or whatever it may be. If this is not your position and you are an "adventure game purist", forgive the potential strawman attack, but I don't really feel like the typical adventure game puzzle should be like this. With respect to the Blackwell Legacy, it's a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nOne of the things that the game does to shake up the formula a bit is introduce the system of a notebook, in which you can link various topics to proceed in the game. There are some usages that do work and do make sense, such as linking a first name without a last name with a last name without a first name. However, there are some implementations that don't work. For instance, there is one puzzle in which you have to link two names together. I had already figured out the puzzle, but since I didn't use the right dialogue option with the right person, the game wouldn't let me actually solve the puzzle  the right way. This had me stuck for about an hour.\n\nFortunately, there are very few inventory puzzles in the game, but again, those puzzles are often quite obtuse and farfetched in nature. Regarding the stability of the game, there is a way to reliably make it crash (at least in version 1.7), where if you click outside of the notebook when you have it pulled up, the game will crash. This isn't too big of a deal, but it's just something worth noting that you probably shouldn't do that. The game autosaves every time you go to the world map, so if you do accidentally crash the game, you shouldn't lose too much progress.\n\nApart from the puzzles, there really isn't much else to this game. Again, puzzles are sort of a mixed bunch in this game with regard to quality. However, the puzzles weren't anything that really blew me away in cleverness, so I'll give this game a 6/10 for the gameplay.\n\nStory: The main draw of the game, obviously. The series is quasi-episodic in nature, with this being the first in the series (I really wish they introduced a numbering to the games, but oh well). It definitely does feel like the first thing in a series, but that's not to say that it's necessarily bad or unenjoyable. I found myself enjoying the characters introduced thus far, and the writing lends a very believable nature to them. The premise is quite good as well; of course, I won't talk too much in-depth on that, since that's the whole point of getting the game. Overall, I give the writing and story an 8/10 for a cast of very enjoyable characters and an interesting enough premise to base a series off of.\n\nGraphics: A bit of an odd one. It seems to fluctuate between a few different styles of art; the facial features of Rosangela and Joey in-game don't really look anything like they do on the title screen, and nobody's facial features look ANYTHING like the ones shown in pictures. In fact, I'd go as far as saying the faces in the pictures are potentially more unsettling than the premise. None of it is bad, but the lack of a consistent art style can be a bit jarring. This is an Adventure Game Studio game, so if you can run Steam, you'll be able to run this game. Also, since this is an AGS game, there is the winsetup.exe file in the root directory of the game. Alt-Entering doesn't pull you out of fullscreen (which it fullscreens in 640x480 and looks not so great on a 16:9 monitor), but using winsetup.exe will allow you to run it windowed. With technical aspects being pointless to rate, we are left with the pretty good but still sometimes inconsistent art style, leading me to give this game a 3/5 for graphics.\n\nSound: They definitely have a good composer on staff for this game. There's definitely a few songs from this game that I wouldn't mind putting on my MP3 player. If I had to pick a favorite song from the game, I'd pick the intro song. It just does everything right for me. Regarding the voice acting, it's not bad for an Indie game. There were a few voices that I wasn't expecting for certain characters, but oftentimes in real life people look nothing like what they sound like, so it's not too big of a deal. There were a few lines that did feel kinda forced, but that didn't ruin my enjoyment all that much. Another issue I noted, specifically with Joey's voice actor, is that it seems like sometimes they record without a pop filter. This may not be the case, but it is definitely noticeable on a few lines. For a very good OST and some pretty good but not perfect VAs, I'll give this game a 3/5 for the audio.\n\nOverall scores are 6/8/3/3; Cumulative score of 6.7/10. While the gameplay may not have left me with the greatest impression for puzzles to come, the story has given me good impressions for what's to come for the adventures of Rosangela and Joey. So far, I'd say to pick up the Blackwell Collection when it's on sale, but $5 isn't bad for a decently put together adventure game.","June 9, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(It really does deserve more reviews.)  In case you're confused about what this game is, it's a story/character-centric point-and-click adventure game that's a throwback to the look and gameplay style old Lucas Arts games.  So don't go into this thinking you're getting Bioshock Infinite, and then feeling betrayed when it's not.\n\nHowever, unlike the Lucasarts games of old, the story in BL is presented fairly seriously.  (No wacky pirates or whatever.)  The sardonic, slightly-terse lead character, Rosangela, in fact is very reminiscent of a female lead in the classic Sierra adventure game series Gabriel Knight, Grace.  (And I wouldn't be surprised if the Blackwell creators took inspiration from the GK games.)\n\nSo far the plot seems vaguely reminiscent of the movie Butterfly Effect.  By that I mean it seems there's some genuinely supernatural things going on, but the game throws some doubt the audience's way.  In both that movie and this game, other characters bring up the possibility of the main character having a mental illness, possibly genetically inherited.  And like the Butterfly Effect, the lead character in the Blackwell Legacy has ocassional bouts of headaches to further tease the audience in terms of "is this all really going on or not?"\n\nLike all old-school point and click games, the presentation--while maybe a turnoff to those who don't quite know what they're getting into--turns out to be a strength.  Instead of being in constant "twitch" mode where you navigate some first person view through a Doom-like reflex-fest--the experience is more akin to reading a book.  You get to just sort of unwind as the story presents itself, observe the characters reacting to one another, and watch the plot unfold.\n\nThere is even a little bit of innovation.  Rosangela is  a reporter of sorts, and there's some cool bit of puzzle solving involving the entries in her notebook.  As the player you click on separate clues that may be related, and Rosa draws inferences as to what it could all mean.\n\nAs of now, the game is very reasonably priced, so there's no reason not to give it a shot, whip up some hot chocolate, and enjoy an old-school experience where story, character and relaxation are the main attractions.","December 7, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, 8 bit retro graphics is En Vogue now anyway. :)\nThe music is really good and is nice to listen to. The same can' be said about the voice acting. Personally I feel that the voice acting is pretty bad most of the time, and the main actors sound as if they are just reading a script (which of course they do, but shouldn't let you hear it). The puzzles are not really hard, so it is a good one for point & click beginners.\n\nSo overall I would say 6/10. If you like a good story and can ignore the old graphics it's definitely something you should look into, especially if you get it on a sale.","November 28, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're more familiar with recent games in the genre, this title might seem a bit strange due to its art style and lo-fi sound but the combination of these two gives it an old school charm to it.  The puzzles are interesting and hard without being convoluted and are well-tied in with the story.  The game is a bit on the short side but with the low price and the fact that it's one part of a five part series makes this issue more forgiveable.  I would recommend this game with the added note that unless you're playing this on a CRT monitor from the 90's it feels better to play the game in windowed mode because of the lower resolution of the art.","November 29, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Blackwell legacy proves that you should not judge a game by it's cover. I learned to enjoy the graphics over the course of the games. Everyone you meet has great character, especially Joey. The blooper reel alone was worthy payment for playing the game, but the notes system makes it all worthwhile. There are a few bugs where the sound clip does not match the text, or it does not play any at all, and there are some confusing puzzles that I would not have gotten without a tutorial. In the beginning puzzle, getting told no by your own character is very frustrating, and some other puzzles just don't seem right.

I love how even the minor characters feel fleshed out and real which creates an atmosphere of an actual world which gets shatters when you run into your first ghost.\n\nBlackwell Legacy is the first game and the least fleshed out in terms of gameplay, which is uninspirited. It's not bad, but it's no different from any other point-and-click already made.\n\nThe game is very short, you can beat it in about 2 hours. But for a $5 price tag that can go down as much as 90% during a major sale it's well worth your money\n\nA few tips:\n\n1) Joey can interact with babies, animals and interfers with electronics.\n\n2) People can lie, but usually 'fess up when you call them on it.\n\n3) If Rosa can't get somewhere, Joey can.\n\n4) Don't talk to Joey in public.\n\n5) If you get a name, try looking it up!

I'm a big point-and-click game fan, they serve up good stories, and can make you feel like a genius for figuring out puzzles. This game delivers both. The player-character, Rosangela, is a unique, relatable, character. Coupled with her 'lovable jerk', spirit guide, Joey. The story's intriguing, I really enjoyed the puzzles.\nThough there are some glitches, and it's understandably a small game.

This adventure is comparable with the good old ones I've played like Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2 or Kings Quest 5 and many others.\n\nThe controls are simple and solid. Just left or right-click things to interact or analyze them. You can't click that much objects so it doesn't get anoying like in other point and click adventures. Also you don't have that much items, so you don't have to try to combinate things for houers.\n\nThe graphics are very lovely in 320x240 resolutions and 256 colors. The background and characters could have been made a bit more detailed but the portraits in conversations are just beautiful.\n\nThe voice acting is okay, dialoges are interesting and sometimes funny. Also there are not much nonsense dialoges. The speach mechanism is nice because you have to choase "options" not just the words that will be spoken. You also have a notepad in which you have to combinate clues. Also you can ask some people about these clues on the notepad.\n\nThe puzzles are not that hard to solve but sometimes you have to listen carefully to know what you have to do know. (I just say: the dog). Also sometimes its not that clear where to go next but since there are just a small count of places to go, you will figure it out.\n\nThe story is lovely as well. You play a cute journalist named Rosanna who has just lost her aunt and should write an aritcle about a recent suicide in a college campus or so. After a while she meets a ghost named Joey who is telling Rosa that she's a medium and has to free ghosts that are confused and trapped in this world.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the ugly perspective problem. When someone walks into the background, they get blurry because there is no pixelate animation for walking away from the camera and getting smaller (you know, because of the perspective). This happens fortunately just in 2 or 3 scenes. This made a minus point in my rating.\n\nThere are sometimes little bugs like in one of the conversations with the security guard in the hospital or that the fusebox key doesn't have a transparent background in the inventory and just such little things (made a minus point in my rating)","June 24, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I'm saying is this, if you are going to play the Blackwell Legacy, you should probably consider getting the rest in the series.\n\nBefore giving my score, there is one other point I should bring up: The voice acting, it leaves a little bit to be desired. I'm not saying it is bad, just that there are some issues with the over-all sound quality. Some popping, and background noise is not out of the ordinary for this game. It is not a big issue, but it can be a little jaring to hear.\n\nSound issues aside, the presentation of this game works well and feels like a good point and click game.

As such, The Blackwell Legacy, being a game developed with the AGS engine, caught my attention, and, like many AGS games, gave me a somewhat nostalgic yet fresh experience.\n\nThe real meat of most AGS games would be the story, and The Blackwell Legacy's story does well to draw you in. You play the role of Rosa Blackwell, a freelance writer living in New York, whose aunt recently died. Her aunt's death impacts her far more than she initially imagined, and it basically leads her to investigate other cases that have occurred in the area. There's far more to the story than that, but I don't wish to spoil too much. It's essentially a mystery story with supernatural elements to it. The game does quite well to flesh out a bit about Rosa, her backstory, and those of some of her friends and family. The game did try to do a huge info-dump of backstory near the very beginning, which was quite tedious, as even the game's designer admits, but beyond that, the game paces itself okay. It's the first part of an episodic series, so it obviously feels you wanting more in the end, but as a first episode, it does it jobs of grabbing you into the series.\n\nThe gameplay is standard fare for most point-and-click adventure games, where you click on areas to move your characters, and click on items and people to interact with. As such, there's not really much to talk about. Unlike most adventure games, though, you don't really spend all your time using inventory items with objects/puzzles/people you see throughout the game,. Instead, you will collect information about people and events that occur through the game, and try to combine such information to help Rosa understand them to help progress the game. It's was a bit different, and while minor, was a good touch to differentiate it from many other adventure games, like the old Sierra ones.\n\nAGS games never really look technologically impressive in today's age; the graphics are pretty reminiscent of early to mid 90's adventure games, like King's Quest VI or Gabriel Knight. That is not to say the art is bad, though, as the artist of the game does really well to depict various places in New York quite well, like Washington Square Park. I haven't really been to much of New York in the past, but I've read elsewhere that the game does a good job of accurately depicting some of the areas there, which is cool.\n\nThe music was quite nice in some areas of the game. In particular, I really enjoyed the music at Washington Square Park, as it's rather calming, and compliments the park scenery very well. The voice acting was okay, for the most part, but I felt some characters lacked emotion in delivering their lines. The game's designer even commented that he felt some of the spoken lines didn't seem to convey the messages he was trying to send. Still, the voice acting wasn't horrible, so it doesn't really detract from the game, too much.\n\nSome of the cons about the game include the inability to delete or overwrite saves in-game. I was surprised to see that I created 3 saves of the same name when I played, as I had thought I simply overwrote an old save. You can simply delete the save files from the actual save directory on your computer, but it's just less convenient. Also, at times, the wrong voice-overs would pop up for certain lines in the game, which was kind of strange.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend trying this game out if you are a fan of graphic adventure games.","June 25, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robotdrama/recommended/80330/","robotdrama","Robot Drama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robotdrama/","63 products in account","The Blackwell Legacy was a flawed but very enjoyable point and click adventure.\n\nFirst off, the flaws:\n\nIt's definitely short, like many of Wadjeteye's games, but the plus side to this is that it's an accessible adventure with a plotline that can be finished for people who may not necessarily have the time or attention span to commit to a longer game.\n\nThe protagonist takes a bit of time to warm up to--in the first part of the game, she's not particularly likeable, and seems to be overly rude for no reason. This mostly changes after the first major plot reveal in the game, where Joey is introduced.\n\nFor the most part, the story was paced well. However, the game is split into two days that function like acts--the first day is primarily exposition. It's interesting and important, but it felt like the game took a little bit too much time to get to the supernatural focus of the plot. The first sequence where you are required to figure out how to get into your own apartment felt unnecessary and unconnected to the rest of the story.\n\nThe central focus of this game is advancing the plot and moving the character development forward. The puzzles don't come in a great variety--mostly just speaking to characters and piecing together clues from what they tell you, and using those clues to speak to other characters who will advance the plot forward.\n\nThe gameplay of the game itself isn't going to be as varied as some of the bigger classics of the point and click genre, but once you accept this it's a pretty engaging story with some enjoyable characters and charming dialogue. Joey, a ghost who hasn't been able to exchange his 1940's trench coat or his slang for something more modern, steals the show with his one-liners and provides a good relief from the otherwise serious plot. The plot is cliche'd--not venturing away from the familiar folklore of confused ghosts needing guidance to the next realm--but the game is self-aware of this and manages to make it interesting enough to be invested in the outcome anyway.\n\nAs far as representation goes, I appreciate Wadgeteye's decision to feature a female protagonist who moves beyond the damsel in distress/sexy action hero binary. While her standoffish attitude seems a bit unrealistic and unnecessary and her character is a little bit flat, Rosangela's character contains elements that give her more substance than most women in video games--she struggles with anxiety and stress, and is frequently socially awkward. I look forward to playing more games in order to see her character develop further. Representation of different ethnicities is present in the game, but is somewhat of a mixed bag. There is a supporting character who is an elderly Indian woman named Nishanti Sharma. For the most part, her portrayal avoids the typical lazy stereotypes about Indian women. She lives alone with her dog, cares sincerely about her neighbors, and defends people against gossip rather than partaking in it. On the other hand, the background music for her apartment is a loop track of drum and sitar music intended to sound Indian. This is the only location in the game where this music plays, so it has the effect of reminding the player that Sharma's ethnic background is different and less normative than the protagonist's.\n\nOverall I'd give the game a 3.5/5. The story, while cliched, was told well enough to make me want to finish the game. Joey has some pretty quotable lines that make a playthrough worthwhile, and it's nice to see a game where women have backstories and personalities, rather than just being part of the scenery or simply existing to move the plot forward.","July 2, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A shy, awkward and introverted young woman named Roseangela Blackwell (or Rosa for short) has recently lost her only surviving family member, but to her shock discovers she may have also inherited an unexpected family legacy and gift\n\nIt's probably the least strong game in the series, but is still enjoyable and a good intro to the series. The first puzzle can be irritating to some, (because the solution should be very simple but Rosa's low self confidence makes her refuse to take the direct approach forcing you to take a very roundabout one). However I felt it fit her character and high level of shyness given the situation, and as Rosa herself grumbles at one point "we can't all be social butterflies".\n\nThe characters, ghosts and humans alike, are believable, and likeable. The game has a good atmosphere,  and good voice acting too.\n\nIts medium (pun not intended) to short  in length,the other games (except prequel Unbound) are longer, but I don't feel this took away from this game at all.\n\nIn fact I'd recommend the whole series. Anyone who likes point and click adventures with great story telling and characters, should enjoy this series. It's also great to see the development of Rosa and Joey (Joey, although helpful, does seem slightly resentful of Rosa for not being Lauren in this game). How Joey gradually grows to respect and care about Rosa, instead of just being obliged/duty bound to help her, and how Rosa gains confidence and becomes bolder and more proactive in solving cases as the series develops is one of the things I love about it, the main and recurring characters (the main two especially) do mature, grow, and change as the games progress.  The over arcing plot also thickens and gets darker further into the series, and raises many questions  which both Rosa and Joey must find an answer despite the risks.\n\nThis series has become one of my favourites :)","April 1, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's actually a really short game.  Story is okay.  Might as well be an episode of Medium or Ghost Whisperer.  Or better yet.  It could have been an episode for a TV adaption of Sixth Sense.   Can't really say much without just straight out giving away everything.\n\nTips\n\nOpen ya notebook.   Click a name and you'll see it get written on the bottom.  Click another name and Rosa will try to pair the two.   Doing that is important.  It's a mechanic I just didn't know about.  Maybe that pop up might have mentioned it but I'm not sure as i double clicked and it vanished soon as it appeared.\n\nAt ya apartment talk to ya spirit guide until ya exhaust all things to talk about.  One of those items will have important use.\n\nExamine everything in ya inventory when ya get it.  You can't drag and drop items outside of the inventory.  The items in ya inventory can interact with each other.  Not many of them though.\n\nAnimation was pretty nice.  Everything about the game reminds me of DOS days.   Some of the dialogue is a little corny.  Like  Barry's  "Master of unlocking"  line in Resident Evil.\n\nVoice acting is kind of meh.  Sort of dry for my tastes.  Feels too much like they are just reading the lines off a page.  Didn't really connect with these characters much.\n\nIn the end its a point and click mystery game with a really short play time.  Again, I only spent so much in the game cause I didn't understand the notebook mechanic and that apparently one of the questions you ask needs to be asked again to get even more information.   Not sure its worth the price of 5 bux.  But if you can grab it when its on sale like I did (summer sale had the whole series for like 3 bux)  then go for it.  Just don't expect any elaborate story archs.  It's one tiny intro mystery for our heroine to solve and thats it.

This is something that I like as i rarely find the time to actually finish a game if they are longer than this. Being able to get through it in one sitting meant that I could actually finsh the game and complete the story and not have it sitting in my Steam library for the rest of time mocking my lack of attention span.\n\nThe premise of the story is good and the writing has not let the concept down.  The characters are interesting and the universe that it is set in promted me to want to learn more about it.  This being the first game in the series I hope that as the stories progress we find out more about the main protagonists and why they interact as they do.  The beginning puzzles are not particulary hard but there a few annoying ones at the end that are timed.  There was one non-obvious one which I used a walkthough for (I don't have the patience for a game where I get stuck for a long time - I prefer to look at a walkthough and continue on so that I get more story before my attention inevitably drifts somehwre else).  There were also a couple of annoying timed puzzles towards the end which I could have done without but got through eventually.  The ending was a bit hokey but the story concluded satisfactorily.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game as the story is good and the puzzles seem to make logical sense when completing them.  I picked it up cheap and I think it was well worth the price for 3 hours of gameplay and story.","July 12, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While each individual episode of the Blackwell games isn’t that long, they are incredibly deep, have great writing, and interesting concepts all around. The basic story, regardless of which one you’re playing, is you belong to a family of mediums and your ever-present spectral partner in crime is there to back you up.\n\nOften you have to seek out spirits that are having difficulty coming to terms with death and need assistance in passing on. The characters, writing, artwork, and even voice acting make these titles shine in a way that really makes you nostalgic for older, more contemporary adventure games. Wadjeteye is definitely a company to watch for this reason alone.","March 16, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm so glad I bought it, I've thoroughly enjoyed this episode and can hardly wait to play the others!\n\nWithout giving too much away, I'll say that I absolutely loved Joey's dialogue, personality and the dialogue he shared with Rosa. The storyline is pretty good, but it's a rather short episode. So, if you do buy this one and enjoy it, I think you might want to buy the other episodes as well so you can get the full experience; because five hours of gameplay for just one episode just isn't enough!\n\nThere is one complaint that I have, though; if I leave the game running idly for awhile, I'd come back and then the speech bubbles are skipped altogether. So I'd be forced to quit and restart that part just so I can catch what had been said.\nOtherwise, the game runs smoothly so long as you don't sit idle for too long. One other minor complaint I have is the saving system. You type in your name and save...and there's a file for every time you save, as opposed to overwriting just one file.\nBut, if you just pick the most recent file, you'll get your most current position.\n\nThis game was a lot of fun and really addictive.\n\nIf you're a fan of detective or ghost stories, you'll enjoy these games!","March 16, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Understandable, sure, but lighten' up will ya!?\n\nHowever, considering that in the next installments she will be much more likeable and kind of interesting, I'd say give it a shot and see if you like it: if you hate this first game, you might like the next, or can always stop here.\n\nI recommend it.","February 7, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Legacy is short (think like the Telltale episodic games) but packs a cool story of paranormal investigation into its time. Some of the puzzles are a little obtuse, not so much because of the concept but the details of how to use the game tools to accomplish it. I got the RADICAL SATAN ENDING rather than the "good ending" because the game doesn't really do anything to communicate when items are placed in your inventory or concepts placed in your notebook.

The game is old. it looks lik ♥♥♥♥, and changing the resolution is hard but its a very interesting story. Its a basic point and click adventure game where you solve mini puzzles to get to the next part. The story is pretty good and I wanted to know what happens next. Its short but it doesnt outstay its welcome. It has me intrigued about the rest of the games.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are pretty intuitive but the last two follow videogame logic to a T. They are just weird and walkthroughs might be necessary. Aditionally, you cant move on and do certain things unless you have some dialog with people which is annoying at times. There is a great notes system which allows you to create new notes and its pretty damn good.","February 22, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This part exists mostly to get you familar with the characters Joey and Rosa. That in itself is the biggest problem; other than getting to know the main characters, there is not much else to this game. What I'm saying is this, if you are going to play the Blackwell Legacy, you should probably consider getting the rest in the series.\n\nBefore giving my score, there is one other point I should bring up: The voice acting, it leaves a little bit to be desired. I'm not saying it is bad, just that there are some issues with the over-all sound quality. Some popping, and background noise is not out of the ordinary for this game. It is not a big issue, but it can be a little jaring to hear.\n\nSound issues aside, the presentation of this game works well and feels like a good point and click game. However, you should only buy this if you have the money to spend on the other parts afterwards.\n\n7/10\n\n\n\n","June 25, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As such, The Blackwell Legacy, being a game developed with the AGS engine, caught my attention, and, like many AGS games, gave me a somewhat nostalgic yet fresh experience.\n\nThe real meat of most AGS games would be the story, and The Blackwell Legacy's story does well to draw you in. You play the role of Rosa Blackwell, a freelance writer living in New York, whose aunt recently died. Her aunt's death impacts her far more than she initially imagined, and it basically leads her to investigate other cases that have occurred in the area. There's far more to the story than that, but I don't wish to spoil too much. It's essentially a mystery story with supernatural elements to it. The game does quite well to flesh out a bit about Rosa, her backstory, and those of some of her friends and family. The game did try to do a huge info-dump of backstory near the very beginning, which was quite tedious, as even the game's designer admits, but beyond that, the game paces itself okay. It's the first part of an episodic series, so it obviously feels you wanting more in the end, but as a first episode, it does it jobs of grabbing you into the series.\n\nThe gameplay is standard fare for most point-and-click adventure games, where you click on areas to move your characters, and click on items and people to interact with. As such, there's not really much to talk about. Unlike most adventure games, though, you don't really spend all your time using inventory items with objects/puzzles/people you see throughout the game,. Instead, you will collect information about people and events that occur through the game, and try to combine such information to help Rosa understand them to help progress the game. It's was a bit different, and while minor, was a good touch to differentiate it from many other adventure games, like the old Sierra ones.\n\nAGS games never really look technologically impressive in today's age; the graphics are pretty reminiscent of early to mid 90's adventure games, like King's Quest VI or Gabriel Knight. That is not to say the art is bad, though, as the artist of the game does really well to depict various places in New York quite well, like Washington Square Park. I haven't really been to much of New York in the past, but I've read elsewhere that the game does a good job of accurately depicting some of the areas there, which is cool.\n\nThe music was quite nice in some areas of the game. In particular, I really enjoyed the music at Washington Square Park, as it's rather calming, and compliments the park scenery very well. The voice acting was okay, for the most part, but I felt some characters lacked emotion in delivering their lines. The game's designer even commented that he felt some of the spoken lines didn't seem to convey the messages he was trying to send. Still, the voice acting wasn't horrible, so it doesn't really detract from the game, too much.\n\nSome of the cons about the game include the inability to delete or overwrite saves in-game. I was surprised to see that I created 3 saves of the same name when I played, as I had thought I simply overwrote an old save. You can simply delete the save files from the actual save directory on your computer, but it's just less convenient. Also, at times, the wrong voice-overs would pop up for certain lines in the game, which was kind of strange.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend trying this game out if you are a fan of graphic adventure games.","June 25, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it feels a bit dated in 2014, The Blackwell Legacy is fairly impressive early outing for Wadjet Eye games, and should be appreciated by fans of classic point and click adventure games.\n\nThe story, which is one half supernatural and one half sleuthing, is compelling from start to end, and sets up what I'm assuming will be an excellent four-part series of games.  Noteably, the entire game is fully voiced, and reasonabley well at that.\n\nA couple of the puzzles are fairly obtuse, and the game isn't really forthcoming about how its "notes" system works, however once you grok the basic fundamentals of Blackwell's note-based puzzles, it becomes a relatively smooth ride.\n\nAs a final note, I finished the game in roughly three hours, which might come off as a bit short to some people.... but for the price tag, it's worth it in my opinion.","January 9, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only wanted something new to play, I couldn't get my head wrapped around any of the games I had in my possession, and it was at a good price.\nThe Blackwell games give you an extremely cute, intriguing, point-and-click adventure. I'm a big point-and-click game fan, they serve up good stories, and can make you feel like a genius for figuring out puzzles. This game delivers both. The player-character, Rosangela, is a unique, relatable, character. Coupled with her 'lovable jerk', spirit guide, Joey. The story's intriguing, I really enjoyed the puzzles.\nThough there are some glitches, and it's understandably a small game.

It has a sort of old school feel for the nostalgic and great main characters to keep you interested in the story. The concept is interesting and is a nice change from the usual ghost stories we find.\n\nIf you're looking for a scary story, this game isn't up your alley. There's not that much suspense till later in the games and even then it's all family friendly (in a good way; Like Don Bluth's old films.). It's also not a great mystery thriller either; it's an adventure following a woman and her ghost and helping other ghosts into the light (insert Ghost Whisperer joke here.). Keep in mind that it is an ADVENTURE game, that means get ready for random clicking, wanders, and over complicated puzzles. Also sadly, most the side characters are forgettable, but Blackwell's saving grace is the two main characters and the concept, while I don't feel was played out to the fullest, was an interesting one. I don't regret playing Blackwell and seriously recommend it to others who like games like Monkey Island.","May 8, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This adventure is comparable with the good old ones I've played like Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2 or Kings Quest 5 and many others.\n\nThe controls are simple and solid. Just left or right-click things to interact or analyze them. You can't click that much objects so it doesn't get anoying like in other point and click adventures. Also you don't have that much items, so you don't have to try to combinate things for houers.\n\nThe graphics are very lovely in 320x240 resolutions and 256 colors. The background and characters could have been made a bit more detailed but the portraits in conversations are just beautiful.\n\nThe voice acting is okay, dialoges are interesting and sometimes funny. Also there are not much nonsense dialoges. The speach mechanism is nice because you have to choase "options" not just the words that will be spoken. You also have a notepad in which you have to combinate clues. Also you can ask some people about these clues on the notepad.\n\nThe puzzles are not that hard to solve but sometimes you have to listen carefully to know what you have to do know. (I just say: the dog). Also sometimes its not that clear where to go next but since there are just a small count of places to go, you will figure it out.\n\nThe story is lovely as well. You play a cute journalist named Rosanna who has just lost her aunt and should write an aritcle about a recent suicide in a college campus or so. After a while she meets a ghost named Joey who is telling Rosa that she's a medium and has to free ghosts that are confused and trapped in this world.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the ugly perspective problem. When someone walks into the background, they get blurry because there is no pixelate animation for walking away from the camera and getting smaller (you know, because of the perspective). This happens fortunately just in 2 or 3 scenes. This made a minus point in my rating.\n\nThere are sometimes little bugs like in one of the conversations with the security guard in the hospital or that the fusebox key doesn't have a transparent background in the inventory and just such little things (made a minus point in my rating)","June 24, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dialogue options are usually inconsequential, and there seems to only ever be one way to solve any problem. The player is not allowed to be creative, but must be able to think of abstract and often unintuitive ways of surmounting obstacles.\n\nHaving said all that, this game still has an intriguing plot, with engaging characters and voice acting. It's a bit like reading a mystery novel where sometimes the next chapter is inaccessible until you imagine a way to solve a problem from the previous chapter (or, occasionally, look up a walkthrough on the internet). The Blackwell Legacy had a few thought provoking moments, and made me want to put up with its clunkiness for long enough to experience the whole story. If you're into that kind of thing: give it a go - it's only $5. I suppose the game did entertain me for a couple of hours.","March 28, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Point-and-click adventure games have always been a vexing genre to me. On the one hand, I find myself enjoying the storylines quite a bit, as they seem like that's where most of the effort in making the game goes. That's fine and all, but oftentimes, the puzzles receive the short end of the stick as far as the design attention goes. When I wrote the review for The Walking Dead game (the first long form review I did), I mentioned that one of the things I enjoyed most about the game was the fact that the puzzles made sense. They may not have actually worked in the real world, but they made enough sense nevertheless.\n\nMost point-and-click adventure games that I've played have puzzles that don't make all that much sense. The adventure game purist's perpsective seems to be that having these puzzles adds to the gameplay, making it so that the game doesn't just last an hour and a half or whatever it may be. If this is not your position and you are an "adventure game purist", forgive the potential strawman attack, but I don't really feel like the typical adventure game puzzle should be like this. With respect to the Blackwell Legacy, it's a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nOne of the things that the game does to shake up the formula a bit is introduce the system of a notebook, in which you can link various topics to proceed in the game. There are some usages that do work and do make sense, such as linking a first name without a last name with a last name without a first name. However, there are some implementations that don't work. For instance, there is one puzzle in which you have to link two names together. I had already figured out the puzzle, but since I didn't use the right dialogue option with the right person, the game wouldn't let me actually solve the puzzle  the right way. This had me stuck for about an hour.\n\nFortunately, there are very few inventory puzzles in the game, but again, those puzzles are often quite obtuse and farfetched in nature. Regarding the stability of the game, there is a way to reliably make it crash (at least in version 1.7), where if you click outside of the notebook when you have it pulled up, the game will crash. This isn't too big of a deal, but it's just something worth noting that you probably shouldn't do that. The game autosaves every time you go to the world map, so if you do accidentally crash the game, you shouldn't lose too much progress.\n\nApart from the puzzles, there really isn't much else to this game. Again, puzzles are sort of a mixed bunch in this game with regard to quality. However, the puzzles weren't anything that really blew me away in cleverness, so I'll give this game a 6/10 for the gameplay.\n\nStory: The main draw of the game, obviously. The series is quasi-episodic in nature, with this being the first in the series (I really wish they introduced a numbering to the games, but oh well). It definitely does feel like the first thing in a series, but that's not to say that it's necessarily bad or unenjoyable. I found myself enjoying the characters introduced thus far, and the writing lends a very believable nature to them. The premise is quite good as well; of course, I won't talk too much in-depth on that, since that's the whole point of getting the game. Overall, I give the writing and story an 8/10 for a cast of very enjoyable characters and an interesting enough premise to base a series off of.\n\nGraphics: A bit of an odd one. It seems to fluctuate between a few different styles of art; the facial features of Rosangela and Joey in-game don't really look anything like they do on the title screen, and nobody's facial features look ANYTHING like the ones shown in pictures. In fact, I'd go as far as saying the faces in the pictures are potentially more unsettling than the premise. None of it is bad, but the lack of a consistent art style can be a bit jarring. This is an Adventure Game Studio game, so if you can run Steam, you'll be able to run this game. Also, since this is an AGS game, there is the winsetup.exe file in the root directory of the game. Alt-Entering doesn't pull you out of fullscreen (which it fullscreens in 640x480 and looks not so great on a 16:9 monitor), but using winsetup.exe will allow you to run it windowed. With technical aspects being pointless to rate, we are left with the pretty good but still sometimes inconsistent art style, leading me to give this game a 3/5 for graphics.\n\nSound: They definitely have a good composer on staff for this game. There's definitely a few songs from this game that I wouldn't mind putting on my MP3 player. If I had to pick a favorite song from the game, I'd pick the intro song. It just does everything right for me. Regarding the voice acting, it's not bad for an Indie game. There were a few voices that I wasn't expecting for certain characters, but oftentimes in real life people look nothing like what they sound like, so it's not too big of a deal. There were a few lines that did feel kinda forced, but that didn't ruin my enjoyment all that much. Another issue I noted, specifically with Joey's voice actor, is that it seems like sometimes they record without a pop filter. This may not be the case, but it is definitely noticeable on a few lines. For a very good OST and some pretty good but not perfect VAs, I'll give this game a 3/5 for the audio.\n\nOverall scores are 6/8/3/3; Cumulative score of 6.7/10. While the gameplay may not have left me with the greatest impression for puzzles to come, the story has given me good impressions for what's to come for the adventures of Rosangela and Joey. So far, I'd say to pick up the Blackwell Collection when it's on sale, but $5 isn't bad for a decently put together adventure game.","June 9, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The supposed options you have to overcome a problem are sometimes borderline ridiculous (e.g. the teenager guarding the door).\nThe story itself is actually interesting, and there are several relatively novel - or at least uncommon - aspects to it... but it's not worth the trouble!\nTo be honest, I quit relatively soon.

The story is that some chick named Rosa just lost her aunt, the only family she had. She's a reporter for some small time newspaper when she discovers that she's a medium between the living and the dead. She finds out that her grandma and aunt both had some Samuel Spade 1940s gumshoe type ghost following them around helping them get lost souls over to the afterlife until they both went insane. So they go around trying to solve murders and help the spirits of the deceased move on.  It's an ok hook, but the game feels more like Nancy Drew than hard-boild film noir.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beeedup/recommended/80330/","beeedup","no shirt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beeedup/","492 products in account","Ever since I noticed it in my games library, something kept pulling me toward playing The Blackwell Legacy. I'm not sure what it was. Maybe the art style? I'm kind of a sucker for pixely AGS games. Maybe the excitement of having a multi-part narrative experience? After all, I love the episodic Telltale games and Kentucky Route Zero. I don't know what drew me to The Blackwell Legacy, but I've just finished the first installment and I wasn't super impressed.\n\nThis isn't to say that I didn't like the game--as is the case with most adventure games there were really only a couple of things I really *disliked* about the game, and they were silly puzzles. For the most part, though, the puzzle mechanics, which often involve using an in-game notebook of "clues" that trigger dialog options, were particularly fun to play around with. But overall, the experience didn't grab me like other point-and-click adventure games have in the past (for me, Yahtzee's Chzo mythos games stand out the most).\n\nWhile playing The Blackwell Legacy, I didn't have any of the laugh-out-loud moments, goosebump-/tear-inducing emotional moments, or "I'm so proud of myself for solving this clever puzzle" moments that have characterized this genre for me. My experience playing The Blackwell Legacy was, in all honesty, kind of boring. And yet there's still something about the story that makes me want to continue playing the Blackwell games, so even though The Blackwell Legacy didn't make a strong impression on me, I'm completely willing to keep going with the series. The Blackwell Legacy probably works well for what it is: a writer's early attempt at creating the introduction to what seems to be an ambitious series.\n\nSome other noteworthy aspects of this game include the visuals/sound design and the commentary tracks. The game looks great. The settings and character animations are really impressive, and they were definitely instrumental in keeping me playing the game. Similarly, the sound design was pretty well done. All of the lines are voice-acted, which is great since most of the voice actors are actually good at what they do. More often than not I would actually sit and listen to the complete dialog rather than skipping through it and simply reading the text.\n\nFinally, the commentary tracks. Normally I wouldn't think to comment on some weird, optional aspect of a game like this, but I feel like the commentary tracks revealed a couple of interesting things to me. The commentary gave an insight into the game creator's personality, and that's something I'm really interested in. I like to connect unique game narratives with unique personalities. I do the same thing with the creators of music and movies, too. But there was something about Dave Gilbert's personality in the commentary that just seemed so at-odds with the tone and attitude of the game, I had a hard time listening to all of his commentary (I skipped some of it). On the plus side, the commentary tracks verified a lot of my suspicions that the game maybe didn't represent the creator's best work. In the commentary, Gilbert often critiques his design choices, which is both really interesting and heartening. I expect that the other Blackwell games will be better than the first.\n\nIn conclusion, my biggest takeaway from The Blackwell Legacy is the ability to look in on the process of creating a video game. That kind of insight has always been interesting to me. In this way, The Blackwell Legacy seems like a sort of prototype game. I expect the next games in the series to really improve on the first.","January 8","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main issue is that by the time you get to the "action" of the story, you're already halfway through the game, and it isn't terribly long to begin with. However what it does do is establish the mechanics and purpose of the rest of the series, so it's definitely a necessary introduction. My favorite part of the whole game is the dialogue options, the writing is absolutely on point, and it allows you to inject your own personality into the main character, without breaking the defintion that the author has given them. The plot itself is also engrossing, and I wouldn't have trouble recommending this to anyone.","October 7, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I put the thumbs down for it and called it a day. I have now played though 4 of the 5 Blackwell games (the four that come in a bundle) and would now say that I was relatively pleased with the series. The first game was on a very small budget as Wadjet Eye games was just starting out (the only other game out was The Shivah). I have left my old review up about this game. And while I still dislike many of the elements of the first installment, this game does lay the ground work for some fun future installments and a pretty good series. I give the series a 7.8/10 overall.\n\nOld Review:\nI wish there was a maybe button for reviews. I personally did not enjoy the game very much. There were too many things that I did not like about it. Some might like the style and actually enjoy the game, so here were my pro's and con's.\n\nPro's: Good storyline, Interesting Characters\n\nCon's: Puzzles were too easy, only two functions for the game (not like a classic point and click, i.e. Look At, Pick Up, Push, Pull, Talk To), the game was too short, and the art was not that great (game looked like it was made in the 1990's instead of 2006, but look at the pictures and decide for yourself).\n\nSome people love shorter games with easier puzzles. And if you really like mystery, then this might be the game for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beeedup/recommended/80330/","beeedup","no shirt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beeedup/","492 products in account","Ever since I noticed it in my games library, something kept pulling me toward playing The Blackwell Legacy. I'm not sure what it was. Maybe the art style? I'm kind of a sucker for pixely AGS games. Maybe the excitement of having a multi-part narrative experience? After all, I love the episodic Telltale games and Kentucky Route Zero. I don't know what drew me to The Blackwell Legacy, but I've just finished the first installment and I wasn't super impressed.\n\nThis isn't to say that I didn't like the game--as is the case with most adventure games there were really only a couple of things I really *disliked* about the game, and they were silly puzzles. For the most part, though, the puzzle mechanics, which often involve using an in-game notebook of "clues" that trigger dialog options, were particularly fun to play around with. But overall, the experience didn't grab me like other point-and-click adventure games have in the past (for me, Yahtzee's Chzo mythos games stand out the most).\n\nWhile playing The Blackwell Legacy, I didn't have any of the laugh-out-loud moments, goosebump-/tear-inducing emotional moments, or "I'm so proud of myself for solving this clever puzzle" moments that have characterized this genre for me. My experience playing The Blackwell Legacy was, in all honesty, kind of boring. And yet there's still something about the story that makes me want to continue playing the Blackwell games, so even though The Blackwell Legacy didn't make a strong impression on me, I'm completely willing to keep going with the series. The Blackwell Legacy probably works well for what it is: a writer's early attempt at creating the introduction to what seems to be an ambitious series.\n\nSome other noteworthy aspects of this game include the visuals/sound design and the commentary tracks. The game looks great. The settings and character animations are really impressive, and they were definitely instrumental in keeping me playing the game. Similarly, the sound design was pretty well done. All of the lines are voice-acted, which is great since most of the voice actors are actually good at what they do. More often than not I would actually sit and listen to the complete dialog rather than skipping through it and simply reading the text.\n\nFinally, the commentary tracks. Normally I wouldn't think to comment on some weird, optional aspect of a game like this, but I feel like the commentary tracks revealed a couple of interesting things to me. The commentary gave an insight into the game creator's personality, and that's something I'm really interested in. I like to connect unique game narratives with unique personalities. I do the same thing with the creators of music and movies, too. But there was something about Dave Gilbert's personality in the commentary that just seemed so at-odds with the tone and attitude of the game, I had a hard time listening to all of his commentary (I skipped some of it). On the plus side, the commentary tracks verified a lot of my suspicions that the game maybe didn't represent the creator's best work. In the commentary, Gilbert often critiques his design choices, which is both really interesting and heartening. I expect that the other Blackwell games will be better than the first.\n\nIn conclusion, my biggest takeaway from The Blackwell Legacy is the ability to look in on the process of creating a video game. That kind of insight has always been interesting to me. In this way, The Blackwell Legacy seems like a sort of prototype game. I expect the next games in the series to really improve on the first.","January 8","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other than that it is a great adventure game. Maybe under utilizing the inventory but imho compensating for it with other unique features. There are some bugs in the dialogues I am not sure if any of them is causing deadlocks yet. Sadly the GNU/Linux variants of games don't seem to get as much attention by the devs. as the windows version. So far I experienced that with several games on steam and I do understand that fixing Bugs on GNU/Linux will not make you rich but in my opinion it is only fair to supply a bug free version for everyone and to not strip features from any of the versions. 4/5\n\nUpdate:  Just played through and I liked it. The game is short but you are likely to be able to buy it cheap so that ratio seems balanced. The Voice acting is amazing and the writing is great. The art style is not the lazy and ugly kind of pixel art but is a nice and beautiful style. Most importantly the animations are ok which really helps make the game beautiful.

It was the story that pushed me through. I enjoy mystery/detective games since I started playing Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney when I was in high school.\n\nThe story and the way you solve things out are amusing and fun to do for me. I thought the premise with the Blackwells were interesting.","May 11","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am SO glad I did. This is the first, and they just get better and better with each one. I definitely recommend all 5 games to anyone who enjoys point and click adventure.

The game is a bit short, can be finished in 2-2.5 hours.\n\nMy only issue was that the game often went weird whenever I manually saved, opened the Steam overlay or Alt+Tabbed; it started skipping all the dialogues, and didn't stop until I rebooted the game. But as I realised you don't need the manual save option anyway, the Autosave is enough.\n\nEdit: Though I only replayed it with the commentaries because of the achievement, they were actually quite interesting, even though a bit longwinded.","December 21, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The games aren't particularly difficult and the (good) voice actors are the same as in every other Wadjet Eye game, but the story is awesome and the artwork is consistently great. The addition of simple, intuitive controls and a nice soundtrack make this one of my favourite adventure series.","May 5","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's short, sweet, straightforward, and it sets off a good start for the rest of games in the series. Writing's pretty okay, and the story was engaging enough for me to get through it. There were also some shoddy character portraits and occasionally sub-par voice acting, but the narrative made up for it.","October 14, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Steam achievements are things you actually have to aim for (as opposed to adventure games by, say, Telltale Games, where "making it to the next chapter" counts as an achievement).\nThe ending was a little idk, but there is enough here to make me want to play the next game in the series.","April 5","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole series is worth playing, and this is the logical beginning.\n\nSome of the later games have better-designed puzzles and gameplay, but the essential structure is already there. The characters are interesting and New York is represented quite accurately - although from an introvert's perspective. The game is very straightforward and is almost over before it begins, but a cool commentary track - actually two different ones -extend the life span. After that, there are four more Blackwell games to play. (The next one is Unbound, if you didn't know.)\n\n8/10","June 2","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
