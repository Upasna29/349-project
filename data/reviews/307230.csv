Unfortunately the game mechanics are very imprecise - you have to guess how far enemies can see, how much damage they cause, the zombie AI tends to get stuck, obstacles are seen from an isometric perspective and thus often don't provide cover even though they block your view etc. The result is that challenge equals trial and error in this game. The price is the only thing that is fair about this game.\n\nStill, I've definitely played worse games.

But how this game looks like? It is 2D game, you are zombie, you are outnumbered by civilians and soldiers. Your goal is to convince everyone to become zombie, usually by biting. Civilians are cowards, so they just run, but soldiers are brave and they have guns. You have to be smart and always try to outnumber your enemies. You can give simple orders to your small zombie army and develop new tactics.\nGame is simple, but enjoyable, graphic and music are ok - it is indie production after all. Flaws?

A game for casual gamers, where you can control your very own army of Zombies and cause havoc? I am game!\n\nSo, you have your very own little zombie and you are given your first tutorial mission. This mission is just to be sure that you know how to use the directional keys and understand the basic concept that if you are a zombie and try to close to an unarmed human, they will run from you. And if for some reason you manage to stand just long enough next to them, well.... yey, you just made a new zombie friend.\n\nAfter the tutorial and the first couple of levels, you realise what I,Zombie will be all about -  a combination of a stealth / puzzler game, with a brief touch of RTS. All in all, it is a relatively short game, with only 20 levels. However, level design is solid. It has a nice learning curve and level difficulty increases gradually.\n\nThe soundtrack, in its never ending loop combines well with I,Zombie , and the visuals are quite nice for this little game. I particularly like the main zombie design, as it sort of reminds me a Tim Burton meets Simpsons combination. Oh well, Danny Elfman had already set that link before, so perhaps that concept isn't so far fetched.\n\n\nIn short, these are the things I can point out as positive in I,Zombie - The concept, level design, the soundtrack and the main little zombie. Seems like we are heading for a masterpiece!\n\nNow the painful bit....\n\nThe first thing I have noticed after initial seconds of gameplay was that there controls weren't very responsive. There seems to be a lag between hitting a button and the character acting on it, and it becomes incredibly frustrating playing throughout levels of stealth without really knowing where your character's movement will end. I came to realise that as you lower the resolution, I,Zombie will run faster and the commands will become more responsive... but at this point I have started questioning myself if I it was fair to expect having fluidity issues with a Unity based game. However, lowering the resolution will reduce the game window, and if you fall lower than 800 x 600, I would recommend that you play it through with the aid of a magnifying glass.\n\nApart from unresponsive controls, I have often struggled with basic movement. More often than not, my little Zombie would get stuck on the edge of a box or some other obstacle, without being very clear why.\n\nThe combination of broken controls with some movement issues turned almost every level into a trial an error experience. And whereas in the first couple of levels I was still going for the 3 stars rating, the frustration soon took over me and my main goal became powering through the 20 levels I,Zombie had to offer.\n\nEventually I had another go in reaching max stars and beating I,Zombie in less than 15 minutes, in order to complete the achievements. Unfortunately this ended up as another disappointment, as for some reason they still appear as "incomplete"\n\nApart from the nice basic visuals, I,Zombie also had a couple of graphic glitches as the constant flickering of white lines all over the place or the glitchy rain effects (which seem completely unnecessary and don't bring any added value to the game).\n\nTo sum up, it is a nice game, with a nice concept and ideas and solid map building. However, the several flaws it has turn what should be an enjoyable game into a frustrating experience. At some point you have to wonder if the fact it is so short is actually a thing for it or against it.\n\nHowever, I do think that the price is fair an is often on steam sales. If you are curious, by all means get it, but don't expect a masterpiece.\n\nNote to the developers: I am quite sure you have put quite an effort into it, please don't see my review as just someone taking a shot at you. I can see that there are plenty of people recommending I,Zombie... I am just not one of them :)","February 25","false","4.5"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","26","36","0","2"

So those that got helmets on are going to shoot you and those with ordinary hats you are going to bite to get zombies to command (stop, follow , attack)...\nPersonally I think it is a bit strange that the game were not originally tagged as a strategy game also as I think that though "arcade" like then strategy is needed IMO (I see that later it now has been tagged as strategy also).\nOtherwise, I haven't played the game that long but it seem worth a try and the small price to pay..\nGame is with indie / retro style graphics and while it may look relatively simple then it is probably not that easy.......","December 9, 2014","true","0.2"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","2"

Never heard of them.) and adding fun nuances along the way, the game doesn't disappoint. Simple controls make the game quick to learn but later levels prove that the game is far from easy.\n\nOverall, a great twist on the zombie genre and a great game. It combines the feeling of frustration every time you lose to that one, damn, evil, HORRIBLE F***ING SOLDIER, and the joy when one of your minions bites off that EVIL SOLDIER'S head.\nSo, the game is a must-have for any zombie fan.

Little bugs, such as zombies stopping once in while around corners or immortality when soldiers are attacking you near top right corner where your health bar is (there is one level when you can alone deal with 2 soldiers this way).\nBut, at least for me, little things like that doesn't matter.

Rather than an all out assault much of I, Zombie is about positioning and sneak attacks as enemies have a limited field of vision but can still kill you quickly if they spot you far away. I loved getting the drop on patrolling guards and seeing my numbers grow, maneuvering my horde with a limited but effective number of commands as I infected every moving thing in the level. I, Zombie's biggest problem, again, is that it takes this mechanic and tries to do too much too quickly.\n\nWith only 20 very short levels (usually under two minutes if you do things right) there's very little time for the game to capitalize on its mechanics, peppering in different ideas throughout without giving them enough attention. It keeps the hour long experience varied, but I never felt as if the level designs were making much use of the enjoying ideas the game presents, merely showing some basic examples of how they work so you know how to use them before the difficulty catapults upward. Many of the later levels require infuriating amounts of precision to complete, often requiring you to follow an absolute line to get through them, and any deviation resulting in your very quick death. The final level in particular is such a poorly designed embodiment of trial and error that I ended up having to resort to watching a level walkthrough, and even then still had a great amount of trouble actually pulling it off.\n\nI, Zombie is entertaining for what it is, but more often than not its attempts to make more interesting use of its mechanics is simply by raising the challenge in cheap and frustrating ways. I'd love to see the core of the experience spun out into a larger and more ambitious game, but for now it acts more as a proof of concept than something I can recommend.","December 9, 2014","false","1.1"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","27","51","0","0"

Early levels are pretty straightforward, the later levels tend to require a bit more planning of where to go and when, plus along the way there are a few tips and tricks you can pick up of how to manage your fellow zombies.\n\nYour resources for each level are yourself - faster than the rest, and you control yourself directly with the cursor keys (or probably gamepad, haven't tried and the keys worked fine for me), and the zombies you have turned in the level so far which can be set to follow you, stay where they are, or attack the nearest non-zombie. Once you learn how to manage your brethren they can be used as a shield to cover your approach to a patrolling soldier, a distraction to let you get in closer before being shot at, or set up to attack the other of a pair of patrolling soldiers that are too far apart to just rush from one side. Your comrades can be a bit annoying and snag on the scenery occasionally, and they are really annoying to try and get past the sentry guns intact when a level requires that, but apart from those things the game plays pretty smoothly.\n\nOnce you have completed a level and survived you can move onto the next level, or replay it and try to find a way to complete the level without any zombies dying in the process, thus earning three stars. There are twenty levels (plus a training mission) to work through, and particularly the last half of them tend to be interesting and may take a while to figure out a good plan of attack, or get the timing right. Once that is done there is also potentially a bit of replayability trying to find a faster route to win each level, but beyond that it is not really the sort of game you will go back to again, as once you know how to do each level there isn't much more to gain from it. But it is quite fun to go through that one first time.","March 27, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No matter if you use the keyboard or the mouse to move your character, you'll always get stuck somewhere, mainly near the edges and this can be pretty annoying.\nI think that with few more work on the movements this can be a nicer and more playable game, i can recommend it only if you have a bit of endurance.\n","December 17, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At least ten or more levels would've been nice. The game is so short that i've managed to get only one steam trading card dropped out of available 3.\n\nA little buggy. In some levels where you have to get through small spaces, zombie tends to stuck out of nowhere.\n\nAlso that, "you cannot eat the guards" levels are just annoying. I mean we're playing a zombie game, we should be able to eat everyones brains. Grrrrrr.\n\nApart from all these things i wrote above, i recommend this game for a half hour fun time.","January 12","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics, music and sound are okay and everything fits together. There are multiple options for the controls. You can play with Mouse, Keyboard and Controller or combine them. All 3 options work pretty fine.\n\nOne annoying flaw is, that you can easily get stuck on obstacles which slows down your movement. So if you're not precise enough and you try to take a sharp corner, you will get slowed and gunned down. But hey, just take it as a challenge and work on your precision.","December 6, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found with a controller, movement and control is fairly smooth.\n- For the $2 price tag (49 cents on sale) the arcade-style graphics and sound are excellent.\n- For the basic game, replayability is very limited, unless you are going for 3 stars on each level and some achievements or leaderboard stats. However, as there is a level editor, and a community creating new levels, this greatly increases the playtime you will get out of this game.\n- Trading Cards!  Achievements! Leaderboards! Yay!\n- The dev for this game is fantastic.  Very accessible, responsive, positive, professional and will work to resolve any issue you might have.

You are looking at 1-3 hours depending on how skilled and *lucky* you are. The main source of annoyance from this game is the zombie AI. The zombie AI pathing is either passable or awful-- the zombies get stuck on random things alot of the time, causing you to fail. The art is okay, just your typical mobile game 2D style. I am just glad this game isn't pixelated because I am getting sick of pixelated games. The levels are either stupidly easy or unbearably unfair and difficult. Overall this game is really short and really "meh" in my honest opinion. The idea of it is really interesting but unfortunately nothing unique and/or *FUN* is done with it. This is a good game to play if you want to pass the time, but if you plan on passing them there are MUCH better mobile games out there.\n5/10.

This looks to be an almost decent excuse for the game, made for either tablets or consoles, that was directly ported to PC, with no time whatsoever to change anything.  Literally, there is zero mouse function for this game.  I have not in my entire life since I played games on a Tandy not been able to use the mouse in gaming.  You will navigate the main menu & game with only the keyboard.  But as for the game itself...\n\nThe cheeky little intro video has IMO, the best thing about this game, the music.  I am not sure if it was done by the person whom made the game itself, but whoever did, if I was ever interested in working on a game with them, this would be the only area I would like to recruit them for.  The music is absolutely great, it is catchy, although repetitive, you don't get tired of playing it, though the short levels you'll be going through.  Oh, yes btw, every single level in the game is extremely short.\n\nBecause, after about 3-4 of the stupidly simple first few, you'll start to run into the problems of gameplay here.  Your zombie will quite easily get stuck on walls.  As in, NES times levels, stuck on walls.  This game is merciless in allowing you to make mistakes.  Generally getting stuck on a wall, or making a single mistake at the wrong time will cost you your one and only life, and then you restart the entire level.  Now, some of these levels do have some interesting ways you must finish them, so there is a slight bit of entertainment in the figuring out of how to sneak past the guards, and get to the unarmed civilians, which if you can manage to do, you can walk your zombie over to them, their health bars drop, and they become generic zombies under your control.  Now you may very roughly control them with essentially 3 commands: Stay in one place, follow me, go towards the nearest enemy head on and attack it.  These controls are barely good enough to bypass the levels if you are extremely patient, skilled & have a good sense of timing.\n\nSpeaking of patience, however, this game has even run mine out.  I have the patience of a Hindu ♥♥♥♥ing goat high on mushrooms and weed + Jesus Christ, but this ♥♥♥♥ing game...let's talk about the final level I am on.  I have looked up a video of how to beat it.  I have seen the man in the video able to do it, but he even had to stop his video, play the game for God knows how long, and come back to it once he had figured it out.  In the game the only enemies, are regular green soldiers, and special forces soldiers.  Now, green soldiers will shoot a single bullet at you, that if it hits, will both damage you, and slow you down.  (Who knew zombies had nervous systems, and were affected by things like getting shot.)  These soldiers after a few missions, aren't too difficult to deal with, as if you get to them, like normal civilians, if you damage them enough you can kill & convert them.  The special forces on the other hand, are a totally different thing.  They not only are armed with machine guns, which will spell almost guaranteed death if they hit you with even one bullet, but they are COMPLETELY ♥♥♥♥ING IMMUNE TO DAMAGE.  That's right!  You could walk up to them, and stand there all day long, with some sort of invincibility cheat/God mode turned on, and they will never die.  They are immortal enemies.  Frankly, this is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game mechanic.  It would have been like, having to fight Starman in Super Maro Bros.\n\nIn closing, I do not recommend this game, would not recommend this game, ever.  If anything, a soundtrack to this game should be sold, and the game itself taken off the market.  I bought it for 54 cents, and would not pay one for it now, or even DL it if it were free having played it.\n\nI'd give this game 4/10, giving 3 points for the great music, and 1 point for the little bit of fun had while playing it.","July 23, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The colourful rounded artstyle gives way to an oddly cheerful zombie apocalypse. Art asside the gameplay is simple and easy to grasp, sadly though, there isn't much. Commanding your zombies and shambling about as a zombie yourself in this game leaves you feeling as if there could be more. Granted this game focusses more on timing and choosing targets strategically in order to finish the levels with minimal casualties for that 3 star score.\n\nOn the downside, this game feels like one of many Mobile to PC ports which brings with it a few bugs. One I found particularly troublesome was having to start as administrator because the game would totally lock up on the main menu shortly after launching. Another bug that was a little annoying was when controls were unresponsive for a short period of time, this usually fixed itself within the span of 2-3 seconds but was annoying none-the-less.\n\nAll in all for it's $2 asking price I'd certainly recomend it for casual gamers and achievement hunters alike.","November 16, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Generally getting stuck on a wall, or making a single mistake at the wrong time will cost you your one and only life, and then you restart the entire level.  Now, some of these levels do have some interesting ways you must finish them, so there is a slight bit of entertainment in the figuring out of how to sneak past the guards, and get to the unarmed civilians, which if you can manage to do, you can walk your zombie over to them, their health bars drop, and they become generic zombies under your control.  Now you may very roughly control them with essentially 3 commands: Stay in one place, follow me, go towards the nearest enemy head on and attack it.  These controls are barely good enough to bypass the levels if you are extremely patient, skilled & have a good sense of timing.\n\nSpeaking of patience, however, this game has even run mine out.  I have the patience of a Hindu ♥♥♥♥ing goat high on mushrooms and weed + Jesus Christ, but this ♥♥♥♥ing game...let's talk about the final level I am on.  I have looked up a video of how to beat it.  I have seen the man in the video able to do it, but he even had to stop his video, play the game for God knows how long, and come back to it once he had figured it out.  In the game the only enemies, are regular green soldiers, and special forces soldiers.  Now, green soldiers will shoot a single bullet at you, that if it hits, will both damage you, and slow you down.  (Who knew zombies had nervous systems, and were affected by things like getting shot.)  These soldiers after a few missions, aren't too difficult to deal with, as if you get to them, like normal civilians, if you damage them enough you can kill & convert them.  The special forces on the other hand, are a totally different thing.  They not only are armed with machine guns, which will spell almost guaranteed death if they hit you with even one bullet, but they are COMPLETELY ♥♥♥♥ING IMMUNE TO DAMAGE.  That's right!  You could walk up to them, and stand there all day long, with some sort of invincibility cheat/God mode turned on, and they will never die.  They are immortal enemies.  Frankly, this is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game mechanic.  It would have been like, having to fight Starman in Super Maro Bros.\n\nIn closing, I do not recommend this game, would not recommend this game, ever.  If anything, a soundtrack to this game should be sold, and the game itself taken off the market.  I bought it for 54 cents, and would not pay one for it now, or even DL it if it were free having played it.\n\nI'd give this game 4/10, giving 3 points for the great music, and 1 point for the little bit of fun had while playing it.","July 23, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The A.I. for both the civilians and the zombies is practically stupid since they both act similar meanwhile the soldier A.I. is very chaotic and their range is all but constant some of them only have the range of a shotgun and can only shoot you when you are next to them while others shoots you all the way from the other side of the map\n\nIf you really want this game or don't mind rage quitting after being killed or having your entire team killed constantly by a stupid companion/unlimited range group of soldiers than by all means pick up this game.","December 30, 2014","false","1.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It becomes fairly difficult pretty early on and you really have to strategize in a lot of cases. Additionally, I have so far always felt that my death had been caused by me and not some flaw in the game (despite the controls, more on that...); when you die it makes you go "Shoot, I could have done that better".\n\nThe only "flaw" (not a big deal really), if I could consider it such would be the aforementioned controls. In this game, moving around is done with the arrow keys and your 3 actions are done with 'a', 's', and 'd', this being the only configuration; no changeable bindings. The only issue I have with this is that my more nimble fingers are stuck with the job of triggering actions rather than moving. I have not found any cfg or txt files containing the bindings. The game was created using XNA Game Studio Express so I suspect that the controls are probably hidden deep within some of the .XNB binaries scattered about the game directory. Regardless, I got over it.\n\nThis game is good for when you are waiting for a download or on the go with your Shield or just wanna see how fast you can solve a puzzle that wants you dead. Plus, I got it for free anyway so I am satisfied. Although I advise you get it while this 10% off sale is still up.\n\n4/5","December 14, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a very pleasent and relaxing puzzle game more for casual players! Its a great concept I only wish there was to the game as its very short. I beat the game in about an hour and 100% it in about 2hrs and I never 100% games. like other negitive reviews for this game I found myself wanting to do more with my zombie hords like when they got split up and sometimes the zombies dont follow your commands right correctly but then I thought "hey there zombies"... lol. I felt like the line of sight in this game was a little bit off and I constantly found that I underestimate the guards range. I do think that there would be a lot of room for improvment if the guards aggro wasnt the same for infront of them as it is behind them. over all a good game. with a little more content and maybe a dlc this game could be great. well worth the $1.70 I spent on it.\nalso please make a level editor, let the steam community make this the great game it can be!\n\n","December 14, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simple, yet cool !!\nNegative\n- No sound of human screams if we pursue them, too far for realistic? Not really, because this indie game\n- Human character in this game has flaws, that is? If they run, and has reached the end of the wall. Human character can not run nowhere else, just ran to the side and also it is very slow to run away from us, so the difficulty is reduced in this game.\nSo if the game is recommended for you? For games below Rp. 20,000 may be recommended, and also to you who are fans of Indie Games.\nRating: 7/10 AFM","February 27, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only got it because it was on sale. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect... it's labeled as strategy, but sometimes felt like a puzzle game, such as choosing the order and timing or how to avoid the ones you can't do anything about.\n\nYes, it is very short and it would be great if they would add some more levels or modes to the game. I'm seeing reviews saying that there's less than 15 minutes to the game. That's a bold faced lie. If anybody gets a perfect game all the way through on their first and only try in under 15 minutes, they simply cheated. It will take multiple (sometime several) attempts on many levels to get 3 stars and a low time, and you might not get both in the same run. The 15 minutes is a combination of best times for all levels, and since it could take several tries per level, that means it'll almost definitely take over 30 minutes and probably average over an hour. That's still not very long, but it's longer than 15 minutes.\n\nIt's worth the $2 if you like strategy or puzzle games, otherwise, there's still no reason not to try it out if it's on sale. If nothing else, you'll get some cards and achievements out of it.","October 30, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So the game is actually pretty fun- you play as the zombie and your mission is to eat every human and turn them into walkers, like yourself. The levels are designed to make you think and plan strategically- something that I didn't think the game would offer. I, Zombie NORMALLY doesn't have you blazing in, chomping off everyone's face, no, I, Zombie forces you to plan out moves and command your squad of walkers (if you have any) to get the job done. So yes, if you do end up infecting any other humans, they will turn into zombies and you can command them to do things such as stop, attack, or follow you.\n\nGraphics\nSo even though this game isn't THAT old, it still looks pretty bad, if i do say so myself. Even at the highest resolution I can go (1440 x 900) the game will still look pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the game will be out of proportion with my monitor (meaning that there are those nasty black lines on the outer edges of the screen). If you're going to buy this for graphics, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SAVE YOUR MONEY.\n\nGameplay\nLots of gameplay aspects were mentioned in the review up top, so I'll recap.\n- Commanding your walker squad\n- Planning out your moves\n- Infecting guards/pedestrians to then infect others\nOverall, gameplay mechanics are very smooth and effective. Nothing really seems overpowered.\n\nSoundtrack\nVery generic, nothing like death metal. It makes the game feel light, nimble, and fast. It made the game seem less violent then it actually should seem like. The soundtrack makes me feel like the game is rated E10.\n\nConclusion\nBuy it- it's lots of fun and not really violent. Get it while it's on sale because it's seemingly on sale a lot and even then, the game only costs $1.99 on a regular day. 9/10","May 18, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only got it because it was on sale. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect... it's labeled as strategy, but sometimes felt like a puzzle game, such as choosing the order and timing or how to avoid the ones you can't do anything about.\n\nYes, it is very short and it would be great if they would add some more levels or modes to the game. I'm seeing reviews saying that there's less than 15 minutes to the game. That's a bold faced lie. If anybody gets a perfect game all the way through on their first and only try in under 15 minutes, they simply cheated. It will take multiple (sometime several) attempts on many levels to get 3 stars and a low time, and you might not get both in the same run. The 15 minutes is a combination of best times for all levels, and since it could take several tries per level, that means it'll almost definitely take over 30 minutes and probably average over an hour. That's still not very long, but it's longer than 15 minutes.\n\nIt's worth the $2 if you like strategy or puzzle games, otherwise, there's still no reason not to try it out if it's on sale.

I only got it because it was on sale. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect... it's labeled as strategy, but sometimes felt like a puzzle game, such as choosing the order and timing or how to avoid the ones you can't do anything about.\n\nYes, it is very short and it would be great if they would add some more levels or modes to the game. I'm seeing reviews saying that there's less than 15 minutes to the game. That's a bold faced lie. If anybody gets a perfect game all the way through on their first and only try in under 15 minutes, they simply cheated. It will take multiple (sometime several) attempts on many levels to get 3 stars and a low time, and you might not get both in the same run. The 15 minutes is a combination of best times for all levels, and since it could take several tries per level, that means it'll almost definitely take over 30 minutes and probably average over an hour. That's still not very long, but it's longer than 15 minutes.\n\nIt's worth the $2 if you like strategy or puzzle games, otherwise, there's still no reason not to try it out if it's on sale. If nothing else, you'll get some cards and achievements out of it.","October 30, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They do add harder elements in later levels though. Though there aren't many good things other then the concept and easy controls here. The game is short and can be beaten rather quickly. It isn't really even made for long plays as after maybe 15 minutes you'll find you don't have the urge to continue. When controlling your character around corners and walls I often found that you were slowed down rather dramatically for no reason. Worse of all though is the unfair AI who can go from simple to overly difficult if even enemies with guns and a big field of vision. One you are being shot you slow down and your health quickly goes making a lot of deaths happen in a frustrating manner.\n\nOverall even for $2 I,Zombie will be worth it for some that plan on playing this a lot but with little content and enough problems to weigh it down I just can't recommend this one when there are better others like it.\n\n\nScore :\n\n\n2/10\n\n","July 4, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I used to play between breaks at school, do 1 level here, 1 level there. I have to say that this is an extremely rewarding game to play. It causes you to think about all of your actions and strategize about the best and fastest ways to beat the levels. A few goods and a few not so goods to round out this review:\n\nGood:\n- Rewarding Gameplay: Easily the most notable feature. The levels are set up in such a way that it rewards you for your patience and strategy. (or for speed runs: SPEED)\n- Leaderboards: Though just about everyone has gotten perfect stars on every level in this game, it then challenges you to see how fast of a speed run you can do to beat the levels.\n- Challenging enough: The levels are challenging enough that you may get stuck on some for a bit, but they are never impossible, as long as you try to formulate some sort of strategy.\n\nNot So Good:\nShort: It's such a short game. I think I have 3 hours logged onto the game and I've completed it with all the achievements. That's not to say that this should deter you at all. It's a short game, but a really great game.\nSemi-linear completion: Some of the levels are constructed in such a way that you have to comply to the level's mechanics to beat the level, meaning that on some levels, you may be able to have a few different choices of where to go to add to your zombie family first, while some, you will have to follow a set standard of how you beat the level. It's not terrible, but I think it would feel even better to have some more choices. Having said that, it doesn't take away from the gameplay.\n\nThat's really it! It's innovative and fun with really negligible shortcomings. I would definitely recommend this game. I got it on sale, but after playing it, I totally would have bought it at full price too.","June 27, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can grab the game for few cents and you don't care about getting all achievements done go for it. Otherwise skip this one. It's a quality worth a dozens other free online flash games. Trying to get to 3 stars is purely lucked based in last levels, you can do everything correctly, but still anything of the following can happen: you get stuck behing an invisible obstactle that shouldn't really be there / soldiers decide to shoot your zombie first even though literally every other zombie's closer to them, which end the level for you / soldiers decide to finish the zombie they started shooting even though other zombies are closer, killing you zombies and not granting you that 3rd star. The fact that soldier's shooting and your bitting are animated with same time frame is annoying as hell as no matter that you stepped on the soldier in between his shots, you're still bitting the same speed and moment when he's shooting, which leads to so much moments of you dying the same moment soldier got changed it's beyond depresive.","May 29","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I, Zombie is only $1.99. The game I, Zombie is about strategy. Your a zombie and in each level you got to kill the humans. There are two parts to the games levels. The original levels, and the winter levels. This game also includes a level editor and some achievements. In all, I recommend this game.","May 9, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
