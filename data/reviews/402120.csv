The term "single stick" threw me off so hard at first. But let me tell you something; if you play for a while (say, an hour or so) you'll forget you're not in control of the firing. That's because in a way, you are in control. Your positioning relative to priority targets is crucial to your success in this game.\n\nI absolutely love this game. The visuals, the smooth gameplay, the music (dear god the music sounds like it was ripped straight from a Sega Genesis game, i.e. AWESOME), everything about this game was clearly made with so much love.

My first time running it I thought it was very lousy and aesthetically unappealing, but something about it kept me pushing on.   I'd pick it up and play about 15 minutes at a time here and there.  Now I have grown to really enjoy this game and I find myself jumping in almost daily.\n\nYou land in a monster inhabited map and your goal is to collect items and find the teleporting exit.  Do this three times without dying and you will face a boss before you can proceed to the next area.  I don't know what is going to happen after a while because I keep dying.  :)  I do know that aiming and shooting is automatic, which works pretty well, so you can focus on dodging projectiles and picking up loot.  It plays better than that sounds.\n\nIt's difficult, but fun, with many useful characters and power-ups that can be unlocked to aid you on your runs.  After learning to go after one Elite mob and chests, to get organs per level, I am getting better and farther just about each run.  Maybe I'll even beat it one of these days.","January 13","true","3.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Bullets shoot out of the character, attacking only the closest character, and tyou progress through the levels.\n\nThe wrinkle comes from the second stick, providing a short dash that allows the player to avoid bullets, as well as two abilities that can be activated. Several passive abilities, such as bombs, rockets or flamethrowers, round out the characters attacks.\n\nWhat starts as a fairly simple, easy system quickly becomes more complex, the difficultly ramping smoothly to provide a surprisngly engrossing experience. It is much closer to games like Touhou or vertical bullet hells than to the immediate cousins of Nuclear Throne or Binding of Isaac. This works to the games benifet, providing a tense, methodical experience where foresight and planning pay off.\n\nI would definitely recomend this to many people, though with the ceveat it's closer to a true bullet hell than other games that are visually similar in gameplay. The patterns get tough, and careful use of your dash and a bit of luck make for an excellent experience.\n\nAlso, I love the pixel art, and the music isvery fitting. The neon effect goes a long way to turn what could have been a boring visual design into something memorable!","October 20, 2015","true","4.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xap747/recommended/402120/","xap747","Zev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xap747/","23 products in account","Deathstate is a lot more fun than I first anticipated.  Having seen a lot of footage and information beforehand, I didn't see myself playing it for more than an hour.  Once I started playing yesterday though, I couldn't put it down.\n\nI'm going to do something unorthodox and break down the game based on its own description.  Deathstate is a...\n\n1) Single-stick shooter - this means that you use your controls to move, and the game aims and shoots for you.  My first thought was that this would be annoying, but it's actually quite a positive thing.  You target and fire at the closest enemy, which leaves you with the remaining responsibility to dodge and use items.  And you'll need all the concentration you can get for those two things, especially later in the game when it gets hard.  On top of this you still feel in control because the movement is so fluid and responsive.\n\n2) Roguelike - There is permadeath.  Game runs are quick and brutal when you first play.  The game's progression through levels is linear (for the most part), but the content of each area is procedurally generated, meaning it's different every time.  This includes the physical shape of the level as well as enemies and items.  It makes each run feel fairly unique.\n\n3) Bullet-hell - This descriptor may be a bit misleading for some.  On the game's default easy difficulty setting, you'll be spammed with enemy bullets, sometimes in patterned formations, and in large quantities in the later levels.  But it's not nearly as much as a classic "Bullet Hell" shmup like the TouHou games, so it may give a bad first impression to bullet-hell enthusiasts.  HOWEVER: If you want a higher difficulty you will quickly unlock "Planar Altars" which start showing up in the early areas, and allow you to crank up the difficulty via the game's "Desecration" level.  This shows promise in satisfying more hardcore gamers.\n\nWhat else is cool about Deathstate?  Here's some fun things that can keep you playing:\nCollectible monster organs that you stuff into your body and make it more powerful\nArtifacts and books that orbit around your character with active & passive abilities to, among other things, shoot more projectiles like magic missiles, laser beams, fireballs...\nA bunch of characters with different abilities and passive traits\n^ You unlock more of the above nearly every time you play!\nShops where you can buy items or gamble your money away\nGIANT chests!\nAn awesome aesthetic of otherworldly awe, gloom, and eldritch horror in varying amounts, and good music to accompany it.\nAll around smooth controls which can be remapped and also support Xbox & Steam controllers\nAnd possible cons:\nSome of the visual effects may be bothersome to people.  I forgot they were there myself, but they can't be disabled.\nThe boss attack patterns can become predictable after a while\nThere's a few buggy things in the Library's menus, but at the time of this review the devs said they are working on it.\nI think this game is well worth the money if you like roguelikes, weird monsters, vivid colors, and blowing things up.","October 21, 2015","true","17.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

You only move and the character shoots in auto. This is, in my opinion, better than the twin-stick-shooter system, because it reduces complexity (moving and aiming at the same time), and allows you to focus on movement. This does not mean the game is not hard, just watch someone play the new insanity mode or finish a desecration run.\n\nIf you like Binding of Isaac, I strongly recommend this game. Also for the fans of other bullet hells/rogue-likes, I recommend you give this game a chance.","November 24, 2015","true","34.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I inevitably get frustrated somewhere around my fifth or sixth death, utter a loud expletive, and take a break. However, I keep coming back whenever there's a temporary lull in my day. Judging by the extensive list of items and features I have yet to unlock, I have a long way to go.\n\nThe controls are responsive and surprisingly simplistic. The etheric 'bullets' your character fires aren't aimed manually, but are instead fired automatically at the nearest enemies, making it your responsibility to put your astral explorer in the right place at the right time. The many swarms of weaker, projectile-less enemies can become a real problem, because they act as constant meat-shields to the more threatening enemies, prolonging every encounter and increasing your chances of losing precious hitpoints to your own incompetence.\n\nLike most roguelike-likes,  the items you to pick up or don't pick up can make or break your run through the game, but you aren't entirely at the mercy of the Random Number Generator. Success always feels possible, if difficult, thanks to the bullet hell elements and the dodging mechanic. The many, many projectiles in the lower levels can be phased through or dodged by the directional arrow keys if you are fast enough, giving the game a high skill ceiling.\n\nIn short, the game is easy to learn and hard to master, and I give it extra points for the cool setting.

My only complaint is that death sets you all the way back to Layer 1, and the game can get repetitive if you have to progress through the same few levels over and over again just to get back to where you died. This design choice does limit your moves - you're less likely to be daring and take a risk if you know the last twenty minutes of your game might be wiped out because you got cornered.\n\nOverall, I've very excited to see how this game continues to shape up as the developer adds new content and works out the kinks. I'll be spending plenty of time with it.\n\n","November 3, 2015","true","5.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The aesthetic of the graphics and sfx/music is really unique and the single stick shooter style gameplay is surprisingly complex. Plus, the items and organs add so much to every build! The combination of unlocks and permadeath is working really well so far: All of your character's stats and items are reset when you die, but progress you make unlocks the possibility of new items spawning. It keeps making me want to play another run to try to find the latest eyeball or heart I've unlocked.\n\nAlso, the single stick style of the game lends itself surprisingly well to the Steam Controller.

Lovecraft universe.   It's a relatively simple game:  Steer one of a growing cast of unlockable characters through a series of procedurally-generated worlds, gobbling up unlockable guts--monstrous hearts, eyes, brains, lungs, etc.--and equipping arcane tools that modify your stats and offensive capabilities.\n\nAnd I quite literally mean "steer":  As a single stick shooter, you don't have direct control over when or where you shoot.  Instead, your character automatically targets and shoots enemies when they come into range, leaving you to focus entirely on movement and dodging.  This unusual choice may turn off some players because it sounds like a dumbed-down twin stick shooter.  It doesn't help that the first map (called a "layer") is frequently pretty easy, leaving many to assume you can simply sleepwalk through the game while your character does all the work.\n\nHowever, it's not long before the difficulty ramps up and you realize that the game is built on maneuvering around the dozens of bizarre enemies and their various projectiles and attacks.  The single stick conceit doesn't make the game easier...just different.\n\nFortunately for those who descend a few layers and feel that the game is still a little too easy or light on the "bullet" aspect of a bullethell, the game gives you the opportunity to increase the difficulty.  This comes in the form of crystal skulls, which are located at the beginning of each run and then randomly throughout the middle of levels.  Approaching one gives you the option to "desecrate" it, upsetting the cosmos and upping the ante; enemies will be a lot nastier, projectiles will be more plentiful, and the player will die to fewer hits.  There appear to be differences between desecrating the skull at the beginning of the game (which activates an "Insanity" mode) and those that are periodically discovered within the Deathstate (which simply add "Desecration" levels to the run).  But once you start a run, you must die to undo the effects.\n\nNonetheless, Deathstate isn't exactly the most complex roguelite shooter.  You won't constantly stumble across novel item synergies (or contraindications) like you would in Binding of Isaac.  In fact, you're usually free to hoover up all of the stat-enhancing guts you come across.  But as of the v1.20 Beta, the developer has taken a lot of community feedback regarding item, organ, and character balance in an effort to significantly expand on the variety of item effects, combinations, and character classes.  The result is that there's a greater depth and range of options in Deathstate than ever before.\n\nIn sum, the game offers up enough unlockable characters, items, weapons, and dungeons--and more than a few weird gameply mechanics and secrets--to keep things fresh and interesting for anybody wanting a new roguelite-shooter in their lives.","December 28, 2015","true","113.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Deathstate is a roguelike, bullet hell, single stick shooter set in a bizarre world of dimensional exploration for pc and mac. You play as a number of unique characters trying to discover the fate of Professor Elinberg who opened a portal to the void. Great and terrible mysteries and even greater treasures await if you are bold or foolhardy enough to go beyond the beyond.\n\nThe Bizarre World of Deathstate\nIn Deathstate, you are a traveller of the outer realms. You have discovered the secrets of deep astral projection by entering into a fully death-like meditative state. While in your Deathstate, you can go beyond the beyond to realms previously only imagined by those enlightened or mad enough to dwell upon them. Tread lightly though, for these far planes of demi-existence that you choose to explore are extremely hostile to mortal souls. - Highly Recommended!","December 31, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It scratches the itch of shooting and dodging in a very satisfying way, and out-Isaacs the Binding of Isaac while it's at it.\n\nThe game is a "single stick shooter", by which they mean you only control movement and the usage of your activated items.  The movement feels fluid and natural, and it's worth noting that the developers absolutely nailed the feeling of a true danmaku shoot-em-up, even down to things as subtle as the speed of enemy bullets, or the size of the hitbox proportional to your character sprite (not too tiny, not too fat).  Your character automatically targets the closest enemy, and fires without stopping.  This frees up more brainspace for you to focus on positioning and managing the enemy horde, within which always lurks a few stronger and more threatening enemies that need to be eliminated quickly despite the popcorn piling up in front of them.\n\nThere is technically a 2nd stick at work, here: using the right analog stick on a gamepad will activate a dash dodge ability that you can use to get yourself out of bad spots.  I don't know if this figures in more at higher level play than my own, but I find relying on it tends to actually end up killing me faster than if I simply played more cautiously in the first place.  YMMV of course, but there are ways to herd bullets into lines and create gaps through them without relying on a dodge, and these are still just as effective as they would be in any other shooter.\n\nThe game features a (unlockable, but easily so) dynamic difficulty system called Desecration.  You can find altars and desecrate them to raise the difficulty level of the game for the rest of that run, giving enemies more health, denser bullet patterns, and in some cases "suicide bullets" fired when they die (think Ketsui on the Ura loop, or 2nd-loop Dodonpachi).  There's also an Insanity Portal option, turned on before the run begins, that cranks up the difficulty right from the get-go.  It presents a significant challenge, even for someone with 1CCs of other games under their belt.\n\nThere is a pretty sizeable pool of items you can find, mostly in the form of ingestable organs, with a smattering of swords and books and other relics sprinkled in.  These unlock as you play, and I appreciate that a lot of attention has been paid to making sure that (for the most part) there aren't any that are useless or actively bad, with the possible current exception of items that change your firing to a burst or flurry, which removes your ability to handle the game's popcorn hordes with any sense of grace.\n\nGrace is the key word with Deathstate.  It's fluid and fun in an immediately gratifying way, and is the kind of game where you'll "Just One More Run" yourself into the ground, only noticing too late that it's 1 in the morning and where did your whole day go?","April 24","true","23.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

What this means is that you move your character, and your character automatically fires at the closest target. At this point, some of you are probably saying "Whaaaat?"—let me assure you, though, that this is both fun and challenging. The way I play, I have my left hand on WASD and my right on the arrow keys; the arrow keys activate a "dash" that lets you "phase through" bullets. Even though I'm not actively controlling where I shoot, I'm still making decisions every moment—What target should I move close to now? How close do I have to get so it's in range? Can I figure out its pattern and predict where I have to be next? Would it help if I dashed through this bullet, or would that put me in the path of something else? Can I run over there to the health item without running into bullets? Should I activate my character skill or my item skill, or should I save the MP/cooldown for when I really need it? Where should I go next in this level so as to find the exit before time runs out?\n\nOnce you get to the higher levels, it starts feeling more like Touhou than anything else, as you carefully maneuver through bullet patterns. (After all, in most Touhou games, don't you just hold down the fire button all the time?) You also accumulate various items (this is where the "roguelike" aspect comes in). The items modify your damage, rate of fire, bullet type and so on, and some give you skills that can be activated. You can only carry one grimoire, one weapon and one "orbiting relic", and they float around you; when you find a new grimoire, for example, you have to consider which is best for your current build. There are other weird and interestingly gruesome items like eyes and spleens, but you can collect as many of those as you like. Incidentally, the levels are organized into worlds, but randomly generated; each type feels different from the others, and within a world each level is slightly different, with a different combination of monsters for example—different monsters require very different tactics to take on.\n\nWhile I, personally, was never that good at Binding of Isaac, I found myself able to get to the end of Deathstate with only a week or so of play. Of course, that's hardly the "end" of the game; I can play with more unlocked characters, I can use the "desecration portals" to increase the difficulty level...I have no doubt I could play this game for months, if not years. Speaking of unlocks, there are lots of them, which is a good thing; even if you die, very often you unlock something new to appear during play, which is gratifying.\n\nGraphics: Pixel-y, but very good. There are all sorts of crazy monsters. Some are admittedly "generic", like skeletons or liches. Some of them are obviously based on things from Cthulhu Mythos stories, like the Starspawn, Gugs and Elder Things. Some are actually versions of the weirder Dungeons & Dragons monsters, like Modrons, Beholders or Grells (here "Hawkminds"). And some of the monsters are original, like the Molten Faces. As long as you don't hate pixel artwork—and you aren't grossed out by disembodied organs, or by flesh melting off monsters when they die—I think you'll be impressed with the graphics.\n\nSpeaking of graphics, I should mention the "scanline" effect. It's very well done; when you switch levels, it almost feels like your monitor is turning on and off (it's just a graphical effect though). There's also a "brightness" effect; when you get a health item, the screen glows with saturated colors for an instant. And when you get down to very low health, everything looks gray and washed-out. Also, when time runs out in a level, the colors start reversing, or sometimes phantoms appear all over the screen. And certain monsters can actually increase the scanlines or brightness, making it seem like when you get close to them, the entire game is being affected. These graphical touches act as cues for events in the game...and they also just appear bizarre and fascinating. (By the way, I think the scanline effects can be turned off in the options.)\n\nMusic and Sound: Excellent. Well, it's sort of a vaguely chiptune-esque feel; I understand the composers (well, everyone involved) were inspired by Genesis games; imagine Ecco the Dolphin meeting Cthulhu. Also, Carcassus will make you think of DOOM (in many ways). Honestly, I liked the music so much I bought the soundtrack DLC, and I NEVER do that. As for sound, there are lots of nice cues; you can tell when a health item drops somewhere in view, and you can tell that it's different from a gold drop. Acquiring health produces a nice "gulp". When you meet an elite monster, it announces itself with diabolical laughter—to say nothing of the demonic cackle that heralds a boss.\n\nStory: The story is, admittedly, vague: You have followed a Professor into a dimension filled with monsters, and now you have to defeat him and/or escape. The, writing, however, is quite good; what I'm referring to, mostly, is the descriptions of monsters and items, tiny bits of Lovecraftian prose you can read once you've encountered/unlocked the thing in question. Also, between levels, various characters will pop up and say random things. This ranges from the Professor threatening you, to skeletons making references to old games, to the undead merchant saying truly bizarre things ("A brain is a terrible thing to only have one of"). The point I'm trying to make is that the story and writing don't have a big role—nor do they need to—but they're good for what they are.\n\nIN SUMMARY: I'm coming back to it and playing it again and again. Highly recommended.\n","January 26","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Playthroughs are typically 15 to 30 minutes long and beyond WASD for movement the other main keys are "F" to examine and the arrow keys to dodge (all keys can be re-bound to whatever you like).  The keys needed to use potions and other items are helpfully overlaid on the on-screen display you see while you play.\n\nShould you buy Deathstate?  Well, if you are a casual gamer like myself who likes to occasionally unwind playing simple yet fun RPG-styled games then the answer is "yes!"  Deathstate features a mix of science-fiction / horror-style chiptune music mixed with some very fun heavy metal for one of the mini-boss fights you can choose on every playthrough.  The metal track (called "Desecrate") on the Original Sound Track (OST) is thrilling.  I would compare it to the game version of an all-out table-and-chair throwing bare-knuckle brawl with Satan himself, set against the background of the cosmos.  Good stuff.\n\nWhile I don't see myself putting hundreds of hours into Deathstate the game is, for what it is, fantastic.  It is a pick-up and play sci-fi horror-style RPG game with very simple game mechanics and challenging enemies and bosses.  I have heard some people find the on-screen overlay disorienting during long play throughs.  I haven't and I am prone to motion sickness.  I recommend picking up this game on sale if you enjoy this style of game.","March 22","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do you like to mix element from danmaku (bullet curtain) and rogue-like? Then you have your game : Deathstate.\n\nThis review has been made after clearing the full game at version 1.13, which means 100% achievement and the hardest possible run.\n\n\nFor which player ?Thanks to a scaled difficulty the game can be played by both novice to danmaku and experts. However, as it is now this can has some flashy effect that may pose a problem for color-blind people along with those having photo-sensibility.\n\nPros :    The game is alive : you can post on the forum and the developer is present to answer and give insight on the game and its future, which is a strong point as bug fixing is ensured by the presence of the developer.\nMusicThe music is good and sounds effects are carefully used. Thank to this mix, you can hear what is happening around you, which is pretty valuable for hardest difficulty.\nArt : Simple and effective pixel art in the Lovecraft world. Even if it is not extremely "original", it is done properly, the game has its own style and you will remember it.\nA good choice of characters : As for now there are 10 playable characters and 3 in-run transformation that will modify the gameplay from a little to a lot. This is good as you can have some affinity with a certain type of gameplay (dodging or heavy DPS) which is present in the characters.\nPrivacy : It is the first game which ASKED me if I wanted my data collected for improving the game anonymously. Just for having the game asking my consent it is a great pro in this market where some developer have no concern for players' privacy.\nCons :    Color effects : It is how the game has been programmed and it serves in its difficulty by adding coloration effect (color inversion, blur, increased gamma) making difficult to see where are the bullet on the screen. However, I believe this is a con for people who cannot stand such effect, may it be for personnal taste or medical reason.\nHeavy RNG : As for now, hardest difficulty are way too much RNG dependent. There are build where you simply cannot go on, which lead to reset fest.\nNo lore : The last con I would add is the scenario and the lore. There is little to no scenario in this game. You are trapped in a simulation like, you kill monster and that's pretty all. Therefore you play the game for the gameplay and not for unfolding the scenario.\nOverall? I recommend to buy the game at full price for people who do love danmaku and rogue-like. If you are not a big player of danmaku or rogue-like you can buy it either full price or on small sales. If you hate one of those style or are waiting for a Lovecraft like story, do not buy this game, it is not made for you.","February 17","true","38.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's not much doubting that. It's also very frustrating. Also no doubting that.\nThe mechanics are easy to master, and with the variety of mostly useless equipment that you can pick up, most runs will be quite different than each other, and this is a good thing. The graphical style is pleasing, and the colors are quite nice, even though sometimes enemy bullets seem to blend in with everything else. The music is very good, and is probably the first soundtrack I've heard in a while that had a true retro feel to it.\nBullet Hell, Rougelike. Painful heaven.\nHowever, I think that there are two poor decisions made with it.\nIf you want to make a difficult skill based game, that's fine. Dark Souls is fairly difficult with mechanics that can be mastered, Touhou is a series another good example of that. However, I feel that even will skill, the reason this game will still be difficult is not because it requires luck, but rather because of the visual filter that frequently brightens and can sometimes pulsate, making bullets impossible to see. Or, at least, very difficult to see. I can't judge if this was an intentional decision to increase difficulty, or if it was simply a stylistic choice. It /feels/ like a cheap way to increase difficulty, and I don't like that one bit.\nThe second, and probably more minor and definitely weighing on my lack of knowledge, is that most of the organs in the game seem to provide minimal benefit if any at all. This could change later in the game, perhaps the slight pushes in either direction will affect the outcome of a run, and I can't currently say if that's true or not.\nIf I were to give this game an honest rating, I'd give it 6.5/10. It's decent and fun, and I will definitely be playing every other day, but I will always hold a small resentment for it in my heart for the cheap deaths it often presents me with.","January 12","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I ended the run with over 1000 gold because the game gave me no opportunities to spend it.\nThe level designs after the first chapter are just asinine and frustrating. Tons of "Well, guess you're screwed corridors with no way to avoid damage.  It's a definite serious problem when the game actually becomes easier to navigate and position yourself on the final chapter of the game.\n\nTo clarify, I had a far easier time avoiding damage, navigating and killing enemies on the very last chapter of the game, with no changes in my item inventory.  Though the enemies were harder and bullet patterns were awesome to deal with, I wasnt' fighting the level design nearly as much at that point.\n\nIt's a fun concept and man I am really enjoying the lore but again, I don't recommend it until these problems are fixed.","January 7","false","7.8"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","10","22","0","3"

The addition of different items, granting unique abilities was refreshing, but I found that many of them were just thrown in, and didn't add much of a dynamic to the combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BleachedBlind/recommended/402120/","BleachedBlind","BleachedBlind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BleachedBlind/","279 products in account","Deathstate is a game that I wanted to like. The idea of simplifying 2D shooters to a movement only based scheme is novel. It allows the player to focus on dodging and placement. This would be great if everything built around it wasn't so faulty.\n\nThe music in the game ranges anywhere from tolerable to aural punishment. The Maze of Ix has undoubtledy the worst track I've heard in a game in years. The art style is quite nice, even though various enemies are recycled through areas. Half of the enemies are barely animated, though. Visual design choices also get in the way of the gameplay. One of the zones cycles through colors, and some of those are almost the same hue as the bullets. Using or picking up healing items accompanies with a blinding flash that blocks out vision of projectiles. The clutter and aesthetic bits strewn about the levels make it hard to tell what can be walked over and what can't. Factor in that characters get stuck on corners like they're coated with rubber cement, and you have chunks of life lost to bad movement.\n\nAside from characters getting stuck, the core mechanics of the game don't work as well as they should. Runs are almost entirely determined by the quality of items picked up. Some items are good, most are relatively unimpactful, and some are outright bad. Why have an item that increases damage but slows rate of fire to once a second when the player is going to be surrounded by enemies? The later levels are swarmed by high health enemies that fill the screen with bullets. That could be forgiven if the player wasn't also on a timer to get through each stage. If they items picked up during the run were below par, then winning is almost surely out of the question. Money even feels like a wasted resource because shops are rare and usually are either a straight up gamble or just have consumables, which may or may not be bad.\n\nI don't recommend the game in its current state, and I don't expect it will improve drastically enough for me to change my mind. If you are considering this game, I strongly urge you to look at Nuclear Throne instead. Although much harder, Nuclear Throne is well worth your time and money.\n(Sidenote: At the time of writing, many items in the game outright do not work if you use an XBox One controller. Expect to use your keyboard or another controller until this is patched.)","January 7","false","4.6"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","0"

It's gonna get downvoted anyway. TL;DR Items are mostly negative, characters are kinda bland, most pick-ups are extremely high risk with little to no reward, annoying mechanics, the weapons suck, the trinkets are basically repeats of charcter abilities, that are all meh under level 3, etc, etc. It saved the last chunk of my review so, there.\n\nAnyway, if you're into stupid hard bullet-hell, Cthulhu stuff with glowing ♥♥♥♥ that gives you a headache, then by all means go for it. I don't think I've ever had a game really give me a headache this bad before. I don't even know what the damn rune does or the random sliding across the map. It's an interesting game, I'm 100% sure people will downvote this into oblivion, but I just can't hit yes.\n\nI'm not gonna pretend like I'm amazing at Rogue-Likes, or anything like that, but the difficulty+timer is just irritating as hell. When I play I don't feel like I'm learning or getting better, if anything I feel like I'm just getting lucky. After 7.4 hours, I still don't feel I've learned anything or improved at all outside of being better at dodging. I don't like that feeling, I don't like what that entails. If I can't really improve, and I don't want to continue playing then that's kinda the nail in the coffin for me.","January 2","false","6.4"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"
