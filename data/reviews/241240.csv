It was a game that asked you to, for example, toast some breads using bombs, lasers, switches, conveyor belts, etc, in a Rube Goldberg style. The idea was novel and the game contributed to hours and hours of fun, even though I was too young to understand much of it.\n\nThen few years later, another similar game called The Incredible Toon Machine came out, which from what I remember, added a few animals like Al the cat and Sid the mouse. It was not officially part of the series; everything looked more cartoonish, but I still spent even more hours blowing stuff up. I was older (therefore wiser), and it was still in the 90s.\n\nToon Machine was the last game in the series I played. Fans like me have waited many, many years for a remake of this classic game. Imagine my joy when I saw Contraption Maker on Steam, made by none other than the creators of the original TIM.\n\nThe game itself has over 100 official puzzles, not to mention the plethora of user-made puzzles on Steam Workshop. The developer continues to update the game with new stuff, and the puzzles are challenging. They may seem easy in the beginning, but as you go through them, especially in the medium and hard section, you may find yourself pulling your hair when you cannot toast those breads after 20 tries.\n\nIn short,\n\n* if you had played The Incredible Machine and loved it, you will very easily love Contraption Maker.\n* if you (god forbid) had not played or heard of TIM before, but for some reason you like toasting breads with bombs and lasers, you will very easily love Contraption Maker.\n* if you had not played or heard of TIM before, and don't like Rube Goldberg machine, then I regret to tell you that you are missing out the fun and want to thank you for reading my review anyway.[/list]\n\nAs an extra motivation, you will get two copies when you buy now. Give it to your buddy and let them toast some breads!\n\n\nWith bombs and lasers!","October 25, 2014","true","8.9"," 84 of 88 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","84","88","9","5"

Electronic Arts was still the young Anakin Skywalker of gaming, not yet the Darth Vader of corporate exploitation and greed.  You had to learn DOS, to manage your EMS and XMS, and to properly set the jumpers of your sound card (if you had one) to match the IRQ settings in your config.sys.  And your 150 MB hard drive had more space than you could ever fill.\n\nIn those days I played "The Incredible Machine."  And it was.  Incredible, that is.  One of the earliest sandbox games, it gave us a canvas for infinite creativity that was loaded with personality and possibility.  Then they made some more of them.  Then TIM just sort of disappeared.\n\nNow it's back.  And even though the game is no longer (capital i) Incredible, it's still just as incredible.  So if you loved the early 1990s original, buying this should be a given.  If you're too young, or just weren't paying attention, and missed The Incredible Machine, do yourself a favor and buy Contraption Maker anyway.  It's a great time to jump in.  It's a puzzle game for people who don't like puzzle games, as well as those who do.  It's great for young children, older children, and very, very old children (i.e. "adults").  It's an exercise in creativity without a point, just creativity for its own sake.\n\nHere's the basic premise:\nYou normally [do X mundane, manual task] with [Y amount of effort] in [Z amount of time].  If C = Coolness, completing tasks the normal way would be C/100.  But if you could automate [X task] by spending Y+E amount of Effort in Z*1,000 amount of time, would C go through the roof!?  Yes!  It WOULD!  So if X = "turn on a flashlight," Y = "press a switch," Z = 0.25 seconds, and C = 0.1 (which is to say "hardly cool at all")... well, let's just say by adding a mouse, a bowling ball, a laser, some rubber bands, a hundred feet of pipe, and a boxing glove you can make turning on a flashlight the coolest thing you'll do all week.","May 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 67 of 71 people (94%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","94","67","71","25","4"

This was on sale for only a quid, so I took a chance on it. I was amazed at its quality: The music is great, the mechanics were excellent, the UI is nicely designed and the graphics are nice as well. I was shocked, I did not expect this game to be good.\n\nI then looked up the company who made it and it all made sense. They're the same people who made "The Incredible Machine" in the first place! I was so impressed by how good this game is that I picked up another 5 copies to give to people in the future. I really, really hope they do a big DLC. They do free updates, but I'd be more than willing to pay money for a lot more puzzles. Not even new components, just new puzzles would be fine.\n\nSteam workshop integration is a huge bonus and means that you never really run out of levels anyway - I just prefer official ones as they're more consistent in difficulty and quality. Achievement integration would be hugely appreciated as well, this game has potential to use achievements in the way they were intended: For doing crazy things which the game doesn't actually require you to do at all.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone.","November 3, 2014","true","10.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

SO MUCH YES.\n\nThe Incredible Machine is a physics puzzle game. It's not just just any physics puzzle game, though; it was the first! Before Scribblenauts, before World of Goo, before Garry's Mod, even before all those crazy flash games on Newgrounds, it was The Incredible Machine that let gamers discover the joy of physics sandbox chaos. Many hours of fun were had feeding tiny children to alligators and dropping huge piles of cats onto trampolines. The puzzles themselves were sublime, teaching foresight and out-of-the-box thinking in ways that were unheard of at the time. I'd go so far as to say that The Incredible Machine 3 is probably my top pick for best puzzle game of all time.\n\nThere have been clones and copycats over the years with varying levels of quality (Bad Rats, anyone?), but now you don't have to settle for imitations! This is the same game as it was 20 years ago, only with a new name and a fresh coat of HD paint it so greatly deserved. All the old machine parts are back, puzzle size and complexity is UNLIMITED, and Steam Workshop integration means that the world can see the puzzles you make (rather than just whatever friends or family you could trick into playing your custom puzzle). The music is almost as good as the old soundtracks, and just try not to shed a tear of nostalgia when you clear a puzzle and hear "whew!"\n\nThe interface still has some annoying kinks to work out, and some of the animal animations are atrociously ugly, but overall this is an amazing effort and deserves the time and attention of any puzzle gamers, especially those who enjoy programming-style games.\n\nI'll tell you what, I'm really loving this fad of ridiculously old puzzle games being brought back by their original creators. So besides this, we now have Chip's Challenge back as Chuck's Challenge, DROD is still going strong, Shadowgate just got a modern remake... what's next? Boulder Dash? LaserTank? Dr. Brain? ...Oh my god, Dr. Brain. Somebody please bring Dr. Brain back. Get a kickstarter going or something. Now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/triface1/recommended/241240/","triface1","Whimsical Watercress","http://steamcommunity.com/id/triface1/","47 products in account","Finally a successor to the The Incredible Machine (TIM) series! If you played TIM, buy this! If you like puzzles, buy this! If you like throwing cats with deadpan faces off the screen, buy this! Even without going on sale, the game has quite a bit of content you don't have to worry about not getting your money's worth, unless you're not into this type of game at all. I got this for the equivalent of 0.50 USD during Summer Sale 2015. That is such a freaking steal that I am now a professional thief.\n\nMechanics:\nThere are many new parts that were added in this game. Just to name a few, you now have Tinker the dog, as well as many variations of Tim (Sledding? Walking? Snowball-throwing?). The variations in Tim, in particular, makes sense as Tim used to just be the cannon fodder that you threw everywhere with boxing gloves, springs, anti-gravity pads, as well as getting him stuck on a blimp, all with the aim of getting him back to his house. This increases the number of ways you can throw cats with deadpan faces off the screen.\n\nMany parts can now be adjusted to have their area of effect changed. For example, the scissors used to be something that can only be placed horizontally, but now it can be rotated 360 degrees. You can also choose at what angle you wish the kettle to blow an object. All these improvements combine to make the game deeper and more flexible.\n\nYou also no longer have to struggle with placement of objects. There were some puzzles where you had to adjust your objects by the pixel so that they would get contact in the exact right spot and respond to each other. That's no longer the case here. The hitbox is bigger now, which does not make the game easier, though it does make it much less frustrating. You no longer have to worry about the stupid candle not being in the exact right spot to launch the rocket.\n\nAlso on the topic of mechanics, the addition of a fast-forward button is simply genius. There have been many times in TIM where puzzles take more than 15-30 seconds to execute in its entirety. Combined with the earlier-mentioned problem of object detection, it can be extremely annoying. This solves that problem, and can also save you time if you're a veteran player wishing to blow past the easy levels.\n\nArt and Sound:\nThis may just be the nostalgia speaking, but The Incredible Machine series had a very engaging soundtrack, whether it was the MIDI or the upgraded non-MIDI version. CM's do not stand out particularly as very good compositions, and there are a few pieces of music that are slightly grating (like the main theme). Having said that, I must qualify that CM's soundtrack is actually decent, just not as good as TIM's.\n\nNext, the art style of CM is very different from TIM. While TIM goes for a clean and flat look (likely an artifact of the technological restrictions at the time), CM has a more "shaded" style of art which is very obvious on certain objects like Tinker the dog. I slightly prefer TIM's art style, but I think the departure from that art style is an attempt to distant the game from the original series, which is not a bad idea at all. What developer wishes their game to only be referred to as a clone of another game? I still find the new art style a little jarring, but I'm sure it's just a matter of getting used to it.\n\nTIM had its own system of map sharing that was later discontinued. Now that CM is launched on a reliable platform like Steam, I think it's safe to say that custom map support won't be an issue further down the road, which will mean there's a whole lot of content out there even after you're done with the original puzzles. Community engagement is also at an all-time high.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nAfter all that, CM does have its own shortcomings. The level editor has categorized all the objects with the aim of making it easy to find parts. However, imagine my annoyance when it took me 5 minutes to realize that the anti-gravity pad was actually not part of any of the categories, and had to be accessed by viewing all the parts.\n\nThe game has also decided to opt to include a zoom and pan feature. This is more likely an accessibility feature than anything else, however, the OCD in me is very disturbed by the fact that you can pan the level even without zooming, and you end up with black borders on the side.\n\nSummary:\nIn summary, despite some questionable decisions, CM has made many refinements to mechanics that TIM got wrong. Fast-forward, more consistent object interactions, and almost-assured longevity of the game due to the its community makes this an easy recommend. I give Contraption Maker a 8.5 cats with deadpan faces out of 10.\n\nIt is a pity CM was kind of an under-the-radar release. I look forward to seeing CM flourish as its own series.","June 22, 2015","true","1.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","16","17","4","1"

Even in its Alpha state, the game already has tons of building parts, many of them from the legacy The Incredible Machine series (also developed by the awesome team that made this!), and a few new ones, too.\n\nSome parts are still lacking proper art, but that's not something you should worry about - Contraption Maker is still in development, and many things in game can't be considered 'final'. Moreover, I think the developers have stated that skinning support will be available at some point in the future. Anyway, it is at gameplay that this title really excels! Playing with explosives, blimps and even alligators is completely safe here, not to mention plenty of fun. :)\n\nThe new Alpha releases have brought a significant amount of content to the game, since the first one. New parts, bug fixes, some amazing pieces of soundtrack (which is great, as the original The Incredible Machine had excellent tunes) and even a working multiplayer mode! I see lots of potential here.\n\nAll in all, would I recommend this game? Heck, yes! This is the kind of game I'd want my own kids to enjoy.\nWell, maybe if you really HATE puzzles and Rube-Goldberg machines you should stay away from this. Otherwise, do try Contraption Maker, it will be worth every penny you spend on it.","December 21, 2013","true","33.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Nearly everything from TIM2 (or 3.0, etc) is there, featuring an interface that'll be second nature to any old veterans of the game.  It also adds in a few new parts here and there that take better advantage of a more robust physics engine and some graphical and design improvements you'd expect for a modern version of an older game.\n\nDefinitely worthwhile for any fan of the TIM series.  And even in its current unfinished state, well worth a look for anyone who wants to have fun designing virtual Rube Goldberg machines.","December 27, 2013","true","20.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

If so, or if you enjoy solving puzzles then check out Contraption Maker.\n\nBeing familiar with The Incredible Machine, I picked this up to reminisce and have some fun with puzzles. Besides, a two for one!? That's great.\n\nFor me the puzzles didn't get challenging until hard difficulty. Perhaps I was younger, however, I remember The Incredible Machine puzzles being much harder. Therefore, the previous difficulties seemed to just take time to put the pieces in place.\n\nPlay time included about 8-9 hours for me to finish all the official puzzles. Played some of the Editor's Choice community mods and puzzles. There certainly is much more content if you factor in the community puzzles. However, one challenge is that the game fails to keep a progress of what community puzzles you've solved--unlike the official puzzles.\n\nWith all that said, it's a great game, and I recommend it. Perhaps a 8/10. Support the developers if you'd like to see more of these types of options.\n\nCertainly have some fond memories of The Incredible Machine, so I'm pleased to see this released!","November 11, 2014","true","24.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Hours of my tutelage in the basement computer lab of my school were spent in blissful abandon playing that wonder of a game, comparing my elaborate constructions to my equally-enthralled pubescent minds, We were gods of all creation, and in our experimentation bonds of eternal friendship were erected alongside the craziest, most Goldbergian of useless designs. It was a fire of friendship that flared, roared, and fizzled away as we slowly grew apart.\n\nNow, in my twenties, apart from those pre-pubescent paragons of pointless perfection, the fire has been rekindled. This game is whimsical and childish enough to make you remember those happier childhood days without pandering to you.

Perhaps you're looking for some nice well written review! Well here I am!\nFirst off, I made a video review specifically for this game so feel free to check it out :)\nhttp://youtu.be/xyCdD2nWxM8\n**The written version:**\n\nI have to say that since the moment I discovered there is a remake of Incredible Machine being made by the same peeps that made it way back I was excited like a little baby and also cautious, because we all know how the remakes/sequels/etc. go right!?\n\nI fired this game up, a beautiful bright colourful menu with awesome music greeted me. Well this is starting great. I had little to no read about this game, haven't prepared and I just went for it as it was in my library. I fired up the tutorial sessions, and oh boy.. nostalgia punched me right in my face.\n\nI did finish the tutorial level in about 30 minutes, not letting my eyes go off the screen for a brief moment. This game is just addictive and plain fun. It's like 2D Gmod with awesome stuff like lasers, cannons, cheese, and much more. You didn't play the original Incredible Machine? Well no worries, you don't really have to! This game is great on its own (and even better if you know the original). The redesigned graphics are awesome and well fitting (apart from the cat animation that seemed weird to me), the music is creative, funny, positive and evoking a sense of playfulness. Everything is .. great!\n\nBut thats not all. Its not just a polished refurbished Incredible Machine. THIS THING HAS WORKSHOP! You can create contraptions and puzzles for other people to play, and there's already over a 1000!!! That's something absolutely great and adds up so much more to this game and genre! This is something that was not possible during the time Incredible Machine was released and its just AWESOME.\n\nAnd that's not all! There's multiplayer! YOU CAN BUILD STUFF WITH UP TO 7 FRIENDS! Holy cow. I haven't had the chance to try the multiplayer out yet, because my friends don't own this yet (I will make them), but oh boy thats something I'm so much looking forward too.\n\nAre you looking for a game that can bend by your logic and creativity? Do you wanna create fun machines that act complicated but do silly stuff? Do you wanna laugh? Want a game for the whole family? Want something that you fire up at any time and you have something to do every time? WELL THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! (And that's not even the whole list of questions!)\n\nPros\n+ Cute graphics\n+ Cute physics\n+ Workshop!\n+ Multiplayer :3\n+ Funny!\n+ Great music.\n+ LOT OF CONTENT\n+ Friendly and dedicated developers!!!!!!! (One of the VERY FEW successful early access games!)\n+ Nostalgia all the way! (if you played the original)\n+ For any age.\n\nCons\n- Addictive (OH GOD IS THAT A CON?!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RonBWL/recommended/241240/","RonBWL","Ronald Brain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RonBWL/","74 products in account","Contraption Maker really met my expectation - definitely worth the purchase especially I get an extra copy to share to friends.\n\nQuick facts for those too lazy to read on:\n\n+ TIM's successor with upgraded engine and physic\n+ Lots of new stuff to play with (parts, scenery...)\n+ Make mode for custom puzzle creation\n+ Steam Workshop (Share your own / play community's puzzles)\n+ 2-key pack (Great for gifting friends / do giveaway event)\n+ New content still coming everyone once in a while\n\n- Not working properly on small screen (Laptop users may find this bothersome)\n- Drag 'n drop replaced Click 'n drop, needs time to get used to\n\nNow it's full review (WARNING: Wall of text up ahead!)\n\nFor those who are new to the party, Contraption Maker is your Rube Goldberg puzzle games - you are given some parts to fill up in the contraption to achieve specific goal(s), and it's up to you to work out how they connect with each other. Tutorial levels are a good start to get to know all the parts, and the puzzles get harder and harder (and trickier) as you play through Easy, Normal and Hard. The best part of CM, just like original T.I.M, is that you can create your own puzzle / contraption, and with Steam Workshop, you can even publish them for other players to play. Community work will definitely keep this game long live even if the developers stop updating. One more thing, unofficially, you are even allowed to texture/sound mod CM to your heart's content (Though, part's physical won't change, just their appearance). I've heard that the developers intend to make it Steam Workshop friendly in the future, so custom skins are another new thing we could expect.\n\nContraption Maker hasn't changed much comparing to The Incredible Machine - if you love T.I.M, you will love CM as well because they are quite similar, and CM is made even better with new parts, physics and interface, something you definitely can't find with $15 for 2 copies pack. Of course there are some changes and tweak there and now (Such as you now have to drag 'n' drop parts and click on them to see additional options), but I guess we can get used to it in no time.\n\nGiven that CM has just left Early access, there are still some problems with minority user bases (me included, which is why I will state here). This game will not work properly on small monitor (Under 1280 x 720), so if you are using ancient LCD like me now, wait till you get a bigger one first. As mentioned, the change from drag 'n' drop parts and click on them for additional options can be a little annoying when building contraption / puzzle - if you won't zoom in, you may not be able to select the part you want to as the game just lock to whatever part near it instead. Finally, there are still some issue publishing contraption / puzzle to Workshop - unfortunately, a single "Failed" messenger won't help you much, you'd have to play around with your invention until it gets accepted, quite frustrating.\n\nHowever, despite all these minor setbacks, Contraption Maker is still a very good puzzle game, whether you are T.I.M fan or not. Especially recommended for those who likes to play with friends, and Multiplayer Online is a great feature as well.\n\nUpdate: 2-pack offer is back, stated deep in the description so you may miss it. You can now get an extra copy for your friends like in 1.0 release.\n\nUpdate #2: After a rather random recommendation on discussion forum, I never thought the devs actually put back the "Contraption Maker is a 2-copies pack - send the extra copy to your friends" at the Purchase window. This just shows how much they actually care about the game and us customers :D\n\nUpdate #3: Those who keeps whining for Achievements, they are out NOW, so if you still refuse to buy Contraption Maker, I really can't think of anything to convince you guys further - come on, give the devs some support, really!","July 8, 2014","true","31.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've heard that the developers intend to make it Steam Workshop friendly in the future, so custom skins are another new thing we could expect.\n\nContraption Maker hasn't changed much comparing to The Incredible Machine - if you love T.I.M, you will love CM as well because they are quite similar, and CM is made even better with new parts, physics and interface, something you definitely can't find with $15 for 2 copies pack. Of course there are some changes and tweak there and now (Such as you now have to drag 'n' drop parts and click on them to see additional options), but I guess we can get used to it in no time.\n\nGiven that CM has just left Early access, there are still some problems with minority user bases (me included, which is why I will state here). This game will not work properly on small monitor (Under 1280 x 720), so if you are using ancient LCD like me now, wait till you get a bigger one first. As mentioned, the change from drag 'n' drop parts and click on them for additional options can be a little annoying when building contraption / puzzle - if you won't zoom in, you may not be able to select the part you want to as the game just lock to whatever part near it instead. Finally, there are still some issue publishing contraption / puzzle to Workshop - unfortunately, a single "Failed" messenger won't help you much, you'd have to play around with your invention until it gets accepted, quite frustrating.\n\nHowever, despite all these minor setbacks, Contraption Maker is still a very good puzzle game, whether you are T.I.M fan or not. Especially recommended for those who likes to play with friends, and Multiplayer Online is a great feature as well.\n\nUpdate: 2-pack offer is back, stated deep in the description so you may miss it. You can now get an extra copy for your friends like in 1.0 release.\n\nUpdate #2: After a rather random recommendation on discussion forum, I never thought the devs actually put back the "Contraption Maker is a 2-copies pack - send the extra copy to your friends" at the Purchase window. This just shows how much they actually care about the game and us customers :D\n\nUpdate #3: Those who keeps whining for Achievements, they are out NOW, so if you still refuse to buy Contraption Maker, I really can't think of anything to convince you guys further - come on, give the devs some support, really!","July 8, 2014","true","31.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I used to have a game called "The Incredible Machine" on my old Pentium 90 (!!) many years ago. It was like a 'crazy inventor' contraption maker sandbox/puzzle game. In it, you solved puzzles along the lines of putting some cheese down to attract a mouse to move along a platform with a hole in it, just before the cheese. Just before it could reach the cheese, the said mouse would fall down the hole onto a switch wuich turned on a fan pointing at a ball perched right at the end of a platform. The fan would blow the ball onto a trampoline placed just underneath that platform. The ball would then bounce up off the trampoline to trigger another switch which, when triggered, would activate a conveyor belt with a lit candle on it. Just above the end of the conveyor belt was a rocket, which as soon as the candle reached the end of the conveyor belt, it would light the rocket's fuse and the rocket would take off, thereby solving the puzzle (phew!).\nAt the beginning of the level though, some of the above mentioned components would be missing and it would be up to you to choose the objects and place them in the right places to get the contraption to work properly and fire off the rocket. That was just one example of many puzzles, getting more complex and using more and more varied parts to make up some quite involved and ingenious contraptions.\nThis is the successor to that game, made by the same developers. Contraption Maker Is one of the cleverest and ingenious puzzle games out there. It also has a sandbox, as well as the pre-made puzzle levels, where you can make up your own weird and wonderful contraptions using as many varied and different objects as you like, making them as convoluted and complicated as you like. You can then upload them for other users to try and solve, giving this game almost infinite replayability.\nThey've even just added a multiplayer mode and as this is still a work in progress, there are even more features bound to be added. At the current price, this game is a steal!\nIf you are a puzzle game fan, buying this is a no brainer and is up there with the best of the genre and yes that includes Portal 1 and 2 providing you can overlook the fact that Portal was 3D whereas this is in 2D - now there's an idea for a sequel; a 3D Contraption Maker! As it stands though, it will run on even the most modest of PC's.\nI can recommend this game without hesitation. So what are you waiting for?","January 13, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Keeps the feeling of the original TIM while updating art and contraptions to nowadays. Art is somewhat childish and miss some of the old pixel original art. Sound FX and music is ok, reminds me of original game. Difficulty seems to be lower than TIM series, but I recall being only a child when first got a copy of the game. For children this is a real gem, while for adult you can get a smile while playing it.\n\nHopefully creators of contraption maker will target a more grown up public in future, or at least give a boost in the difficulty settings for downloadable content/future games","November 30, 2014","true","30.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles, parts and free form creative mode will all be instantly familiar to long time fans with newcomers to this series being able to pick it up in no time. It’s still shaking off it’s beta status with crashes and funky behaviour peppering it’s otherwise solid execution, something that I hope to see remedied in the not too distant future. Personally I think it will make an absolutely fantastic tablet game, one that the current generation of 10 year olds will remember as fondly as we do when it comes to The Incredible Machine today.\n\nRead my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/07/18/contraption-maker-ah-to-be-young-again/","July 18, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Guys who were children at the TIM machine era - nostalgia & old memories.\n\nIt's a kids' game basicly in my opinion(Well, TIM machine was meant to be as well).\n\nOn the positive side:\n\nThe graphic is sort of cartoon one, which I like it. Bunch of new tools and other stuff compare to the old game.\n\nMultiplayer is nice, you can set your own level and controlling everything. You can also download plenty of new levels that you can play in. There are also sort of creating level tournaments which is a nice add.\n\nCons:\n\n- All the levels are easy!!!!!!(Inlcuding Medium and Hard ones) it seems the creators got lazy making really hard ones\n\n- No more multiplayer options that could be nice(Complete a level in X time)\n\n- For people who prefer nice graphic it would be terrible\n\n- Still mainly for kids(Nothing against it, but people got old since :)\n\n- Not many levels\n\nOverall: I would say it'd be worth buying at a much lower price(I bought for 1.50$ when 90% discount)\n\nIt should be a 5$ game at the max.","December 15, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As the game is just in beta, the only thing I really hope is that they will add many more official puzzles. Didn't take long at all to complete them, and they didn't seem as challenging as the original. That being said, with this new reboot you do have the option of easily accessing other players puzzles and contraptions, but finding challenging ones that seems doable at this point is a challenge in and of itself.

The graphics are pretty childish, along with most of the tracks, and yet the non-rigid puzzle design of the main game alone is pretty entertaining and addictive. There are a lot, and I mean a LOT of maps where you can "cheat" a solution with 3-4 pieces, most of the time exploiting the physics when a prop lands on the diagonal surface of another prop you place. Doing things the "right way" is its own fun, but there's a certain thrill that comes when you realize you broke the intended sequence -- and I have no doubt the devs left these in for two reasons. #1: Those "aha" and "take that, game!" moments are both equally enjoyable at the right time, but also #2: the main emphasis is on the creator (I think I got 4 popups suggesting I go there before they just gave up), and allowing players to think outside the box trains the player to fully utilize the creator when they're ready to move away from the puzzles.\n\nIn any case, it's a goofy little Rube Goldberg device creator that's family friendly, and a nice little time killer. At the very least, pick it up for its uniqueness. My only complaint is the music gets repetitive after awhile, though it's definitely a nice throwback to comic tunes that could've easily existed in Rube Goldberg's era.","June 2, 2015","true","10.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It's good, clean fun for everyone that also challenges you to flex your mental muscles as well, both on developer-made as well as community-made puzzles.\n\nSome people will make claims that the game limits you by only giving one way to solve a given puzzle. Hardly the case, if you ask me. I solved more than a few puzzles with thinking so far out of the box that the official solution bore not the slightest resemblance what I ended up doing, and the puzzle still had the good grace to acknowledge my solution as valid because I accomplished the objective it demanded with the parts it provided, even if I didn't use them remotely like they were intended. This is clearly not a 'one answer and only one answer' game.\n\nDoes it have flaws? A few. The plug system takes a little getting used to (since the game now rather aggressively plugs in parts for you), and a handful of parts are a touch too loose in definition--the free rotation of smaller parts or walls isn't bad, but it can be a bit of a chore to line up some parts just right without relying on the snap-to function built into the game. I also miss the old music from the old The Incredible Machine days, but that's just auditory nostalgia on my part.\n\nAll in all though, a lot of fun for thinky folks. A cute little game that brings back good old memories while remaining accessible and affordable in spite of a few minor hiccups.","July 29, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are a staggering amount of official puzzles (I'm nowhere near finishing them all) of varying difficulties, and most of the ones I've played are great.  There are also a ton of community-made puzzles.  Some of them are really good, and some are terrible but funny in their terribleness.\n\nThe most fun part for me was the level editor.  You can make your own contraptions and puzzles using all the parts in the game.  The editor is a little awkward, but generally easy to use.\n\nMost annoying part of the game is the bad UI.  The actual game mechanics are really well-done, so I have no clue why they failed so badly with the UI. Exiting a puzzle should take you back to the page number where you found the puzzle, not the main puzzle page.  There should also be an in-game way to search through the puzzles by name or author, how does this not exist?  These are really basic features- it makes you wonder if they actually tested anything outside of the puzzles/contraptions.\n\nBut it's still a really fun game, or else I'd never put up with the other stuff.  It's very satisfying to create a convoluted contraption all just to accomplish the simple task of, say, turning on a blender.","September 17, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Aw man, I always wanted to play that when I was young!"\n\nIn short, Contraption Maker is a puzzle game about making Rube Goldberg-type machines to solve some sort of problem. Put the basketball in the box, get the tool guy home safely, feed the dog, break the lamp, fire the rocket. Simple enough, right?\n\nWell, it falls into one of the problems you typically run into when making a sandbox puzzle game: Each puzzle typically has either one blindingly obvious solution, because all of the other possibilities have been prevented at great effort, or it has several solutions, each more convoluted than the last, and the player is likely to come up with a solution which is radically different from what the puzzle designer intended. Often a solution which doesn't resemble the intended one, and which typically doesn't use most of the parts made available, or which exploits something the designers never considered.\n\nAll fine and good, right? The whole point of games like this is to come up with a creative solution. The game even includes a video recording feature so that you can make a video of your favorite solutions and upload them to Youtube.\n\nWell, except that sometimes the "solution" is not entirely clear, and because of this, the player may end up spending time solving the puzzle only to find out that what they thought was a "solved" state is... not? And there aren't any hints of any sort available in-game to help guide players towards the expected goal.\n\nI play puzzle games for the sense of accomplishment I get when I figure something out. Or to learn new tricks when I'm forced to give up and check what the "official" solution was supposed to be. After completing most of the puzzles in this game, I never once got that sense of satisfaction. I always felt like I was fighting against the puzzle designers, not figuring things out on my own, and as a result I found myself more and more prone to using cheap tricks and underhanded techniques to bypass what the puzzle designer no doubt thought would be clever contraptions. I viewed playing the game as less "What's the next puzzle I get to solve?" and more "Well, I paid the money for it, I should probably finish it."\n\nFinally, of course, I mentioned inexact objectives and that I only finished most of the levels? Well I ran into one level in particular which stated a fairly simple goal(put a pair of jack-o-lanterns in a cardboard box), but upon completing the objective, I found that the simulation continued running, refusing to give me credit for solving the puzzle. There's also one puzzle I was only able to solve using a glitch in the physics engine, and consiquentially my solution worked exactly once and was not reproducible(since each simulation run is subject to some randomness). I've come to expect a higher level of quality from the free puzzle games I play, let alone the ones that I'm willing to lay down cash for. Physics glitches should never be valid solutions.\n\nAlso one of the songs sounds like an old west saloon remix of Maralyn Manson's "The Beautiful People," which I thought was hilarious.","November 21, 2015","false","13.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"

TIM3 was the high point of the series, but to me the Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions was a big let-down and a huge step back. Also, having tried some other remakes of my old favorites, like some of the new Worms games, I was more than a bit sceptical on how this game would turn out.\n\nLuckily I was worried for nothing! I find the new TIM.. I mean, Contraption Maker, every bit as good as its best predecessor. The easy puzzles are, of course, really easy, and there's a lot of them, but you can skip to the more difficult puzzles whenever you want for the added satisfaction of solving them. You can also pick any one from the pre-made 200-300 puzzles, so you won't get stuck without being able to continue.\n\nThere's also, of course, the free building mode, where you can create your own contraptions and puzzles, and share them via Steam Workshop, which is nicely built into the game. There's a good amount of parts and people have been constructing some pretty great things. What's more, there's even support for modding.\n\nWarmly recommended for anyone into puzzle or building games.","November 4, 2015","true","51.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If I had to nitpick, I'd say that the art style is rather off-putting and at times it even confuses me, to the point where I can't tell what I'm looking at (which is horrible, because the original games were designed so that you could understand what most of the objects did by looking at them). Secondly, while I don't necessarily think the original games had amazing music, the music they have here is rather bland at best, to annoying at worst.\n\nBut obviously I wouldn't be giving this a thumbs up if I didn't think it was worth it. Compared to all the contemporaries that have cropped up in recent years, Contraption Maker is a wonderful return to form for a series that has long been neglected. The game mechanics are good, the interface takes a bit of getting used to for a TIM veteran but I've grown to like it.\n\nIf there was a way to create custom assets and different music libraries for this game, I would be glad, because virtually everything besides the underlying mechanics sort've lets this whole package down in a way. Not enough for me to hate it, per se, but I think the difference here is that I can play the old TIM games for hours on end, whereas this game I need to pause every now and then and wash my eyes.","April 23","true","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Probably the same place as the original Incredible Machine series, but oh well.\n\nSo now that it's actually had time to come together, I can safely say this is the new, proper successor to The Incredible Machine. Parts abound, the new physics engine feels more realistic, and a bundle of new parts and part interactions means all sorts of interesting new puzzle opportunities. Vertically oriented scissors! Tie ropes to a bunch of stuff you couldn't before, including platforms used to precariously balance other objects! Create a recursive assembly line with part manufacture and disposal points! Expand the playing field to a theoretically infinite size, and build as much as you want! It's a real gem, and I regret putting it off for this long after the first phase of Early Access felt so chintzy.\n\nIn some ways it does still feel oddly chintzy. The aesthetic of many of the parts very much rides the razor's edge between "smoothly designed" and "cheap looking", and some of them seem to have a terrifying size disparity. The interface screams "mobile game", even though it's PC-only. Some part interactions still feel like they're completely missing sound effects. You'll get a popup asking if you want to follow their Twitter. There are typos in the news on the title screen. There are visual bugs here and there, and the Camera Animation Tool is, while clever for presentation, one of the most infuriatingly buggy tools I've worked with.\n\nBut you know what? It is the best game yet for making some got-dang Rube Goldberg goodness, and it's criminally cheap to boot. Some of the golden standouts of the 80's and 90's are really finding new footing again, and this is one of 'em.","May 21","true","13.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can solve the puzzle a different way, but the game doesn't accept the solution as valid as the victory condition programmed in isn't the same as the one presented to the player. Sadly, it does not get better from there. Even the hard puzzles are incredibly easy and contain wholly unnecessary elements to provide the same obvious hints as earlier levels. Usually these sorts of games try to draw out the player's creativity.

Long story short if you dont run a 64-bit build of Linux, 64 still being the minority in the Linux world due to it not being as necessary, nothing will be downloaded and the game will in turn not launch. They have no plans to fix this so if you have been screwed over get your steam refund while you still can. There have also been a number of launch issues on other platforms in which the team has no longer proactive in fixing.\n\nBeyond this there are still a number of TIM gadgets from the newer games that are missing.\n\nMy best advice is track down a copy of TIM: Even More Contraptions instead, the team seams to have really bitten off more than they could chew with Contraption Maker.","November 11, 2015","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

They have a multiplayer feature but its not really multiplayer... I thought i would be like 1v1 who ever uses the most things in their contraption wins you have 5 mins GO! Thats what i thought it would be like.... It does give you 2  copies of the game one to give to your friend. The problem is none of my friends would like this game. So i just used it for trades. This game is ok but like i said its like an app on your phone... It gets boring after awhile. If you brought the price down i think more people would buy it.

Yes, I see that the electric plugs connect automatically, and the wals and conveyor belts dont snap to huge squares any more, but whether that is an improvement seems ambiguous to me. No way to really edit anything substantial in the workshop has been demonstrated. Joins of different types of walls (or simply two pieces of wall) are not implemented (the original game's joins were absolutely spectacular)\nin short, the graphics right now are worse than the windows release of Incredible machine, and other sprite games of the period, for example Creatures 3. Looks more like something that would be on an iPad with microtransactions, such as Mega Jump. Perhaps the gameplay will be gradually expanded, but so far between the inferior graphics, the iffy controls, and the unnecessarily free positioning, I recomend the original over this. And it doesn't look like the visual style is goign to be fixed.\nI was reffering to this version of the game - http://resource.mmgn.com/Gallery/full/The-Incredible-Machine-Z5CC.jpg","June 12, 2014","false","1.6"," 18 of 82 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","18","82","0","1"

TIM was essentially a kids game with some cool kinetic trap making that allowed for adults to have fun playing it too.\n\nContraption Maker was fun.  I have two downsides that are pretty much entirely subjective.  First, the graphics are bright and cheery.  That would seem like a positive for some, but for me it's like looking at a rainbow that is moving.  It gets slightly irritating after awhile.  Secondly, I felt as though the game attempted to be more on the funny side rather than the serious side.\n\nI don't know who their target audiece was, and I felt that the game might be too complex for kids, and too childish for adults.\n\nWith all that being said, I would ultimately recommend this game.

TIM was essentially a kids game with some cool kinetic trap making that allowed for adults to have fun playing it too.\n\nContraption Maker was fun.  I have two downsides that are pretty much entirely subjective.  First, the graphics are bright and cheery.  That would seem like a positive for some, but for me it's like looking at a rainbow that is moving.  It gets slightly irritating after awhile.  Secondly, I felt as though the game attempted to be more on the funny side rather than the serious side.\n\nI don't know who their target audiece was, and I felt that the game might be too complex for kids, and too childish for adults.\n\nWith all that being said, I would ultimately recommend this game.  It is fun.  I put sunglasses on for the colors, and I am happy that such a game still exists.  Maybe a few kids will latch onto it, and maybe a few adults will relive nostalgia.","November 5, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was one of the only games in the school's computers, and I really enjoyed the game. It's great to see that the team behind TIM are still active. Contraption Maker is also a very enjoyable game but I was somewhat disappointed to see that it's almost the same game after 10+ years. The only changes seem to be the HD visuals and somewhat better physics. I expected more innovation than that. Also, the missions feel easier than before but that's probably because I was like 9 years old when I last played it and now I'm 22... Overall, it's a great puzzle game with more potential that could be unlocked in the future. I'd recommend it to any puzzle lovers and old TIM fans.","October 12, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After rolling a bowling ball to ignite a lighter which fires a cannon that shoots a ball which hits scissors which cut a rope and release a blimp which hits a fist which punches a hamster cage and then the hamster cage starts rotating a wheel which moves a conveyor belt and rolls explosives onto a ball which flies off the map, I was pretty much convinced that I would like this game.  Has lots of parts, was updated recently, and has multiplayer compatibility.  This game is cool.  I also got 2 copies of the game for $3 during a sale.  The only issue I experience is that the game will occaisionally freeze which causes me to have to restart it.  Other than that, I love it.\n\n\n10/10 would ignite a lighter which fires a cannon which hits... again","February 8, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It follows the same logic (or arguably lack thereof in some cases), and does encourage you to draw on knowledge from various areas, such as mixing primary colours. This allows it to work well for both adults and children alike, and I suspect its target is children supervised by parents for help with the harder puzzles. And trust me, there are ones even adults will likely have a head-scratch over (I know I have at times!).\n\nMy only real gripes are that the controls are a little iffy, particularly with placing parts. The menus around items are not context-sensitive so it can get frustrating when placing items in certain areas, as you can't access the menus properly - you have to rotate somewhere else before putting the part in, as an example - which means some puzzles require more clicks than they need simply because there's no allowance made for menus going off the screen. The game also does seem to hold your hand a little too long, with many of the first puzzles (even past the first 50) being a case of 'clone/mirror the other half of the screen' or 'fill the obvious blank', so it can get a little tiresome early on.\n\nBut do continue. It's good.","February 24","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Did you spend hours and hours in the puzzle editor trying to make ever more elaborate puzzles to stump your siblings and/or friends?  Good news, then: they may be calling this a "spiritual sequel" to the original, but this isn't just like TIM -- it is almost EXACTLY the same game. Which, in case it wasn't already clear, is a good thing.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the original, read some of the other reviews that are already here (tl;dr -- Rube Goldberg machine builder). They made a few changes in the decade or so since the old games, but they're all pretty much quality-of-life adjustments. The graphics have been updated, the physics engine seems to be more sophisticated, and the interface is far more user-friendly (electrical cords visibly auto-attach to nearby outlets, lasers have an indicator while you move them around so you don't have to keep turning your machine on and off to find out where they're pointing, and light/wind sources similarly show you how far they extend).\n\nMore importantly, almost all of the parts from the old games made it in, and they've added some new ones! A timed laser repeater and a beam splitter for even more elaborate laser mazes, physics-enabled domino blocks, and a programmable "part creator" that spits out a stream of objects and will probably result in endless absurd shenanigans. Oh, and an egg. The egg is important. (Also, they've released free Halloween and Christmas updates with new parts!)\n\nFinally, the addition of community content naturally means that you have access to tons more puzzles than there ever were in the original games.\n\nThis is just one of those classic games that makes perfect sense to update for the current generation, taking advantage of better computer hardware and Steam's platform for sharing player-created content. An old favorite that's even better than it used to be. Totally worthwhile.","December 22, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has almost all the original items and concepts, plus an ever-increasing amount more. I'm surprised how much I like all the online features too. My only qualm would, of course, be the repetitive music.","November 29, 2015","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's really neat that the devs are using this game as an initiative to teach kids, and warms my heart that the the original IM dev (Kevin Ryan) is involved in the project. Brings back really fond memories, can't recommend this enough.","April 19","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It brings me back to the days of The Incredible Machine, which was the sandbox game of my childhood. I feel that this game doesn't get enough praise for how much fun it is, but the game industry is far too washed out with FPS games. More people need to play this game and put their mind to work.\nMy favorite thing about this game is trying to complete each puzzle using as few pieces as possible instead of completing the puzzle the way it was meant to be.\nIf only the team would add more puzzles because the community made puzzles rather stink and are not usually up to par with the official puzzles.","June 2","true","48.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
