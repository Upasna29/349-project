From out of the ether, a ghost tells you to find the light to bring back the sun.   You flash your highbeams to uncover the secret fire in a ring of moths and a kickin' 80s electro-rock riff shreds the truth of your victory in defiance to all the ghosts of lost drivers on this forgotten road.  How is this not a Led Zeppelin song?  We're talking air-brushed-on-the-side-of-a-van levels of ♥♥♥♥♥in' and righteous in that order.\n\nSo as you can tell, I love the idea of this game.  How much do I hate giving this game a negative review then?  A lot.  A real lot.  I really hate reviewing games like Night Shift: games that have got a full tank of new ideas, but lay on the gas and they explode long before they reach the promised land.  Watch a "Red Asphalt" video and you'll have an idea of what I mean when I say NIght Shift is poorly executed.  And it's unfortunate that it is, since that makes this review one of those back and forths where I have to praise the game, telling diehard fans of the genre "NO PASSING" on this one and, out of the other side of my mouth, damn it for its many faults and tell most readers, "DO NOT ENTER."\n\nAlright, alright.  Let's shift this thing into gear!  What exactly is wrong with the game?  Chiefly, it's more cryptic than a hearse doing doughnuts in a mausoleum.  Night Shift starts being exactly that obtuse right from the start where it (one can only assume) deliberately obfuscates how to play the game.  Not only is there no tutorial, but if you decide to get clever and go to the menu to try and find the keys from the rebinding options, be prepared for disappointment.  There's no such option.  But, hey, this is basically a 2.5D FPS in layout, so W, A, S, D, Space, and E are pretty much the holy gospel of game design, so maybe we can give it a pass?\n\nMaybe, but the game continues to be as impenetrable as an ice queen in barbed-wire panties with the layout of its many puzzles.  To find one, you drive around aimlessly for long stretches of minutes until hopefully you stumble backasswards into one.  And god help you if you should leave the puzzle because you decided to test the problem by moving just too far out of the puzzle's bounds or you got momentarily frustrated.  You will have a lot more aimless driving ahead of you as you try and guess how the handful of landmarks are related to each other or if they are at all.  You know those RPG type games, like Zelda, where sometimes they have a screen that will repeat if you don't exit it from exactly the right direction several times?  It feels like that, except after a ton of random wandering you hit a puzzle.\n\nSo I found driving around in the dirt without a clear sense of direction really frustrating.  But this is a game about driving at night and the atmosphere is great, it's a major draw, and this lets you experience it.  Fair enough.  The actual puzzles and how they relate to the controls are pretty dodgy.  Quite a few of the puzzles rely on you flashing your high beams at things, but the time between when you hit the button and when the beams flash is very sluggish and they only affect objects that are an annoyingly precise distance from the car.  This makes hitting the enemy ghost cars and other puzzles that rely upon timing your flash a teeth-grindingly grotesque experience.  And, for some reason, you can only flash your beams while completely stopped, which badly breaks the flow of driving through the night.  If real cars worked that way, I wager I'd have a lot more speeding tickets, if you know what I mean.\n\nJust like in real life, you can get a single sentence hint for some puzzles by running over a nearby ghost.  And there are a few other clues like the activity on your radio and the descriptions for the game's achievements (yes, I needed to use them to figure out how to solve a couple of them).  But, overall, the puzzles are wickedly unclear.  To give you an example:  there was one puzzle that gave me the victory music after I wasted some ghost cars, but after pulling about a million U-eys looking for my prize, I finally gave up driving in the manner of my Polish heritage and continued into the night where the victory music died, right into another half of the puzzle that I accidentally solved while trying to return to where the music was.  There were at least two puzzles I still don't know the logic behind but I solved them somehow in a crowning moment of "huh, I guess I was supposed to do that?"\n\nThat said, I did solve all of them by myself in less than three hours, so they aren't impossible.  But that brings us to the last nail in the coffin that was at some point meant to be a favorable review for Night Shift:  it's short.  There are only seven puzzles in the game.  Yeah, they'll take you a while, but only because the game is stick-a-paper-bag-over-your-head levels of opaque and there's so much driving around lost in the dark to get to the puzzles.  And while the game's atmosphere is thick and rich like a seven layer chocolate cake, the story is more like a single chocolate chip.  There is really no more than the blurb on the store page:\n\n"The sun has disappeared from the sky! Darkness chokes the land, depriving it of all things good. Now it’s time for you to figure out how to bring the sun back! Get behind the wheel and find the sun in Night Shift!"\n\nThat's really it.  No further characterization of you or the task at hand or the world around you.\n\nSo that's my long list of grievances with Night Shift.  And I'm sad to have it.  The ending to the game was easily the most radical thing to happen since the 80s ended and the overall tone and idea behind the game are great!  How many adventure games exist where you play as a car driving on a 2.5D haunted highway practically reinacting the song "Radar Love?"  Night Shift.  That's it.  And that's why I can still recommend it to long time veterans of adventure games who have legendary patience and can put up with  logic that's been filtered through glue sniffing.  But to everyone else: sorry, you'll find more frustration than fun.  And even to those adventure gamers who will stick around for something new, there's really not enough here to be worth the cost of an entire gallon of gas.  There are meatier indie games with better puzzles and more character for the same price.  Wait for it to go on sale.","February 26, 2015","false","2.7"," 85 of 100 people (85%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","85","85","100","14","3"

The puzzles that I played were not all that difficult, but they were a lot of fun and gave me a good sense of accomplishment upon completion. The puzzles give you very little guidance, but when you're on the right track, it will give you some indication through the soundtrack gradually getting more complex or some sort of visual display. The soundtrack is one of the best parts of the game and the gradual shifts it makes as you progress are very satisfying!\n\nI'd have to say that this game is more for the mystery/puzzle game enthusiasts rather than driving. While the driving controls and gameplay are fine, the game would would have been just as appealing to me if you played as someone walking around in the dark with a flash light. But I can think of a few games that have done something like that, whereas a puzzle/mystery driving game is a new breed for me.","June 18, 2014","true","3.4"," 54 of 72 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","54","72","0","2"

Whether they are real or a figment of your driver's sleep deprived imagination is unknown. The world you've cruised into is the essence of 80's obsession with a technological dystopia and sunless futures, the soundtrack (Dance With the Dead - http://dancewiththedead.bandcamp.com/album/out-of-body) the embodiment of cyberpunk, retro-future values recently re-popularized by the likes of Perturbator or the rest of the artists on the ever-popular Hotline Miami soundtrack. Night Shift caught my attention recently with it's appearance on Steam's Early Access, standing out with it's strangely unique concept and almost Knight Rider-like aesthetic.\n\nNight Shift is a decidedly confusing game, pitting your solitary and anonymous retro hero against the empty pitch-black depths of the unknown and ruined roads before you. Many questions are presented without any real explanation, what happened to this world, who are these other phantasms and who is our driver, what exactly am I supposed to be doing? You're dropped into the pitch black land without any clue or indication of what to do other than the trail of butterflies leading you back on the road setting you on the right path for exploration. The gameplay is very straightforward and simple in execution but sprawling and secretive in it's discovery, having you explore and steal light from dimming lamp posts with your seemingly magical high beams while watching your energy closely, which can only be recharged by the glowing white trees that stand out in the darkness. You'll be stopped on your journey to gather and restore the light around you by the ghostly apparitions of other cars, perhaps even previous drivers on the same failed quest to find the sun as you?\n\nNight Shift already has an attractively old school and fully realized atmosphere, but in it's current form lacks any narrative as to what you're doing or where you are which while effective in it's mysterious and strange nature is exactly why it's in Early Access. The developer, creator of the puzzle-platformer 10000 Amps, apparently has some pretty ambiguous ideas for where the story is headed in the future of Night Shift and is enlisting your help to ensure it's further shaped into something great with the addition of story cinemas and lots of new plot, new levels, as well as full Steam integration for controller support, achievements, cards and the like.\n\nOverall, Nightshift is an awesome and quirky concept with a really cool dark and retro atmosphere that still has a long ways to go in terms of the overall experience given, and if you're the kind of person who's keen on watching as well as help an uncommon and unique idea develop into something even bigger you can pick it up for a very reasonable $4.99. I'm personally pretty excited to see where this one goes.","June 27, 2014","true","5.5"," 55 of 74 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","55","74","2","1"

Night Shift is one of those games.\nI've no doubt that anyone interested will be looking at the screenshots and video available on the store page, and wonder why would they ever play a retro game. The answer is, you won't, the game will play you.\n\nIt cannot be seen, cannot be felt,\nCannot be heard, cannot be smelt,\nIt lies behind stars and under hills,\nAnd empty holes it fills,\nIt comes first and follows after,\nEnds life, kills laughter.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Night Shift.\n\nGameplayThere's an old saying that goes something like this: All roads lead to Rome. This is not the case. All roads will lead you to the dark, a long and empty dark. Until a light appears, and you follow the light, thinking it will lead you home. It won't. It will force your mind to think of ways to make the light show you the way.\nNight Shift is, sort of, a puzzle game, one that does not provide the players all the clues, but it does provide you the melody to light that flame of yours that will light up the world, or at least find your way out of the dark.\nThe game consists of a series of challenging puzzles, some of which are more like charades, and the end goal is to bring enough flames to the sun so that the world can shine once again.\nThe graphics might feel retro, but do not let that fool you, it fits like a glove, and so does the soundtrack, which will make you take a trip down the memory lane.\n\nLet there be light.\n\nPros Quick and concise tutorial;\nChallenging;\nGreat soundtrack, the music is really nice;\nRetro graphics incredibly well adapted to the game.\nPrice;\nGuaranteed entertainment when watching a friend trying to do a complete playthrough;\nA wonderful sense of accomplishment when you finish the game.\nQuite frankly, there aren't many cons to the game, as it delivers everything it promises.\n\nCons Should have an option to enable some hints;\nCan be considered a bit short if you're a puzzle master.\nVerdictI'd give it a 9/10 It's a really interesting challenge, that you can easily play on your own, or even have your friends play and laugh as they fail miserably to find their way, only to get their mind blown away when they find the way.","April 13, 2015","true","3.0"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","28","35","0","4"

I'm not making that up.\n\nNight Shift as stated before is a driving puzzle game. You play as a driver who must save the world with the help of his muscle car. One day the entire world is consumed by the dark and you need to save it.\n\nNight Shift consists of you driving around and solving cryptic puzzles. It always ranges from a few different puzzles like destroying cars, turning on lamp posts and looking for butterflies. Your main goal is to collect 6 flames and to destroy the orb that's consumed the sun. You have a few buttons that do different things. You can drive around, flash cars and turn off and on the car lights.\n\nThe music is pretty much non existent. You have one track which serves you as a indicator if you solved the puzzle. There's no music if you don't do the first part of the puzzle, you get a very quiet version of the song if you do something right and if you complete the puzzle you hear the full uncut and loud version of the song which I though was an interesting way to use music as an indicator.\n\nThe graphics are pixel art type art style. I love the graphics in this game as I love all pixel type games. Overall the graphics are okay.\n\nThe game took me 3 hours in total to finish. It might take longer for some people as some of the puzzles are incredibly hard and very very cryptic.\n\nApart from the one playthrough you will do there's basically next to no replay value.\n\nIn the end I would say only buy this game on a sale or skip it entirely. While the game is a fun time, it's way too cryptic and short for the full price.\n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10 - Buy only on sale or skip\n\nIf you liked this review consider giving it a like and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 24, 2015","true","2.4"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","2"

Proceed with caution.\n\nIn Night Shift, you play a driver trying to bring the flame back to the sun and light up the world. You play in first-person view from inside the car. The game consists of a series of puzzles that you reward you with pieces of the sun's flame. Puzzle-solving involves the manupilation of light, mostly using the car's headlights. You drive in darkness in loops, till you stumble upon a puzzle. Throughout my playthrough, it seemed that once I've hit a puzzle, driving off would bring me back to the same puzzle again, which probably means that the game gives you the puzzles in sequence, rather than having all of the puzzles available at the same time. The puzzles tend to be obtuse and some of the requirements are a bit too fussy (i.e. I would know what needs to be done, but find the execution difficult). The game makes nice use of audio cues: choppy guitar riff for partial solutions and full-on blaring guitar goodness when the puzzle is solved). The game is on the short side, as it took me 1.5 hrs to fully complete it (though to be fair, I cheated on one puzzle that frustrated me).

This should mean the game is very simple, but the challenge is never in what to do, but where and when to do it.\n\nIn one level you may be trying to re-light lanterns that have gone out, in another you may be eliminating ghost cars with your lights, and in yet another (or another part of the same level) you may simply be lost and looking for the road.\n\nWhat really ties together the game are its minimal yet functional graphics as well as some really good sound design, especially in the music compartment.

Weird stuff happens. The mechanics are unique and make it fun interacting with the world. Such as using your headlights to blast away evil stuff and lighting up the world! The graphics are certainly retro-styled which make it intriguing and the music is very good.\n\nI think a hint system at least is needed when players get stuck; this would be very nice. I found myself getting stuck for many minutes at a time, and it makes the experience not fun. Stuck on one particular part right now for about 15-20 minutes. Still not sure what to do. One example of a hint system would be Broken Sword's hint system.\n\nIt being easier or some form of hint system, would certainly stop me getting annoyed at certain moments. Although if the story is rich and detailed that might not be so much of a problem. But I think it is something to consider. :)\n\nOther than that I give this game a 6 out of 10 so far, a game with an interesting concept but needs some work on the execution still. Hopefully the developer can tweak the gameplay a little to make it a bit more easier, but they are working on the story which will make it feel more like a living world.","June 19, 2014","true","0.8"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/f-ingsweet/recommended/301050/","f-ingsweet","Doctor Smiles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/f-ingsweet/","650 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe road in front of me receded into an empty void. It felt like I had been driving forever. The radio stuttered and crackled, catchy tunes occasionally popping in as I continuously drove, searching for the answers to our mysteriously disappeared sun.\n\nThank Christ I bought one of those fancy electric cars, because I haven’t seen a gas station for miles in this damn game. Only weird electrical trees. Welcome to the world of Night Shift, a currently in-development indie title by Brandon Brizzi that attempts to blend puzzle-solving with driving cars in a very 1980s retro-futuristic themed world. There really isn’t a story written up for the game at the moment, beyond the basic idea that “the sun has disappeared, go try to find and save it by solving puzzles. Oh, and there are ghosts for some reason.”\n\nControl over your car is relatively straightforward. You use the WASD keys to move in any direction, and you use the spacebar to flash your high beams at things like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In addition, the E key turns your headlights off entirely if you choose, but there’s no real point to do so from what I can tell. The kicker here for me though is that you have to find all this out simply by finding out for yourself. There’s no list of key bindings in the settings, no tutorial or any kind of information to let you know what you’re able to do or not do, nothing. For a game this simple (and early in development), I can let it slide for now, but not everyone likes the whole “figure it out for yourself” take when it comes to learning how to control what you’re doing in-game.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it’s just a lot of roaming around and solving several different puzzles. Remember those ghosts I mentioned earlier? Well, currently they come in two flavors: Little specters that sit on the side of the road, and aggressive ghost cars which try to ram into you. Thankfully, both can be killed by flashing them.  When it came to the specters though, for the longest time I would keep killing them and think nothing of it. Even though they respawn, what I didn’t realize was some of them (Maybe even all of them) actually give you hints on how to solve the puzzles. I didn’t discover this until the last puzzle, which I was totally stumped on, and I ended up finding this little hint system on pure accident.  When you solve a puzzle, a little white flame appears that you collect, and it flies off to a magical glowing rock that sits in the desert. By the way, if you’re like me, you’ll more than likely keep passing that same damn rock while driving around just trying to figure out what to do, or where to go. On a side note, I think this game could use a benefit from having a bit more action-based gameplay, as it would really go well with some of rather more adventurous music the game has. In terms of graphics, having things set in first-person was definitely the best fit since you are driving a car everywhere you go. However, when you do finally choose to go do a little off-roading, you’ll find there is quite literally NOTHING out there but a barren wasteland that is too dark to really see in. And since the map seamlessly loops, you can find sometimes yourself continuously revisiting the same long patch of terrain for eternity. Personally, I think it would be cool if you passed through a deserted city or something occasionally, to give things a change of scenery.\n\nBest ending ever.The soundtrack is great, it really is where this game shines the most I think. All of the music was composed by a band named Dance With The Dead, who make some pretty awesome and catchy electropop, and it really fits well with the artistic themes of the game. Unfortunately, I do have one slight grievance. From what I experienced, the music only plays in-game when you’re in an area that’s attached to one of the puzzles. If you’re out roaming, all you’ll get is the ambience of your car’s engine as you try to find your way back to wherever you’re supposed to be. Other than that, complete silence.\n\nNight Shift is currently on Steam for $5, and while I’m not exactly satisfied with it, I think I can grant it benefit of the doubt for the moment because, as I’ve stated before, it’s still being worked on. I feel like this is a game that does have the potential to be something good if the developer can manage to expand the gameplay beyond just “drive, solve puzzle, drive.”\n\nhttp://wtbfun.com/night-shift-an-early-look/","October 15, 2014","true","11.8"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","16","27","2","3"

This is a "puzzle" game that consists of driving around in a dark desert with no real indication of what you're doing, with the worst car controls I've ever seen in video gaming.  It is as bland as you could possibly imagine, and then some.  Zero redeeming qualities here.  The "mystery" of figuring out what's going on falls completely flat and nothing develops.  The game simply ends at some point after you drive around hitting space bar next to lamps.  Clicking the uninstall button was much more satisfying than anything inside the game.\n\nEven if you get this for free, spend your time elsewhere.","October 6, 2015","false","3.6"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

I never really play any games twice to be honest so saying that means something about this little charm. Sure, the puzzles can be a B!tch to solve at times and I had to resort to the internet once.  Not knowing the puzzles this game might take you almost an hour or 2, and knowing the puzzles you can beat it in I'd say around 20 mins maybe even less. Even though its short, its HIGHLY rewarding and everytime I see the flame and hear Dance with the Dead I just smile and feel completely proud of myself then its time to solve another puzzle. Although I do have one complaint about one of the puzzles and I still have no idea how a keep solving it (It's the one where the ghost says "Own the road". Other than that the puzzles are pretty simple. I'd say buy this game if you like a puzzle game for a cheap price.","February 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was rather engrossed in the atmosphere and completely perplexed as to what was going on. Why was the sun gone? Who are these bluish ghost people? Who am I? Why am I the only one on the road? All the while trying to figure out the various puzzles scattered throughout the desolate landscape.\n\nI must say that it's rare for a simple puzzle game to make me question the world around me but Night Shift seems to have pulled that off rather well. This game is a good example of doing more with less; with minimal assets it manages to pull off a strangely immersive experience. That constant questioning of what the hell was going on combined with the abstract puzzle solving really succeeded in my opinion. The constant confusion seems to work in the games favor; which is certainly a rarity in my experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, I had a blast with Night Shift; and I eagerly await whatever awaits in the coming updates and eventual release. My favorite moment thus far was the soundtrack coming on in full force after completing a puzzle; it was pure joy. I must give a big thanks to Brandon Brizzi for making this enigma of a game!","July 16, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I managed to somehow progress by driving around, and weird ghosts giving me clues as to how to progress even further.  This is an absolutely strange game and is is best described as a FPS driving puzzle game.  The highlight of this game?  Definitely the 80's music.  While being loops that start to play if certain conditions in solving a puzzle are met I still found them extremely satisfying and for me personally I thought it was the best part of the game.   Can I recommend this game?  That is really a tough call.  I know it'll appeal to some people and totally turn others off.  If you lack patience I'd say steer clear of this game.  If you like something different and the screenshots appeal to you and enjoy obscure puzzle games while you are behind the wheel of a car and listening to some looped 80's jams?  you might enjoy this game.

As I write this, the soundtrack is playing in the background, and even after listening to the same loop for at least 15 minutes now, it still gives me chills. So much delicious synth. Where on earth did Night Shift go wrong?\n\nTo set the record straight, I'd been keeping my eye on this since it's been on early access. The chill music and 2.5d graphics really brough some nostalgia out in me, and the premise of just a weird, cool driving game with ghosts and ghost cars had me so excited. You see, at the time, I thought Early Access was that of beautiful promise. I expected, since it was incubating so long, that I would get a game that really gave me that strange want to drive my own personal Christine, but without the murder. You get...you get something completely different, and also something depressingly short. Is it bad? No. That's what's so awful. It's well made. It's thought out. It does it's best to mess with you and mess with your knowledge of the game. Just when I began anticipating the clever puzzles (this is oddly enough an adventure game), the game ends. It ended barely before the hour and a half mark. I'm letting it chug so I can get my trading cards, but really, it's just a two hour game, and most of it is long stretches of nothing.\n\nIn a weird way, that's kind of what I was expecting; something more akin to a laidback hitch hinking simulator a la Glitchhiker, or just a visual feast of the 80s with a soundtrack to sleep to. Weirdly, it's more about ghosts dropping ambiguous hints and flashing headlights at ghost cars. There is no explanation to the mechanics, and driving around in circles hoping to find some indication of what you're supposed to do is laughably tactless. Once you get into the pattern, it does its best to throw you off. That's all well and good, except for the fact it doesn't really lead to anything. Of the seven puzzles, there is one in particular that drove me nuts. Basically, you have to flash lamp posts to turn them on.\n\nYou do this a lot. It's boring. It doesn't help that your only way of interacting can be done when you're not driving. There's no point to it except ruining any potential flow the game could've had. God I want to love this game. Basically, there are four light posts, but you only need to flash one to turn them all on. The victory music starts playing, but it's warbled. What am I missing? Turns out, you're supposed to wait for the lamp posts to line up their lights...while they're off. I figured that out fairly quickly, but spent a good 15 minutes trying to get them just right to collect the flame. The flame that I needed to fix the sun.\n\nYou see, none of this is the impression it gives at the beginning, nor in it's small marketing. Yes, it says you gotta save the sun, sure, but when you're driving a sweet muscle car in the synth laden 80's, I want to go fast and see pretty neon colors. There are no pretty neon colors, only ghost cars, ghosts, lamp posts, and puzzles. It doesn't help that upon beating the game there is this amazingly awesome cinematic that basically shows off the game I wanted to play; a muscle car bursts from the darkness and trails neon awesome behind it and the landscape comes back to life. It's gorgeous. It's wonderful. Then the game is over.\n\nThere is talent here. The maker of the game can make a mean, powerful atmosphere, and the sprites are immaculate and perfect for the tone, save for the ground which is depressingly dull and brown. Of the two tracks of the game, they are spectacular. I need them on my iPod. The cinematic at the end is gorgeous, and the artist who did that deserves all the recognition they could get. Everyone who worked on this has great stuff to their name, and I can honestly say that Early Access probably won't see many games as fascinating as Night Shift til Valve finally sucks it up and cleans up the place. Yet somehow, the whole thing sits in a pool of opportunity and fun and misses out on all of it. Hell, the puzzles could more or less stay too, but the game as a whole is just missing something. It's missing the fun of driving at night.\n\nOf course, I still kind of love this game. It's going to be a bit of a guilty pleasure, and I feel if it ever comes under scrutiny I'd happily come to its defense. However, I can't reccomend it in good faith, because for the majority of the time I didn't enjoy myself, and when I started to, the game went out of its way to make sure I couldn't. Then it ended.\n\nWorth it for the soundtrack, and worth it for the ending, but as I whole, only worth it if it's on sale. I'm giving it a thumbs up because I love it all the same, but I'd say this is about divided as I've ever been in a review. Looking forward to see what they've learned with whatever their next project is.","August 4, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodmorningcmdr/recommended/301050/","goodmorningcmdr","allen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodmorningcmdr/","476 products in account","Night Shift is a very atmospheric and surreal puzzle game. Unique gameplay, with a satisfying presentation containing retro aesthetics and music (which is fantastic). The puzzles are a bit obscure, those with less patience may get frustrated at some of them. It's one of those games where you have to think outside the box. Take your time, and observe your surroundings carefully. Take a break if you find yourself stuck, you'll probably get it on the first try after coming back to it.\n\nMy only real gripe is that the conclusion could have been more interesting, after all that work I was expecting something with a little more effort put into it. Didn't ruin the experience and wasn't terrible, just not memorable at all. It wasn't a long game either, puzzles were few and there's nothing else to do but the puzzles, it took me around 3 hours to complete. However that wasn't an issue for me, and shouldn't be to anyone else considering its very low price.\n\nIf you're looking for something different and don't mind being challenged, I definitely recommend this game. If not, try it anyway- you might end up enjoying it.","May 9","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
