I had the highest level armor and weapon so powerful it could kill anything with one or two hits.  My rapid-firing high-damage assault rifle could hit birds at any range.  At that point the game had stopped being fun.  Even the extreme planets were too easy; meteor strikes were few and far between.\n\nBut now?  You can start a colony.  Weapons are no longer ridiculously powerful, and the accuracy of some guns has been reduced.  Soon there will be hoverbikes.  Hoverbikes?  Hell yeah.  Colonies?  You're kidding me.\n\nNope, not kidding.  Colonies.  Nothing like settling on a fiery planet, building a beautiful city inhabited by unique and endearing people, and watching it be obliterated by one giant meteor.  That taught me something... build underground.  So now I have my own little ragtag band of survivors, duking it out with nature.\n\n\nPros: Epic gameplay, both at low and high levels\nBeautiful atmosphere, covering a huge range of fantasy and science fiction\nCreepy undertone; there are hints everywhere that there's some greater power behind all this\nBananas\nCons: The quests get tedious once you've gotten pretty far; it's eventually just "get this" and "get that".  Hopefully this will be fixed soon...\nThe races could use some more differences; while it is cool that they have specific armor, weapons, and ships, it would be much more interesting if there were race-specific abilities, even if they only affected the early game.\nStill some balance issues with weapons, but this is much better than it used to be.\nThis is a personal pet peeve, but I really want some more high-level bows.  After a certain point they're no longer useful, as they just don't do enough damage.  If there were more bows to go with the top-level gear, I'd be in heaven.\nMy final rating: 9/10\nGreat game, but not perfect.  Keep in mind, Starbound is still in Beta.  I'm sure they'll get at least some of these things fixed before the game hits 1.0.\n\nOne more thing: I haven't yet explored all the game has to offer.  I'm sure there's tons more to see, and more problems too, but I haven't found any yet.\n\nEDIT: Nevermind about the bows, I just realized you can craft a Ferozium bow.","November 9, 2015","true","287.2"," 187 of 211 people (89%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","89","187","211","20","15"

My old review is here if you want to read it. I'd reccomend doing so after reading the new review to get a more complete picture. Note that this review was made Jult 15th based on a version of the game from april. Not much has changed, and reading both will give you a better understanding; https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/134599654/Starbounds%20review%20V1.txt\n\nAs well, if you interested in a comparison content wise between starbound and it's competitor, terraria, here is something I made in response to someone else. Beware though; it's spoiler heavy for both games. Though if you have played terraria, on't feel you will play it, or don't care about spoilers im general, feel free to give it a read. It'll clear up a lot of things on with the comparisons people make about the games.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/134599654/Starbounds%20problems%20-%20An%20explanation%20by%20Skyblade799%20in%20response%20to%20Jelly%20Slug.txt\n\nStarbound is not a good game. It's not a good exploration game. It's not a good builder. It's not a good with the combat either. The main thing I don't like about starbound is how lackluster EVERY aspect of the gameplay is. The classes they are putting in are too basic for their own good (melee, ranged, magic, but with very basic weapons through normal play). The world has little in it that isn't reskins, and the  caves and world gen is not well done, and causes stagnant exploration. Heck, on the note of exploration, there is no consistency with what you find except with biome chests.\n\nOtherwise you have no idea where to find anything, and the whole experience feels like running through a random number generator. A bad one at that, considering most of what you find (minus legendaries) is useless. The legendaries are also troublesome; they are the only remotely interesting weapons and they are blocked behind the wall of RNG as opposed to normal progression. And most of them aren't even interesting anyway; most melee just shoot a single short range projectile, and the ranged weapons aren't worthwhile.The combat feels bad. Even the coming update voices some issue from even those playing it. The additions such as parry or blocks specifications don't do much to actually liven up the action itself; it's a very slow combat system that has little depth. Slow walking backwards slows things down for no reason, and limited attack angles makes many melee weapons outright useless. Moreso, the energy system linked with movement items makes ranged combats uses questionable compared to a hammer/spear melee user. Even the enemies, while they are to have unique attacks added, have the issue of the fact that their parts are not linked to certain areas, so that you have little reason to care about them. Even more so, they only drop money, leather, and meat. As such, there is no point to kill anything; it's not worthwhile, and is overall a waste of time. Almost all of the weapons feel bad, with the only exception being the bonehammer. Ranged weapons are garbage. The actual discovery is almost nonexistant.\nAfter the first two dungeons and a few hours of exploration, I came to feel no more feeling of discovery. You aren't discovering some strange items or unique areas, they are all too simple and similar. Especially the bosses. You go to a tier, get the tier ore, fight a simplistic and uncreative boss with little more then a tier upgrade afterwards, and move on. You aren't going through the world and thinking; "Hmm, I wonder if I can use this on that object I collected over there" or "I wonder where I might find this strange item?". Instead it's "well, better get grinding all the steel I need for that robot. Then, in the next tier, grind some more. And then, grind some more. While making sure not to die, since that would drop my ores and start the slow grind over again". What abount dungeons, or mini rooms? Nope. They don't have anything interesting in them but furniture. And due to the fact they only change room order, they stop feeling fresh after the first go.\n\nImagine if a roguelike (the genre which started the random gen craze I so love) had only changed room order but nothing else? It would become stagnant quickly, because each run would feel too samey. And it does. No feeling of discovery, too many of the same thing reskinned, and an overall empty world in a supposedly "vast" "complex" exploration sandbox. That's awful. I should never feel that a game is grindy like this. Not even the most hardcore of roguelikes have made me feel that, but that is because they are fun to experience from the start.\n\nStarbound feels like  some sort of poorly made foreign MMO focused on grinding over and over with no satisfying result. The themes are just copy paste without any strange additions. Seriously, they could do a lot with these themes. But instead, they gave mushroom boring brown mushrooms. They gave rainbow nothing but a bunch of melons and sand. They gave a potential lava/crystal cave area, just a bunch of empty rooms filled with lava with the occastional crystal which is ONLY used for furniture. They gave the tentacle area nothing BUT TENTACLES. I... just why. I'm sorry, but I have to compare this one time. Look at the nether from minecraft or the corruption from terraria. They don't just have fire or corrupt dirt. They have so much more. The tentacle biome is just that, with nothing to find that'll make you think "what is that? I really need to find out what that is!". Instead, it's all "Wait, they just reskinned all the trees and made them drop tentacles, and reskinned the dirt and stone? Thats it? REALLY? And more so, you don't actually need to explore to anywhere particular, just grind enough. The progression is so straightfoward that at times you can practically draw a line through it. And it's a sandbox, I should not feel that way.\n\nThe items and enemies in starbound are mostly just the same throughout the game. Tier 1 sword is the tier 10 sword with less power. No weapon stats other then damage or speed (or energy for guns). No stats like size, crit chance, crit damage, bullet spread, etc. The elemental stats are simple after effects and enemies don't actually have weaknesses. Building has no purpose other then vanity as of now. Yes they "plan" to change that, but that time isn't soon. Their development is extremely slow; it's been over two years (approaching 3) and they don't have much. Even the nightly updates lack anything noteworthy.\n\nFor example, the nightly updates (as of forum reading and dev blog reading) lack any use for building at all, except maybe for farming. They somehow haven't managed to get the shops functionally in the\noutpost yet, and the normal village shops are so worthless, that it seems pointless to even have villages in the game.\n\nWell. There's way more, but I think I can cut it there.\n\nI think I lined it out well enough. Not even the next update solves really any of the real problems, and many of them are imbedded in their design philosiphy. Mind you, I do also despise how the community was treated. It was incredibly irrisponsible and blatantly bad to treat so many people who had followed you like that. It's even more aggrivating that all they tried was damage control and then eventually just being quiet, as if nothing happened, but that is not the main issue with the game itself.\nI haven't had fun, and that is due to how the game is designed. It's grindy without reward. The exploration, combat, building, etc either lacks purpose, reward, or fun. And most importantly, it's a sandbox exploration game, whlist I do not feel like I am discovering anything. It makes me ill. It had so much potential, but they aren't trying to make their systems fun, they are too stuck in their ways it seems. Dissapointed isn't a strong enough world for my feelings on the game in it's current state.\n\nAvoid.","July 15, 2014","false","218.5"," 1,494 of 1,943 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","494","1","0","130"

Nightly is the most glitched, as it's updated every midnight, so play nightly at your own risk. I play Unstable and they just gave it an update, the addition of quests has changed the game quite a bit, there are now quests as opposed to just 'get this ore, build this thing, repeat'. You need to prgress so far in the quests to get to a new solar system. This game used to be like a bigger Terreria with less point, now it's finally turning into what was promised and Chucklefish is giving us regular updates again. They're introducing new bosses, I've only so far had to tangle with Dreadwing(the penguin UFO) and they haven't tweaked him much aside from give him a bazillion and three HP and he has his own level you can't build on. So while he's not that much harder, he's ♥♥♥♥ing hard.\nIf you got it and stopped playing give it another shot, I'm not sure if stable branch has been updated to the new quest system yet, though, I'm on unstable. If you don't have it and like sandbox tree punching sims definately give it a shot.\nEDIT:\nHey Terreria fanboys, unless your crappy attempts at snarking can make me laugh like Sid1120's down there I'm deleting them. I'm sorry if this offends you. Also I accedently deleted a post from somebody who said Chucklefish was being 'condescending' to fans during the silence, didn't mean to, accedental double click. I didn't consider that a snark and can't comment on it as I was taking a haiatus until updates started again.\nANOTHER EDIT!:\nI was completely unprepared for so many votes...

Starbound is being worked on and I'm looking forward to the final release. But only then I may change my opinion about this game. Starbound showed me that it's not  reasonable to pay for something before it's finished, unless you have a huge amount of trust in a developer to keep its promises. I therefore cannot recommend any Early Access game, but that doesn't mean Starbound is a bad game. It may be awesome some day.\n\n\nUpdate 4/2014: Sadly, Starbound has now entered a state, which I hereby call "Early Access Limbo". Despite promises, excuses, and resolute attempts by the fanbase to prove otherwise, development has come to a de-facto standstill. Therefore I cannot recommend this game anymore. Maybe this will change in the coming months, maybe Starbound will live up to it's enormous potential after all. But until then it's nothing I would pay money for.\n\n\nStarbound is a great game and certainly more than just a copy of Terraria. Or rather may be because the game isn't finished yet and anyone who buys it has to keep that in mind. Exploration is very motivating, the number of items, weapons and armor is simply huge and the fact that you're able to travel through space and venture on new planets is amazing. Besides, the list of coming features sounds promising. I bought Starbound to support the developers and peek into a game which may turn out to be one of the best in 2014. If you don't mind bugs and losing your character frequently it's worth a try, anyone else should wait until release.","December 22, 2013","false","22.8"," 351 of 436 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","351","436","0","9"

I thought this game was going to suck.\nI read most of the bad reviews saying that "Chucklefish has bad management" and "This is just another terraria clone."\nBut you know what?\nIt doesn't.\nAfter reading most of the bad reviews, I had already removed the game from my wishlist. Until a friend of mine said I needed to get this game, me being the open-world loving exploration enthusiast that I am. So I said, and I quote, "Yeah, whatever mate."\nAnd I got it. And I played it. And oh god did I love it.\nWhen I play a video game, I try not to get caught up in the developer drama. There are a plethora of stories on this game page about how Chucklefish "missed their chance" at increasing their popularity, and how the hype "waned out and died." I like to look past all of that. Same with Arkham Knight, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port that it was. I played it, I liked it, and I didn't have to get caught up in all of that developer drama. And it's the exact same with Starbound.\nIf you look past the early access hell this game is going through, it's a really good game. It's fun to play around in, build in, and generally explore.\nAnd it would be telling a lie if I said that the whole few hundred billion or however many unique variations of planets there are fact didn't impress me.\n- Great music, although often repeats.\n- Tons of biomes on different planets to explore.\n- A surprisingly rich backstory, although the only way you could find this backstory is from randomly dropped codexes :(\n- Randomly generated temples, tombs, castles, villages, research facilities among others are always a blast to explore.\n- Surprisingly challenging for an open world platformer. (EDIT: That is, if you choose the normal mode.)\n- There is no story. Litterally. You're planet explodes, your ship is broken, you fix it, and do quests for people around an interstellar outpost. (Not a very impressive one, I might add.) (And I also imagine that Chucklefish will be expanding on the story as they go, if Starbound ever makes it out of EA.)\n- Randomly generated guns and swords are fun to collect. (also, the cosmetic armors are super awesome once you collect a full set.)\n- Easter eggs. Everywhere.\nIn conclusion, you should get Starbound if you like exploring cool looking planets, collecting unique and fun to use items, and overall having fun killing unique monsters, looting enemy bases (and maybe a few friendly ones along the way), screwing around and decking out your space ship (Also, did I mention the ships? There are eight tiers to a ship, and once you get to your eighth tier, it's a blast decorating it.).\nIf you play games for story, dialogue, immersion and sidequests with a lot of effort put into it, this isn't the game for you.\nYou can listen to the bad reviews if you want, but what I'm trying to say is that it's not as bad a game as they say it is, for the reasons listed above.\nBut overall, it's a great game, and I do recommend it.\nAnd it's not even finished yet!","January 2","true","188.0"," 285 of 354 people (81%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","81","285","354","16","17"

This sandbox adventure/survival but with an actual quest system being put in place which falls into the realm of space/sci fi genre. The game offers so much fun especially played with friends. You start off on a planet looking for crafting materials just to survive and get ship off the planet but as time goes on you start advancing through tiers through various tasks, quests, and boss battles which enables you to travel throughout different sectors and random worlds, offering you new  biomes,dangerous envioronment, and hazards which you'll have to explore to find materials to craft. More will be added  as times goes on, ship battles more quests, more hidden treasure in a planet etc.\nThe planets themselves have very nice environment and fun to explore because it is randomized on a galactic map, by inputting x and y coordinates  which acts as seed numbers, you'll travel through endless randomized worlds and discover awsome adventures either by yourself or with friends. You'll dig at least over 24 hours into this beta and still finding yourself replaying it over and over with new content update.\n\nWinter update Gameplay As it stands right now the system for combat is still WORK IN PROGRESS but the there is an actual story to the game now that is flows really well. Quest systems and mining to progress. Once a quest is completed the character goes back to the hub to turn it in to gain a tech upgrade to visit certain planets i.e Radiated, Cold etc until the final tier. The bosses and quests are repeatable and hardcore and the fun of the discovery is back again with tons of new items and secrets to discover. The new biomes are fantastic. A long awaited update that took just way too long but glad that it is finally out so far in unstable build but hopefully we'll see a stable release of it this month.\n\n(I'll be working on the review for this game now and also giving out free keys on my stream each week.

I do recommend this game but I don't have a full review on it yet since it is not a finished game, as the game update changes and progress I will throw a new updated review up.\n\n[pros]\n+ Randomized planets and biomes\n+ Organized travel system\n+ Actual quests in the game\n+ Great music\n+ Great animations\n+looking forward to more\n+MOD SUPPORT!\n+addictive gameplay of mining and being able to build whatever you want through progression\n+Multiplayer with friends and strangers\n+ The Winter update Finally\n\n\nCons- updates cant come fast enough! moarrr\n-if you dont like minecraft or terraria or those type of games you will probably not like this game that much,\n\n- Right now the game is in a stand, where its trying to shape itself into a better game, The devs moved close to each other and well, the game stopped updating for a while, with buggy nightly builds as far as updates are going which you can get your hands on the newest content to at least try out but remember, its tests and bugs, the game came to a dead stop atm. Awaiting a massive overhaul to the game and the things promised. I have faith in these guys so I'll leave this right here because there isn't anything more to do in the game after you acquired everything in the adventure.

The game has been updated in February 2015, and the feelings toward the update has been mixed. I have no interest in playing the game again as of yet, so take this review with a grain of salt.\n\nStarbound sets out to expand the foundation built by Terraria and create a fully explorable universe with different planets, all with their own look, feel and randomized creatures. At first the game feels absolutely massive, and entering new biomes and finding civilizations can be a blast.\n\nUpon starting the game you're given the choice between 6 different races, and get to customize the looks and appearance of your chosen character. You then start in your spaceship, and beam down to your first randomized planet. From now on you'll have to explore, mine, hunt and survive like in most games of this caliber. The game has some nice startup quests to 'ease' you into the game, and teach you the basics of crafting and hunting. As of now they run out very quickly, but more quests are hopefully getting added in the feature. Audiowise the game is really good, and the music is nice and relaxing.\n\nUnfortunately this is where the game takes a turn for the worse, and you're left with a tedious grind for resources and Pixels (similar to the xp in Minecraft, except that it also functions as currency for vendors in the game). The game becomes extremely linnear, and I always felt like I was on a pre-determined path. Everything you want to craft takes Pixels, and let me tell you, they got really carried away with this idea. The best ways of getting Pixels is by killing enemies, the harder the enemy, the more Pixels they will drop. Say the enemies drop 50 Pixels each. Let me give you an example of how this gets really redundant. At one point in the game you need to create a robot that summons the second boss of the game, which will give you what you need to advance and see new parts of the universe. All in all it costs you 3000 Pixels to build it, that's 3000 Pixels to advance slightly. that's an absurd amount of monsters you have to kill. Another way to acquire Pixels is by using a refinery which transfers ores into Pixels, a method which prolongs the already massive amount of time spent mining in the game.  I can appreciate a  good	   grind and working towards something, but this is just ridiculous.\n\nCombat in the game is laughable at best, and pretty much amount to pressing the button until you, or the enemy dies, and the navigation as you're both jumping around is frustrating beyond belief. The guns in the game are completely worthless and feel more like peashooters than actual lethal weapons.\n\nStarbound is a terrible waste of potential, that could've been a good experience if it hadn't fallen flat on it's face in so many areas. As of now, you should not bother with this game. There are far better Early Access games out there that deserve your money and attention.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nNote: After reading through all the feedback, the most common criticism of this upcoming part (and greatest argument in defense of Chucklefish it seems) was that it was focused more on the forum moderators than the actual developers. Hopefully this updated version will prove more satisfactory. Special thanks to Steam user sweetjbro from whom I took some of the screenshots. His review can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetjbro/recommended/\n_________________________________________________________\n\nTHE DEVELOPERS\n\nIf the game doesn't already sound bad enough, I am sad to inform you that Chucklefish (the developers) are even worse. The last noteworthy update was in December, and the information being released to the public is in my opinion not worthwhile at all, and are pretty much just gifs and pictures of things you won't get to play with before they release a solid update, which as it looks now could be quite some time. The official Chucklefish forum is one of the most heavily censored websites you will ever visit on the internet. Most criticism, how valid they may be, are brushed under the rug as ''trolling''   or  ''Flamebait''	 and the user has a good chance of getting banned. In the light of the negative attention rising over the slow development and their childish treatment of criticism, they've resulted to blaming their player base for the lack of progression.\n\nBlaming their player base: http://i.imgur.com/KsDvRHN.png\nLink to the updates: http://playstarbound.com/\n\nAfter numerous P.R catastrophes, a lack of updates and overall censorship of the forums, negative reviews (including mine) started rising to the top, colouring the game once described as  ''The way to do Early Access right'' 	  in a new light, instead of acknowledging their mistakes or (god forbid) apologizing, they instead chose to blame the negative reviews on  ''Vote Brigading''.	  Vote Brigadingm for those who don't know, is an act commonly associated with websites like Reddit, where a group of people band together to upvote or downvote a post/review/comment to push forward their own beliefs and ideologies without viewing it in a critical or objective matter. To add to this a moderator over on the Chucklefish forum claimed that we're just a small vocal minority spreading our blind hatred and paranoia. Chucklefish can never be in the wrong!\n\nVote Brigading: http://i.imgur.com/NrI9VdG.png\nVocal Minority: http://i.imgur.com/NMNeGLK.png\n\nIt was also leaked that they had their own hidden subforum full of hardcore defenders of the game, all making fun of the rest of the player base behind our backs. What differentiates them from us? That they're constantly kissing their asses, unwilling to call them out when they inevitably screw up? The funniest part is the excuse from one of the forum moderators  ''I dont even remember that subforum. Unless it was one they did for April fools or something.''	   yeah, nice try.

Rather than adventuring in a single world, in Starbound you travel between different planets each not only belonging to a particular biome, but containing some of unique features from a fairly large list, from peaceful villages to dungeons filled with zealous guards. So you never know what you will find on each new planet you visit, which makes exploration very addictive: you will always want to explore “just one more planet”!\n\nIn terms of combat and other game mechanics, Starbound already has pretty solid core mechanics at this point of development, though they keep being tweaked and some core mechanics may still change in the future.\n\nIn short, I fully recommend Starbound to anyone who likes sandbox games or want to give this genre a try.

I backed this game a long time ago with several of my other friends who couldn't wait for Starbound's release. After receiving a RIDICULOUSLY large sum of money for their pixel game, Tiy and the rest of the devs have failed to release a finished product after missing their release by over a year, coming up on 2 years. Because they have already been paid a ridiculous sum of money for their incomplete game, they do not have the motivation to finish their PIXEL RANDOM GENERATION game. I have played this game since day one, and it has barely evolved since then. Exploring planets seemed fun at the very beginning, but it gets old real fast. The different races mean nothing, and will maybe eventually have different effects. Gathering minerals is almost always the same and repetitive for each planet and sector, bosses are unimaginative, boring, and easy. The "new" questing system that has been added is boring and monotonous, the missions seem almost pointless in that they only exist to stall the player before more real content is added. If you are thinking about buying Starbound, turn away and play Terraria instead. You will have a much better time, with a complete game that is still receiving more content at a better rate than Starbound, an unfinished game. Chucklefish really needs to step up and finish this game, its honestly pathetic that it is still early access. Do not give Chucklefish any more money until they take the action to actually complete and polish this game. Until Chucklefish gets their ♥♥♥♥ together, this game will remain a disappointment to me and many others who were expecting much, much more from the lazy devs at Chucklefish.","May 31, 2015","false","91.4"," 1,091 of 1,499 people (73%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","73","091","1","40","41"

I can barely play this game anymore without realising all of the things that have been promised, but don't even show promise of being implimented yet. Not to mention the countless bugs that seem to never be fixed, all the while drama storm after drama storms keeps getting stirred up by devs, modders, and the community itself.\n\nIt feels like a beta, it plays like a beta, and the devs keep saying that it's in beta.

Officially claimed to be "fully released" by 2013, this game was pushed back in development because it was not properly finished. Through many updates at first, the game's difficulty was scaled down drastically, and was turned into something equally easy as Minecraft. Originally being made by the Developer's views, the game was changed drastically by community requests and incorporating user-created mods. Originally promised to have "thick and fast" updates, the game met a stagnant halt, only to be given a beta-beta release by the name of [Unstable]. This is where the small updates were to be shown, and for a time, they were. A very short time, at that. After a few small patches and one moderately average sized patch, stagnant development once more arrived. The crew behind the game moved out of the country over to Europe, and set up shop where everyone was close together. Surely the updates would be fast now, you'd think. The biggest update since March 2014 is that they have a small dog at the office.\n\nThe game had such a booming and viral start. It was a game of promises, dreams, and a great pixel game; something incredibly rare nowadays. The game had a somewhat rocky start, being a cleverly disguised alpha instead of the stated beta release, but it was playable. Many features felt nice, and the gameplay fit well with the atmosphere and music. Then it got boring because nothing was new. Through lost promises and hilariously bad customer support on the official forums, many people believe this game is dead. It pretty much is, when the developers are spending little time developing as they once did.\n\nAt first, we had developer streams. We could talk to the developers for HOURS, talking about everything down to the color of the kitchen sink. Then we had some streams of gameplay with less discussion. Then we had preorder bonuses, including some really lame things like a statue of "you" in the game. Then we had promises of fast updates, which has so far been a lie. It's been months since the last real update as of this post time, and there's no real sign of progress. There were people who donated HUNDREDS to this game, only to be shafted so far. By definition, as of the game's current and past iterations, this game is a scam.\n\nI still hold hopes that the developers will EVENTUALLY do something for the game's betterment, but I will definitely not expect them. It's obvious they ran with the money. If you want this game, look up youtube videos first. If it looks like something you'd want to play, then by all means buy it, but just remember that it's a buggy, unfinished game with no hope in the nearby future of completion. Other Early Access games are more likely to be fully released ten times over before this is out of the current be- I'm sorry, ALPHA release.","July 2, 2014","false","596.5"," 701 of 967 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","701","967","0","21"

If the issues have been fixed, then this is a good thing.\n\nOnly reason this is still up here is because it's the biggest thing I have done on steam.\n\nAfter the early access phase ends I may play the game again and write a new review whether it will be another negative review, or a positive one I am unsure. Here is the original review:\n\nThis game may look like the Terraria lover's dream come true, and indeed it did look so to me at first, but after playing through the game and aquiring the final tier of tools and armor, I discovered that all is not lollipops and unicorn farts as I thought. These are my reasons for why the game lets me down:\n\n*The game has terrible gear scaling to the point that you can skip entire tiers of tools and armor and not miss out.\n*There is no reason to create a permanent settlement on any planet, as when away from that planet, time does not proceed. Meaning that a farm on that planet will not grow. Causing you to have to make a farm in your ship, so that it grows everywhere you go.\n*While the first planet may play like terraria, once you get the ship modifications to go to other sectors, you will likely move your storage and crafting stations on to your ship, so you have it available easily.\n*Poor difficulty scaling. The difficulty on terraria scaled well. Making what was previously the best armor the lowest quality armor for the next section of the game. Where in Starbound, the next tier of armor gives you slightly more health and slightly more energy.\n*Weak guns and unavailability. For a game that boasts randomized guns, they are quite unavailable until later in the game. All of the guns I ever found in the game felt like I was toting a piece of cardboard. They consumed far too much energy for their damage output.\n*Farming endgame. After about the second tier of tools, there are no more hunting knives or hunting bows, so the collection of leather and alien meat becomes a lot harder than it was on the first planet. Causing the player to slump into a farming lifestyle for all their food.\n*Stale combat. All of the enemies hop around the same, use similar attacks or cheap tactics that allow easy hits on the player.\n*Inconsistency between clients. When playing with others, the creatures are not consistent between clients. You may think that an enemy looks like a Pikachu, which makes squeaky noises. But for your friend, it looks like a puddle of custard with seven brown eyes on a round head on a long neck, and it makes noises like a sheep. This makes it hard for players to convey to their allies or friends what they are seeing/being attacked by.\n\nAs I achieved the final tier of gear, I feel no need to play it again unless it changes dramatically. As such, I have not played to the end in every single update, so I am unaware if any changes have improved on the problems I have outlined in this review\nHowever, this game is in early access, and it should improve with time. I advise letting the super fans help the developers kick the kinks out of the game for you, and grabbing the game at a later time, when it is out of Early Access.\nWhen the game fully releases, I may play it again, and revise my review.","June 8, 2014","false","102.3"," 975 of 1,358 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","975","1","0","32"

Game didn't receive an update in at least half a year (recently they added "experimental" "updates" that add almost no content and STILL break the game without fixing the old issues, so you get 1 exp. update to fix the one that came before it) now. Most recent update on their 'blog': a picture of a mob without much context and "Well I don't feel like typing much. See you later!" at the end. This just explicitly shows how lackluster and amateurish (or simply lying) their whole team is. On one occasion I had an unpleasant talk with a few of their devs and I can only say that if those people worked in any real company, they'd be fired by now.\n\nCombat is extremely tedious and boring - hit stuff with swords and spears. For ten tiers. In a sci-fi themed game. Stuff kills you in two hits. Then you equip for that tier. Then you kill stuff in two hits until you go up a tier. Bosses are all incomplete and bland. Have trouble with one? Encase it in a dirt tomb and stab it/ blast it with turrets or underpowered guns. The only challenge in this game is dealing with the blatant lack of any though in the combat system EVEN THOUGH it was already redone to make it seem "better". One bad design decision leads to another and leaves the player frustrated, bored or simply regretful when he realises that he could have spent his money on something better (like a couple of actually good games). (as of 09/08/2014 this is STILL the case)\n\nExploration is bland. Run around the planet, looking for labs for tech, cutting down trees. All planets feel exactly the same with a different colour palette. Best thing you can get out of this is some uniquely coloured blocks if you like building (but if you do, there's Terraria and Minecraft where you can do as much and more) (as of 09/08/2014 this is STILL the case)\n\nTech is limited to new jumping mechanics and mechs which have a very limited window of usefulness. If any at all by the time you get them.\n\nIf you ever wondered why the Early Access programme should have more restrictions and a refund policy in place then you can take a look at this game and find out. This project if we can even call it that is a cash grab by many standards and it reminds me only of one other game that was in the same state - the infamous scam "WarZ" now known as Infestation: Survivor Stories. Not to dwell on this for too long but if I am to be honest: this is the only purchase on my list of over 150 games that I have ever regretted and asked for a refund (that was refused because bah, early access shield).","May 30, 2014","false","35.8"," 374 of 504 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","374","504","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whilyam/recommended/211820/","whilyam","Whilyam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whilyam/","174 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL:DR: Avoid this game at all costs. For now.\n\nSo, I really liked Starbound. I love the CONCEPT of Starbound. The idea that you can look around countless worlds and find new and weird randomly generated stuff is such a great concept to me. The races are appealing too from a character design standpoint, and the worlds (at one point at least) were fun and interesting. It was the makings of a perfect game, at least for me.\n\nSo, why am I not recommending it?\n\nIn short, the problem is that the developer, Chucklefish, has seriously mismanaged the project. Let me be clear, it's only the developers that are holding this back. The concept and world they've built is strong. They just seem to enjoy pulling anything unique out and making the game bland and generic. I would strongly recommend this game when Chucklefish either goes bankrupt and sells the assets or if a new development team comes in. Let's go through a list of changes.\n\n1. Monsters are no longer all randomly generated. They added "hand-crafted" monsters to most worlds. If the ridiculous hipster name didn't turn you off, the mundane attacks will. They add nothing to the game, but they were heralded as a great feature.\n\n2. Damage on contact. This was in the game when I first started and it was annoying. They removed it in favor of combat using tells from the monsters and dodging attacks. They then added this back in for no reason. This is the biggest reason I have for abandoning the game. The game is not built for damage on contact. You have to move the (barely visible) cursor to one side or the other of your character, otherwise moving backwards makes you crawl like a snail. When the combat was all about dodging, this was great because it meant you could jump out of the way of an attack and use that time to get yourself back under control. Now, that's impossible because, if you jump, you then have to spend all your attention trying to NOT land on the stupid thing. Keep in mind that almost all monsters are faster than you and will run to your position making this a futile endevour. FUN!\n\n3. They're taking the exploration out of the game. What used to be a fun trek to see what you could find on a planet's surface has devolved into exploring a world to see what micro-"dungeons" (loot rooms) have spawned there. Given that there are only a handful of potential microdungeon themes, you're done pretty quickly. As a minor side note, they went over random weapons and turned them from cute rusted weapons that made sense... into a series of pallate swaps. "Oh boy, I found a random axe! Unlike my current random axe, this one has a blue spiky head instead of a red swooshy head."\n\n4. They've taken out interesting summoned bosses and have given us bland, fairly easy boss "quests". Don't get me wrong, the summoned bosses were terrible. Mostly because you could cheese them really easily. But they needed tweaking, not removal.\n\n5. Content removal. There used to be tentacle planets. There used to be a lot of things in this game. But it's just gotten blander and more generic every update. The races are even getting blander. They SHOULD have had racial traits that made each one interesting to play. They don't. In fact, in the next update, you're losing racial themed weapons. So, you're losing anything identifiable about the race outside of the sprite, and even that's covered up by armor most of the time.\n\nVerdict: Get this on sale for >80% off.","March 4","false","225.6"," 526 of 721 people (73%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","73","526","721","29","43"

I felt like I should write a new review and focus less on the developers and more on the game that is available. I know a lot of you will look at my play time and think "He has X amount of hours in this game, he must have enjoyed it." But if I could have my hours back I would. Think of all those hours you spent in your last relationship and then try telling someone that the other person was worth dating and that you don't want a minute of your wasted time back. I tried to love it and I tried to be a beta tester and hunt down bugs, but it just wasn't worth it.\n\nRight off the bat you'll notice that the game is very grindy.  Now, a little bit of grind is okay in a sandbox game as long as it's well paced and it never becomes tedious and boring; but Starbound does just that. The game becomes go from this planet to the next looking for another tier of ore and a boss to fight. You'll spend hours mining away, looking for the next ore. You run the risk of brain death while doing so, but it'll all be worth it in the long run, right? The boss fight and new enemies will be amazing, right? Nope and nope. Many bosses just feel like regular enemies on steroids, and the new enemies are just variations of the standard ones you see regularly.\n\nSecondly, the game doesn't excel in any particular field. It's a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none and each mechanic has been done somewhere else much better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tamahide/recommended/211820/","Tamahide","some drunken, naked italian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tamahide/","104 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nStarbound is a sandbox adventure game that has been hailed as a long-awaited successor to Terraria. Unfortunately, I am applying the "sandbox" bit very loosely.\n\nAt first glance, Starbound looks exactly as you would've expected it to look like. A game about building stuff, exploring countless alien worlds and generally killing ♥♥♥♥ for the hell of it. While in a literal sense, all of this is true, Starbound makes it apparent that all of these aren't going to be of any use to you throughout the game, and you're not going to have any fun trying.\n\nStarbound's linear progression system is a blatant contradiction to the term "sandbox", and mind-numbing amounts of item/material grinding don't help either.\n\nYou see, while Starbound also bases its core elements off what has made games like Minecraft and Terraria so successful, there is also a very apparent lack of actual freedom-- the very same freedom that made the aforementioned games so enjoyable.\nStarbound's not-so-subtle linear progression is basically landmarked for you in small steps, telling you what you have to do in order to get ahead in terms of equipment. And by landmarks, I mean boss fights when you've done everything that the game tells you to do in a particular sector --basically just an area of space where creatures and items are all locked on a particular "level", so to speak. The sectors themselves are essentially levels, backtracking earlier "sectors" being completely useless; as most materials/items you'd find there would be of no benefit for use or crafting equipment of your current tier. And let's not forget that because these landmark bosses drop items that are absolutely necessary for crafting items of a higher tier, in the flavor of some advanced crafting station.\n\nStarbound also features needlessly complicated requirements for some basic items. For example, a device that allows you to breathe in space - in a game about space! - requires you to kill a mid-game boss, hunt down midgame minerals and have a crafting station that in itself requires some irrelevant materials. And mind you, this sort of pointless grind is necessary for a great deal of practical items such as armor, weapons and other equipment. While some weapons and armor are simple to create, those particular items are usually sub-par, if not utterly useless for the sector you'd be using them on.\n\nExploration and the gathering of resources are pointless and incredibly unenjoyable, respectively.\n\nFor a game about gathering resources and exploration, Starbound is still incredibly bland in both of those aspects. Of course hunting down minerals is a must, but Starbound seems to make even that a frustratingly boring experience. (I'm not saying it's amazing in any comparable games either, but Starbound somehow makes it even worse.) And don't even bother digging deeper into a world, it's easier to just find a different world and dig for whatever resource you need there. Also keep in mind that there are certainly no unique resources on particular worlds that would be of any use to you. And the only variation of equipment comes from the fact that most of it is randomly generated, with the exception of legendary or otherwise named items.\n\nSpeaking of other worlds, and exploring in general, I can't say Starbound doesn't make it somewhat memorable to find some secret lab or mining complex hidden beneath the ground. But overall, these really don't help you at all in the long run. Functionally, almost all worlds are the same, they have trees, they have minerals, you should look to see if there's a structure that you could loot. If so, loot it and move onto the next world, if not, just move on. The only exceptions are asteroid fields and moons, which have no air, low gravity and more minerals. NPC villages basically exist solely for you to raid them, buy things from them and/or rest in them\n\nCombat is a slow-paced mess with unnecessary amounts of difficulty in places.\n\nOn combat, Starbound is just plain bad. There's just no other way of putting it. It's arguably the most incredibly boring part of the game, either being an awkward cover-based ranged engagement or painfully monotonous melee combat, which consists of little more than "click to swing thing" until either your enemy dies or they knock you off a cliff and you die.\n\nMovement is teetering on 2 extremes, it's either a slow gait around your enemies with a bit of small hopping, or being knocked around at high velocity by the said enemies while completely helpless. In both cases it's extremely unenjoyable and very stiff, while some "implants" have since been added to remedy this terribly static combat (Such as higher jumping or quick bursts of speed), the fundamentals remain almost completely unaltered.\n\nThe rewards of combat are almost completely null; regular enemies will not drop anything aside from a few bits of currency. Bosses will give you some necessary material to progress in the game, while mini-bosses occasionally drop some form of decent weaponry. That being said, boss fights as I've had them are crouching in a spot where the boss can't hit you and attacking them until they die, because it's simply too hard to attempt to attack them head-on. When I say hard, I mean they'll just kill you in 2 hits; combine that with the fact that combat is unredeemably boring and you're set for the most unenjoyable fighting you've had in a while.\n\nThe fact that healing pots (known as StimPaks) are inexcusably rare and expensive do not help this at all. While highly effective, you'll burn through whatever miniscule amount of them you have left incredibly quickly. And with the pathetically small health pool you're given, (which does not scale to the enemies you'll be up against, even with appropriate armors equipped) you have little choice but to rely on them.\n\nNow, I'm going to be forthright here so pardon my unprofessional choice of wording, but Starbound's dev team is ♥♥♥♥ing incompetent.\n\nChucklefish has done a lot to show us how hard they work to make Starbound what they promised it to be. Which to say is taking four million dollars of kickstarter funds, taking a long vacation after releasing their barely passable early access game, playing bloody Mario Kart instead of working on their game, and let's not forget acquiring a puppy for the office. They had promised game updates to come incredibly quickly, yet the last big update was six whole months ago. When they attempted to work with ETAs and failed, instead of taking the inevitable backlash they got and trying to improve on it, they just used it as a further excuse to not do anything.\nAll official Chucklefish sites are heavily censored, any sort of criticism is flagged down as "trolling", regardless of how valid it actually is. And better yet, the devs take time out of their non-existant schedule to whine on Twitter, blaming "trolls" as the reason they're not getting their own work done.\nChucklefish should be receiving no further support through Starbound or any other game, they're irresponsible, incompetent and show what little they care for everyone who had supported them.\n\nFeel free to disagree with me, but Starbound is a train wreck of a game. I give it a 3/10, there is enjoyment in the game, but it burns out way too fast. Linear progression in a sandbox game is downright unacceptable, grinding for items is an unnecessary meatfest, exploring nets you little reward, and combat is unreasonably hard with little health, disproportionately powerful enemies; also being painfully monotonic and boring. And it has also become quite clear that every dollar spent on Starbound is just another dollar Chucklefish is going to run away with.\n\nStarbound is a journey into the skies and beyond, and according to Starbound, the skies and beyond aren't very enjoyable.\n\nThanks to Flashtirade for being my editor once more.","April 26, 2014","false","75.4"," 1,034 of 1,450 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","034","1","0","35"

Still worth the £11 or so if you don't mind a mish mash of stuff.\n\nI have well over 100 hours of gameplay time for Starbound and I even ran a very small private-ish server for friends list gaming buds but I still feel it's a struggle to recommend Starbound as it is. There was a fair amount of hype for Starbound, planet exploring, procedural content, aliens and storyline. I eagerly viewed update videos on water physics and this gave me hope for a streamlined, coherent sci-fi-esque sandbox. However, I think SB needs some time to get to that point and people hoping for the same thing should probably watch the dev blog and decide based on that.\n\nWhat it does very well is provide initially interesting planetscapes, the random and odd creatures living there never fail to amuse, things like the biomes having various effects beyond colours and tree types do help gameplay. But after a while, you just learn to accept 'here's another *insert content* from starbound'. To remedy this, there is a potentially interesting storyline that accompanies your ventures into the higher tiers. I think this is a nice way of introducing new tech trees etc, rather than the stale method of 'I built a better mining tool so I can mine more things to make an even better mining tool.' you know what games I'm looking at here.\n\nBut sadly, these storylines aren't fully implimented as of yet and this is a shame because without this I feel like the world is a mushy mess of lots of cool content that actually doesn't do a lot after you stop 'oohing' and 'ahhing' at it all. And I think that's where the beta problem lies, there isn't any content to keep me playing after I level up my gear. I'm not even inspired to build stuff, even though the building is so much easier than other frequently compared 2D sandbox games. There isn't enough 'mechanics' to things such as wiring and water and the true survival aspects of wandering lonley as a little lost spaceship.\n\nKeeping an eye on the dev blog (because I *want* SB to be the really super awesome game I think it could be) there are some promising things coming along, like improved creatures; both in designs and mechanics, for example. But I am still wondering where the meat of the game will come from, the underpinning things that will allow me to play for hundreds of hours more in a super nerdy way without just rinsing and repeating the relentless levelling up of gear.\n\nStill, all that Ooh and Ahh content got me to 100 hours or more, so for the price I'd say that was very much worth it. If the content they have released so far interests you, £11 or so is a fair price to support development. The forums and community itself is also a worthwhile commitment, mostly being friendly. If you enjoy having a little input during a beta phase, this is one of the nicer places to try.\n\nBut if you are, as I said, expecting a fully fleshed out game with more meaningful mechanics than some interesting environmental designs and promising yet mis-mash content, remind yourself this is still Beta and watch from a safer distance!","June 30, 2014","false","114.6"," 283 of 378 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","283","378","0","7"

Five months have come and gone with nary a word of an update to fix the glaringly obvious issues that this game still has and the most we've gotten out of it was the manure splattered onto the windmill and the community has all but completely annihilated itself because of it and the joke so funnah maymay of a gods forsaken Horse AI with enough backpedaling to by the Community Managers that it would knock off miles from any car when the poll was “accidentally” deleted.\n\nI put down $15.00 in hopes of this becoming a big thing and even though Chuckles and his crew grossed nearly $20 MILLION in terms of funding.

Some games are capable of being fun in unfinished states but Starbound is not, what is currently offered is a sandbox, a very dull sandbox. It's great if you want to build or just stare at the same procedural environments over and over. Sadly even the core feature of the current alpha is lacking, the combat.\n\nThe vision for this game is sweet, however it's far beyond the horizon and I don't get how the game could be finished in even a year at the current rate of development, I think perhaps 2 updates in total so far have come out, ones which didnt add content but rather just remixed the barest progression system ever. There might be some turn around with this due to the recent restructing of Chucklefish, I have seen some interesting progress in their daily updates (showing us what they're working on, not actually playable).\n\nI have seen some negatives of the game just from this alpha and they don't bode well for the final release. If you are a fan of Terraria's tight controls and graphics they are not to be found in Starbound. The graphics are fluffy as well as player movement and combat.To elaborate I feel as if all movement in the game is slow, from the velocity of bullets to fall speed, as well as the hitboxes of monsters being somewhat strange, probably in part to their procedural generation. I have a hard time believing the game will have a high difficulty lacking of frustrations, whereas in Terraria due to its good performance it can ask much of the player in it's boss fights. My current outlook is that more fun will be gotten from the noncombat experiences of the game. Those experiences however apart from building are nonexistant in the current build, features such as trading, questing, farming (plants are in but the full extent of the system is missing), and storylines are still in development.","July 2, 2014","false","24.1"," 160 of 205 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","160","205","0","0"

Not by a long shot.\n\nEarly game is fine, very playable, but mid/late game is extremely bare and unfinished and the game progress is very linear. There are no options when it comes to gear choices as you simply build the next tier of gear then fight the next boss.\n\nAll the planets FEEL the same. You run across the surface, find a few chests, then find a NPC building, kill the mobs inside then move onto the next planet, each planet follows this same pattern. They do LOOK different, but its the FEEL i am talking about.\n\nDigging seems pointless as you can find all the ores you need above ground and the weapons you get as drops are better than the ones you can craft.\n\nCombat is fun at first but very samey. All the weapons seem the indentical. Some have a few gimmicks but there isnt much difference whatever you use.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game is the lack of updates to the STABLE BUILD. There has been 2 tiny updates to the stable build since February, which added virtually zero content.\n\nThe game has 2 other beta options which are the unstable build and a nightly build. The unstable build is updated once in a while, but again no sizable updates. And then there is the nightly build, which apparently gets updated nightly, but it is very broken. I have yet to see a sizable update to this either, its always just little things, like a new AI interface which is purely cosmetic and adds no content. When I did update to the nightly build I couldnt even start the game for a while.\n\nTo conclude with the beta options: updates are tiny and irrelvent, they are badly broken sometimes, so you are left with the choice to play the unfinished game from febraury, or a even beta beta build which might break your game and saves everyday.\n\nSo yeh, in the description they say "UPDATES WILL COME THICK AND FAST" but the updates have been neither thick nor fast. Buy this game at your own peril.\n\nI will also be deleting comments off this review, good or bad.

It was the best thing I had ever seen. Then the updates came. I figured "oh, they'll probably make it easier to find civilization" (at the time I had only found 3 settlements, by my 30th hour of gameplay. I was still happy.) The game started to lag for me. I was used to it, I had a bad computer at the time.\n\nShortly after, there was a wipe. I lost my character and my favorite server went down. I couldn't play with my friends anymore, the custom ship I was building (thanks to a lovely little mod bundle a friend and I assembled), the planet we were terraforming and the MASSIVE ice-world castle I was building...all gone. I saw what they did with the game and I said "ok, I guess that's a reasonable update." and began my base and ship anew.\nThen there was another...and another...Then yet another update came and I couldn't play anymore. I was looking at enough lag that creatures wouldn't move on my screen and I could walk right through hostile dungeons without firing a shot.\n\nFor six months or more, I abandoned this game.\n\nA few weeks ago, I got a new computer. I immediately thought back to starbound, one of my favorite games of all time. I boot it up, all excited! Then I remember...oh, the server is gone now. Oh, my base is gone, my ship is gone, my loot is gone, my character is gone. I accept it and move on, perfectly content to start a new character and terraform everything from scratch.\nThat's how amazing this game was.\n\nMy first planet, I'm happy as a clam. I had a new bazooka that fired guided missiles and a nice sword that that spins around and massacres everything. Then I found a house! YAY! A neighbor! Then another one.....YAY! TWO NEIGHBORS!\n\n*next planet* oh hey, a village!\n*next planet* oh hey, 4 villages!\n*planet after that* Its the garden of Eden, holy crap!\n*fifty planets later* Jesus, another village? This whole place is filled with lava though...\n\nAt this point, I've noticed that nearly every planet has a village on it. Most have several and most of the ones that have several, are completely covered in tiny little wooden villages. I didn't like that fact much, as it took away from the previous, unique feeling of awe and accomplishment that once accompanied the discovery of a settlement. Quickly becoming bored with that, I did something I had never done before. After just a few hours, I decided to run up a few levels on the main campaign (time was, I never needed to go beyond durasteel, I just explored and built). Even with all my goofing around and time wasting, I got the max tier of armor and weaponry, killed every boss using just my chakram (first weapon I ever found. It scales, but really badly...still the best weapon I have somehow) and I hit a wall..."what do I do now?"...\n\n"OHH! I KNOW! I'll capture a bunch of pets and start an illegal animal fighting ring!"...oh...wait. Nope, cant capture "combat pets" anymore. Only...you know I'm still not sure what you CAN capture...all I know is that its something not worth the effort...I threw those pods at literally everything interesting.\n\n"Ok, well, how about I do what my friend was doing and collect cool trees?" Nope! None of the non-basic ones drop saplings anymore...ok...\n\nI had nowhere to really go, nothing to really do and all of a sudden I realized just how hollow the game had become.\nI considered building a base. I mean, every planet does have a massive cliff somewhere that I could just dig into now...\nThen again...that's every planet.\nI could go on an ice planet...but survival has been removed for a long time and all the upgrades make everything safe. (oh, minor note, I haven't found a single background that struck me as more than mildly interesting. They used to have some really gorgeous ones, like aurora backgrounds, particularly on ice planets. Now, at best, we get a mountain range. At worst, a bunch of mildly weird trees that really muck with your depth perception.)\nwhat about a lava planet? No...It takes eons to reach the floor and I'd probably just find another village.\nHow about I settle on a planet with lots of those cool creatures the procedural generation always comes up with?...oh...wait. I haven't encountered a single procedural creature since I re-installed.\n\nIt used to be hard to find a perfect planet, with a nice background and dangerous weather (seriously, meteors used to be everywhere, it was awesome!) and cool animals and a nice hillside to carve a castle into. And when you finally did, you WANTED to build there. You were COMPELLED, to build there! Now, every planet is...bland and identical.

And I mean, AMAZING. It looked like terraria, granted, but it was in my top ten games of all time. Since the updates, I hesitate to say its even on par with terraria. The balance was lost. The devs left out most of the features that they were supposedly building (custom ships, being a big one. Wouldn't even be hard to do, its one file and a couple of tile types. ENTIRELY feasible and easy to make completely optional!), they increased chests, ore deposits and village areas to ridiculous levels and all but REMOVED procedural generation. Where are my shadow dogs? Where are my eyeball trees and strange giant, lightning spitting, barbarian hylotl? (I want to take a moment to impress upon you, the importance of this last bit here. The procedural generation was about 80% of what made this game amazing.

That plaything got old and I moved on. Being a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to CF and the community was worth the 15 dollars. The game itself is not worth it though.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nIf you prefere a more objective, better written review give this guy a chance: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082557773/recommended/211820/\n\nIts far less vulgar then mine and he brings up proofs of CFs mistakes and censorship.\nCheck him out.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Going to do a full scale update completly revamping the review. You can call me whatever you want or create as many alts you want to disagree just because you want to defend your little "poor innoncent indie development company", I dont care. The forums are turning into a corrupted sinkhole and are de facto banning users for no reason.\n\n\nIts the 18th December 2015 now. This game has been in early access for... 3 years... 3 damn years. And not a single bit of decent progress. Instead people who were fans of the game get banned on their forums for saying that their combat "update" is bad. Instead they add useless furniture, tedious fetch quests and a useless colony system instead of propper content like a functioning, balanced combat system or the actually promised dark and mature content. Instead this game gets DF9'ed so they can forget it as fast as possible. What a waste of money and time...\n\nThis review is outdatet. The game is ♥♥♥♥ now after certain "updates" (2 noteworthy updates changing the game objectivly to the worst.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlright after some serious thoughts on the game and recent posts of the devs calling negative criticism invalid I would like to disencourage from supporting Chucklefish and any titles they are developing. They called people with valid points trolls and idiots. Valid points are for instance that the game developement is by far too slow, alot of broken promises, no ETAs anymore just because 1 or 2 done by the devs backfired, ignoring the official community almost entirely (inofficial communities like Reddit get all the attention) and if they interact with the official community on the official forums it is just minimal and not saying anything.\n\nThe game itself was suprisingly good for the way it was back 1,5 years ago and honestly I was hoping that devs would keep up the good work they had when initially starting the public <<Beta>> back in december. It had nice mechanics (all gone now), 6 interesting species which are quite original (except for humans maybe, because well thats us) (2 of them still not being fully implemented), a decent weather system which can blow away your mind at some point (which game offers nowadays weather with really destructiv abilities and forces you to think into your buildings, what materials you use and the whole design.), and most important ALOT procedurly generated things, mobs are random, weapons are random, blades are (almost) random, planets and envirements are random (partially, means dungeons and certain presets are there and selected on generating a planet) and pretty well done on the code you could think. Nope its a pile of garbage.\n\nBut for the ignorance and sorta mean spirited comment on quite a few negativ feedbacks on the official forums done by a good chunk of the community I would not recomment supporting them just for the Devs to wake up. I got the impression that they are not providing anything good at the moment. What we got is a relativly good game whatsoever. But the Dev team is currently a, excuse my words, horrible cluster♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf they intend to change that behavior at some point I will retract the negativ review of course and turn it into a positiv one, but that must be said, the current state of developing is not really satisfying and you are pretty much tipping in the dark of knowing what will be added at some point. If you just want to have a good sidescrolling survival game in space which allows you to build awesome 2d structures and some fairly interesting, very different alien species to choose from (which game has humanoid canivorous plants nowadays, again really good design decision by them) then its something for you. And if you are into weird tentacle porn/pr0n then there is also a whole biome you will like. Get a <<sexy>> female character (probaly alien species aswell for the extra weird guys) and have your wildest Phantasies on said biome ;). So its up to you: If you want a relativly good game now and dont care about future developments, consider this as thumbs up and go ahead and purchase it. If you are looking a bit more skeptical on things I would wait and see how things develope and not purchase... specially after the drama the past days the devs caused in the official community. Oh and mobs look like Pokemon sometimes, thats also a nice little plus. And you can actually catch those mobs aswell and use them as critters for your own purposes (the feature is still not fleshed out but still pretty cool). That should sum it up, thanks for bothering to read.\n\n\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nSo apparently the dev team managed to move all together after roughly 4-5 months. They are now located in great britain and are feeding the official forums with news and on what they are working on... though after another "rant surge" of the official community of not being updated on the forums, and reddit again getting all the attention. They posted then a "Status Update" which involved nothing but an advertisement for a game they are publishing. That caused more trouble finally getting them to post on a daily base since monday. Lets see how long they continue and when we will see an actual patch... If they keep their word and "big content patch" is on its way then the game might have a chance to get better soon... getting better reputation wise.\n\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nCF is censoring now their steam subforum.\n\nUpdate 3: Mod who is censoring hard got removed, Finn is quite ok to be frank, other one "Shoehead" intruded steamforums, got turned into shredds within a few hours.\n\nUpdate 4:\n\nCF has a subforum on their official forum hidden from regular members. Its not a moderator forum.\n\nhttp://i.4cdn.org/vg/1407014460583.png\nhttp://i.4cdn.org/vg/1407016724018.png\nhttp://i.4cdn.org/vg/1407016900953.png\n\nThe people in that section are all hardcore defending people. All of them. And presumeable out of the rules posted by "Sledra" they are allowed to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ there.

Critical analysis of:\n======================================Starbound======================================\nNote: Positive recommendation due in large part to development starting to come together well. I do not think you should buy this game at this moment, but you should watch.\n\nTL;DR:Wait for release, and perhaps a little while after! See how the final stages of development goes! Make sure implementations of vital features and the way they intertwine are up to your par! Things have been improving, accelerating, and shaping up a lot lately...but you never know what one thing could ruin it all for you as an individual. As always, be wise with your money.\n\nDo I at this point think release (or a few big updates after) will be worth your money? Yes. Do I think that it could also potentially be held back by a poorly implemented feature or two? Quite possibly. So if you have already purchased starbound...maybe it will soon be time to give it another go! But if you haven't...hold on to your wallets for just a little longer.\n\n======================================\nIn-depth Feature Critiques:\nThe Beginning:You start out on a pretty planet, with a lush, colorful, friendly background. The terrain is usually mild in variation, making navigation fairly simple and quick. You are outright forced to dig down to the bottom of the planet--gathering ore along the way for gear--to acquire core fragments so you can fix your ship and go elsewhere.\n\nNow, this may sound pretty annoying--and it is, however, many steps have been taken to make it a relatively quick and easy process. There are more caves and tunnels, making digging down to the bottom easier, as well as ore deposits that can be broken up to get a decent amount of a certain ore type. Underground sub-dungeons can potentially provide interesting loot, or just a needed change of scenery or some pixels.\n\nThe Planets and Exploration:Upon gaining the ability to venture further, you may wonder just how good the new sights will be. The answer to this question: a mixed bag. Many planets seem boring and pointless, just a new color or different dungeon/settlement type. Maybe a cool biome or two...maybe a bunch of annoying biomes. Maybe there's no good loot. Maybe ore generation makes your desired type hard to find. To make matters worse, certain planet types tied to getting through the later tier are by nature incapable of being fun and unique. Ocean planets, for example. Mostly water atm.\n\nOn the other hand, it is very possible to stumble upon a planet with cool terrain, a cool settlement or dungeon with good loot, awesome looking background parallax and kickass trees, and an abundance of ore. Regardless, there needs to be more unique elements and reward/incentive to exploration. Things to make individual planets stand out and be special. Rare biome or dungeon variations, a strangely safe and beautiful planet of a dangerous harsh biome type, a different day/night cycle time, dangerous creatures and minibosses.\n\nThe Combat and Creatures:Combat in starbound is fairly well setup. Weapons have unique properties and styles that generally enable you to fight however you want. Monsters now have better tells and more sensible windups, so blocking, dodging, parrying, and tanking are now all viable options. Since monsters are mostly generated off screen, and generally stay there, the end result is that combat often feels like a chore you do to get that one creature with that one annoying attack to stop impeding your horizontal progress around a planet.\n\nThere is much room for improvement in that regard:\n\nLoot should be more rewarding, fun, or varied. Monsters should seek you out and display unique behaviors. Perhaps some herd up, or fight in small roaming packs, or try to avoid you. Even if nothing at all is done to make it more engaging and fun, rather than like a popup when trying to surf the net, the spawning needs to be tweaked. I would like to see hardcaps on the amount of creatures that can spawn within a set distance of each other, or while you are busy killing other mobs, or how quickly it will populate the area past your sight with new monsters when you've just slaughtered five so you can finally resume moving forward.\n\nThe Functional Mechanics and Building:They actually nailed this one. The matter manipulator is not only a lore-friendly tool, but an essential one. It is a way to have an item bound to your character at all times, not taking up inventory or hotbar space, that offers a big improvement on the utility found in most sandboxes. Digging and placing blocks can be precise, with ugprades to speed and tiles covered, the size of which can be adjusted on the fly. You can remove and relocate liquids, and building is quick and easy as well, thanks to the handy ability for your matter manipulator to hightlight relevant blocks. As a protip: You can even use it to help search for buried ore in the dark!\n\nBuilding is quite good. There are many objects and styles of blocks to play around with, and you can now colonize planets and rent out rooms of your design to NPCs. The building materials chosen for this process directly effect what you will get. This gives more purpose to the various biomes, and the exploration of them, because there are tenant NPCs that are based specifically on certain biome types. This was also very well done. Unfortunately, the availability of unique and varied building blocks in terms of aesthetics is limited. Aside from stone, many can only be scavenged from settlements or dungeons, no less! There are plenty of blocks that will end up having 100 recolors, as well, due to the nature of their planet, like sand and dirt. So why is there not a similar change in color and style not found in wallpapers on settlements, the color of bricks used in temples, and so on? Maybe one day.\n\nThe utility of the sci-fi exploration sandbox genre typing doesn't end there. A ship AI personal to your race is a clever way to dispense introductions to the game and quests, tips, and inform you if you try to do something like pay for an upgrade with too few materials. There are many other instances of starbound's mechanics being very well designed, so the foundation is strong.\n\n======================================I've maxed out on space to the point where I can't even finish the following section. For those who want to read the rest, I threw up a silly wordpress site: here[fakersrealreviews.wordpress.com]\n======================================\nThe Sandbox, Progression, and Professions:This one is a bit more difficult to comment on, because it's in a pretty heavy state of flux lately, and especially going forward from here, so I'll cover the basics from where it has been to where it is going. Back in my day, when we had to walk to school uphill in the snow, 10 miles, both ways...you could simply load up your ship with coal and take off to the great unknown. This was pretty cool, but honestly, from a design standpoint it did allow you to exhaust content quickly and kill off the novelty of the sights to see. The starmap at this point branched out with similar planets, and you had to unlock the next tier to see new types. This was pretty lame, actually, and it conveyed an extreme feeling of artificial walls and progression.","January 29","true","386.3"," 141 of 184 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","141","184","7","19"

SORRY, NO REFUNDS. If you don't own it yet, don't buy it. Either wait until the developers get their ♥♥♥♥ together or pick up terraria or something.\n\nAfter playing the winter update on unstable (keep in mind it took them over 10 months to release it and its still not out yet), its nice to see that the devs are back on it. But what did the update add? A quest hub, quests, and ship upgrades. Maybe a dozen new items, new liquid types and all that.\n\nNow the game feels terribly linear, with even more grinding to do. Quests come in groups of 4-5, and after completing all the quests you upgrade your ship. Rinse and repeat. Many of these quests require you to find crafting materials, and every ship upgrade tier requires diamonds. Problem is, a lot of these materials are even harder to come by as chucklefish nerfed the amount of materials that spawn.\n\nWith that being said we can go back on the dev team's history. Summing it up, it is full of lies and broken promises, with a dash of frivolous spending and extreme incompetence. Also keep in mind that the original release date was slated to be in 2012, with the release date being updated to "sometime in 2013". Evidence of the 2013 release date has been quietly removed.

The game has a more than decent framework, but the developers keep changing the game's premise, leading to a circuitous lack of progress and wasted potential.\n\nIt's gone from a Terraria-like 2d space exploration game with procedural worlds and craftable bosses, to a story-driven series of instance dungeons, all the while killing off promising older content while adding more and more unfinished (and/or unnecessary) features. This slash-and-burn development has left the game unfocused, long after the point where it should have been crystallizing. The initial hype has died down, releases are fewer and longer between, and content is stagnant for months at a time, leaving players wondering if there's any motivation or momentum left to see it completed.\n\nThe playstarbound website seems to feature lots of regular updates, but most of it seems to be showing off graphical blandishment and experimental features, few if any of which have rolled down to gameplay or promise to offer much in the way of functional content. In their eagerness to demonstrate that they are still actively working on the game, they're offering a lot of gravy and not much meat.\n\nPlayers will quickly burn through all the existing gameplay content and acquire all the useful craftable equipment, leaving you with nothing to do but wander randomly generated worlds in search of treasure chests. Judging from the comments here and at other sites, many players have walked away due to the lack of content, and with them goes word-of-mouth support.

But it has potential, so it may – possibly – be good once it's finished.\n\nThe biggest reasons why you shouldn't get it yet:\n– It's pretty boring. Yeah yeah, some fanboys say they've invested 500 hours into Starbound, but unless you're also a fanboy, you'll probably run out of interesting things to do pretty fast.\n– There is a pretty high risk that your worlds and/or characters will be wiped or corrupted in software updates, which is pretty disencouraging for investing time and effort into this game.\n\nThere are some troubling aspects about Starbound. Some of those things have to do with the failed promises of the developer. Around 6 months after it was released as Early Access, it's still basically in alpha, and who knows when it's going to be released? With few major updates, it's also hard to know if the game is on the right track. Put simply, I don't think we should reward developers who can't live up to their promises.\n\nBut I also have some deeper concerns about the concept of Starbound itself. Starbound is basically Terraria in space, and one reason it's taking so long to finish is because it's so damn ambitious. An endless amount of planets with lots of various biodomes, what's not to like? Even in the Early Access, there's a lot of variety, but unfortunately it seems to be rather superficial. And that is the problem: that despite the massive amount of content, most of it may ultimately feel rather generic and not especially meaningful. In other words, my concern is about quantity vs. quality. And furthermore, why invest time in building stuff on a planet, if you're going to move on to other planets anyways? As a result of these things, both exploration and building are hurt – arguably two of most fun things do to in games of this genre.\n\nCan they solve this, and create both quantity AND quality? I.e. create a good game? It should definitely be possible, but we can't know until they've gotten further into the development. As of now, they haven't solved it.","June 6, 2014","false","14.6"," 112 of 147 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","112","147","0","0"

Grab a Seat.\n\nI'm going to start with what Starbound was a while back.\n\nStarbound is something that I was so excited for, and was so hyped for. After playing So much Terraia, I flipped a ♥♥♥♥ when I heard about Starbound back in 2012. I constantly followed the Dev Logs and the Roadmap (We'll get back to this) to see how close the game was to their initial release of Summer 2012. Then...That didn't happen. Which is all fine and Dandy, I understand some games need more time to work on them, they can be overly ambitious and overestimate time. The Problem here however, is they Lied. Quiet a bit actually.\n\nTime to get back to that Roadmap, one of the biggest lies. The Interactive Roadmap they had posted, showing all their progress, was removed, and I realized this as soon as the game actually came out, that this was because they had such little actually functioning/complete. The Game that they called "Beta" was pretty much Alpha. Randomly Generated Planets, The Progression, The Weapon System...They were so very simple. Because of my initial excitement, I was able to pour over 90 hours into the game before I realized the universe of Starbound was really...Generic. None of the planets, monsters, or weapons felt unique. Sometimes It might be a desert planet. Sometimes It might have lots of trees, or sometimes It's purple. They were all "Randomly Generated so they're all unique" But that really tore away attachments to everything, Monsters Especially. When Combined with their small aresnal of abilities. They effectively became walking attacks with a randomly gen'd monster skin.\n\nThis was early starbound, and it was honestly a total a complete mess. But Lets talk about Starbound Today, and why I still don't recommend it. A lof of issues I've stated, they are working on fixing, which is great. They've added more handrawn weapons, Monsters, Microdungeons, and unique planet atmostpheres. They've added Progression, Colony's and farming. They've honestly, added a good wealth of stuff!\n\nBut honestly, I still can't recommend this, and here's why:. There's STILL an inherent feeling of incompletion, emptyness, and genericness you get when playing starbound. Sure there is more of a drive now with a early quest system finally added, and you have the initial explorative drive to push you into caves and microdungeons to sink some hours. But after a while, it still begings to feel very stale and incomplete. Which again, wouldn't be an issue, but this game has been in Early Access since 2012, which is well passed it's origional Release frame. With Developers as Untrustworthy as Chucklefish, this is a huge issue. The game verywell could get the Early Access sticker removed from it and sold as it is now. There would be nothing stopping them from claiming the next update to be the full version of this game, and have plenty of promised features still missing from the core. This is one of the main reasons I cannot recommend this. This game will have you left feeling empty, like something is just always missing.\n\nI of course do realize though, this may not be a problem for some of you. Some of you will look at starbound, ignore it's developers, and have tons of fun regaurdless. If you know for a fact that Starbound is a game you can enjoy at it's current state with the possibility of this being it's final release, by all means. Go ahead. I will say multiplayer does make the game much more enjoyable. But I personally, cannot recommend this game still. After following it's development very closely, and witnessing all the decietful behavior these dev's have exhibited, anything can happen. I've already seen some features like Hunger and Heat removed. Maybe they'll bring it back, maybe they'll remove something else. If they break something they can't fix/balance, they might just remove it.\n\nOverall, in combination of the game still feeling inherently empty, The Developers of starbound are untrustworthy and that is a very scary thing. I can't willingly recommend you a game that does not feel finished, might one day never even be finished.","January 31","false","128.0"," 303 of 439 people (69%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","69","303","439","18","6"

Between burrowing just under the surface, walling myself off from enemies, and using a movement tech to fly over stuff, I soloed the game all the way to the final tier, crafted endgame armor, and found a tier-ten legendary sword without ever crafting a chestpiece, which means I had 1/2 the armor and 1/5 the health I should have had for the entire game and still managed to complete it. Shouldn't something prevent that?\n-Gameplay gets repetitive. There are different planetary and underground biomes, but even the tentacle and heck biomes still play the same as the others, just with cosmetic changes, and any biome-specific loot is fairly inconsequential.\n-There are STILL dungeon/NPC instances I have yet to encounter, but I don't really need to, because they're all roughly the same (except the Portal-based one, that's pretty neat, but finding it without coordinates can be a chore, and it lags like hell even in singleplayer).\n-Lackluster tutorial only briefly mentions some critical gameplay elements without actually showing them to you (Cooking? Bed healing? Pickaxe? Anvil? Nah, you don't need any of those, you'll be fine).\n-Players in multiplayer can destroy your ship decorations and steal your locker items unless you build your base on an asteroid far above the planet's surface.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you like building stuff, play Minecraft.\nIf you like fighting stuff, play Terraria.\nIf you like exploring stuff, play Starbound.","June 28, 2014","false","156.5"," 95 of 122 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","95","122","0","1"

The game was slated to be released by the end of that year, with the beta being released sooner. They quickly raised a million dollars in a few months. In celebration at the massive interest and popularity of Starbound, Chucklefish expanded their goals for the game, planning to work both pre- and post-release to make Starbound the best game they could possibly make.\n\nAs it turns out, all the promise in the world can be killed by a bit of mismanagement.\n\nStarbound only saw its "Early Access" release that year, pushed all the way into December. The game didn't receive any significant updates until a year later, in December of 2014. As it turned out, Chucklefish had spent the entire year relocating themselves into a new office instead of following up on the massive success of their crowdfunding campaign. The interest popularity in Starbound waned and died -- rather than reaching the caliber of Minecraft or Terraria, it's just another "you're-a-sandbox-game-oh-okay-that's-interesting-no-really" game.\n\nChucklefish means well, and they do still seem to want to make Starbound the best game they can. Honestly, though, that opportunity is gone. The chance that was Starbound was so poorly bungled and botched that Chucklefish simply can't live it up to either its hype or former potential. Starbound is just yet-another-game anymore, devoid of interest and living entirely from update to update to keep its player base. As well, Chucklefish keeps trying to do too much -- the team frequently works on things that ultimately don't help the game much at all (Hoverbikes, for example: terrain generation is 90% unnavigatable cliffs and steep hills), which leaves what Starbound really needs on the floor. Starbound's content remains emaciated compaired to the promises Chucklefish gave years ago. Updates only accomplish a mediocre effect on making the game enjoyable again, and they're becoming less and less effective on refreshing a tired and increasingly dated experience.\n\nMaybe Starbound does have a silver lining, but I'm not personally counting on it lasting. [I take it back, I'm done with Starbound at this point] but I don't see this game having much future. I'd be surprised if anyone even notices if it actually leaves Early Access.\n\nSo remember, kids: managers exist for a reason.","December 18, 2015","false","53.9"," 703 of 1,058 people (66%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","66","703","1","44","73"

I was hyped. It seemed like a good purchase at the time, because I had been waiting for four months prior to purchasing the game.\n\nUpon the beta testing/release date, several things became completely evident to me -\n1. The game is uninspired and lacked any of the features that were promised on the Roadmap.\n2. The game lacks features - it cannot be called a 'beta' by any means.\n3. While the engine is robust, stress testing the engine without using the 'mod' system is impossible anymore.\n\nMoreover, all of those things come in addition to multiple problems with both the developers and the way the developers act - that, unfortunately, is not going to be discussed here. What they say and do does not concern me, because I'm not going to give them any more of my money after this.\n\nThe game is uninspired. All of the planets are palette swaps of prior planets with background changes and very little varied topography, ocean planets are not implemented, water does not work properly, combat is unaimed and very clunky, movement is slow and practically unresponsive until late game, the space game doesn't give you guns until 3/4ths of the way through...There's really more I can expand upon, but I don't want to spend all day pointing out every little flaw: while that my be what I signed up for, people tend to throw hissyfits whenever someone does that.\n\nThe game also lacks many pivotal features and items that were told to be in the game. Now, before everyone tells me 'it's a beta!'...Tough luck. A beta is a game that is feature complete and does not have content added until post-release, this game is an alpha. Features are still being added and looked at, which means that the game is nowhere near ready for beta testing.\n\nNow, the third is a personal gripe. I do not want to modify and add content to this game because I did not pay to develop code for the developers, nor would I get paid for doing so. I paid to test a beta, which involves moving variables, creating events that lead to crashes (like the 8x8 matter manipulator that hit as fast as your FPS), and even manipulating drop tables so I can check and see if newly implemented items work as-intended. With the devs putting a 'beta' into a .pak file, it removes any and all ability for me to properly beta test the game. It has no reason to be within a .pak file, because it is not a release copy.\n\nOverall, the game is flawed, the developers have no idea what they're doing, and paying for this game is not worth it. Not until the game is released.\n\nEdit: It has been a year and a day since I have written this review. Happy Independence Day, America, and the game is still not out. Abandonware, do not buy.","July 4, 2014","false","171.6"," 94 of 122 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","94","122","0","0"

I'd qualify with "it's not dead" but I never thought it was truly dead, it was just taking it's sweet time and it would end up being nothing like promised.\n\nThis remains true. Updates were a long time coming and have all but removed the USP for most people - the ability to explore. Sure you can run around a few planets and dig but it gives me nothing that other games don't, and they do it better. Sure there's quests but these come in 2 forms - the mandatory questline you have to follow to progress. This is long, monotonous and spoon fed whilst offering no challenge and the only reward is the game becomes playable. There's also procedurally generated quests but as expected it's "Go x-planet, dig dirt, return" "Fetch x item" "Kill x Miniboss".\n\nCan you mod this into decent game? Maybe. Probably. Solid 6/10 is acheivable with mods. For me that's not enough, I don't want to *have* to mod games for them to be enjoyable.\n\nSure I'm bitter because I wasn't given what was sold to me, luckily new customers can't be. If, when all is said and done, you still want to buy this game then you should. Go for it, you will probably get your money's worth, but at the same time I wouldn't "recommend" it by a long shot.\n\n-\n\nEDIT: 4 months later, my review is still entirely accurate. For a game in development that should tell you all you need to know about the pace it's being "developed". No changes at all.\n\n-\n\nA very pretty game with a nice soundtrack and a lot of potential.\n\nVery little community interaction from anyone aside from the Community Manager who makes poor attempts to "troll" customers and is forever playing the "victim card".\n\nDevelopment updates come in thick and fast, but entirely in the form of promises and gifs as opposed to any actual update to the game. There was a 5 month break in production, 1 month was a company vacation and 4 months was due to moving a few artists and the Community Manager to London.\n\nThey also adopted a puppy and have used the backers money not to fund Starbound, but each take up work on individual projects and then publishing other's games.\n\nShould be good if/when it's finished. Slated for release in 2013 - that's officially moved to 2015 and will probably be moved again.\n\nIf you like repetitive grinding you should buy this game, but do not buy it to support or follow development. Chucklefish has already made over $15 million from Starbound and owning the game doesn't give you any extra idea of how development is going.\n\nIf you want to support this game not buying it is the better option - falling sales is the only thing that may get Chucklefish to buckle down.","July 7, 2014","false","24.9"," 105 of 139 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","105","139","0","1"

Collecting ores for armor, getting boss items, and dying every so often got a bit stale before you finally unlocked the awesomeness that is hardmode, full of amazing enemies and items. Starbound is like the early game grind of Terraria the entire time, with nothing cool to look forward to. Tiered armor is boring- each set is incrementally better than the last, and that's it. Randomized weapons ensure that only a very small amount of them will be interesting- however, none of those randomly-generated weapons will be as interesting as weapons like the Golem's Fist in Terraria. The devs said they had a great story in the works, one for each faction, but that hasn't come through at all. Even the opening cutscenes for the races still aren't finished almost two years after release. I desperately wanted to enjoy this game, but it looks like I'll have to wait for Terraria Otherworld to satisfy my fighting/storying/building game itch.\n\nEdit: I wrote some stuff in response to comments on my review, so I'll add them here.\n\nFirst of all the game is not at all in an early stage of development. It's been a year and a half since the beta began, and the developers were aiming to release 1.0 last year: "We’re going to be releasing a stable update once the tech tree can be progressed through from start to finish, after that we’re going to be focusing on finishing up this todo list for 1.0. Which we are aiming for this year, but could go into next." from Tiyuri on September 19th. With that said, the game "should" be pretty close to done by now. We've had previews of the cutscenes from before the beta even came out. But whatever, story doesn't matter I guess.\n\nThe gameplay is just bad in almost every way. Weapons are bad. In Terraria, every non-tiered weapon is made to be fun, so they're fun! In Starbound, they're created from an array of random parts. As far as I know, melee weapons have NOTHING to make them interesting- the only thing that matters about them is attack animation and DPS.\n\nArmor is bad. Each tier is better than the last, but only from a numbers standpoint. In Terraria, the armor's set effects make it more of a personal preference- you actually have a choice between which armor you want, because they're actually different! What a novel idea. For example, on one run through I used meteorite armor for a good while into hard mode as a challenge, almost exclusively using my space gun, and it was damn fun. If you use a different armor in Starbound, you'll just die faster. Also the racial armor bonuses are pretty dull.\n\nBuilding is bad. There's no real point to building anything other than decorating your ship since you need to hop planets pretty frequently. In Terraria, you have a reason to build houses (NPCs) and you even have more of a reason to decorate and care about your world because, well, it's the only world you have! Maybe colonization will help this a bit, but somehow I doubt it.\n\nMining is bad. There isn't anything cool or dangerous about it. There's stuff underground, sure, but the novelty of poop monsters, useless frog merchants, and ruins with no story behind them wears off pretty quickly. In Terraria, there are whopping great enchanted swords and pig monsters coming through walls trying to kill you, and treasure rooms, underground mini biomes with unique enemies and drops- it's quite a bit into hardmode that mining becomes farm-status without much to worry about. Even then, because you can actually make interesting items with the stuff you mine, Terraria still wins out.\n\nCombat is bad. It's just really bad. Enemies have poor AI, are generally samey and boring (thanks again random generation!) and are weirdly balanced to either kill you in one or two hits or never even damage you even on the same world. There aren't any interesting drops either- meat, pixels, maybe a weapon, but that's it. Movement in combat is pretty boring, especially with the slow backwalking. The techs barely help in this respect because they're pretty clunky to use in combat.\n\nExploring is bad. Once you've seen one of something, you've seen all of them. There's not enough variety for a game which has exploration as one of its main selling points. I can think of maybe 12 types of big explorey things (avian temple, apex obstacle course, human prison colony, etc.) off the top of my head, and you'll probably find all of them within the first 10 or so hours of play.\n\nTech is the only interesting thing about the game, and even then it's because of their unrealized potential (which will probably remain unrealized in the future.) Accessories in Terraria have much cooler effects anyway.\n\nSo tell me, why would I recommend this game when Terraria does everything better?","June 12, 2015","false","68.8"," 597 of 919 people (65%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","65","597","919","27","53"

It had monsters that came out at night, weather that made you cold, and you needed to eat or you would starve.

This is becuase for a long time, the game would not run unless I closed the launcher after launching the game, which also took me out of "in game" status, and thus did not log hours. there was also a time when starbound ran horribly if you tried to run it through steam. My true playtime is probably well in excess of the number you see above.\n\nIt's come a long way, and changed in direction and scope from what it used to be. It's a decent game all things considered, but there is a time when all the planets start to look exactly the same. When the randomly generated monsters all start to look the same. When you stop seeing new things and upon visiting a planet, decide "there's nothing interesting here." when the billionth apex lab hoves into veiw. It is certainly not a bad game, and it's developers are certainly not bad developers. but after several hundred hours of playtime, I'd think any part of any game would look like any other part of that same game. What I'm saying is that it will take you a long time before you run out of stuff to explore.\n\nOne downside that stands out the most though, is that chucklefish has a disturbing habit of including new features/mechanics, and then removing those same features and/or mechanics later. Starbound used to have a system for hunger, a system for freezing to death, and a system to burn to death. yes there is some kind of burning/freezing mechanic now, but it's nothing like the old system. in the old system, you had a meter that would slowly decrease depending on what clothes you had and when it ran out, you started to freeze/burn, and in freezing areas, you could mitigate the freezing by standing near warm things. In the new system, you get tech "skins." A sort of unlockable invisable shield that protects you from the environment. If you dont have the right skin equipped, you burn/freeze the moment you beam down to the planet and there is no other way to mitigate it other than equipping the right skin.\n\nAnother thing, after the most recent update (glad giraffe) is the new prefab creatures. Starbound has (had) randomly generated creatures, and this was one of it's selling points. Now though, the random gen creatures are very rare and most of what you find, spread evenly across all the planets, are the same canned prefabricated monsters that you would find on any other planet.\n\nIt's a cool game, but the devs need to really nail down EXACTLY what should be kept and what should be changed. Just to be clear, I DO recommend this game.","November 30, 2015","true","288.7"," 155 of 224 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","155","224","5","8"

This is an early access review, so I might change this review in the future.\n\nI used to play a lot of Terraria back in the day, and when Starbound was announced, I was pretty much hyped already. Not only it promised more of everything that Terraria already had, but also better quality. When it went into the pre-order stage (have in mind that it was a pre-order for a beta access... which is hilarious in itself) I got convinced by a friend to get it. So I did.\n\nOnce I started the game, everything looked much better than in Terraria, but really, once I got to the first enemy, I felt really put off. The starting gear you get deals almost no damage, so you spend minutes trying to slay an enemy IF the enemy is hostile. And that you never know, because all animals react differently. So you basically gamble.\nGetting your first gear is nice after some scavenging, but really not at all rewarding. You get some basic stuff, dying multiple times on the way because of the tedious and horrible combat, just to die some more with the new gear. Get used to the respawn animation, because you are going to see it a lot.\nI was also promised exploration. I hoped for more digging, well-built cave systems, like in Terraria. But I think they meant running across surfaces of various planets, because that's what you are going to be doing 90% of the time. Exploring caves? No point. You'll find better generated loot in abandoned laboratories, but it will also save you time grinding resources. This game offers you so many things, but without a Wikipedia open in another window you should forget about doing anything meaningful. It just looks like a flawed mod for Terraria, that keeps promising more of loot, better gameplay and expanding, generated universe, but lacks the polish and finish.\nNot to mention that the multiplayer requires 3rd party software like Hamachi or Tunngle to connect with friends, because a few months ago when I tried, I couldn't connect to any public server.\n\nThe games is being continuously developed, yet I see few changes to the actual gameplay.\n\nWish I could get my time back, if not the money, because it isn't likely that I'll go back to this game. It's plain boring, so unless you like long-♥♥♥ Minecraft-esque grinding, don't bother. Combat is tedious, exploration unrewarding. If anything, the artstyle helps this game, but if I want to look at nice things, I can just watch a good movie.","July 17, 2014","false","6.9"," 108 of 150 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","108","150","0","4"

Wait a few years for release if you must play.\n\n"Terreria in space" has a nice ring to it, but Starbound takes the concept disturbingly literally, existing in a universe where space explorers wield swords and shields or use bows, even the race of sentient machines dress in medieval costume and live in castles, travelling the stars in coal powered spaceships (That also look like castles). If a science fiction sandbox is what you came for, there is little to be found here.\n\nIn terms of content Starbound could be generously described as a sandbox; but by this I mean a box full of very dry, very gritty sand. You can pour it, dig it or maybe throw it about, but you can't make anything satisfying with it in it's current state; world generation that all look the same after a dozen planets, populated by ludicrously coloured aliens that happen to look almost exactly like Pokémon, construction and tools that is essentially limited to pre-spaceflight materials (Unless you steal them off more advanced races), even the wiring system that provides just a fraction of the functionality enjoyed in Minecraft with redstone (And provides what little complexity exists), is broken and has been for at least 8 months now.\n\nThe game's development epitomises the worst of early access; it came onto the scene years ago riding a wave of publicity, about how it was going to be the next big sandbox game, claiming to have members of Terreria's dev team working on it, and promising the world. But there is little content yet (What features we do have are described as a "tech demo" by the lead developer) and it has now been 6 months since the last update, and even the content they tell us will be out in the next patch (ETA unknown) isn't even a fraction of the promised features.\n\nPerhaps Chucklefish has what it takes to make good on their very, very extensive list of pre-development content promises without cutting corners. But at the current rate of development it could be 2-4 years before it's truly ready to play.\n\nUntil they add some water to this sandbox, so that it all sticks together properly and you can build something worthwhile, I'd advise holding off on getting in on the early access, you could be sat in this box a long time with just a sandy ♥♥♥ to show for it.","July 8, 2014","false","748.0"," 77 of 102 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","77","102","0","4"

So don't expect this review to take a look at nightly builds or anything released after today ( 08.08.2014).\n\nIn it's core concept Starbound is game aiming to combine the element of Metroivanias and resource gathering + building games like Minecraft. Because of an indie developer, the size of the team and naturally wanting to be a sides-scroller the game was developed as an pixel-art game. In these respects it's quite similar to Terraria, which isn't that suprising as the lead developer (Tiy) was an artist in the team behind Terraria.\nThe premise of the game was to be that your character (which would be customizable and choosen out of 6 +1 races) would own a spaceship with which he'd be able to explore nearly infinite amounts of planets, which would be precedually generated and experience some sort of story. In this adventure you'd be able to expand your ship, gather a crew, get quests and generally  use things you found during exploring to tech-up.\nThis premise would naturally allow quite a bit of freedom, making it somewhat of a sandbox style game, whereas builders could concentrate on building stuff, while adventurers could fight monsters...\n\nSo if you dislike the premise, go and ignore Starbound.\nIf you like this premise, keep on reading as i saddly can't advice to buy this game.\n\nMetroivainins life through well designed dungeons and interesting enemies, something Starbound isn't currently offering. The few dungeons in game look nice so far, but there are only a handful of them and they're not offering anything really valuabe, so there's no real reason to visit them.\nAlso Metrovanias live from the fact that your character gains new abilities. And while there are few abilities to gain, they feel pretty weak, unbalanced yet and quite often very similar. Giving the player the ability to fly for a few seconds doesn't is the same, no matter if it's represented by leaving a trail of bubbles or butterflys behind.\nOverall the combat doesn't feel balanced at the moment. There are, for example, a few end bosses. But the best tactic against them is simply building a small shelter out of some hard material for oneself poking a hole in said shelter and than shooting upwards, till the boss is dead.\n\nYou can gather resources and build stuff to get some progress. The problem with that progress is that it feels like a grindfest, so to build a better armor you not only have to mine some coloured ore (10 progression levels equal 10 or so differently coloured ores), but you've to gather pixels (which is some form of currency) which is mostly dropped by monsters, and only in small quantities.\nThere are really a lot of nicely done items one can place in the backdrop if you want to build your own outpost and there are really lot of different of materials to build a house out of. But for builders the game suffers from to many monster spawns to get said materials in bigger quantities and the pixel costs for crafting some of these items. Also Chucklefish saddly added the possibility for a meteor shower, which bears down to one big meteor hitting your base and destroying large parts of it, while not adding any way to defend against that.\n\nI personally hoped, from the preset of vast procedually generated planets and media pictures shown from Chucklefish, that exploration was going to be really interesting. They implied that different planets have different weather. Some are warmer, some are colder, some have oxygen, other lack in it. There would be cities and dungeons scattered around in the universe. And while there are some bare bones of that, the planets really don't feel that different and exploration isn't really that rewarding. Instead of spending time to find a Apex laboratory (the laboratory of some planet of the ape like ape race), one can actually better use the time mindlessly mining for some ore or hitting some monster over the head with a stick.\nYou can find techs (read special abilities) and some minor loot in some chests, but it's not really worth the whole thing. It only really is worth searching for such things, if you want to build a home out of that materials. Which again becomes a bit of a grindfest.\n\nNow as one can clearly read on the shop site, Starbound is an early access game.\nThis means that a lot of my assessments might fall short in the future, as the game gets finished more and more. But that's just one possibility. And therefore it's important to take a look at the developers themselves.\n\nWhen i first read about Starbound in 2012 i got the feeling that behind Starbound where highly idealistic developers with just a few minor games under their belt. It was one of those typical indie-dev teams which a great vision. That Tiy himself worked on Terraria, which was allready a good game back then, lead me to believe that the team was knowing what it was doing with a 2d sidescroller with a pixel look. So the goals seemed achievable.\nBack than it was implied that Starbound might be released in 2012, which as you can see, it wasn't.\nThe team developed a lot of precedual aspects of the game, saying by that it would become bigger than Terraria. Procedual weapons, planets, universe, monsters...\nAlso it was often mentioned how the player could terrarform planets, use his ships to interact with the world, meet and even gather a diverse crew and live through something fascinating. They showed mock-ups (not really labled as such back than) showing huge ships, small drop-ships, sea planets, crews and whatnot.\n\nThen 2013 came and Chucklefish started taking money to speed-up development for the planned 2013 release. They gave some stretch goals, which got achieved within only a few days and kept on openly thinking about how one could be able to use mechs and other vehicles. Or how the player would influence the universe with his quests. In 2013, quite early as far as i remember, they added a roadmap to their homepage - which is still there. This roadmap, as far as i remember, wasn't labelled specifically as a beta road map and soon got filled to 50% finished in most of the areas. When Starbound still hadn't a real release date in summer of 2013 Chucklefish began hinting at a beta release in three phases before a full release - you can find the plans and phases for the beta on the starbound homepage - http://playstarbound.com/how-the-beta-is-going-to-work/ .\nIn autumn they then opened up pre-ordering the game again, with the promise of an early beta access to the game, while still implying a 2013 release. While time went on the bars in the road map good filled and filled more but there was still no release date. Then in fall 2013 (only a few days before new years eve) chucklefish released the beta.\nI played this beta a few minutes and it felt like a somewhat solid base, which hopefully got expanded on soon. It had no quest, no terraforming, no real vehicles, no recruitable NPCs and no real balance.\nAnd it pretty much stayed that way until now. CF more or less announced the game as advertised wouldn't get released this year, but then their lead developer started to question what a 1.0 version really meant and how he was the one to decide what that means. And how people misread a lof of things as promised features, while it was only them thinking aloud.\nThey're releasing (highly bugged) nightly builds and blog posts, but a lot of that isn't nearly reaching the advertised features. And given the leads questioning one has to wonder if they're still planning on adding such.\n\nOverall Starbound as concept might even suffer from the procedual monsters and such. Because it make the game feel stretched.\n\nSo overall i'd say don't buy it, at least not yet. And really be critical of CF as they suffer from the same illness as Peter Molyneux does, overpromising and under-delivering(yet).","August 8, 2014","false","49.2"," 67 of 87 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","67","87","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverforte/recommended/211820/","silverforte","Forte","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverforte/","43 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe game has progressed but not much. They've changed some systems around and added quests, but a lot of the game's core issues have not been addressed. I think the game is better but because they keep ignoring the glaring problems the game has, my opinion that people should wait if they've not bought it has not changed in any way. They've spent a very long time promising change and the amount of the game that has been fixed or updated is not substantial considering the time they've taken to get Upbeat Giraffe out to the public and into stable. In a year, one would expect most of the game to be done after having been released to the public for beta. Call it alpha all you want, it was a beta.\n\n\n-Before I get to my points, something needs to be said here. There are accusations going around Steam (because the people here refused to go to the official forums and learn anything and then just repeat what they read here in review comments) that Chucklefish has scammed and lied. Not once has this ever happened. They are a small indie company, they're not EA. They can't just puke out a game with 50-200 people working on it. The unstable updates were consistent. If you were not aware of that and that was why you thought no progress on the game could be found, then your ignorance is to blame for your opinion. Go to the official forums, educate yourself.-\n\nHere we go:\n\nRain comes through off screen blocks and causes indoor flooding. Large quantities of water do not persist as it randomly drains both  off screen and on. These bugs have been around for a year and it is shameful that they're still there. I created a decent sized tub of water and the surface continued to drain over the course of 10 minutes despite my thorough placement of backdrop and border blocks.\n\nGame still suffers from crippling framerate problems. The more blocks and decorative entities in an area, the worse the framerate drops. It gets more severe over time until it is unplayable. Using the 64 bit experimental launcher helps but not entirely. They've stated that they're going to optimize the engine when they're done adding new systems but, with their reputation, I would not hold my breath. It's definitely better across the board (especially server side) but it still gets bad. Server latency issues from CPU and memory not releasing properly still exist. Fresh reboot -> Guy logs in right after that and moves sand or water -> 2,000 ms latency on high grade server hardware with fios connection.\n\nMob spawning is extremely annoying. They spawn over and over even in areas where you've built lights and man-made materials. So, in towns you make, monsters spawn everywhere. I've not seen them spawn indoors but for them to spawn in such vast numbers right outside the door is unnecessary and irritating. Their behaviors were tweaked so fighting them is less annoying but that turns out to be a wash when they made up for that by increasing their spawn rate. Their behaviors are less annoying but they spawn way more frequently... no advancement made.\n\nBuilding is still useless. There is no reason beyond aesthetic and creative reasons to ever build anything or revisit planets. The only form of protection we have is /settileprotection which utilizes 2 different area IDs I've seen. The IDs are 65535 and 65532. One stops damage to naturally generated objects and the other stops damage to player-placed objects. It affects the entire planet you're on when you use it and can be sort of useful... but randomly feeds back a 'Failure' error in the chat log when used. The error stops after a reboot but randomly comes back. So, if you're staff on a server and you're not the host, you may not be able to issue a restart since there is no method for remotely doing that. Meaning, if you toggle the protection one way and you need it the other way, you might get it stuck that way til you can contact your host for a reboot. Which also means if you turn protection off for editing purposes, can't get it back on and can't get in touch with the host, your server could get attacked by griefers and you'll end up screwed. There is currently a massive outcry on the official forums for more attention to be shown to server-side systems. Hopefully more than Linux will see attention.\n\nWe have to rely on thirdparty wrapper software made by fans like you and me in order to properly administrate servers. These wrappers often cause more problems than they solve. For example, StarryPy crashes users if they look inside of chests or other container objects on a planet that has protection enabled provided they are not on the planet protection list. These wrappers also cause latency issues because they use up more memory than the default server software. Having to rely on thirdparty software to fix problems that exist in the basic game is a problem gamers have had to deal with for decades. It, to me, is unacceptable for game developers to shoehorn in a multiplayer component to a game and then leave it up to shoddy thirdparty software to fix the problem.\n\nIt never does fix those problems and, most of the time, the creators of the thirdparty software (Starrypy, Starrybound) end up abandoning the projects or not being able to keep up with demand for one reason or another; usually their personal lives prevent them from being able to find the time or motivation to work on the projects. The programs end up outdated and useless. If the developers themselves would just fix the server-side components to their games, we could avoid that problem ENTIRELY and a lot of frustration would evaporate. Anyone remember Tshock for Terraria? Getting support for that game meant dealing with extremely hostile community leaders and developers who literally said they'd be nicer to people if someone paid them more. Don't even get me started on Minecraft's Bukkit. Developers create the online component then forget it exists.\n\nDevelopers: fix your own damn games!\n\nNPC guards have this behavior where they will follow you and assist you which you can toggle with the interact key. But, this variable does not persist off-screen. They will say they'll follow you automatically (annoying) then when you tell them to stay, walk away and come back even a couple minutes later, they've forgotten you told them to stay and they follow you again.\n\nNovakids are very creative and the theme is interesting. Melding cowboy aesthetic into the 'Starpeople' race is pretty clever. Their weapons are revolvers and rifles. There is also a new delete button on the character screen, a welcome addition.\n\nThe quest system offers a very refreshing take on progression. Now, you talk to your ship AI in a console on your ship and are given quests to complete. These quests help you progress through the game instead of you just digging for ore -> making object -> crafting item to summon boss -> killing boss for drop -> repeat X times as it was in the previous stable update. Quests change this up so it isn't nearly as linear. Though, there is no option to skip the tutorial and once you've done it one time, you'll be sick to death of having to do it on other characters.\n\nMy previous review saw this game sitting at 5/10 and I suggested people wait it out even though the time it takes Chucklefish to do anything is questionable. The fact they have hired a group to sell Starbound T-shirts when we still have so much in the game that needs fixed shows that they have a problem with priorities. Liquid exists in the game but can't settle if there is too much of it, rain goes through blocks and hackers still make hosting a server a nightmare because files are still clientside... but we get t-shirts and some near useless outpost vendors.

They also promised daily updates, though they hardly release one every month or two months and containing mostly bug fixes or changes to the engine, meaning little or no new content, which is actually needed or you'll get tired of the game after a few days. They promised lots of stuff long ago, stuff that modders brought us in a matter of days - and of course free! How could these people, who got paid by us, not release updates when modders do?\n\nYes, it is a fun game, it is very promising and has a lot of potential but I warn you: do not buy the game if you expect it to be finished any time soon, and by that I mean a couple years unless you really rely on mods; buy the game if you think it is worthwhile as it is now. Do not expect hard working developers on this game.\n\nAgain, if you expected a better Terraria, you will be extremely disappointed, and if you haven't even played Terraria yet - do it, it is much better than Starbound, much cheaper and has much more content.

Pre-Alpha is more like it. Everything in this game is a placeholder until the "real thing" comes along. Main story quests, progression, exploration, etc. Everything's going to change. Selling items isn't even implemented into the game yet so it's difficult to make money. There are tons of biomes and monsters are randomly generated but they're literally all the same. The only difference is what the background is and what blocks generate. Everything becames stale after a while. We explored a magma planet, tundra planet, desert planet, and jungle planet, and the layout for all of them is basically the same. Nothing memorable. Monsters all have the same AI and therefore, not memorable. You'll fight the same things whether you're in deep caverns filled with magma or on an asteriod field.\n\nDevelopement on this game has slowed to a crawl which sucks because it's not even close to finished. Beta means that the game's mechanics are finished and just needs bug fixing, stat balancing, polishing, etc. This isn't even close. Half the features and mechanics are missing. This version of the game is just a mechanics test; everything else will come later. That's how it feels.\n\nEDIT AS OF 1-21-15\n\nI reviewed this game back in July '14 (haven't played since May '14). Steam says I played for over 600 hours, this is due to the launcher bug, actual playtime is about 180.\n\nDevelopement team has implemented an "unstable build" update system. So great, we get a beta of a beta (a beta that I still believe should be called an alpha). Selling items still not implemented. Still no story or quests beyond the first 4 or so tutorial quests.

Progress has all but halted (in order to facilitate the company coming together in one office to be more "efficient"). They have forgotten on who's backs they were able to get their company together to begin with. On the backs of people who supported them when they promised a game that will be their labor of love. Now it seems they just got their hype money, and are sitting back enjoying the ride. Well it shows, and thanks to this game, I will never invest in another early access game. It breeds laziness and mediocrity among developers when they can promise whatever they want and not follow through. Maybe in time this game will become something great, but given the progress so far, I highly doubt it. I have gotten my money's worth in enjoyment, but a lot of enjoyment was seeing it grow.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/recommended/211820/","poopybutts","Andem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/","618 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI bought two copies of this game before it even came out. I gave into the hype because I loved terraria so much and I loved space so much. I've learned the hard way to never buy a game that is not out yet.\n\nThis game has many many small cool aesthetic features. There's already more furniture and different blocks in this game than all of terraria. The torches flicker. There's villages and the npcs talk to each other and say "I'll get you for killing Billy" and what not. There are monsters that make fart noises.\n\nAll in all though, the game is just an amature mess. The real meat of the game is boring and incredibly uninspired and it makes me so sad to say that since I was probably hyped for this game for years. Pixels are the in game currency and pretty much used only for crafting and I do not understand why. Say you want to make iron armor. It takes like 10 iron armor and 500 pixels. Why? Why do you need money. It should be enough that you grinded the materials for it.\n\nOntop of all that, you lose 25 percent of your pixels on death and can't get them back even if you go to where you died. There does not seem to be a sell feature either yet. (game has been out about 6 months now) and there is no way to trade pixels with friends either.\n\nThe monsters and planets are all randomly generated which sounds like an amazing idea. till you get to a few different planets and realize everything is exactly the same as the other planet. sure the enemies look slightly different but they act almost completely the same. It's much more exciting to find the non-randomized enemies around but they're rare.\n\nThe music is great and relaxing. That is until you come up upon a level 1 bird and suddenly you are assaulted with this strange epic boss fight music. It's unbelievably jarring and really takes away from the mood. When you actually find a cave and go underground there is just flat out no music at all. I found a nice flesh biome underground but it was made completely dull and uninteresting as there was no music no sounds or anything to make it sound like it was hell.\n\nThere is also an unbelievable ungodly amount of grinding. I have already mentioned that with pixels before, but it actually does get worse. Even with a diamond pick axe, going down into say the heck/flesh biome? The blocks will take about 5 or 10 seconds to break. Sure in this game you break 9 blocks at a time but it feels so incredibly boring to sit there holding down left mouse button in complete silence while you break some flesh blocks that have copper ore in them. The second boss summon took about a total of 100 steel bars. (thats 200 iron ore and 100 coal ore.) Thats not even counting the thousands of pixels spent or the armor and weapons you absolutely need to progress. The boss itself was bland and took about 3 minutes to kill and had only 2 attacks. on its death, it dropped a key which let me progress to the "harder" levels.\n\nI went to the third galaxy set and just couldn't take it. Every planet is essentially the same. Gather the resources in complete silence, fight the random monsters that all do the same thing, and then summon a boss and repeat.\n\nAh, I forgot to mention. Building in this game is great. It's well thought out and extremely easy to do. However, there is no reason to. It's incredibly depressing. In Terraria you build houses and homes for yourself and other villagers and you see your home flourish into a village depending on how you build it.\n\nIn this game? There's no benefit to making a single house. You have a spaceship. You put your crafting materials and chests in it. Whats the point in building a home on a planet when you're just going to leave it and go exploring tons of other planets? You can spawn villagers and guards, but its all aesthetic and does nothing to benefit you besides being cute. It's actually a pain to go back to any home you make on a planet since you have to go to your ship and then use your precious fuel to return back. All for what? A chance to look at a shiny castle you made? A place to find all the different colors of dirt you stored?\n\nI just can't reccommend this game right now. I thought 6 months would be enough to make the game at least a little better but i guess its not. Maybe in 2-3 more years this game will be amazing. I really hope it is. But right now it's only good intentions that are not implemented well.\n\n","July 8, 2014","false","20.3"," 82 of 114 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","82","114","0","6"

As of the time I write this, Starbound has been available on Steam for over 7 months, and there hasn't been a worthwhile update in at least 3 months. No self-respecting individual, short of the impressively arrogant or willfully blind, would consider this a positive aspect of any game, and I find myself wondering how anyone involved can defend it as anything but a tragedy.\n\nOh, right. But this is a GAME review, and I've only gone so far as to criticize the developers passively. The game itself, it's pretty fun for a while. Get some friends and enjoy the bloated sandbox environment offering 4 whole bosses, a bunch of randomly-generated monsters, and some admittedly fun mods. The development of a player relies entirely on a "carrot-on-a-stick" method of baiting that player into making equipment with higher numbers than they had, strictly so that the poor sod can beat enemies who deal bigger damage numbers than those previously encountered. It's like the worlds worst MMO, but with even less lore and far fewer people with whom to play.\n\nIn short, don't buy this game. Don't consider buying this game. Don't even convince your friend James to buy the game for you. Convince James to buy KFC for two with that money, instead. Then you, too, can experience the crippling gut pain associated with paying for Starbound, except you'll be fed for a few hours instead of disappointed for a figurative eternity.","July 11, 2014","false","77.4"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","43","51","0","0"

Their nightly build demonstrated that they have indeed accomplished nothing over the past 3 months.\n\nThey have been completely disingenuous with their spending and funding of the project. Leaving their failed deadlines aside, all money pledged to the game promised that it would speed up development of the game. In fact, it has actually slowed development down, as one of their 3 coders spent time interviewing candidates for their new "pirate game."\n\nInstead of taking the time to actually hire the necessary personnel needed to finish their initial project in a timely manner, they instead chose to fund an entirely new game project.\n\nThey are incredibly shady, as only a week ago, we found out that one of their three coders (Barwe) quit back in April, which is really huge news to keep hidden. (His twitter still said he was an employee, and their home page still lists him as an employee.) Chucklefish only came clean about it when the community really pressed them for answers. It is very likely that they had no intention of every saying anything about it.\n\nAs a whole, they are very unprofessional. I'll list a short summary to make my point. One of their coders (Omni) went on a banning spree on their forums, reddit and steam page, lashing out on everyone due to "stress." He then made an apology post, and banned himself, claiming that he would be removing himself from the public outlet. Not three days later, he unbanned himself from their steam forum to say that a poster there was legitimately mentally handicapped. Then rebanned himself. Then, due to the massive conflict his idiocy stirred up, he unbanned himself to reply yet again, making any credence he could ever have evaporate in the wind like the promises of their unfinished mess.\n\nMolly, who is the community manager has almost zero community interaction. Often, we find out important news through Tiy, Omni, or Bart. Molly spends her time using her twitter account as a personal account, promoting ideology. As the coup de grace, their whole "horse-♥♥♥♥" fiasco was recently announced by her to be "just a joke" after a large portion of their community was banned just by being outspoken against the idea. (Which according to Molly was the point of the entire "trolling.")\n\nTiy, the lead developer is a very derogatory and snide individual, who belittles those who ask simple questions regarding the health of the game. Less than two weeks ago, he took to twitter in a self-proclaimed "drugged" state, belittling people and berating those who question their competence.\n\nAll in all, I don't think these are the worst people in the world, but I would definitely say that they are easily the most unprofessional bunch of developers I've ever seen. Honestly, the biggest problem is their inexperience and lack of ability to accept criticism. The amount of cash flow they've seen has caused them to forget their humble origins, and the people who believed enough in them and their vision to part with their money on a promise.\n\nI'm sure I've missed some of their chicanery, and if you're interested, here's a bunch of helpful links that will verify all that I've said.\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/jAWKJnHy\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/docume...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bajxe4L.png\n\n***The above information was written by Billy T and not my own words.

Terraria had just released, so I got the bug of a 2D procedural sandbox game with building elements, but I was a Metroid die-hard and loved space, so I got a bunch of friends together to make a sort of space-based Terraria clone. That was.. I believe it was in May or June.\n\nFast forward a month. We're now settling on some actual solid concepts for our design and pushing a small prototype through the strainer. Written in C#, as we were experimenting with it after Terraria dropped, the game was showing a lot of progress and we were pretty excited (I was, and in some cases still am, an ANSI C die-hard.)\n\nTiyuri (the founder of Chucklefish) dials me up on IRC (Internet Relay Chat, for those uninformed.) The conversation happened on OSPNet. I was affiliated with sllabs (Secret Lair Labs) at the time. He talked to me about his new game, but instead of conversing with me as a decent person would, he made me sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) via the web.\n\nPutting aside how hilarious an NDA-via-the-web is, I forwarded the e-mail back to him with my name and address and he proceeded to tell me to stop developing Nebula, because his new game, "Starship", was being developed and he didn't want competition. He said he'd give me a "job" working in his advertising department or whatever. Essentially, trying to buy/scare me into stopping development of what would be a free, open source, and potentially Steam-releasable game born out of a couple of friends messing around.\n\nEventually, of course, I said "no", but my other friends were kind of terrified at the thought of potential lawsuits. They eventually stopped working on Nebula, and at its early stage, the project tanked.\n\nI bought this game purely to see what the "result" was. And I'm still laughing.\n\nThis game is the prime example of why someone like Tiy shouldn't lead a project. Tiy is a shoddy pixel artist looking for a way to scrape together cash off of other people's backs, and Starbound is a clear, eye-candy-inspiring way to do that. Early on, I was quite enamored. Environments that actually posed a threat? Jesus, that was something I had planned for Nebula. But then it tanked. And it tanked hard. And I never went back. Wish I could get a refund after the fact.\n\nDon't buy this game.

For instance, the latest update made smelting ore take time instead of being instantaneous. There is absolutely no reason for this beyond a weird attempt at chasing "immersion" in the name of monotonous busywork.\n\nMany flocked to Starbound (myself included) because of how impressive Terraria was and the seemingly limitless potential of this game.

The fact that the game has been in development for so long, and made the amount of money it has, and is in this shoddy and unfinished of a state speaks volumes.\n\nI really want this game to be good someday, but I think it will take new blood with a fresh eye coming in to save it.","December 14, 2015","false","40.8"," 327 of 515 people (63%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","63","327","515","15","9"

The game looked very very promising. "Terraria in Space" is what everyone was saying. Few months later, few character/world wipes happened. I had even been paying for a Starbound server so that my viewers on YouTube and Twitch would be able to play around with. We had one last update in Feb 2014 and then all the updates completely stopped, literally right after the devs spoke of a daily update schedule. The devs decided to move themselves all into an office and that was pretty much the last we had heard from them. By April, I stopped paying for the server. No new content meant nobody wanted to play it, and I'm not paying for an empty server. The game is still in Alpha. It's barebones. There are bosses, there are planets, theres a way to cheaply duplicate thousands of sentry guns. Then there was an article talking about all these planned upcoming changes, like farming progression and an actual story. This game is garbage right now in it's current state. Don't buy into the hype. Don't give the devs another cent until they finish the game. Starbound is just another example of why Early Access games should be avoided at all costs, which is a shame because there are many Early Access games out there that are shining examples of what we want in an early access game, like Broforce and Hack n Slash and Contagion.","July 12, 2014","false","132.4"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","44","54","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dwerpy/recommended/211820/","Dwerpy","Kazumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dwerpy/","122 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI followed this game for a long while. Checking blog posts on their main sites daily. Squealing over every single update. It looked smexy. The music was smexy. The hype was real.\nHeck, I even remember when the devs posted this video claiming it was their actual official trailer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0MBDzzW4b0\nIt was wonderful\nAnd when I first played, I can fully say I enjoyed my time. However, it did lack something that kept me from getting really into it.\n\nAnd so I waited.\n\nand waited.\n\nUpdate after update.\n\nAll I can say is, that feeling of emptiness... like an incomplete game... it is still there; if not more strongly than ever.\n\nI feel that the progress and development of this game stagnated and slowed a long time ago, despite the constant updates.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the art and the music is still fanhioaejgajfafFgnbAfOMG <3, but it's everything else that doesn't quite click.\n\nThings that make me cry They removed the survival elements, so it's pretty much just exploration with little consequences. There used to be food, temperature, but none of that anymore. Apparently they're adding it back in for 1.0 so that's really kewl. <3\nThey said you would be freeeeeeee to explore. But you are restricted by quests to pretty much unlock all the important stuff. So you have lots of boring fetch quests or otherwise combat quests to even bother to progress. It feels unnatural and forced; these quests feel like a wall between you and the super cool stuff like big ships and stuff.\nThat might be alright, if the combat didn't feel dreadfully awful, and if the mining wasn't 'grindy'. Hitting and killing enemies doesn't feel as satisfying as Terraria. The combat update did little to address this, there is not a lot of feedpack or impact when you do hit things with your giant future sword or awesome space shotgun. Just a little crinkle which I presume is the monster dropping gold, and poosh, nothing. Every monster feels the same, and is it just me, but where are the procedually generated monsters? You could bring up the arguement that the system just created similar monsters with the same components, but surely that's at least a bit better than seeing the same 'unique' monsters that spawn?\nThis probably explains it better than I do.\nPlanets all feel the same, and besides, you're just there to mine anyways. The planets feel copy+pasted honestly, and exploration becomes repetitive; eventually, all you'll do is pop onto a planet and mine. And the underground is nowhere as near as interesting as Terraria's, no matter how many dungeons they implement... it just doesn't have that charm.\nAlthough modding for this game is clearly an awesome and redeeming feature, I don't think that modding should have to fix the game. Playing without mods soon gets bland, and without them, there are problems within the games that aren't addressed. Such as contact damage with enemies even though they have attack animations I don't even mrgrgr.\nThe idea of building a base among the stars. A planet claimed to be yours. A fortress filled with every single cool lil' trinket you found on your stellar voyage! It excited me. But I soon came to realise that base building was ultimately useless. The universe is ultimately harmless, and you have a ♥♥♥♥ing spaceship to put stuff in.\nAs this game is nearing release, my hope for this game ever fixing the problems that stick out like a sore thumb are slim. Despite all this time in early access, the glaring issues I saw since 'release' are still there. But it's not like this game is horribly bad or anything. As mentioned, the art and music are wonderful, and the environments feel immersive and beautiful! But the combat system, the lack of freedom due to quests, the repetitive and boring exploration, and the overall blandness of the mechanics weigh it down.In my eyes, the content of this game, that seems to be praised, is measured by lines of dialogue and fetch quests.\n\nIf you're going to play it with a friend, go ahead, you'll have heaps of fun with the beautiful worlds that will be generated for your space shenanigan adventures. Just don't expect much when playing alone.\n\nIn my personal opinion, I would give it a 6.5/10. But I know there are lots of people that love this game a helluva lot, it's just that I, as a long-time fan, felt really disappointed in the end.\n\n\n\nIf anybody is going to criticise me for the lack of hours I have put in, do take note that I used to play this on another account and have clocked in more hours than just 15.","May 22","false","15.7"," 111 of 164 people (68%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","68","111","164","14","17"

Outside stands a fish; he chuckles and beckons you closer. When you approach, he regales you with stories of adventure and of entire worlds to discover beneath the depths of the earth. What mysteries does this cavern's depths contain? What secrets could you unfurl? You and your crew could know, for the low price of $15.\n\nTitillated, you hand over the money one person at a time until you've all entered the cave. Heart pounding with excitement, you light a torch and hold it aloft, illuminating the cavern with a saffron glow. Grinning, you stalk into the darkness, and grinning grins of their own, they follow you.\n\nSeveral feet in, you come to descry the visage of what appears to be a solid rock face; a dead end. Obfuscated, you give it a nudge. It doesn't move. You try again with your shoulder, but this attempt is just as futile as the last. You issue a mighty roar, bringing your foot against it, and a patina of dust glides off the surface. You watch the wall with expectance. Nothing. Sighing, you motion to your friends, and they approach.\n\nYou and your friends spend the next several hours pushing, kicking, and attempting to shove the wall down. At one point you hear the din of metal, and look over to see your friend using a pickaxe; you don't remember where or when he got it, but ultimately he's not making any progress - the wall is completely indestructable. Finally, you decide to take a break. You lean back against the cool stone and squeeze your eyes shut, the sweat trickling down your face. You're beginning to realise that it was all a farce. There was no adventure, nor mysterious depths, nor secrets to be uncovered here - and there never was.\n\nYou call to your friends to cease their efforts, and grudgingly they comply. When you again reach the outside, the sky has grown dark and there's no trace that the fish had ever been there. Furious, you squeeze your hands into fists until your nails bite into your palms, until you can just begin to feel your warm blood beginning to trickle.\n"Are you alright?" your friend enquires, placing a reassuring hand on your shoulder.\n"Yeah, it's nothing," you reply, avoiding his gaze.\n\nTurning away from him, you gaze off into the woods. Somewhere out there in that ebon expanse is a fish, chuckling merrily as he's several dollars richer and your group is several dollars poorer. In your mind, you can still hear his chuckle; it repeats itself endlessly, and you know from this moment on, that sound will haunt you for the rest of your life. You'll wake screaming in the dead of night, the sound limpid as the memories of your crushed dreams harry you again; you'll be sitting by a pond on a sunny day when the sight of a lone fish sends you sprawling away in terror; you'll be telling a joke and one of your friends will laugh, and that laugh will remind you of that fateful day - that one fateful day, where you and your friends were blithe and stupid enough to listen to that fish...that one...sordid...chuckle fish!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtlWlLxxsi4","June 19, 2015","false","32.2"," 263 of 416 people (63%) found this review helpful 257 people found this review funny","63","263","416","257","0"

I'd just finished playing terraria, and this game seemed like the perfect formula from that but expanded to become better with an entire universe of randomly generated planets to explore. The original concept was amazing, you have your own ship, you explore planets, get resources, weapons, meet new races, build a house on said planet if you wish. Then once you got enugh fuel, you flew to another planet and progressed onwards. Bosses would be summoned (like terraria) to drop a new nav segement for your ship to exlore further. I loved this, don't get me wrong, but after a long time, updates were introduced to the game to that made it progressively worse and added things that weren't needed (in addition to the early updates wiping saves). The game is now saturated with bad idea after bad idea, and the fun little take on a terraria-esqe exploration game is gone. My recommendation is, don't get this game until the developers get their act together and actually finish the game, as the state it is in isnt warrant a purchase unless it truly is finished and out of "early access".\n\nTL;DR - It's another early access game that doesnt know how to finish itself due to poor team management. Only buy on sale (if you're extremely interested) or wait until it's truly finished and consider it then.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this review.","December 26, 2015","false","146.4"," 262 of 418 people (63%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","63","262","418","16","9"

Starbound went from Mostly Negative to Very Positive in a span of less a month. This results in the game having "Very Positive" reviews despite the entire first page and beyond of Most Helpful reviews being negative.

I loved it. I was enamoured by everything that it promised, and I played and played and played back when it had been recently released into early access. Everything they promised sounded so cool, and everything the game already had was awesome. I played a very early version of it (which was still awesome) and had to deal with a few wipes, and it was reasonable. They were improving it all the time, but a lot of things were still broken, or didnt work. crashes happened, things got deleted, files were lost, but it was perfectly alright. After all, it was an early access game. So I decided, alright, I love this game. So let's wait for it to be released. And I waited... and waited... and waited...\nAlmost three years later, it still hasnt been released.\nNow I am looking at what is being said of the changes that have been made in the time I have been away, and quite frankly I dont think I even want to bother with it anymore.\nI stop and wonder if this would have happened this way if this game hadnt been so successful on early access... and honestly I dont think it would have gone down this way. And that is the real problem.\n\nEarly access allows small developers with good ideas to get the financial backing to complete their awesome and creative projects.\n\nor\n\nIt allows small developers to earn money, procrastinate, and prolong deadlines until they forget what the hell they were originally paid for.\n\nThis was a ripoff. They sold me the promise of a game, and four years later it still hasnt been delivered. In fact the product that is now being offered is quite different to the original game that was sold to me. So, really, do yourself a favor and stay away from this and any early access game.","May 3","false","45.9"," 194 of 307 people (63%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","63","194","307","11","13"

build it. want a giant tree in a sea of tentacle monsters? build it. want a base at the center of the earth where only the monsters that dwell dare approach? do it man its your world(s).\n\nwhen you explore in this game you dont have to worry *oh man am i gonna get lost?* nope. not at all. planets loop back around giving you a sense of the finiteness of a true planet. there is a center to each planet. there are multiple biomes to each planet *though i feel the poison biome needs to back up a bit. its in every planet and the tiny pools are a pain to avoid* ive run into tentacle planets, ice planets, forrests, jungles. ive run into brain planets people, its pretty intense.\n\nmechanics? oh yeah.\njumping in this game doesnt slow or speed you up but when you find a planet with low gravity it changes your perspective of movement. trust me the first time will take you for a ride. there are also things in this game called tech which of any other game would pretty much be special moves but they can open up whole new worlds for you. some techs can let you fly, some just let you move faster. some give you an awesome mechs and others give you the ability to make travel systems.\nfighting mechanics in this game play alot like terraria in the sense that your mouse controls where you shoot, your mouse controls the direction you face and swing and the weapons decide the type of attack you do.\ndid i say its like terraria? oh my its such an upgrade in fighting mechanics. your weapons alone can be so many variations to speed, swing type and secondary abilities. ive played this game for a few weeks now and ive found lightning, fire, poison, knockback, explosions?! and thats just swords!! i havent even started on guns yet!\nguns. the backbone of range. currently there are no recepies to make guns in the game as it stands but the guns are hillariously different. your friend can find a gun that shoots bullets, pretty fast speed and all, you on the other hand may find a bazooka that shoots lazer missiles that light up the sky and explode in blue glowy goodness. each gun has the potential to have different colors to different abilities. the ammo types alone make guns rediculous. i found a gun just the other day that shot stick mines, they fire pretty fast, stuck to walls, and exploded on impact. it was rediculous.\n\nsoundtrack.\noh my the sound track in this game just makes you feel like you really are on an adventure. i will say that there isnt MUCH music as of yet but it is very appropriate when it does play. you get certain music at night, certain music in day. when youre underwanter the music muffles itself so you know, when youre to low in the world the music stops so you know just how deep  you are. battle music is intense, but needs more variation. considering this is only beta and they have this well orchestrated music im dying to see what they do with it\n\nnow on to dungeons.\nhave you ever just walked around and thought *huh this place is pretty barren, i feel like the only person on this planet* starbound can do that, but with a reason. dungeons in this game can be as small as a little trapped apex hut all the way down to a subterranian military base. you can find tombs, bases, ruins, hell i found a dungeon after running into an outhouse all by itself in the field and noticed....is that a sewer down there? indeed it was explorers. packed with poo monsters and sewage blocks. i found that absolutely hillarious.\n\nnpcs.\nas it stands now there arent that many things to do with npcs though you will find in later levels having a chef in your home will be useful since it can sometimes be hard to farm up the necessary food to make the items you need to survive. you cant sell right now but they intend to add that into the game *thank god* and make more functions for ncps. more personality, more function, more life. to put it bluntly i ran into an avian temple with friendly npcs and i climbed all the way to the top. at the top of this building there were two avian saying *im not ready for this* *i thought i had stealed myself for this* they were preparing to jump from the ledge in an act the lore explained simply as "fly or die" thats right. the lore in the game actualy is presented by the races that spawn. i found that little story in a book i found in a city of avians, read it, then ran into them afterwards and was astounded by the depth of these people. currently there arent really that many races cities finished but the ones that are are huge. races have their own dungeons as well which can be pretty fun to explore and understand more about them.\n\nbosses and enemies.\nthe enemies in this game litterally are never the same. they can look similar but never the same. the fun part about this is not all monsters will come up to attack you, some are friendly. the actual fun part about this is that cute little squirrel looking creature over there will come to rip your eyes out but the giant spikey girrafe will leave you alone and go about its business. never judge monsters by their appearance, they will always surprise you and their attacks in some cases can be pretty devastating. flying monsters are a pain even with guns sometimes as they can move pretty fast and have pretty hard hitting attacks but little hp. the only thing about them that i find lacking is the attack functions compared to the variety of monsters. most will always charge, few have attacks other than that and they are usually pretty predictable.\nbosses. there are only a few bosses in this game and truely they dont pose much of a threat given the right amount of preperation. the problem i find with this is you spend ALL that time getting resources and then when that fight comes up its just like fighting any other monster just way bigger and harder hitting. i would like to see these bosses upgraded in some way or at least the ones implimented later add in some other features. and to my second point there arent enough boss monsters YET for the entire progression of the game. i suspect they plan to add in bosses for each teir of gear *currently stops at 10* which will be amazing but i hope they make the monsters a little harder to handle giving you a senese of progression.\n\nBUILDING!!!\nas many people who have played minecraft and terraria there is a certain time when you want to settle down and just build a home. fantastic idea. the building in this game is actualy very similar to that of terraria. you have foreground and background to play with. the only real gripe i have about this game so far in this aspect is you cant craft alot of materials to build. you are kinda stuck right now with cobblestone wood and sand for the most part and other terrain materials you pick up as you gather, but the other materials like castle blocks and tomb stones maybe even just some fancy bricks all come from cities and take a HUGE amount of time just to break. now i dont want to be able to make the special stones from dungeons, thats just giving me the game, but there needs to be more than you can make in the ways of craftable building blocks for a player, even if its just by schematic, im cool with this.\nthe smal little decorations you can remake by adding to your 3d printer on your ship and to me, thats good. it keeps my crafting window clean and free of junk that i wanted to store but not see every day....","January 13, 2014","true","429.1"," 262 of 421 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","262","421","0","3"

I snagged it up the day early access became available. I was so excited for a game that would be terraria, only with new animations, awesome looking guns, tech, mechs, the whole nine yards! So what happened? I can't be bothered to play it for more than 30 minutes at a time, and even then, I only feel like playing once a month. Everything is there. Crafting, building, mining, fighting, even features that terraria doesn't have, like quests, NPC's that don't live with you, actually being able to aim your melee attack. Yet it still falls short. It lacks something Terraria just, has. The IT factor. Maybe when it's done I'll change my mind, but it just feels impossible at times, and by the time it doesn't feel impossible, it's just boring. I mean, at it's current state, it's gather resources, build beacon, fight boss, build map upgrade, go to new planet, gather resources, build beacon, fight boss- You get the point. It's repetitive, it's slow, and it's just boring. I get excited every single time Terraria gets a new update. I'm not even aware of the current dev state of Starbound anymore. Again, things could change, the promised finish project sounds really great, and if you've got 15 dollars just lying around, sure, pick it up, but I just can't recommend that you buy it unless you meet those parameters.\n\nSorry Starbound, but until you pick up the pace on your updates, and give us something worth being excited over, I think you might be a dud.","July 12, 2014","false","35.3"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","41","52","0","0"

For me, regardless of the progress they make or how good or bad this game turns out to be they have alienated their customers and deserve no support whatsoever.\n\nThe only thing that has kept me from putting in a refund request is that I know nobody could have planned from the start to do this bad of a job. I do hope the creators of this game read all the negative comments and realize just how awful of a job they have done and hopefully make good changes in the future because of it. I personally will never buy another Chucklefish game again, at any stage... alpha, early access, beta, completed or otherwise. And not just the publisher, I will most likely avoid any future projects of the development team as well.

It has a long progression time, meaning you have LOTS of time before you reach end tier gameplay, which is awesome. As it is I think it is a very fun game...\n\nHowever, and this isn't in my personal opinion enough to not recommend the game, the updates are really slow. New content is released in unstable builds quite regularly, but it's not necessarily "big" updates.\n\nI took a break well over a half a year year ago since playing the game back when it first came out. When it first arrived the game was quite bland, with abusable bosses, and the only progression being "mine ore, fight boss, craft crafting bench, mine ore, fight boss, craft crafting bench, etc. etc.", although the atmosphere was (and still is) quite amazing.\n\nNow in the new "big winter update" version, it's a heck of a lot better, with a ship you upgrade over time, an interesting active ability system, quests, dungeons, mini dungeons, and a fairly well paced progression system, among countless other fun things. I remember getting a good number of friends on my server with different instruments, and we all got together in a band and played a song, and it was pretty cool. There's a lot of possibilities to explore with what's provided.\n\nFor the building oriented players, I don't think it's quite on the level of games like terraria and minecraft, however the addition of wiring and futristic technology, along with lots of tile sets can allow for some pretty interesting building design. The game is certainly more combat oriented than it is building oriented.\n\nI mean all in all, it's a pretty cool game, just keep in mind if you want a massive universe full of amazing discoveries and an MMO style experience, where you can run into other people on other planets, or if you want more than repeated structures and naturally generated terrain to find as you explore new planets, that's not in the game yet, and given the current pace, it's going to be a long long time before that goal is reached.\n\nRecommendation: Skim a few youtube videos and watch a few trailers. If you think you'd like the game in it's current state, buy it now, have some good fun, and then put it off to the side for a while and come back later when it's more updated. It'll be the gift that keeps on giving. If you don't like it in it's current state, but like the planned features, you might have to wait a good while for those, but I would recommend you go through with that wait, since you never know what might happen to the development before those features arrive.","January 28, 2015","true","126.2"," 251 of 403 people (62%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","62","251","403","24","2"

A lot of work has been done in that span of four years, and honestly, I couldn't be more proud of the developers for sticking through this far. Building a game is hard. Receiving criticism is hard.\nAs much as I absolutely adore the game, it's not finished. You can't judge it as if it were a finished product, as it's not. There's still structures to build, updates to develop, likely huge amounts of content that isn't yet finished or even an idea yet.\nListen.\nI love this game. I'll ramble on about it for ages to anyone who'd bother to listen, and I'll recommend it to anyone who's looking for a breath of fresh air from their intense Terraria runs, or anything.\nBut, it's not done. If you don't like it, great! Maybe it's just not your cup of tea. Maybe you just don't like the fact that the game does very well feel empty in a lot of places (the last time I played, I remember complaining to one of my friends that there was a severe lack of underwater Hylotl cities on the ocean planets) and how so much of the game just feels... incomplete. That's because it is.\nI'll support this game to hell and back five times, but I can't stress enough- it's not done. It won't be for while. I recommend it, hell yeah, it's a great time if you're a fan of Terraria or maybe just science fiction in general or really, any sort of way you could describe this game- a sandbox, but in SPACE! But it isn't done. It kinda saddens me to see so many people disliking the game for the fact that it simply isn't finished, but I can see where they're coming from.\nThink of it as Terraria, but more focused on space travel and the lore. It'll be a great game once it's finished - I'll call it a great game now, even.\nIf you've got a spare fifteen bucks, or maybe ten or so if it's on sale, get it.

Having said that, the game itself isn't worth your money. The content is all extremely repetitive, and if you find yourself checking back for any reason after the initial 5-10 hours, it'll be to see if any updates have taken place. You'll be met with disappointment. Avoid leaving the launcher up when you leave the game, as that trumps up your playtime as well, and Tiy loves to run to Twitter citing higher playtimes as reasons his game must be better than it is.\n\nNow, on to why you REALLY shouldn't play this game:\n\nThe company behind it, Chucklefish, is among the most unethical and dishonest companies around. They're setting themselves up to be a miniature Electronic Arts. They're just as greedy, except they produce less.\n\nThey released nearly 7 months ago, and thus far have only produced two updates of questionable value, after taking in four million dollars in funding. From the moment of release it has been plagued with excuses for why development stopped, such as taking a month vacation after Steam release, then another 3-4 months so they could move a few members to London for communication purposes (which hasn't solved anything yet), to knocking off early for, "Mario Kart" sessions. Development remains in a state of limbo, and nobody is really sure what's going on.\n\nLuckily, they don't communicate with the Steam community either, so the ignorance is shared among their company and investors. I mean, sure, they make loads of money on the platform, but when it comes to updating the folks that supported their 7 month vacation, you have to paw through every social media site known to man to actually locate information, and when you do, it's usually about everything BUT "Starbound." Wondering when the next update will be? I hope not, because their site, Reddit, and Twitter - the places they direct you to for announcements - contains everything from their new office dog, to employees playing in trash cans, to excuses for ranting on Twitter, such as them being under the influence of surgical drugs following an operation, yet managing to spend the entire day on Twitter.\n\nSpeaking of communication, unless it's blind praise, they don't want to hear it, and they WILL censor you. They'll claim they don't, and sure, you'll hear reports of their official websites being highly censored, and probably not think too much about it. "Two sides to every story" you'll tell yourself, until one of their developers comes through Reddit, Steam, and the Chucklefish forums and goes on a massive ban wave of critics, while allowing the harshest fanboys to remain, and you'll quickly learn it's true. The one responsible for the project, Tiyuri, even dedicates a significant portion of his day on Twitter calling all criticism "trolling" in an attempt to garner sympathy. If you head to their forums, they'll label ALL criticism - either done well or blatantly trolling - "flamebait" and lock it immediately... if you're lucky. Often enough, people have been banned for it, regardless of post quality.\n\nThere's more, but what I'm trying to say is, no matter what goes on with this game, don't support it. We've already funded the vacations of some of the laziest, most condescending people imaginable. They make promises they can't fulfill, spend most of their free time Tweeting and blogging about wasting time between complaining about the investors critical of them, taking the development money and spending it on other publishing ventures, and generally treating those that supported them with disdain and contempt, whilst simultaneously running off to Tweet about how everyone is mean to them and they don't understand why.\n\nThere are PLENTY of good indie companies out there, and Chucklefish is the exception to the rule. Give them your money instead.","June 17, 2014","false","43.3"," 81 of 119 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","81","119","0","9"

Yeah sure, its fun for a few hours or days but then you realise that theres not much to do.

"Finally a Terraria in a sci-fi setting - just up my alley" - I thought.\n\nThe game itself has potential in many aspects (sandbox creation, roleplaying immersion etc). You get to create your own character with some basic customization - then you start on a broken spaceship and have to descend onto the planet below to gather resources to be able to continue on into the galaxy and other planets. A lot of exploration follows, but most planets are very generic and alike.\n\nRince and repeat.\n\nCurrently the gameplay and content is very limited. You will keep collecting resources like ore/wood, fighting monsters that pretty much do the same thing over and over again. The combat mechanics are pretty plain. There's not much point into making any houses on a planet with the ship being a viable storing and farm-option. The same thing repeats over several tiers until you hit the end-tier.\n\nWhat prompted me to not recommend this game to any one new to Starbound is the lack of updates from the developers. They've not been upfront or honest with the community and their backers - dates keep being pushed, updates not appearing for many months and a constant change of development strategies (like reworking basic core features, re-prioritizing content creation and contradicting earlier statements quite often).\nAnd there has also been a harsh censorship going on on their forums, where even people who aren't rude nor trolling - but raising valid questions and concerns are getting suspended. I shall also not mention how certain members of their staff have been rude towards the community, which is very unprofessional from a business perspective.\nThere are many other examples of early access developers (be it indie or otherwise) that have handled their projects in a much more professional way.\n\n\nAll in all, if the developers at Chucklefish get their thing together one beautiful day - this game might be worth investing in. Until then, do yourself a favor and do not buy this product.","July 24, 2014","false","254.2"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","39","49","0","1"

I remember seeing it on the steam page in its full blocky glory, both polished and gritty at the same time. The art style drew me in, the music chained me up and the beauty of this simple work of art made me stay. I loved it. I created my first character, who possessed an interesting background and an awesome head of bright pink hair (the color of which no longer exists :( ). His name- Gregby! I joined into the game and it game me a few simple prompts- To give me my 'matter manipulator', a simple digging tool that works on all materials but is very weak, and a basic sword. I remember beaming down and being killed again and again by some weird little bear frog cat with tentacles, but I loved it! In time I had a bow, and soon after a better sword, and even sooner a full set of clothes! I was ready to explore the universe- Or so I thought. I left that nice, temperate planet in favor of a snowy giant and soon froze to death. I felt such relief when a fire was in sight, when I had food to eat, when I was safe from the evil robots and awkward aliens. I loved it. Soon I was exposed to the beautifully coherent multiplayer servers and the friendly inhabitants of them. I knew this was the game for me.\nAfter a few months of playing, the game suddenly stood still and imploded. The torrent of new patches drove away some of my favorite modders, the game got needlessly complicated and extraordinarily easy. I never felt the relief of a campfire or a warm bed, and my adventures soon became linear and uninteresting. My exploration into planets for coal and resources soon became preset quests for power systems that didn't make sense. I mean what in the hell is a 'core fragment'?! I longed for the robot wizard towers, castles, flying ships in the middle of dusty deserts, crashed military cruisers and poop dungeons. Instead, I was given like 6 extra crafting tables and a glob of unnecessary updates. Sometimes, Chucklefish, less is more, and I never felt anything was missing before. Just a little more content- The stuff you promised. I wanted guilds, more music, ship upgrades and new tech. Sprinkle in a planet harvesting laser and it was a recipe for success- But now it's not. Quests as you have them don't really belong in a sandbox game. I still love the game because, at heart, it's a fantastic game, but it's almost off the tracks and you need to fix it before it becomes a train wreck.","October 11, 2015","false","329.6"," 205 of 327 people (63%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","63","205","327","15","10"

A thoughtlessly-designed mess of features that all look great on screenshots but fall very short in execution. While the hope with Early Access titles is that they will be improved and the issues will be fixed, I have no hopes for this happening. Despite the claim of "thick and fast" updates, the last meaningful one was six months ago.\n\nTo go into detail: Despite being a sci-fi title, most of your weapons will be swords or hammers. There are guns, but they're rare and impotent. If you want a mobile light source you can craft a candle-lantern-on-a-stick, rather than a shoulder-mounted LED or similar. These are examples of things that end up making the setting feel more like a fantasy setting with spaceships arbitrarily tacked on.\n\nExploration, which should be the game's strong point, is ruined by the sheer vastness of the randomly generated planets, the tier system, and the coordinates system. Why should I build a house on this planet, over the one next to it? Why should I build a house on this tier-2 planet which only has iron on it, when I can wait and build it on a tier-5 planet with better materials? Why even explore at all, when I could just go on the forums and look up the coordinates of a planet with amazing weapons?\n\nCombat is weak, and floaty. Can best be described as two people on a trampoline hitting each other with pool noodles. Progression consists of mining ore (with a pickaxe, of course. What do you think this is, the future??) to get armor and weapons. When you first enter a new tier, enemies will be killing you in only a few hits. When you get the armor of that tier, you become very resistant to their attacks. It results in a game where you're never properly challenged: You are either fleeing helplessly from the sky demons, or crushing them in one hit.\n\nOn top of all of this, the game is bizarrely resource-intensive for a 2d platformer. I have a fairly powerful system capable of playing full 3d games (Crysis 2, Max Payne 3), yet I have gotten consistently poor framerate.","June 3, 2014","false","135.5"," 57 of 80 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","57","80","0","3"

The promised features, the visuals, the music, even many of the functioning mechanics.\n\nI've been cautiously optimistic despite all the setbacks and drama and, frankly, horrible decisions on Chucklefish's part.  I've been hoping that deep down they want to see Starbound completed as much as any of the players who jumped in early.  Even if jumping in early was supposedly going to speed up the 2013 release of the game that was going to happen no matter what, which not only didn't happen but that particular FAQ item was removed from the site and Chucklefish seems to think no one noticed or remembers its wording.\n\nStill, I've held onto hope.  Then I read this.\n\n"I feel 1.0 is an arbitrary release number and it’s down to us to decide what 1.0 means in the context of our game."\n\nThat's Tiy, in a recent post to Starbound's website.  Stating his philosophy of what "1.0" means to a game release.  First they redefine what qualifies as a beta, which is apparently the state Starbound is in right now (it's alpha, very early alpha even).  Now they're redefining what qualifies as a 1.0 release.  Because it's down to them to decide these standards, since they've earned that privilege.\n\nThis is exactly what everyone in my situation has been fearing.  That with Starbound being declared a beta when it was clearly not in any way close, it would be declared released when it was finally in a beta state, if even that far (it is still not in any way close).  And now Tiy has basically announced that Chucklefish will do just that.\n\nI can no longer in good faith recommend Starbound.  I recommended the game it was supposed to be, despite it being unfinished, because I had some faith that it would be completed.  And maybe if you cram it full of mods it can approximate that.  But Chucklefish may go down as the worst developer ever, if they keep this nonsense up.  They've redefined the industry standards for what qualifies as "alpha" and "beta," and now they're doing it again with "1.0."\n\nTiy mentioned all the good reviews Starbound has received.  It shouldn't be receiving any reviews.  It's not done.  Early access impressions, maybe, but any critic who reviews Starbound as if its complete should stop writing reviews because they've failed pretty hard (especially if they won't acknowledge how that incompleteness hurts the game).  And any critic who writes an early access impression that doesn't factor in Starbound's rough history is still failing pretty hard.\n\nThey've made over $20 million on this game (over $4 million just through preorders on their site), and they couldn't be bothered to put that money towards a development team that could help them fulfill their promises, or at least make up for those they've broken.  This has to be a record for poor financial management by a game developer.  They not only didn't expand their team, they defended that decision by claiming it would actually make things harder.  And in some contexts that might be true, it's probably possible to have too large of a development team, but Chucklefish wasn't and isn't close to having that kind of problem.\n\nThat money is also why I don't feel bad about giving a thumbs down.  They've probably made more money on this game pre-release than most indie devs can hope for after they release their games.  They've made EA-level money, and really don't need more of it.  They don't deserve more of it.  They need to start properly using what they've already made as they explicitely promised they would (before removing that promise, anyway).\n\nI am legitimately depressed by this development.  The reason Starbound brought in this kind of money is because so many people want what was promised, and those people hyped it to other people who also want that.  This is a game people want, it's very appealing, and they paid for it in an incomplete state because that's how much they wanted it.  But they also paid for it in that state because Chucklefish promised so hard that it was going to be completed last year no matter what.  It was so going to happen, just trust them.\n\nI want the game that was supposed to be released in 2013.  Any claims that we got what we paid for because this is early access, or because it's beta (it's not), are ridiculous.  And with this talk about what 1.0 means for Starbound, it's not clear if we'll ever get what we paid for.\n\nI'll write a more positive impression or review if and when I get it.\n\nWhich I really hope happens.  It's just really, really hard to believe it will.","July 22, 2014","false","420.0"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","36","45","0","0"

My prediction - One of the best sandbox games of 2018. I still think Chucklefish is the worst. I will be avoiding their games in the future.\n\n\n\nStarbound had made over $4,000,000 when I last checked. I'm sad to say that $20 of that came out of my own pocket. I had high hopes for this game. I purchased it on Dec. 7th. It was virtually unplayable. Now it's Sep. 30th. Still unplayable. Everything about this game is terrible. There are other reviews that go into detail but you can rest assured that it all sucks. Where are the updates? Last update was in April. What have they been doing? I consider Chucklefish to be thieves and liars. They have soured me on the whole concept of Early Access. I want my money back.\n\nPROS:\nIt's supposed to be cool and fun to play, like Terraria.\n\nCONS:\nIt's not cool or fun to play.\nBad physics\nrepetitive weapons/guns\nrepetitive enemies\nrepetitive worlds(different skins. that's it.)\nSerious lag issues\nsoundtrack sucks\nEarly beta for over 9 months.

The developers did not deliver on their promises, have released little to no recent updates, and have seemingly just up and abandoned the game. I should have just set my $45.00 on fire because that would have at least provided me with a small amount of warmth for a short period of time; spending it on Starbound was a foolish mistake. Pre-ordering the Gold Tier, and giving these scammers even more money, was an especially foolish mistake.\n\nDo not buy Starbound. It's already like a year, if not moreso, behind schedule with no signs that the game will ever be finished. What the developers promised sounded pretty good but it's very apparent that they now have no interest in following through on those promises.\n\nDo not buy Starbound; it's a waste of money. I cannot stress that enough: do NOT buy Starbound.","October 13, 2014","false","9.1"," 132 of 207 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","132","207","0","0"

The game of massive potential with nearly zero progress.\n\nI really want to like this game, but the developers make sure you can't. From the absolute awful forum management, to the abysmal updates, this game is going nowhere fast. It takes the development team a month to implement one update, and they are usually all the things you don't care about this early on, like Flickering Lights.\n\nThe storyline is currently 1/10th complete, and it has been out for nearly two years. If that rate of progress doesn't scare you off, don't worry, it gets worse. The company has since moved offices (to a different country), expanded their team, and started over 5 new projects. I wonder where all the Kickstarter and Steam money is going?\n\nNearly every patch will wipe your character and world. In the 50+ hours I have played, I have completed the game three times (and I wasn't rushing to end game).\n\nI strongly recommend you avoid this game.

Devoured all the lovely material on the Chucklefish website. Got very excited. Very pretty roadmap released - game looks almost finished! Most things on there are at 90 percent. Woohoo! Early access, of course I will buy this game ahead of release, it promises to be amazing. Fast forward to release of beta.\nWhat a tragic waste of time. It's like someone modded Terraria badly. Nothing in terms of functionality is new, everything that was promised is missing and everything that is there is very very dull. Joylessly mash through the tech tiers. Wish I was playing Terraria.\nWeeks pass, no sign of updates. Voicing concerns on forums is met by a cloud of Chucklefish interns beratting you for asking when the thing you have paid for might be ready. The beta gets renamed. Apparently the beta was never a beta in the first place, it was an alpha. Chucklefish start implementing mods supplied by people desperate to make the game interesting. None make it to the actual playable game as it is never updated.\nWoefully and bitterly I resign to never pay for early access again. Chucklefish start working on other titles. Cobwebs start to grow over an angry dwindling community who had hoped for so much more.\nLet's not get fooled again.","October 21, 2014","false","20.7"," 200 of 322 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","200","322","0","0"

Even for early access, the game itself is really buggy. There's no reason to ever set up a homebase on any planet since you're constantly moving around (the only really "permanent" location is your ship), really reducing how fun the building is. In addition, the whole game (even late game) just feels like a search for more fuel for your ship. This was really over-hyped and not worth it.\n\nThe devs rarely, if ever, communicate with the players.

While this review may be a dry wall of text not recommending it now, it could change! Maybe into an exciting picture, an action adventure platformer game, dating sim, puzzle, VN, 3D shooter, blockbuster movie, critically acclaimed best selling epic trilogy of books, or even a positive review! Hype, hype, hype! Features may be added and removed. Such is Early Access. Better like it now, and like it even if it changes, 'cause your stuck with it.)\n\nWhen I got this game in 2013, it was little more than a planetary strip mining sim. Now, it's also an annoying tutorial fetch quest game, too. They had a great idea, but has never gone beyond "meh" level for me. The base game should be great alone. My only hope is that modding doesn't die off completely, and modders can make something good out of it. Shouldn't have to be that way on their flagship title. It has not lived up to it's potential or hype.\n\nA game is nothing with out its developers. So I don't recommend anything they touch, now, either.\n\nEverything in the game is a placeholder as said by the developers. Placeholders are a staple of tech-demos, early alphas, and alpha games, not so much for betas. Some betas may have placeholders, but not as every feature! And what beta game has everything been stated as a placeholder? Only Starbound. Some people paid to playtest, to help them out. What is the point if "everything is a placeholder"? They can't make a commitment to what will be in the game, or what the game is supposed to be? Sure seems like it.\n\nSo much for a design document. Keeping that 'secret' only gives them a great excuse to keep doing, well, whatever it is they do. They don't want to spoil the end? Is it going to be that bad? Why even sell it, then? Perhaps the rumors are true. There never was one. Would explain all the changes of story and game direction. Best they have shown is a flow chart. A simple flow chart is not a design document.\n\nOne of the points of early access is to playtest, bug test, and give feedback. Note the absence of the developer presence on the only legal distributor of the game. The place that hosts the Early Access program that protects them. Everyone has to have Steam to get a legitimate copy, don't they? Don't forget this game had a pre-order, with no definite word if there would even be a beta release, or if there would be anything other than a finished game.(Or even be on Steam.) I'm scared to even think what little broken content there would have been had they released it back then. Good thing they found Early access! It is probably better that we'll never know what a they wanted to sell us originally.\n\nThere is also is/was the launcher bug that tracks additional time NOT played. They knew about it, and did nothing. It is in the developers best interest to let other people think owners are playing far more than they really are. I only wish this game was fun enough to put 300+ hours into. Not even close. Steam game tracking is notorious for being wrong, but being a smart cookie, you already knew that.\nOr maybe you have a magic crystal ball of science magic? Then you also know what my other games real times are, too? I have many that have been played but haven't been tracked. I have games that should have even more time on them, too. You must also have that research paper/scientific study done on hours played equaling fun, too. Oh, that one doesn't exist. Sorry.\n\nIndie used to mean independent of a publisher. CF is now a 'publisher'. Don't worry, they like to redefine words a lot, as they are a special snowflake. They sold a tech demo/pre-alpha as a beta. One year is soon in chuckle-time. Almost done in 2012. A road map that showed far more completion of things not yet done. Mock-up of things that were never to be in game. A bit of honesty would have gone a long way! Seems more marketing and hype was done, rather than work on the game.\n\nOne of the worst thing is really all the whiteknighting fans who have no understanding of the Early Access program. They are allowed to troll other fans and attack any feedback that could possibly be negative, even if it isn't. If someone has a problem or idea, they can expect to be attacked. These trolls don't even get a warning. Very poor moderation at best, even when they have their own moderators on the Steam forums, that is. They do come by and do forum cleanups, got to make the forums look 'clean' for a sale or update. Other developers have good and helpful Steam communities. Too bad they fostered the very toxic community they ignore. They must want it this way, as they have the power to change it, but don't.\n\nBut hey, it's all a placeholder anyway. Wonder if we will ever get the REAL game? Maybe that will be good?\n\nJust remember, it's all your fault. Steam and Chucklefish have said so.\n\nTwo good things did come from Starbound for me.\n1) I met a lot of cool friends, (some who like the game, some that don't) many who I would not have met otherwise. Can't put a dollar value on that.\n\n2) Looked into the Steam Early Access policy. Learned that it's just some toothless guidelines that allow for developer misbehavior. Steam cares more for it's real customer, other game developers, than the consumer. Some developers have great work ethics and can deliver. The other bad developers are protected, and they get a golden parachute. Only the worst offenders get pulled from the store. Pity, the idea is good, but its implementation has no consumer protection. Perhaps Early Access is in early access, too. Regardless, I won't make another purchase for a 'maybe' game. Saved a bunch of money and disappointment by not buying many program failures. Like: The Stomping Lands, Spacebase DF-9, StarForge, among others. Sucks for the good developers who use the program as intended. If I cant trust Steam and VALVe to stand by the products they sell in early access, I just won't buy them. Simple.\n\nStill wonder when I'll get that game that was hyped. What I have now is not that game.\n\nTL;DR:\nFor those who don't like to read, online forums tend to rely on the written word. Seems like all forums are filled with words. Why are you even here, then? As for walls of text, libraries and books must not be your thing, then, too? Are you such a vidiot that the presence of written or typed words make you angry? I don't disagree that the reliance on only one form of media is the best rout, as one should seek as many outlets as possible to make a truly informed decision. I don't personally put a lot of stock into youtubers that get free games to test and positively endorse. Nor does peoples monetizations of their YouTube accounts give me any confidence that the goal of the videos is simply to inform... only to entertain and make money. Take everything with a grain of salt, even this wall of text. Yet, information is power. Had I and others known all of the available information that was buried and hidden out there at the time, not listened to people who held only positive opinions, and not seen positively slanted 'lets plays'... many would not own the games now, myself included. Much info was found in hindsight looking for answers that few seemed to have at the time and the developers would not take the time to answer. But why does one even need to spend countless hours researching all of the internet, when a honest developer could lay out an informational bonanza of truth in one place? Seems odd over a game, down right shady, in fact.\n","May 20, 2015","false","314.1"," 289 of 473 people (61%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","61","289","473","27","23"

Early access is one thing but this is another.  I've had it for quite a while and it is very far from complete.  If the developers don't forget about it(they already made money off it, so they might 'forget' about it if they haven't already) wait until it is fully completed before puchasing it.  At the rate that they've made updates and the progress of these updates, it'll be a few years at the very least before they finish it.  Appreciate it from a distance, at least for now.\n\nUpdate:  I've only begun to touch the winter update and so far it is a much better game then it was before.  It gives a good view of what they've got in mind for the game as a whole but its still something that should've been around much sooner then this.  At least, I'm no longer stuck wondering if they've abandoned the game or not.\n\nUpdate:  There hasn't been much of anything added in any decent amount of time.

This is an alpha release advertised as a beta to increase sales. After months without any updates, and no significant updates at all since release, they're finally overhauling the game by making it more gated and linear than ever. Updates were still promised to be "thick and fast" until a month or two ago.\n\nFans will tell you "It's just in early access!" to excuse the detestable behavior of the developers, which has been to lie. Two of the screenshots on this very store page are from mock-ups; the art assets exist but are unavailable. Notably, the depiction of an underwater Hylotl city simply does not exist, because, almost a year since release, the Hylotl race still does not have any cities or villages. This game really shouldn't be allowed on Steam, since it uses fake screenshots to advertise itself even on the store page. Earlier versions of the website also featured hand-made mock-ups instead of screenshots, to deceive readers into thinking the game was farther along than it really is.\n\nThe procedurally generated enemies are boring to fight and the procedurally generated weapons are boring to find. Features announced as complete on the blog years ago, like the frozen ocean biome and the complex weapon generation system, are nowhere to be found, either having been simply removed during development or outright lied about. A system listed as "50% finished" on the Starbound Roadmap in December 2013 was only just being initially prototyped in September.\n\nThis game is a mess, and the developers are dishonest fools who do their best to censor all dissent.

When originally advertised for its closing in to early access release, the game was "almost done."\n\nHere's what you can do in Starbound currently: explore planets and find out how empty they are, dig up ore to make armor to go to new tiers of planets which are equally empty and dead, fight bosses that only have one attack each or are just generic enemies and are visually totally uninspired, enjoy the quality damage balancing as you're one shot in the highest tier armor by enemies on the final tier of planets, admire the diversity of Pokemon styled enemies that only run at you or jump at you and rarely stop moving entirely to try and shoot something at you.\n\nIf Chucklefish asks to publish your game, tell them no.

I easily played 4 hours a day for a straight week in the single player portion of this game. The game has enormous potential but the developers seem to have cashed in and hit the door running. There used to be a steady stream of updates for the game with more content monthly, but that has completely stopped. This has left me and others I am sure with a game that is boring to play because you have done everything that can be done with the game. I don't see the point of purchasing this game in its current state.\n\nGameplay 7.5/10 - The game runs great and the combat is smooth and easy to master.\n\nEnvironment/Graphics 8.5/10 - The environment is beautiful in this game. The graphics are what you would expect from a 2D game, so there is nothing to say about them really.\n\nLength 5/10 - As I stated before, the developers have essentially given up on the game. The development of the game has basically ceased to exist. They try to make you believe they are honestly working on the next patch by releasing snapshots, similar to snapshots in Minecraft. There are mods, but I was never really motivated to try mods in this game for some reason.\n\nOverall 4/10 - The environment and gameplay is still not enough to give me reason to rate this game higher. The developers silence criticism on their forums and result to bully tactics. Funny enough, they started to post development blogs on the starbound homepage on their website daily to give the impression they are working on this game. Please do not fall for it! Do not buy until the development team actually starts developing more content (good content too!) and stops bullying customers that offer good, honest criticism.","June 24, 2014","false","105.4"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","44","59","0","5"

Even the bosses are easy. Planet temperatures are a useless gimmick since you get the suit for it anyway.

An hour in and you're feeling pretty good about your decision to buy the game, you're feeling like this is a solid experience. A couple hours later, you've explored and seen quite a bit. Maybe you've built yourself a shantytown or a castle. However, you have noticed that the game can sometimes be very plain.\n\nEventually, the idea that the game is rather plain becomes so persuasive that you feel you need to say so or recommend a great idea for new content on the forums. There is only a short time now before you realize why Starbound has so many negative reviews. Enter Chucklefish, the developers of Starbound, some of them came from an optimistic place like Terraria and even more of these devs came from parts unknown. At first we wanted to give Chucklefish our money for Starbound, we even practically threw it at them and told them to shutup and take it. They were more than happy to take our money from us, as any company would probably be.\n\nDays went by, months went by, we're very close to a year now, less than a month at the time of this review. There have been no updates to the game. Oh but wait, there are "nightly builds" which tout daily updates to the game, what you get when you opt into beta nightly builds is a mess that crashes so often that it should be a new meme. There are also Devblogs that advertise things that have already been in the game since it was added to Steam as something new they're adding to nightly builds. That's right, they're pretending old content is new content.\n\nI wanted Starbound to succeed, I pre-ordered it and couldn't wait for all the rewards with pre-order. We were promised a new class and fossils you could dig up, we still don't have the pre-order rewards after all this time. If you go to the official website you may see a different tale, but I assure you that's only because they delete any bit of criticism from the site, no matter how honest it is. The developers of Starbound also have a hallowed history of flaming and insulting customers they disagreed with. Couple all of this with what they're doing now (advertising old things in the game as new) and you're left feeling that Chucklefish is just a gang of con artists.\n\nI'm sorry my review is like this, but it's the truth. You would do well to stay away from this game until the developers in Chucklefish can be mature enough to deliver what they promised with no drama. If they don't deliver what they promised in this game, I will be buying nothing from them in the future. I might even do that anyways to make an example that it's not okay to do the things they did to your customers.","November 16, 2014","false","64.1"," 317 of 522 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","317","522","5","20"

Less than perfect PR and habits of only updating the broken Nightlies branch, I'm finding it hard to reccomend on it's own.\n\nCombat is boring, gameplay can pretty much be summed up with: Start on planet, mine for hours, realize you need pixels, kill monsters, get good armor and weapons, fight boss, go to new planet, realize you're just as weak as you were at the beginning, rinse and repeat.\n\nWeapons don't feel different unless you get a legendary, and even those are often just retextured versions of another. One legendary shoots bubbles when swung, another shoots poison. The only reason I have so much time on this game is because I'm a massochist and I tried to soak everything I could out of the game.

I don't mean in any way to insult the developers of this game, this review will only state my honest opinion about that game at  it's current state\n\nNow thats out of the way it's time to begin.\n\nThis next part is kind of first experice and first thoughts, skip it if you want to get to my opinion as of now\n\nSo, starbound, an early access game that I thought of as being "Terraria in space." I had played terraria a lot with friends before buying this game and loved terraria, so I assumed that this would be the next terraria. A friend of mine had bought the game and I had watched him play it a bit, everything looked awesome, from the tools he had to the things he did, I was convinced. I bought this game at its full price at the time, which was 15 dollars and started to install and play. The gameplay seemed odd and clunky and unfinished, but i convinced myself it was fine and played on with my friends. I then put the game down for probably 4 months. I finally started playing again around may.\n\nOk now on to my opinion now\n\nI came back to the game thinking it would be completely different in terms of new content, being away from and still growing game for 4 month you would expect that. I found the game nearly identical to how it last was, it felt odd and unfinished. Me and another friend had the same feeling towards the game and compared it to terraria. Now terraria has a fun, not very complicated feel to it, you can get into the game in minutes. Now starbound on the other hand I had a hard time getting used to, I knew about the game and how to play, just playing it wasn't enjoyable.\n\nI'm not sure how to explain it but it just was not fun to play at its current state, it was odd, seemingly unfinished and just overall weird. Because of that I can not recommend this game at its current state.\n\nEdit: So I wanna add some things that I forgot. This game has some potential, If we get updates more and with more content this game could live up to its "Terraria in space" image. I think this game could be salvaged but I feel due to the amount of negetive reviews, they have lost most of their current player base, unless it is slavaged, they lost me as well.","July 5, 2014","false","12.4"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

Remember the days when we all purchased games that were released buggy, broken, and incomplete? Most of us complained. Some of us played the games anyways. Very few of us were not disappointed by the garbage we purchased.\n\nThis game cured me of purchasing early access promises forever.\n\nWhile the game is playable and fun for a while, you really do get the feeling its over ambitious and will never be what you hoped for. I got my money out of it, but the disappointing updates tarnished that mild entertainment.\n\nIts a fanboy title, and don't let their message boards suck you in.\n\nBuy something complete and be warned very few developers of this stuff will give you quality titles like Terraria, SPAZ, and Dungeons of Dredmor.\n\n***  "Winter Update"  addendum ***\n\nMore stuff, fixes, but still bland. Read on.\n\nFirst I want to say I really want to like this game, but honestly, I can no longer stand the poor design choices and the incompetence of the people behind this company. They also like to delete posts created by people with legitiment complaints.\n\nThe patch didn't change the core problem with this game. It has a incredibly large star map that does nothing to add to the gameplay. There is so little incentive to explore this massive universe, because each system has very little to offer. You seen one desert planet, you have seen them all. None of them feel unique. They are only different at a glance.\n\nThe progression is also borked beyond all recognition. Progression is only artificial. Its just another color of ore to make a slight variant on the armor you just had. The weapons end up being the same, just diferent colors and graphics.\n\nGameplay consists of landing on a planet, digging for the next ore, and then going to the next planet. Thats it. There are some minor adjustments to your equipment. For example, a tech that allows you to breathe on a planet without an atmosphere. Exciting as this all may sound, the "yippee factor" then dies off when you meet the next form of alien life that is pretty much the same as the last boring group of aliens you shot on the previous world.\n\nThe inexplicable change to the star map baffles me on why this change was implimented. Sure, you want progression. But now, it made each star system bland. Why? Because there are few planet types in each system now. Why someone thought this was a wonderful idea seriously should question his own ability to make good decisions when it comes to game design.\n\nYou can now have a "Frozen" star with eight "Frozen" planets in the system. There is also "Eccentric" stars, which is a new one on me that makes little sense. "Radioactive" stars are now present, which, well, is what stars are. Almost forgot the "Firey" star type. Gee. Imagine that...a star that is on fire. Did it really take a whole year to come up with these names and overall silly idea?\n\nThe new food system is also a joke. Its got a ton of recipes, but they are all the same. This is the central theme to Starbound. That theme is "mindless variety of tiny variations." The buffs the food gives you are minor, and they don't last long. What makes it worse is that you can't even eat more food to replace the short buff because of a poorly implemented timer.\n\nI could go on and on about how poor and disappointing this title is for as long is it would take to discover every unremarkable planet in this botched attempt to create a universe.\n\nThe "Winter Update" is just a mish mash of stuff thrown together in an attempt to possibly bring in more unearned income. Believe what you want, but this game is lacking quality design people.\n\nI will add on this this review when the next update comes along, which will probably be next winter.","October 30, 2014","false","114.9"," 298 of 491 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","298","491","0","1"

Because you're honestly better off grinding for them.

On top of that, at a certain point the game stops giving you objectives, and simply throws you out into the worlds with nothing but some simple weapons and a handful of resources. While I don't want to be babysat through the entire game, I was barely able to begin to understand how everything worked before I was put completely on my own. It took internet research to discover that the next boss was acquired through the robotic crafting table, which previously was just some thing that I saw in the menus.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend the game like it is. Should Chucklefish make the new-player experience much better, I may consider jumping in. While I say this, I was never able to play this game with friends, even with simple instructions on how to set up a 'server' for the game. It simply never worked.

I don't think it will improve- wait until final release or until it goes on sale if you decide to buy it at all.\n\nIt was a tough choice for me to mark Starbound as not recommended because I used to really enjoy this game. However now, taking a step back, some recent changes and underlying flaws have taken that enjoyment out of it.\n\n1. My biggest issue: repetition. I was initially attracted to this game because of the exploration factor, but it doesn't take long before you see the same thing over and over, and the recent changes to the game have only made this worse. Each planet is almost a carbon copy of others of its type, down to the of monsters that spawn there. The dungeons and towns become tedious after encountering them time and time again. The unique charm of exploring different planets' surfaces is almost entirely gone. The over-abundance of microdungeons and rare items has made the feel of the game shift from exploring to grinding for loot. Even the dungeons themselves and the loot within eventually becomes mundane and useless (Oh boy, a new cool weapon! Just like the other ten thousand I found and won't ever need!).\n\n2. Further, the progression feels wrong. NPCs give quests that guide you through the different tiers of armor- but it winds up boiling down to finding some ore, making some armor so you can beat a boss, so that you can find different ore to make more armor so that you can beat another uninteresting boss... rinse and repeat. That's essentially the only progression system, which ends up feels very grind-y. Overall, the old boss system felt much more rewarding. (There is some progression to be had in upgrading the size of your ship, but this provides little to no real challenge at all other than more grinding planets.)\n\n3. Kind of goes along with the lack of the progression, but the game lacks any real point or purpose. Okay, so it's a sandbox game, maybe it can get away with no real substance, right? Not really, as exploring gets old fast and the sandbox aspect withers up fast.\nThere are, of course, more issues (why was damage-on-touch added??) with this game, but these two stood out the most to me.\n\n\nNow, there are still plently of good things that made the game enjoyable. There are neat little easter eggs and plenty of cool things to find. I've enjoyed it for long enough to feel as though I've gotten my money's worth, but lately Starbound seems to have taken a turn for the worse. This game has been in early access for years (wasn't it supposed to come out in 2012 or something?) and somehow it doesn't feel much closer to a finished game. Overall, Starbound feels like a very poorly developed game- it could have been great but something went wrong along the way.\n\nGranted, this is still an early access game (which it has been for years since I bought the game...) so these things *could* be subject to change. However I don't think they will, and the game has lost some of its fun. If you are going to get this game I would strongly encourage you to wait until it is out of early access, although that may take a few more years at this rate :/  or wait until it goes on sale.","April 2","false","155.8"," 161 of 259 people (62%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","62","161","259","10","8"

Don`t buy into this yet, possibly at all. Development has been downright glacial and halting. The game itself is, contrary to what is claimed, not in a Beta state. It`s not even in an Alpha state. It`s, and this comes straight from the project heads mouth, a tech demo.\n\nThe actual gameplay, what is in place at the time of this review anyway, is shallow. So very shallow.

I played a good chunk of it and it was fun. I want to like this game so much. I am incredibly upset that I have to recommend against buying it. I don't want to dislike it, and I suppose I don't; What I dislike is the idea that the game is dead in the water and looks like its going to be that way for... Well... Forever.\n\nI got this game before it even came to steam. I bought the four pack straight from Chucklefish's main site. Played around in it, did all there was to do- I even have some hilarious screenshots of bugs that were fixed very early on. It was fun but eventually doing the same basic things over and over got very boring. The progression was basically broken past tier 2 (and there are 10 tiers) and if you wanted to make a nice base you had to luck out and find the right building materials on some planet. Which is fine, it was an alpha, I accepted it.\n\nFast forward to now. Almost nothing has changed. There is a little bit of tweaking here, some touch-ups there, but nowhere NEAR the amount of progress you'd expect from this amount of time. So I went back to their website and a wave of dread washed over me as I saw what I knew was the death knell of this game:\n\nSeveral of the key developers advertising their personal pet project.\n\nI heavily suspect they are using Starbound as a financial springboard for these projects. There is literally no other reason to do them besides ignorance. A studio as small as chucklefish can't AFFORD side projects like that, because all they do is take away from their primary project. Either they know this, and we're all being swindled so they can fund their pet projects (which, by the way, will likely be DOA, if not DNF, as most one-man projects turn out to be) or they do not realize this and they need to get their act together and put their personal projects on hold until Starbound is ready for release.\n\nI am upset that I have to give this game a no-go. I wanted it to turn out good so much. The concept is here but the staff keeps side-tracking and delaying so they can work on petty dead-end distractions.","November 4, 2014","false","147.2"," 198 of 323 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","198","323","2","0"

The animation is smooth, the lighting engine is GODLY.\nThe problem is that Starbound is shallow and empty. Combat is awkward, the UI clumsy.\nFor all its worth, Starbound feels like it was made by graphics designers. There's randomly 'made' moster sprites, lots of weapons and tilesets, but none of it does anything special. Starbound is COD. A looker, but it leaves you empty.\n\nIf you want a deep, amazing adventure with excitement and action, play Terraria, or try Crea. Crea's also in Early Access, but the polar opposite of Starbound. It looks a lot less (but still pretty great) but has a lot more mechanical depth in it.\n\nEDIT:\nLet me add something else. Starbound doesn't change over time. Terraria gave you potions and weird weapons, but Starbound keeps being obsessed with mining and crafting. Crafting, however, is clumsy, and mining very boring (other than the pretty tileset).\nThe worst part is that, despite its focus on cool monsters, being underground makes the floaty movement choke on itself. And unless you're hunting for dungeons, there's no reason to be surface-side.\nStarbound is a sightseeing tour (like I mentioned with COD). Once you've seen the sights, you lose a lot of luster.

Yes a review that has been about 3 months in the making now. Ok, let me start off by saying this game does in fact have a lot of potential. The graphics are really good in my opinion. The building and crafting is fun. The exploration and space travel is a good touch, and the over all feel of the game is great. The problem with all the really good stuff is there are a few things about this game that are currently ruining all the great things it could be.\n\nI’ll start out with the playability of the game. The game engine itself is system intense. So much so that even with the game settings set to low the game has a tendency to bog down, or freeze. Yes, this could be my system, so I’m not that upset about it. The problem is with the second and most game-breaking problem with this game. 5 months with no patching, no progress, and no updates as to what or were this game is going.\n\nAn embarrassing amount of Nothing, I’m not just talking about content patches. I’m talking about anything that is bugged in the game. It’s as if this game has been tossed aside by the game company because it has already made its money. Worst thing is I sense a quick to finished product coming for this game. I’m not talking one that will have all the bells and whistles. I’m talking a game that will be released as done just the way it is currently. No switch character option, no delete character option, no achievements, no performance patches. Because it will be the convenient way of handling things for the company if they’re burned out on make the game, and have already made their money off of it.\n\nTruly I want them to prove me wrong. I want some content patches that will fix the bugs that pop up every so often in the game. I want the glitches fixed, and the needed menu options added. In short I want them to show that they’re working on this game. Months, and months, and months of nothing from them to the point of it being a blemish on their company.\n\nSo please Chuckle Fish if you read this review I would beg you to rectify this situation by (yes I’m yelling) DO SOMETHING. I may change this review if anything worth calling a patch is done, but for now I would recommend people thinking about playing this game to stay clear.

I hear you cry, "It's a sandbox game about space exploration!".\n\nNo. It's a linear game in a sandbox. They give you a huge world to explore, and very little to see. Some chests with free weapons (and it's almost always a case of it being a better-or-worse yes-or-no take-or-not absolute), villages where people spout repeated lines and give you stuff for pixels, random encounters where you kill people or people kill you with little to no variation or outcome.\n\nTo progress, you have to beat the bosses. This requires upgraded armour and weapons, or you're stuck in a hole firing a terrible bow in the most tedious hour long battle ever... This gear in turn requires a lot of mining. Obviously you mine for better minerals, and make better mining gear too.\n\nYou explore for free stuff, you mine for minerals to upgrade, you beat a boss, you do that 4 times, and then you upgrade a further 5 or so times without beating bosses, just so you can survive. Exploring serves as a nice break from the endless grind, until you know all the encounters, facilities, and villages and can see how meaningless and stale they are. All the planets are kind of the same.\n\nSure, different monsters, different colours, different gravity, different weather... but a forest planet is a forest. The trees might have eyes, or they might look like candyfloss, but they function exactly the same. A desert is a desert. A tundra is just an endless expanse of depressing snow. You want some variety, you have to up and move. Not only that, the starmap interface is horrible, and there's no way of remembering where you were save writing coordinates down somewhere manually, which means that you're stuck with 2 places; your current planet and you home. If you accidentally fly away from somewhere forgetting you didn't have home set well... say bye-bye to your house.\n\nSo, that's the exploration and progression side of it.\n\nWhat about the building and the decoration? Well a lot of the stuff isn't available to build. You have to "steal" it from places (read: dig up the lifeless sites) and scan it to get the recipe or, more often, the ability to pixel print. So in order to make what seems to be 90% of the building materials, you do not in fact craft them with raw materials, but instead refine all your raw materials to magic pixels and then use them to print out everything. Want to make some steel furniture but have no steel? No worries, refined copper will do! Yay for the I-Win Pixel Printer! (In case you missed my cynicism here, I see the pixel printer as nothing more than a device to reduce the number of interesting recipes needed in the game and make it easier and simpler...) Not only that, pixel compression loses you slightly over 30% of the pixels... but dying does too. So there's no reason to not compress all your pixels away and store them for when you want to do mass printing sprees!\n\nI understand it's Beta, but I'm concerned regardless. It all seems to be a show for the player. You're the focus of the entire universe. At this stage, it's a linear RPG where progression is enforced by starmap upgrades and later your gear choice. You have to get better to progress, and you have to progress to explore more interesting places and get more recipes. Pixels are a universe XP-like currency for limiting your upgrades if you haven't killed or mined enough. The entire design philosphy is centric around giving the player this final goal to get to (Impervium gear) and eventually, when you're there... there's not really anything to do. It's lost the sandbox, because you've been told to progress all along.\n\nToo many games of the last half a decade or so have been centric on surrounding the player and telling them to keep pushing forwards. My suspicion is that it's because if you keep pushing forwards through the forced progression, and then reach the end and treat it as "done"... then you don't really notice how little of a game there was.\n\nSo much potential. We'll see how this one rolls and I'll update as appropriate.\n\nA rating? I dunno. Probably a retrospective 4-to-6/10.\n\n-- Edit from 10th Feb 2014 --\n\nWith the recent(ish) news of director mode, along with a total rehaul of the sector system/bosses on the eventual horizon, my interest in Starbound is beginning to build once more. It seems they wished to showcase the base features and engine, and the final game will in fact be structured very differently, which is what I was waiting to see. Pre-emptive review is probably out of the question, but once it's released I'll update once again.","January 1, 2014","false","74.9"," 954 of 1,616 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","954","1","0","62"

In a lot of ways this game is MUCH better than Terraria, but in a lot of ways it is MUCH worse.\n\nPros:\nConceptually nice graphical detail/graphic setting.\nGraphics and music really immerse you into that planet that you're on\nLots of content already to craft and find\nStructures are pretty nice on the planets, but do get repetitive after a while.\nAnimations are great for the quality of everything else.\nMusic is nice and immersive\n\nCons:\nPainfully repetitive combat. The monsters are essentially the same on every planet, if not the same on two, the next will have identicle monsters. Combat is drastically haulted by the fact that every single monster jumps 45 feet into the air constantly.\n\nDepth lacking crafting system that hand-holds you through everything, and takes every bit of the fun out of crafting things. Take a note from minecraft and please revitalyze your crafting engine. It's basically "Find this, find that, push this button" where it could be "Find all this stuff and see what you can make by trial and error!" The second system would be much more rewarding survival/immersion-wise.\n\nContent lacking in comparison to terraria/any game like this. It's just the generic "iron Shortsword" or "Silver pickaxe" type content. The best thing about terraria was that you could always find something different, unique, and just plain awesome at almost any point in the game. Starbound really needs special tools/weapons/items to differentiate from every single other crafting game in existance\n\n\n\n\nThere's no meaning to this game, no goals, no objectives, no epic loot to look forward to, no new mystifying planets that widely differentiate from the last to look forward to exploring, just a basic point and click crafter. I still really enjoy this game, and see that it has immense potential, but it needs a lot of work to ever match up with terraria or any crafter in the genre.","June 19, 2014","false","10.5"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","1"

We need something more complicated to craft..\n\nAlso adding maybe enemy waves that attack your base at some points and build more on that concept..\nEnemies seem a bit dull.. Combat gets too repetitive etc..\n\nMake it more important to have a main base, maybe have some setups that can give you abilities or something from your main base if you keep them powered..\nMake farming better, maybe animal herding etc (alien crossbreeding things like that :) )\nMaybe make it so you can have production facilities on some planets, that would be nice..\nI really hope they make this game more interesting..\n\nAll in all it's an ok game, but it promised to be a very fun game with elements of games like minecraft, terraria etc..but improved and made more interesting, but at the end it's a nice looking (visually) and kinda boring game with little innovation..\n\nMy view might change if they give us a nice big interesting update..\n\nEDIT: I have played this game for many hours because some of my friends bought it so it was more fun playing together.. also we added many mods that improve gameplay, add missions, quests, items etc.. but if we are talking about vanilla (unmodded version) then the text I wrote is still a very honest opinion..

I think they used the money aquired for Starbound to pay additional salaries, bonuses or whatever to their employees and team to make other smaller games..

Since that point this game has stalled out, and random exploration is only so rewarding when the worlds lack character. Terraria managed to keep things feeling fresh even after hundreds of hours of playtime, but after spending a dozen hours hopping from planet to planet it feels like the game is really lacking in content. Pass on this one for now\n\nUpdate: Nearly a full year later they finally update the game as promised, not the daily updates they promised mind you, but a significant update none the less. Unfortunaly it still feels devoid of soul, which i personally blame on the randomly generated enemies and lack of variety per world, as in, each individual world dosent have more then 5 or 6 different species, and almost all of them just drop meat. exploration per planet is pretty bland too, sure there a few temples, labs and the like, but most of the worlds just seem empty. Caves are uninteresting, the core of the planets are devoid of anything but some special ores and most planet surfaces are just one or two rather uninspired biomes. Sure there are funky trees and lots of species specific furniture to collect, but it just dosent connect with me for some reason. Combat is the worst, as it feels like there is really only a couple variations in creature abilities, and none of them particularly interesting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/replekia/recommended/211820/","replekia","Mimi Houllier von Schwarzlang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/replekia/","213 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo many things wrong with this and I don't even mean the actual game.\n\n- No actual updates to a game that is effectively in alpha and should see changes to its core frequently considering in how rough of a state even the engine is\n- The so-called "Nightlies", unstable versions of the most current code made available every evening, are either viewed as updates or not, depending on what is more convenient for the person that is talking to the community\n- Developers stated multiple times that anything currently in is just a placeholder when it was first released as an early acces game, yet none of the promised features have even been talked about again since then\n- Merely having the launcher (which serves no actual purpose) open counts as "playing" the game, thus resulting in plenty of inflated game times (I have not even spent half of the time Steam says I've spent on this game actually ingame and at least half of the actual time spent was me testing simple item modifications)\n- Moderators on the official forums, Reddit and Steam have engage multiple times in censoring of criticism, both regarding the behavior of developers and community managers towards the community as well as the current state of the game and the direction it is heading (if it even is going anywhere at this point)\n- Quite a lot of money was spent on trying to relocate everyone to a new office in London, which would be a good thing if it was even remotely required to have all your employees in the same location for a completely digital product. This move came with a multitude of problems, as not only was important equipment stuck on a ship(!) in the middle of the ocean for quite some time, but also the only seemingly competent coder on the team was stuck in visa limbo for an extended period\n\nThese are just some of the problems surrounding the game, not even the game itself.\nNow the actual game... the only positive thing is that it is relatively bug-free in its current state. Mostly there's nothing that could have any bugs, as in, there is no content. If you are looking at this and thinking it will be Terraria in space, you're mistaken. There are currently three bosses, which are all heavily tiered and either impossible to beat if you don't have the appropriate gear and total pushovers if you do. Beating one rewards you with an item required to unlock the next tier of space, which you are forced to go to if you want to get anything new. And yes, it includes mining up tons of ores for every single tier.\nThe "space" aspect, as in moving from planet to planet, discourages building permanent structures on planets, since you will be moving from one planet to another constantly. Since there is nothing on lower-tier planets that you can't also find on higher-tier ones, there's no reason to go back to them either. Even less so when you consider that you also don't need any of the previous resources for later items and blocks.\nMoving from tier to tier also plays out exactly the same every single time. You arrive at a new planet, beam down and probably get almost oneshot by the first enemy you encounter, as whatever armor you have from the last tier will provide effectively no damage reduction from your new foes. These enemies meanwhile take barely any damage from your old weapons. Thus you hole up and dig down, hoping to find enough of this tier's new ores to make new weapons and armor, at which point you will be god again. You kill the new boss, get the item required to move to the next tier, then return to my first sentence.\nThis progression is supposedly going to be split up into three paths, which are essentially the usual tank/melee, ranged and mage archetypes, as seen in Terraria. However, this is not in the game yet and was last mentioned a couple months ago[playstarbound.com].\nIn fact the current development focus seems to be entirely on two things: terrain generation, which is the only thing that has been brought up multiple times in recent news posts, and decorative and vanity items. Both things that most definitely should be on the backburner at this point, as there is an already functional terrain generation, but barely any actual interesting content, be it progression-related items that would offer some choice instead of a forced path, well designed enemies and especially competent enemy AI, or a quest system that is more than just a glorified tutorial.\n\nThe only thing Starbound currently has over its content-heavy predecessor Terraria is modability. Materials, blocks, weapons, enemies, biomes, effectively everything you see can be changed by you with minimal artistic effort and a basic understanding of LUA. However, this is also where it ends. A lot of core structures that would be interesting to mess with are hardcoded, like an enemy's body composition, world interactions, status effect hooks and, mind-boggingly enough, inventory access. This reflects in just what kind of mods are currently classified as containing new "mechanics": Minecraft-style tech mods, which deal with a basic power system and ore-processing machinery, as well as some defensive mechanisms. One of the few mods that managed to create something unique with some mind-bending codework, considering the limitations, added "Bioshock Infinite"-style skyrails within the first month of the game's initial opening to the public - which were added as "official content" and the only new content in one of the few updates following that mod's release. Take that however you will.\n\nAll in all Starbound is at best a promising proof-of-concept, if trying to copy a Metroidvania with building can be called that. It has potential which I firmly believe Chucklefish is not capable of realizing, considering they have failed to even manage a community without banning voices that were offering valid criticism.

Cool. The problem with Starbound as compared to Terraria is that Terraria, while grounded in a single randomly generated environment, has refined the mechanics of exploring, looting, and conquering that environment to a "T". There's actual variety in the mechanics of different enemies, bosses, weapons, and fun loot like the jet/Icarus/lava-wading boots. Starbound has a fairly impressive universe generation system at its core, hampered by a much less reliably explorable cave generation system, ♥♥♥♥-all in the way of loot, hordes of enemies that look different but act identically (including the bosses), much more awkward and gated systems at work for allowing you to upgrade your gear, and no real differences between most of the weapons besides watching numbers go up as you advance.\n\nBasically Terraria is to The Sims as Starbound is to Spore. Presently. They're still working on it, but I'm going to give it a looong rest before trying to come back.","July 16, 2014","false","85.6"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","34","44","0","0"

Honestly, this part of the game feels like a fan-made mod that's been incorporated into the game. Touted as the biggest new feature, it's pretty underwhelming.\n\nAnother new problem seems to be the developers making the bosses much easier than in the last build. Perhaps this is to account for the younger demographic who want to reach the top tier of ores within the first couple of hours.\n\nIt took me 2.5 hours to reach Fiery tier of stars what with the now abundant ores at a shallower depth than previous builds, plus the completely nerfed boss fights,\n\nCombine the resistance-free flow onward to the end game with the poor optimization and you've got a game that's screaming out "I'm very Early Access" from every orifice. If you like that sort of thing, go for it.

The planets are random, the creatures are random, the weapons are random, the loot dispersement is random (dependent on danger level of the planet the loot is found on).\n\nIt sounds like a lot of fun until you take into account that the endgame currently consists of "start crafting from [Ore A] so you can build [Metal Upgrade A] so you can start crafting from [Ore B] do you can build [Metal Upgrade B] so you can start crafting from [Ore C] so you can build..."\n\nOnce you get past the game's 4 ridiculously-flawed bosses, literally the entire rest of the game (roughly half) is going to a planet whose danger level is 1 higher than the previous planet, crafting enough of a certain bar to build the next upgrade, and then going to the next planet whose danger level is 1 higher than the previous planet. I found myself just sticking with Durasteel Armor up until I had a full Impervium set, because prior to that, it was just mining just below the surface and casing myself off from threats.\n\nThe combat consists of "do you have the level-appropriate armor? No? One-hit kill. Yes? Combat is identical to the previous tier."\n\nI bought this game thinking it would feel like Terraria, but the combat is incredibly loose, enemies are completely lackluster, and the sporadic temples/towns/labs don't really make up for the fact that the planets are lacking entirely in both diversity, and content.\n\nI hope I can recommend this in the future, but as for now, it's worth waiting for some major content additions.","October 29, 2014","false","74.2"," 110 of 175 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","110","175","0","0"

Before that I was patiently waiting for it, keeping myself busy with Minecraft and Terraria. Games like these aren't for everyone, and I know there's been a war with the fans of these games claiming that they're knockoffs of eachother. Honestly, I don't really think that's fair. That's pretty much declaring all games of a certain genre to be knockoffs of one another. Starbound's got a lot of things that other sandbox's don't have, but it's also got a lot of things that they do have. Basically, Starbound plays like Terraria; a side-scrolling/do whatever you want type of game. It has RPG elements, crafting, etc. It has a pretty solid OST, but in my opinion it doesn't really feel Sci-fi. The sprites are gorgeous. The environments are gorgeous. And the creatures.... The creatures range anywhere from downright disgusting in appearance to cute as a button. The kicker is that the cute ones are often the nastiest, and will attack you relentlessly. I've not found two planets that were exactly the same. I'm the type of gamer that rotates from game to game out of boredom, but there are some games that are very special to me that I consistently play. Starbound is among them. I only recommend this game to gamers who have played Terraria or Minecraft and have an open mind. The updates can be a bit sluggish at times, but the changes I've seen have been glorious. And please for the love of Talos, opt into the nightly builds before you claim no changes have been made. Right click on the game, go to properties and from there it's pretty much self-explanatory.

They update content constantly and try as hard as possible to inform people of how they went about adding the new content. If you were to put all their posts together it could be the best dev diary of a game yet.\n\n:::::Updates and Building:::::\n\nThe way you build in this game is very intuitive and easy to understand. The amount of content for a beta so far is very large from what I seen in-game and on their website when I was following along their posts.\n\n:::::Difference from Terraria:::::\n\nWhat I think sets this game apart from Terraria is the sheer amount of locations you are able to go to each with their own unique feel. So if you want to go to a desert planet or one inhibited by aliens you are free to do so and quite easily at that. Each planet in a sense has its own atmosphere as a result of different soundtracks and unique landscapes and items bound to them. This gives a player a greater sense of exploration on a wider scale seeing as how they will want to travel from planet to planet to see what kind of resources they can gather and use to create various different things!\n\n:::::Races:::::\n\nEvery race has their own planet. Being able to beam to other players ships really encourages multiplayer seeing as how its a fun way to see what other races have constructed on their own unique planets.\n\n:::::Conclusion:::::\n\nIf your looking for something like Terraria but on a much greater scale with NPCs, quests, and a hunger for exploration you should look no further than Starbound.\n\nWarning: Some people are referring to this game as Deathbound due to difficulty.","December 4, 2013","true","62.5"," 126 of 203 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","126","203","0","4"

I think everyone did, and that is this game's biggest flaw. I wouldn't usually pin "overhyping" an indie game as the developer's fault, but boy did they make promises; and boy did we swallowed them all.\n\nHowever, development and forum's drama aside (there's quite plenty of it, for the gossip-fond people), I still wouldn't consider this game fun or challenging.\n\nThe good The art direction: this game, if anything, is gorgeous eye-candy. I love the environments, the different races and their associated furniture and the building decoration; certainly the better aspects of the game.\nThe farming and building: So relaxing. I could have just a game made out of building a farm from the ground up if it was anywhere near to Starbound's system. The farming might not be the most complex task and might not have a lot of variety to it, but I think that's where it's charm resides.\nThe exploration: all the different buildings scattered around the planets are wonderful, and give you a nice sense of adventure whenever you break into a lab building or enter the depths of a pyramid. The badThe exploration, 1 hour later: After exploring for a while a few planets, you start to realize something. There's a certain pattern to what are you going to find in the world. Big structure or a city to the left, scattered people to the right, and the planet loops around (which would be in a different situation kinda neat). After visiting once an Apex's city, you already saw everything there is to them. The next one you find is going to have some "randomization" throw in, say adding a building or making it longer, but the cookie cutter feel is there.\nThe AI, both NPC and enemies: from a wide range of idiotic to non-existant, the AI leaves a lot to be desired. The citizens in the cities you find have the charm, wits and usefulness of a paperweight, and the same is to be said of the enemies AND BOSSES. I really couldn't care about killing enemies in this game when you can easily outrun them, or just leave them trapped in dirt. The only reason you kill stuff is because the progression requires grinding, which brings me to...\nThe "progression": kill mine kill > craft or buy stuff to go new place > repeat. There's not point to the currency in Starbound (pixels) when you can just kill everything and everyone to get new stuff. And getting to a new place/solar system/galaxy/sector just means the enemies absorb more bullets. Not a smarter AI, not a more challenging task, not even better finds: just a longer health bar for enemies. Hoo-♥♥♥♥ing-ray, I guess; that's what I've always wanted.\nThe combat system: you click on things until they die. If you are using melee you need to get closer first, but that pretty much sums up all the combat.\nWe are Terraria, except we are not: What's the point of having mining in this game? There's nothing to be found down there (nothing interesting at least), it's just another part of the elaborated grindfest that composes Starbound. The uglyThere's a lot of drama and finger-pointing in the community, but im not going to dwell into that or the Starbound mods might censore me. Wink wink nod nod.\nThere hasn't been any updates for FIVE months. Why is it even in early access?\n\nHOLY ♥♥♥♥ TEXT WALL Long story short: just buy Terraria. It might not look as beautiful as this game, but gameplay-wise Starbound is a dumbed down Terraria.","September 23, 2014","false","80.4"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","32","42","0","0"

I bought this game the second the beta was released, I had followed it's dev process prior to that for about half a year. It's now been out on beta for approximately half a year, and almost NOTHING has changed. There has been such a long list of promises by the devs, and there have been 0 deliveries. Just daily updates on their website listing what they did that day (Even though it is never implemented into the stable game). On the day I am writing this they added "big flying creatures". They promised 3 phases of beta, its been half a year of phase 1, at this rate the game will NEVER see full release, seeing as phase 1 has no end in sight. Chucklefish currently has been given 4 million USD to get this game made, and right now it looks like they just are keeping the money and working on their game at turtle pace with no apologies, or reason for why their progress has been insanely slow. I could write this review for HOURS listing every pointless update on their website and how little they did with their work day according to the update, but that would be a longer novel than every George RR Martin novel combined.\nBasically Chucklefish is a scam company. They've used their 4 million USD to publish indie titles for more motivated developers so they can sap their profits. They aren't even updating their own game, and I'm waiting for it to just disappear and their company to be rebranded as only a publisher. It's pitiful that Redigit of Terraria could accomplish more in a single day than these clowns can in a week.\nTL;DR\nBuy Terraria and avoid this game. It's a long list of broken and unheeded promises made by a company that does nothing all day except use their insane amount of cash from fanboys to play video games and screw around instead of working on their game.","July 13, 2014","false","245.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

It has been all but abandoned. I followed this game for years, even before they had a working forum. It has been a total let down and i dont think it will be finished in the next two years. The devs got to exited by all the money they raked in for early access. Some of them moved to a new country and they spent 6 months opening an office.\n\nThe entire time we hear "OMG guys we are so sorry, moving and opening an office is hard work!!". The entire time no progress is made on the game, yet they continue to publish other games and rake in money for that.\n\nAs for the game iteself... Its buggy, unfinished and very linear for a "sandbox" game. Like i said earlier its at least two years out for a finished game to come out of this mess. The only additions to the game are from modders. Any good mod is quickly picked up by the leaching devs and put in the game. So instead of doing any actual work they let modders do it for them. I love Steam, LOVE IT! But this early access game crap should not be allowed unless the dev has a release date planned already.\n\nEarly release is an easy out for companys for many reasons...\n\n1. They get money now.\n\n2. They can play the "it's only a beta" When it fails horribly.\n\n3. They can take as long as they want to work on it now because they are paid.\n\n4. You test the game for them AND YOU ARE PAYING FOR IT.\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nIn the mean time Terraria has blown full steam forward and is so much more awesome now.

My thoughts at first were "man is this game ever going to be done?" but as I've been playing and checking on the development progress they have quickly shifted to "man this game is almost done, and has nearly nothing to show for it."\n\nLet me explain. This game has had the early access tag for about two and a half years now, which by itself is not a bad thing. The developers have had time to work on the game and really turn it into something special. A lot of care exists for the lore of starbound, the different races are interesting, and they have unique styles that help them stand apart from eachother. But for all the love that went into the construction of this universe, it's a very, very boring place.\n\nThis is in part due to the gameplay. Starbound boils down to a very tedious formula. Go down to a planet, mine some of the ore there, make armor and gear, and then fight the next boss. After fighting said boss you get the ability to travel to new star systems with new planet types. On these completely new planet types the goal is exactly the same, dig down, mine ore, make equipment, fight the next boss. Side quests help flesh out the gameplay, but they are all fetch quests of some sort. At least from what I've seen all these quests do is force players to scour the surfaces of various planets until they find the preset item requested of them. There is no fun in it, and it offers minimal rewards after the first playthrough. Simply put, Starbound is not a fun game to replay. There are nearly no incentives for a second playthrough. The gear for the different races, while visually unique, functions exactly as every other race's gear does.\n\nProcedurally generated games thrive off of replayability, but Starbound just doesn't have it. Exploring planets is interesting at first, but it quickly becomes lackluster. Vehicles and techs that allow the player to traverse planets faster help to ease the boredom of exploration, but there's still little fun in it. Some planet types (oceans and moons, I'm looking at you) wouldn't be worth visiting at all if players weren't forced to do so.\n\nGoing on a bit of a tangent here, but my framerate in this game is miserable. This is a more recent problem, but Starbound currently has abysmal optimization issues. I really don't know why this game runs so poorly for me, but it's wholly unacceptable and I hope that the release of the 1.0 version resolves that problem. In its current state, Starbound is more likely to give me a headache than an enjoyable experience because my framerate is so erratic. I find myself not wanting to build any sort of base because of how quickly the poor optimization catches up to me.\n\nSo, all in all I can't recommend Starbound. It feels like it's made little to no meaningful progress in the last year, and it frustrates me to no end trying to play it. I'm sad to say it too, because I loved this game to death when I first purchased it back in November of 2013.\n\nNote: My playtime in this game is inaccurately represented because of how it runs, steam counts the launcher as a game and I've left it open for long periods of time before. My actual time spent playing is probably less than one-third of what steam says.","May 22","false","549.9"," 53 of 80 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","53","80","0","4"

It's still a good game in my opinion, but it has fallen aways from where it came.  It's still fun to an extent and I hope that Chucklefish stops driving the game in the direction it's going.  Taking out hunger/cold completely, damage on contact, common monsters, and some other things are what really put the game down for me.  I still recommend it to anybody looking for an interesting sidescroller/building game, but it's not nearly as good as it used to be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lummeck/recommended/211820/","lummeck","John Lummeck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lummeck/","22 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIn Starbound, you perform pointless fetch quests in a bland and uninteresting sci-fi universe. Earth has been destroyed  by a monster out of a Japanese porno (did you know the tentacle thing comes from a ban on showing p*nises onscreen? True story), but it's a sign of something greater to come.\n\nTo start with, the game is not inherently bad. Oh no, you see, there's just a few things here and there. It's got a really great weapon generation system and it's easily moddable, has no character limit on the chat (I know this because on one roleplay server a pair of lesbian Novakids sent twenty-minute long textwalls of ERP into the public chat), and a nice big universe. This means it's very good for roleplay, if you play on a server that creates its own lore, but as you'll find out, it's not much fun as a game. There's some nice features, such as your character making funny faces as you chat, and the ability to click on stuff and have your character snark at it.\n\nThe first major flaw is that the lore is quite poorly thought out (this is why most roleplay servers write their own version). The Novakids, while at first interesting, lack faces and this is a bad decision because you lose out on things like facial expressions. They're really weird to play as. Secondly, the Apex, who are a mildly interesting Orwellian society destroyed by one major flaw: they are monkeys. This makes it hard to take them seriously once you imagine what a government meeting might go like. Picture it - Apex screaming their arguments across an intimidating parliament chamber adorned with pillars and banners, the debate raging until they begin flinging poo at each other.\n\nFlorans are a race of savage tribal plant people who were somehow able to miraculously reverse engineer a crashed Apex spaceship, despite having no prior experience with technology much more advanced than a slingshot. The lore mostly appeals to little kids because of these flaws, and not mature sci-fi nerds like you and I.\n\nThe gameplay while at its core a fun experience is destroyed by a horrible quest system ("make me a cup of coffee!") and an unreliable Dev team that tends to break their game in truly impressive ways ("Bug fixes: NPC tenants no longer catch fire by accident").\n\nThere's an interesting colony system where you can get tenants to move into buildings you build, and the tenant will actually be designed to fit the building.\n\n\nIn short, it's an Early Access Scam. This game was meant to be released three years ago but it's still in beta. Apparently the release is only 2-3 updates away, but they're hard Devs to trust. Also, three years overdue and the game has not been optimised yet. The Devs are showing signs of improving but I'd recommend waiting until a sale to buy it if you like roleplay. That's the only way you'll get many hours out of this. I am fully aware of the irony that I have 1000+ hours logged in the game, but that's what happens when you roleplay.\n\nIf you want a fun 2D sandbox metroidvania, just buy Terraria.

After the initial fascination you are quickly met with the very bland nature of this game. It's very barebones, similar to the first iterations of minecraft survival mode or the first release of terraria, if not less.\nDeveloping leaves much room for improvement, as the developers seem to spend more time tweeting and blogging about their COOL NEW AMAZING STUFF™ or whine about the upset customerbase instead of developing the game. When you see all the  "previews" they post daily in their blog you are excited at first and according to their roadmap the game should be about 90% finished. Yet there's not even half of the features implemented. Most of the screenshots are simply mockups, luring you with content that doesn't exist yet.\n\nThis game sells solely on empty promises and mockup screenshots for now.

Racial traits like they discussed still seem to be absent.\n\n•A procedurally generated universe with unlimited procedurally generated planets\nAfter a while, it feels as if it's a copy/paste of the last planet you were on. This also makes building bases/houses totally useless. Good thing there are upgradeable ships and a few missions here and there to make it somewhat easier.\n\n•All content available in online drop in/drop out co-op\nTo an extent, yes this is true. But if you build a base in single player and want your internet friends to see it on a public server, not gonna happen. Which means you gotta fire up Hamachi (or the Starbound Server feature that's available via the launcher) and start up your own server.\n\n•Generated dungeons full of unique enemies\nThey worked on a bit more variety on this end, which is good.\n\n•Randomly generated monsters\nWith terrible AI and are repetitive to no end. This part still is true\n\n•Thousands of items\nFinally reached up to that point. I suppose building materials still count as "items"\n\n•A deep crafting system\n...Which runs on a mostly currency system, which you lose 50% of when you die. Oh, did I mention there's no means of a bank system? Still haven't fixed this bit since my last review.\n\n•PVP gameplay\nPvP in this game is a joke. 90% of the multiplayer community have more or less modded their equipment via Starcheat to one-hit kill everything. <-- You guessed it. Still a problem in multiplayer.\n\n•Own and decorate your own Starship\nWhich they gave more space via upgrades, a huge problem that should have been solved on day one.\n\n•Develop your own home planet\nStill has yet to be implemented in the game.\n\n•Menacing boss battles\nWhich now take place on maps you cannot edit, so there is a bit of a challenge with this bit now.\n\n•Procedurally generated guns and melee weapons\nWhich, again, can easily be cuztomized to be stupid OP thanks to Starcheat. I have yet to understand why the devs added playerkill.projectile into their code.\n\n•Farming, hunting and survival mechanics\nNow it's time for hunting 101!\n1. Keep walking left.\n2. Click on the monsters\n3. Obtain meat!\n\n•Built from the ground up to support modding\nProbably the only selling point. Because does this game sure need it. Still does, however the vanilla version is far less reliant on that end.\n\n•Ongoing free updates\nWhich are actually frequent! Yaaaaaaaay!\n\n•Multi-platform multiplayer\nBasically PC/Mac/Linux multi-platform.\n\nFinal note: This game has still been in Early Access since the last time I wrote this review (So basically...I wanna say since 2013-2014?) and the multiplayer community is still as toxic as I remember, which is unfortunate to say. And I really hate to say this, since the game has lots of potential, but it's going to be -VERY- repetitive after a while. My recommendation? Grab a few friends, fire up Hamachi or the starbound server, get a Skype call going, and just enjoy the vanilla version of the game. By no means am I saying this is a bad game, but it could be SO much better. Save your money, folks.\n\n--\n\nWow.\n\nTwo years and four million dollars well invested, CF.\n\nFor the low, low price of $14.99, you can buy a barely finished game (and has been that way for about a year now) that has little to no updates!\n\nLet's look at the key features, shall we?\n\n•6 playable races\nWe were promised 7, they still have yet to follow up on that, along with the racial traits still untouched\n\n•A procedurally generated universe with unlimited procedurally generated planets\nAfter a while, it feels as if it's a copy/paste of the last planet you were on.

So far there are only a handful of "generated dungeons" that feel exactly the same most of the time. I can guarantee the enemies never change, unless you're in a harder sector.\n\n•Randomly generated monsters\nWith terrible AI and are repetitive to no end.\n\n•Thousands of items\nBuilding materials don't count, pal.\n\n•A deep crafting system\n...Which runs on a mostly currency system, which you lose 50% of when you die.

If you want more space on your tiny ship, be thankful there's a mod for that.\n\n•Develop your own home planet\nStill has yet to be implemented in the game.\n\n•Menacing boss battles\nWhich consist of you shooting behind a bunker or wall.

Unless were talking PC/console/handheld multi-platform, then is that a key feature.\n\nOn a final note: I get that this game is in development. It has been for a year, which really holds no excuse as to why this game is terrible. I remember pre-ordering this game and being REALLY excited.

The developers moved to Europe to be near each other in order to work on the game efficiently and push updates faster. What a huge lie. They pretty much took all the money they got from supporters and ran with it. This game has no future and no hope of ever being finished. Like most people said, this game is forever stuck in beta (if you can even call it that it feels like an alpha) and will never finish. Initially the full game was expected to be released in 2013 but after a multitude of excuses and empty promises I gave up on this game and so should you.

The focus of the game has substantially changed ever since which is not necessarily bad - but a lot of design decisions since then disappointed me.\nWhen the game started as early access in December 2013, I was really looking forward to play it. However, I already had to stop trying it when it turned out that I couldn't reconfigure the keys. I opened a thread on the forum and it turned out that a lot of people asked for key rebinding as well. Some of the fanboys told us it would come with the next patch. Guess what, it didn't. Just like many other features promised, it was never realised. Almost ten months later they have not been able to implement a key rebinding interface even though they know a lot of their customers need it to play because they are not used to WASD. All you get is the usually pi**ed off hint that you can tweak some config file and practically reprogram the game yourself. So is this a negative recommendation just because of a missing keybinding interface? No. It still is an early access game and keybinding will probably even come in the final version (if there will be one ever). But the real problem here is an obviously incompetent team of programmers, who dont give a damn about their community. Instead they come up with lame excuses why they it takes them incredibly long to achieve minimal progress being employed by tons of money, the community paid them. One of my favourites was that they moved to a new office to another country to enlarge the chucklefish company. Yeah, wouldnt be surprised if the new office is on some nice beach and the staff extension was hiring a waiter for the cocktails. This is a deterring example for the risks of investing into early access software - you might like the idea, but you dont know if the team can accomplish it.

Unfortunately, we're now at around 4 1/2 months without a stable update. I expect there eventually will be a fairly complete version of the game, and it'll probably be good, but stay away until that happens. I mistakenly convinced three of my friends to chip in for a 4-pack of the game because of the devs' promise of a "Beta" in "2013". That promise turned out to mean "a very incomplete alpha in 2013 December, followed by getting so wrapped up in moving offices to England that we go from stable updates, to rare unstable updates, to nightly builds that we literally said might blow up your computer and kill your dog". What's really annoying is that the company has devoted repeated effort to advertising other games instead of putting full effort into this one. (Admittedly some of those don't involve the same dev team members, but it's still bad form.)\n\nIn short, what you're getting if you buy now is a very incomplete "Terraria" prototype and a vague promise that you'll have a complete game whenever the devs can be bothered to finish it.\n\n2014.12.4: We're now at nearly a year past the first "beta" with no noteworthy stable updates since February. Basic features like quests remain very incomplete even in the nightly builds that are the devs' excuse for not producing a professional quality release (they had millions of dollars of initial funding) in nearly a year.","July 4, 2014","false","67.8"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","23","29","0","0"

After a string of missed promises, mismanagement and spending of the long invested money of both Steam customers and Kickstarter backers, Starbound development is effecitvely dead in the water. There is little to no hope of significant updates in the near future due to the total fracas of bad business decisions made by the developing firm Chucklefish. The details of such events can be found with a few rudimentary searches.\n\nIn its current state the game has a very low level of progression or content, you have a small variety of biomes with pre-generated dungeons scattered and recycled through them, arbitrary grinding walls that simulate game progression but are really just time sinks to give you the illusion of gameplay. There is little to do with the items you collect and few items or avenues to explore in game. Combat is somehow more simplistic and blase then Minecraft or Terraria given SNES style AI of walk towards the player and attack and mininmal sprite based hit detection. As far as matching to the promised scope of the game the current iteration is no where close and has little hope of ever reaching there. It is doubtful it will ever lose its "Early Access" moniker.\n\nYou are better off purchasing Terraria or some other sandbox game as this project has unfortunately fell victim to a classic case of business failiure, I can only stress my empathy for those who unlike a traditional investment model, must watch their money be wasted.

It didn't show me much information for me to be interrested. "But hey, it does look like a pretty good game to play online with some friends", and oh boy! I was sure right!\n\nThis game combines everything that Terraria missed and combined with Minecraft's "hugeness" and multiplayer. It may be a bit harsh at first, but as you progress it gets only funnier and funnier. Small details that bring people together, just like instruments!

What really gets me is that absolutely nothing in the starbound universe is truly memorable. You can explore a planet (which takes entirely too long for how much there is to do on them) then leave and you rarely find anything worth looking at. The randomized monsters are boring. There's a lot of cool vanity objects but since there's really no point in creating a permanent base you never get to really mess with them.

I share the same issues most "negative reviewers" do, but I have had more than 200+ hours of gameplay from this game, and so have most of the "negative reviewers" as well, and for an Early Access game, that is pretty good, is it not? Despite it's flaws. So before you blindly judge it based off slow development, read the following:\n\nI have waited with reviewing this game until they posted more updates, but have owned it since it was released to the public - and had 200+ hours within the first 2-3 months of the game being released, a lot of those due to mods, but the game is coming around now on its own as well, adding a lot of the features mods used to.\n\nIf you loved Terraria, you will love this, no questions asked, just get Starbound and play it. If you never played Terraria, well ask yourself this:\n\nDoes exploring space in your own spaceship, in a 2D pixelated universe sound amazing? Does building cool space-bases throughout various random planets sound fun? Does exploring the universe and digging to the planets cores sound daring enough for ya'? If that is the case, then Starbound might just  be for you.\n\nWhile I will recommend this game, I do have some minor (and I STRESS "minor", because I do love Starbound) issues that I am not fond of. The developer of the game promised large updates frequently, however, since it released 1 year and 2 months ago, there has been approximately 4 "decent" updates to the game - which have added a proper amount of content to the game. Starbound still has quite a ways to go before it should be considered a full game. And while I understand the quarrels of coding and programming, the actual design part of adding new blocks, biomes, monsters (although monsters are plenty as it is), items, weapons, etc. is not that hard in a 2D pixel game, and some of the updates focused heavily on adding only these (a lot of cosmetic stuff like hats), with minor additions to other parts of the game.\n\nAnd just to make a note, if that previous paragraph bummed anyone out too much - I will repeat, I do recommend this game, and in the first 2-3 months of the game being out I played 200+ hours with plenty of fun and shenanigans. And I am eagerly awaiting the day Starbound is released as a full game. Starbound has a great future, and definitely has a lot of hours worth of content now (which is more than most Early Access games), and additionally there is a plethora of mods that will give you even more play-time.\n\nSo yes, I would recommend Starbound in a heartbeat.\n\nPlus, the Winter Update just added Llamas in Space!","January 29, 2015","true","268.1"," 186 of 320 people (58%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","58","186","320","33","14"

The endless planets concept is interesting, but I felt like I was constantly on the move.  That almost entirely eliminates the building part of the game.\n\nBattling monsters is a joke at this point.  The AI needs to refined, and the monsters need variety, and hitboxes shaped like the sprite would be nice.\n\nExploring is cool.  Planet surfaces usually have at least one unique structure or town but there is 0 satisfaction for visting towns or for exploring the more dangerous areas.\n\nIf the game is truely still in Alpha, I would say the creators are on the right path.

Possibly one of the most generic games you could play. There is no real unique planets, once you visit one, you've literally seen them all. NPC interaction is minimal. Enemies are essentially cheap recolours of each other with a few swapped body parts, fight one and you've fought them all. Boss battles are uninteresting and unchallenging. Weapons are mostly dull and uninspired, dungeons can be fun once or twice before you realize hardly any of them have any real loot aside from the useless aesthetics you can plunder. Each of the playable races are statistically the same, esentially reskins of each other. They do have some unique stats on their racial armour, but that's just stupid and not an actual racial ability.\n\nMinibosses (ones you don't summon, they appear on most planets) are the same copy/paste generated monsters, except enlarged and given some more health. They don't even try to make the minibosses look good or fit in, they don't use the same resolution on them as other enemies. Instead it simply looks as though someone used the magnify tool on MS Paint and called it a day.\n\nI realize it's early access, but it's unacceptable for a game in beta that promised "thick and fast" updates to go months and months without any sort of update to the game.

They just keep adding filler content, ignoring the core, whilst making game easier and easier (hunger and environment hazard removed, ship expansion added) which makes doing certain things pointless (hunting monsters, building bases)... I honestly see no reason to go full-on back to this game, and if this headless direction continues, I see no reason to recommend this game neither...\n\npre 9/10/2015:\nI bought this game when it was new, and it starts to be over 6 months ago. First month or so this game saw two to three updates that included character wipes and somewhat new content. Ever since that third and "last" wipe according to devs, there have been no real patches.\n\nAbout 3 months after release of this game, devs said slow updates were due to their studio being relocated. Okay, seems they got some dosh from starbound, maybe they´ll be now productive in their new studio, I tought.\n\nNow, last month after 5 months of no patches, this game saw "nightly" mode update, which is supposed to be sandbox mode that players can mess with and get latest content updates while devs actively update it. I have to concur with many critics, this is HIGHLY lazy way to patch and update your game, instead of feature patches they give us sandbox where you get your weapons with console codes if you dont want to grind. Well, this "update" truly is "Nightly", as it now every time I log into steam downloads and updates itself, but for some reason, they just don´t get it to stable. It crashes for me on launch, and as far as I have read community hub, I have not read a single comment that says it works and launches the game properly.\n\nI don´t really have any faith in this game anymore. It was quite fun-ish grind-a-thon 20 hours I played with few friends who I had been waiting with drool on our mouths for starbound all hyped up. But at it´s current state, this game really is nothing but grind-a-thon. It´s like terraria in space, except worlds feel empty and bosses dull.\n\nWith starbound, I think this is slowly turning out to be second Early Access game that I actually had faith in, but just wont be really finished and promises fullfilled. I´m not surprised if this game gets in all silence 1.0 update next 6 months or so, and then starbound devs will pull what stardrive dev did and announce that they are working on bigger and better starbound 2.","July 4, 2014","false","42.6"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

A contentless Terraria.\nI really cannot think of many positive things to say about this game. It has terrible bosses (both looks and difficulty wise). Who thought it would be oh so funny to make the first boss be a penguin in a flying saucer? Whos humour is so bad that they actually found that funny? Why wasn't the boss simply an alien in the flying saucer, that spawns more aliens on the surface instead of penguins?\nThen we have the second boss, which is a robot that you build yourself. You build it, just to kill it. This boss also looks idiotic too. How hard can it be to make a threatening looking robot? That's one of the main problems with the few bosses in this game. They don't look threatening at all. They're also way too easy.\nAt least the dragon is somewhat decent.\n\nAnyway, the game has been casualized to hell and back too. At first we had threat levels for each sector. For example, in the alpha sector, the threat level went from 1-10, beta sector 10-20, and so on upto threat level 100. You could immediately see the difference in difficulty between a threat level 1 planet, to a threat level 4+.\nNow we have 10 threat levels maximum. Alpha sector has nothing but threat level 1 planets, beta nothing but threat level 2. Chucklefish claim that the difficulty is still just the same, but that is a flat out lie. The monsters apparently get stronger the further you dig down into the planet, but I never noticed any difference, even when I reached the planets core. Speaking of which, you have next to no reason to dig past the surface in this game. Terraria was filled with sprawling caves which had many neat things to find. Starbound caves are devoid of anything besides a few enemies. You might as well stay on the surface.\nOh and once you reach a certain depth, the music cuts off. Some may argue that this creates atmosphere, but since the caves are so dull I don't see how it adds to anything. Instead it comes across as lazy. There could have easily been some cave themes that actually added to the "creepy" atmosphere that they were trying to go for.\n\nNow onto the monsters. They look awful. They sound awful. Seriously, half of them make horse sounds, the other half make sheep sounds. It's so irritating to listen too. What's the matter? Couldn't even take some time out to give the enemies some decent, unique sound effects? Again, lazy.\nI think it was advertised at some point "never see the same enemy twice!". Well I have seen the same exact enemy multiple times over. I've also seen that same enemy, except coloured green, instead of purple.\nDo chucklefish not know how to make things look threatening? Well, they sort of do since I have seen a few enemies that actually look good, but most of the time the enemies look goofy as ♥♥♥♥. Why must chucklefish insist on taking the goofy route? Is that their plan? To make the games comedy be aimed at morons that find an enemy with a mohawk funny?\n\nI could go on and on about this games shortcomings, but I'm going to cut it short here.\n\nThe bottom line is, Terraria, which took a few months to create (granted it was still a little rough around the edges when it first came out too) is a far and away better game than Starbound which has taken years and is still in alpha, which the devs are calling beta. The updates are few and far between. It's been like what? 4 months now without an update?\nTalk about taking the money and running. I had the game bought for me thankfully, or I'd actually be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if I payed money for this crap.\n\nSo remember kids, don't buy incomplete games, because this happens. The devs have no incentive to work on it now that you gave them 3 million for a barebone skeleton of a game.","July 11, 2014","false","138.6"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Ultimately it disappointed me a lot. I am a MASSIVE Terraria fan and although this was not meant to be the next Terraria by any means, it's just missing a lot of what makes a game like Terraria fun. Exploring wasn't necessarily the fun thing about these kind of games (in my opinion), however it's become the core of Starbound. Exploring and finding chests that contain rare **** that you can use to become more powerful than your mates isn't the same as exploring and finding a building filled with intelligent walking monkeys filled with items that do nothing but look pretty or perhaps heal a little health/prevent hunger. It's nice at first but then I just feel like it looses it's joy.\n\nTo be fair, I preordered the beta so perhaps when the game is fleshed out a bit (a lot) more it will be more fun.

Once you find a bone hammer or a legendary gun you are pretty much unstoppable. Ive gone from copper to impervium three times over in coop and twice solo.

Ah yeah, i have bought this game from external site after totally forgeting that it even exist, now what i expected was finished/close to finished game because i have heard about it like year ago. Obviously its far from that and i do understand that its still early access and that its my own fault for not informing my self better before spending money but yeah...\n\nSo the best way to describe starbound would be unfinished.\nIt really does have everything that is promised, wast space to explore but there isn't enough variety so things get boring fast. There are different sprites for monsters but most of them share same AI while some lack any so they will just jump around till you hack them down.\nCrafting works fine its menu are not complicated and its easy to understand + you can drop 4 or 1 block at once so over all its far supperior to lets say terraria, however there is one thing that i didn't like and that is progression lock tied to certain events. Simply to say usually you have to kill some boss to unlock more advanced stuff and this works fine in aspect that it prevents you from skiping parts and just going for end game stuff without much pentalty. But it translates into rather boring grind till you hit gear milestone only to unlock more grind add to that rather boring exploration and yeah...\nOfc this all can change in final version and i will update this according to that.\n\nStill with all that best aspect of game is that it supports modding and with mods you can tweak the game how you like it. So even in this unfinished state i had fun with it.\nAs many said the game have potential how ever i cant recommend the game in state as it is now.

But potential alone doesn't really mean much for a game, and none of that potential has really been reached. Starbound focuses heavily on procedural generation, from the planets to weapons and monsters. This sounds good on paper- the problem is the game focuses TOO much on procedural generation, to the point it practically stifles any creativity it could have. Once you've seen one bird, you've seen them all. When you've seen one ground monster, you've seen them all. Rather than giving a bunch of weapons and monsters individual attention, there's a bunch of weapons and monsters that have been created by a computer. The same problem seems to apply to planets too, they don't really feel that much different from each other, other than the late game tier planets and whatnot. Starbound's biggest crime is that it relies too much on the computer rather than what the developers could create. While Terraria is most certainly not perfect, this is a mistake it didn't make- it knew the limits of procedural generation, and most of the content placed in the game was created directly by the developers. Not that there's anything wrong with procedural generation, but I believe Chucklefish fell into the trap of thinking a lot of it is a good thing, when it isn't.\n\nMuch of the game is also very empty. They call it a "Phase 1 Beta", which is basically a fancy way of saying "It's an alpha", and only beta by their own personal definition as opposed to using actual software terminology. Obviously this feeling of emptiness is the result of it being in early access, and this is fine. However, I feel it important for people to realize that a beta means that it's mostly feature complete, and essentially just buggy, where as an alpha still has a lot of development to go through. I wouldn't normally care about arguing this, if it weren't for the fact that this could end up tricking people into buying a game that's a lot more incomplete than Chucklefish is leading everyone on to believe. According to them, many of the features are turned off (although they could just as easily not even exist, certainly wouldn't be the first lie they've made.)\n\nThere's really a lot more I could say. I do not expect that Starbound will be a bad game. But this had best be a serious learning experience for Chucklefish that they need to grow up, stop blaming the community for their shortcomings, stop making excuses, eat an entire humble pie and actually realize that they are responsible for the community's negative reaction towards their company and their game. By the time Starbound actually IS fully released in what will likely be several years, it may unfortunately be too late for many people to care. This is their first game as a company, and they're off to a bad start. That's all it takes to tank an indie developer.\nIf none of this has been enough to convince you that you should really hold off on buying Starbound, then read some of the top reviews; they put it in words better than I can.\n\nIf you're still interested, then at LEAST keep an eye on it. As I said, this is a game with potential and I'd really love to see this game succeed, even if its in the hands of a scumbag developer. However, I am a realist, and I honestly do not think Starbound has any hope left. It's tragically inferior to its competition in almost every way, and it really isn't going anywhere fast.\n\nIf anything, Starbound should serve as a cold reminder to be careful with what you preorder and/or dump money into before its released.","August 16, 2014","false","31.9"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

Instead of taking forever to explore one island I can take forever to explore a few solar systems.  But then I can travel to any of the thousand other systems and explore them as well.  The different material types are as varied as Minecraft and then some.  You can grow food, build buildings, create better materials, hunt creatures, get into shootouts with the locals, etc.\n\nin the latest version you can expand your ship.  You don't even have to develope planet-side buildings anymore if you don't want to.  You can literally live off your ship and expand it as you go.  There are now also more fuel types (fuel is needed to move between star systems), some more ceocentrated than others.\n\nWith the outpost you now have access to more quests, which means more adventures.  They can be as random as "Find me a stone USMC sign".  Do you remember what planet on what system you found that USMC prison colony?  You don't?  Time to go exploring and find another to get that sign!\n\nThere are "dungeons" on pretty much every planet.  You can dig down into the planet and find gnomish villages.  You can dig through several different layers of the planet and find everything from mushrooms to buried laboratories to underground lakes full of acid, all of which you can break down with your tool and use for yourself, either in a crafting recipe or as a decoration for your home(s).\n\nIf you like open-world construction games of a blocky nature, then this one is definitely worth trying out.  There are many to choose from these days and eveyone likes one more than the others.  If you're still searching for "the one" then play this one.

Even though the game was in development for many years and people were desperately waiting for a terraria in space to finally come out. Only to be disappointed with it's lack of polish and content. Even through this games many updates it still has a very big flaw. You can do all of its content in about 2 hours. Sure if you spend a majority of your time going through the different planets and exploring you can rack up more hours. That gets boring extremely quickly when you learn that the planets have little variety and just look a little different.

And sadly, it's been that way for the past 6 months now.  No quests, repetetive planets, weak progression, villages full of aliens that don't do anything besides a few little jokes, simple combat, and a team of seemingly incompetent devs who don't seem able to deliver content or interact with the community in any meaningful way have ruined a lot of my excitement for this game.

Difficulty and ores depend on planet types locked by a hazard in which you need to obtain a special resistance in order to not die within five seconds. Enemies and loot are part of this terrible classification. This is what replaced the older system where planets where catorgized into difficulty levels rather than just something depending on the planet type itself. Too much of this game is forced and there so little to do. Even more so, there is nothing worthwhile to do with your money.\n\nOne of my biggest gripes with the game is the weapons and armour. There's very little to set ranged players and melee players apart except for the last tier of armour. (which then introduces mage-like weapons?) Most importantly, I'm not impressed with how they handled the balancing and ammo for weapons. It's incredibly stupid to base it off on an energy system only generated by your suit and shared with some of the abilities you use. A lot of people would think using actual ammo would tip things toward ranged but it doesn't! Think about it, melee based players can use blocking and the energy system to manuever around quickly and to also dodge. Range based players only have that bar for the weapons, which aren't much at all, plus a penalty to back pedaling. This is why Terraria is infinitly better. All of the classes are balanced and don't rely on redundant systems.\n\nWith each update I'm playing less and less. Who needs to farm when the hunger system has been removed? Who needs to colonize a planet when you have your ship and little to do with money?

The community is toxic and the developers seem to be either a bunch of children or simply conmen abusing the stupidity of the aforementioned fanboys. Don't buy it, don't give it attention, just forget all about it. I hope that, one day, this game will be forgotten by every single human being on this planet so it could be like it never existed.

It's been gone over that the developers are lazy, blame the community, and have decided that one screenshot and half a paragraph of nothing in particular counts as an ;update'. It's made over 2 million in it's kickstarter, and over 15 in the first MONTH, so it's not like they should have ANY excuse not to get cracking, besides the fact they're just lazy.\n\nOh, and apparently none of that massive budget got put towards a QA department. The last content update was in March. For a VALENTINES update. And it was almost all vanity items. And during that time, they released a patch with one of the WORST POSSIBLE bugs in this time of game; about half your chests, or ANY storage unit would crash the game if you simply CLICKED on it.\n\nFor a game that needs you to hoard a lot of stuff for crafting and building, this was INSANE. The "hotfix" (aka a patch that  is supposed to come out ASAP) didn't come out until a couple DAYS later. And guess what? ALL those bugged chests were deleted. Gone, vanished, no way to get your stuff back.\n\nWhat did the devs say to this? Basically "Tough ♥♥♥♥, you should have made a backup of your world before our patches? You didn't? Well, you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, aren't you?"\n\nDon't buy this.

Loaded it up briefly today (but it crashed on load, good start) while i had a read of some of my fellow players reviews,  and well....it seems like it's just gone even further downhill from where it was when I posted the earlier review below.\nStill doesn't seem like we have ship customisation/upgrading? That was one of the early promises they made for content.\nI actually enjoyed going through the different regions (Alpha/Beta/Delta) back in the day, but they've removed these which makes the universe feel a bit more generic and limited.\nOnce again, the fact it's still in EA a year after my last review, and was initially "released" a further year before that...that's not a good sign for a game.\nMy recommendation is still as it was before: Don't get this game until they finish it, if they ever do.\n\nOriginal Review (Dec 2014)\nSo much has been promised with this game, but so much hasn't been delivered- various dates for release stages have been pushed back (often repeatedly), much hyped content (ship upgrades, etc) has never been implemented.\nIt's easy to get pretty much high-end gear and have a huge fortress of your own built *full* of scavenged/crafted furniture/chests/etc without much game time- the number of hours I've spent on this game is including several times where patches broke save files, so I had to start again, and a lot of time leaving the game running while I go and do other things.\nAs of currently, there hasn't been a proper content update in quite a while (not counting the "night" updates, which are sort of unstable unofficial patches/updates. So it's beginning to seem like this game will never be truely completed, and therefore never follow up on all it's promise, which makes me sad as it started off seeming awesome.","November 21, 2014","false","87.7"," 144 of 250 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","144","250","0","8"

We enjoyed it so much I bought 2 4-packs to play w/my family. Once we finished expert mode on Terraria, we were excited about Starbound because one of the devs on Terraria created Starbound. I bought 2 4-packs of Starbound to play w/my family. We haven't installed them all. The game is just boring, the combat is repetitive and pointless, the bosses are not worth fighting once, much less more than once. Worst of all are the mobs. They could all be the same. It doesn't matter if you procedurally generate many more things if they are all essentially the same boring thing underneath. Oh look a rat pig bird. Hey an eyeball dinosaur. You fight every single mob the same way and they fight essentially the same way. It just doesn't much matter.\n\nInfinite is not better. A well planned out, designed, crafted finite world with finite monster types with well designed and balanced mechanics is MUCH better than inifnite, procedurally generated junk. I don't want to play Starbound anymore, it's no fun. It doesn't matter that the universe is infinite. If it's boring, it doesn't matter.\n\nCan't wait for Terraria: Otherworld and Terraria 2.

Do not buy the game right now. I'll say it again do not buy this game while it is in development. Now you may be asking yourself well why would I say that with having played 80 hours of it and I'm going to explain why my stance is what it is now. I'll try to keep it in bullet format and simple to read so you can pick out the pros and cons and decide more easily for yourself. Also I apologize for my grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors.\n\nFirstly I want to say that Starbound as it is right now is playable and enjoyable to a point, but the reason that I believe you shouldn't purchase it at this time isn't because of the game itself rather the developers and PR behind it which I will get into later.\n\nPros\n\nExtremely playable, simplistic and fun for short bursts of playing time.\n\nNot necessarily a unique take on the genre, but if you played Terraria I'd argue that you would like this game.\n\nInteresting race concepts and art style\n\nDecent crafting though a bit lacking has it's moments\n\nA variety of biomes to run in and Dungeons to play through keeping some of the worlds you visit fresh and interesting driving\nyou to continue exploring at least for a while.\n\nCons\n\nFor the cons section I'll follow each bullet with my belief on the validity of the con and whether it should influence your purchase. I am no means a video game expert and all of this is my opinion I'm simply trying to help you understand why my recommendation is what it is.\n\nThough it's marketed as a Beta in this writers opinion it is an Alpha with Beta stability. I'll go in depth with this a bit more to make my reasoning clear, I believe a Beta should be feature complete and be testing for bugs. Some may not agree, but as I stated this is my opinion not a fact. One avenue where I believe this shows itself best is that most if not all of the content dealing with progression, npc interaction, and questing is garbage and it's been this way for coming up a few months shy of a year now. This isn't permenant just current state now.  "In my opinion this is a decent sized con, but I don't believe it should be what you determine your purchase on. Though it does suck a bit now it will get better, but it takes time and work to get through this."\n\nAs I mentioned above the game is playable and enjoyable in short play sessions, but it ends at about 2 hours if that. Now you can play and build entire cities if you'd like which isn't bad, but when it comes to enjoyability I like progression and steady game play through to the "end" of the game. "This shouldn't effect your purchase unless you are kind of like me and enjoy progression, questing and npc interaction."\n\nThough there are different biomes after about an hour or so they all blend together, I love their heating system for colder planets don't get me wrong, but the driving force of the game is to gather x ore from x lvl planet and make x lvl armor and ship upgrade to go to the next level. There is no drive to build a base, no drive to colonize anything, and no drive to try to discover anything at all other than dig straight down get your ore then go back to your ship/base to build the next upgrade. "To sum it up these last three cons can all be placed within the Alpha vs Beta con. Just understand that getting into this there are parts missing entire sections that seem boring and will be that way for several more months if not a year more. which brings me to my last con."\n\nThe biggest con and the reason that I'm recommending you to not buy this game until it is finished is Developer/company interaction, PR, and feedback to customers. I want to go into detail about this one because it is the damning factor in a lot of the arguments about whether the game is a worth while investment. When I first purchased Starbound the promises from Chucklefish were actually quite different than they are now which brings me to my first complaint. Chucklefish has the worst time with release dates and due to this they change what they say. For instance when I purchased the game there was a quote stating that all funds would go directly to the game and that the more money they got towards it the faster the game would be released. This was followed by a company move and publishing multiple titles for other companies on top of starting another game without having finished their first game. This wouldn't have been so bad had they explained that with the money from Starbound they were in fact not going to hire more programmers and increase the release speed, but rather promote and further their company. Not so bad, but a form of false advertisement on top of a pile of them. Quick releases went to slow releases then releases on a nightly possibly broken status exc. I'll sum this up by when I read what the developers have to say now as they ask for your purchase on steam only a few shards of it are the same as they were when I bought into this and when you argue this point it will get thrown back in your face stating that it is an early release, but I would argue an early release is still promising certain things in the effort to get you to invest in a product so most if not all promises made by a company need to be held accountable no matter the status of the promise. This isn't a kickstarter this is a product being sold on future content or development practices you are promising your customer.\n\nWhen confronted with the lack of communication back when updates were slow and given between three to four websites developers responded angrily with customers. Through passive aggressive hints or even out right blaming customers for lack of production in certain areas because they were "complaining too much." Let me rephrase I say developers, but TiY is actually the only developer I remember with this. There might have been more, but TiY stands out as having done it the most. "These two points though terrible when talking about a company and a consumer are not so bad, but lead into my final con which is the one that truly drives my recommendation."\n\nOver the past few months when I've visited the forums I've watched as some of the most overzealous moderators delete, censor and close any forum dealing with negative feedback with no other reasoning than "everyone should know better" quote from Izzabelle (The one who locks) < guessing self made title. When questioned about it the moderators continue to delete, censor and act irresponsibly to customers due to the anonymity of their interaction. This behavior though rude and obnoxious can't all be placed on the developer except that it's been happening for months and anyone watching the forums for a length of time know that speaking ill of the game comes with the chance of being banned anywhere from 2 weeks to permanently because "they said so". This would bring one to assume that this type of interaction is not only acceptable to Chucklefish, but applauded by the frequency of these types of responses. Customer censorship is shameful.\n\nThough the game and what it's shaping up to one day be look amazing, Terrible customer interaction, Terrible forum moderation, Lies, Misscommunication and Blaming have ultimately turned me off of this company and any/all of it's future games. My recommendation is to buy the game when it's finished or don't buy it at all, because the moment you have something negative to say you no longer really matter. They got what they needed from you after all.\n\nWhen the game is out I will switch the recommendation and rewrite the review to explain why in it's finished version it's worth buying, but that any looking to buy need be wary of early access from Chuckle.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DPVRP","September 9, 2014","false","87.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

I will not hold your hand, do it yourself.\n\nGame is not going anywhere, they're already working on another game too.\n( Apparently it's another team in the same company, as if there even was anyone working on it in Starbound in the first place. )\n\nEDIT2.0: It's been a LONG time and yet still none of the promises were expanded upon, and the game's current population are fanboys or people who are angry, still waiting for a product.\n-REVIEW-\nStarbound is very linear, with no real goals on what to do other than: 'Collect stuff, make better stuff.'\nThere is no real incentive to play beyond that, as building is mostly pointless as you will leave worlds behind, as you should be travelling across the whole galaxy of space and whatever.\n\nThe quest system is very under-utilized ( as of which, they have stated that they will add more for 1.0 )\nand even if they do add more quests, the question changes to: 'Will it ever be worked on far enough to be interesting and add value to the game?'\n\nOutside of it's initial charm, which comes from the 'immersive' part of the game, the game can get old rather quickly, as there currently isn't enough material to keep you interested in the lore of the game, and there isn't enough quests/dialogue to keep you wanting to stay around the towns/villages/airships, which again, comes down to lack of content. There are plenty of descriptions, which are a nice touch to the 'immersion' factor, and the player will actually move as if they were talking. There's also a ton of references, which will entertain some. Some references are VERY obvious, while others are a bit more subtle, however, still obvious.\n\nBut that isn't enough to keep players interested for long.\n\nThere's survival elements into this game that require you to eat, be warm, and of course, remain in good health ( so nothing completely ruins your day ).\nHowever, this adds to the linear part of the game.\nYou make armor, it protects you, you make better armor, it protects you better, and now you are a bit more warm. As for food, you can get food almost anywhere, making it more of a annoyance than an actual survival element. And I do mean anywhere, you can kill animals on the moon if you needed to.\n\nThe combat works in a good concept, it's actually better than Skyrim. You'll need to actually attempt to stay alive, as enemies are dangerous enough to overwhelm you, until you are geared.\n\nThere are various types of weapons in Starbound.\nSpears - Good for poking\nSwords - Good for stabbing\nGuns - Good for shooting\nBows - Good for Hunting\nand various other tools of violence, all at your disposal.\n\nCurrently, the enemy isn't programmed far enough to actually require tactical use of the weapons.\nThe best use is simply to get a ranged weapon and kite the opponent.\nIf an opponent could require certain use of weapons, ( perhaps teamwork )\nthen this would be very interesting.\nShooting a monster, while it turns to deflect you, while an ally stabs it in the back with a spear, avoiding it's protruding spikes and toxic clouds.\n\nThere is the standard mining. Not much to explain there.\nCutting down trees actually falls over. Rather than combusting. +1 Immersion.\n\nItems; they are everywhere.\nThere are plenty of items and upgrades within Starbound that really change the game.\nHowever, your luck is based on whether you go to the right planet or not.\nWhether you got lucky with the RNG, or maybe you looked for a good planet on the internet, there will still be many pointless planets in which you do nothing but look for a giant monster that has red particles near it. Then you kill it and get a weapon with special properties, which are pretty fun to use. My personal favorite was the bonehammer, which let you slam with a melee attack, while at the same time, launching bones at the enemy.\n\nSpeaking of items and upgrades( called techs ); there are some pretty cool finds that let you do certain things.\nUsing a quick dash, or maybe creating a bubble to help you levitate, those help with the game's combat, adding a bit of excitement. But, again, there simply isn't enough to use, losing out on any potential diversity.\n\nThe game's modding scene is extremely good, but, as this is a review of the base game, we will not discuss mods as part of the game. The modders of Starbound have done some excellent work and have added many things that players have wanted. If you did pick up Starbound and regret it, you may have a chance using the player created mods, which would help you gather some value out of the game.\n\nNow, you have all of those cool stuff in a sci-fi world. 'What more do I need?' - No one, ever.\nThere's the giant problem of the game not being finished, and not currently having enough meta-game. The lack of content really strains the game, a moment where dynamic missions would be very influential. Right now, the only real content there is, is based on the sole existance of player creativity, and mechanics. Once a player has exhausted either, ( which they will, unless you have a never-ending supply of drugs. ) they will then have nothing to do. Yes, there are quests, but how long will those really last the player? Will they be lengthy enough to continue playing, and will they successfully hook the player? The lack of a true meta-game really shows after just beating the first boss, and is very evident after you get to the last sector.\n\n'Oh, you can uh-uh-uh build a b-b-base!'\nBut what purpose does it serve me, other than for more storage?\n\n\n\n\nOther than searching for dungeons ( then raiding them after hopefully finding one )\nand beating all of the bosses in the game and crafting the linear-upgrades of items, what more can you REALLY do?","September 9, 2014","false","46.9"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","12"

The current state of the game is not broken, but very far from feeling complete.  There are bits and pieces of brilliance and fun to be found while playing the game, but the game becomes a repetitive bore after exploring past the first couple of sectors.  "Bland randomness" is the phrase I would use to describe most aspects of this game that rely on the procedural generation.  The planets are randomly bland, the weapons are randomly bland, the monsters and NPCs are randomly bland, the unique structures and dungeons are randomly bland, etc.\n\nThe game seems to have spiraled into some kind of development hell for almost six months, with few updates, suspiciously vague promises of future content, and a fair deal of excuses to why development is going slowly.  Furthermore, I am appalled to see the overkill level of censorship that this company is now pushing against their fanbase: a justifiably angry fanbase that gave THEIR money to Chucklefish in order to help them expedite the development of this game.  At this point, I just I feel like I've been flim-flammed by a dubious indie game developer and payed far too much for far too little of actual substance.\n\n\nUpdate (7/31/14): Tried the nightly build after a bit of messing with the files to stop the game from crashing... It's nice to actually see some of the features put into effect that they have been showcasing on their website, even if the gameplay is a buggy, discheveled mess.","July 15, 2014","false","47.8"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

It was basically Terraria. In Space. With promises of being much more. Hell, the game was developed by ex-Terraria developers. That lead me to thinking: How could developers of Terraria mess up their game by simply putting the damn game in space? At that point it didn't matter to me. Numerous friends already bought the game and bombarded me with "WHY DONT YOU HAVE THIS GAME YET????", and, "PLAY WITH ME!!!!!" They never seemed to run out of things to rave about the game. So I bit the bullet. I bought the game, immediately installed, and dove into the universe of Space Terraria. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nNow, onto the gameplay.\n\nDiving head-first into singleplayer, the game introduces you to the quest system by having you retrieve your first item in the game from a storage compartment on your spaceship. Simple enough. The controls seemed nothing out-of-the-ordinary. WASD to move around, spacebar to jump (even if jumping momentum seemed clunky), clicking to interact with various "blocks" and items, yadda yadda. Already the game seemed like SpaceTerraria. After beeming down to my starting planet's surface and completing the remaining "tutorial" quests, I had a cozy little camp with a fire and a crafting bench. I made myself a pickaxe and mined some of the obviously low-quality starting ores (copper, iron, and some coal). Using coal to power my spaceship, I had already travelled to a few planets, and scavenged enough resources to create a distress beacon: the item required to summon the game's first boss. A penguin piloting a giant UFO dropped from the sky, and my first boss battle had begun. It ended just as quick. As it turns out, the boss was extremely easy to "cheese," as a trapped myself in a small dirt box with a one-block opening to swing a weapon out from. The battle was done and over with as quickly as it started. I climbed through the various tiers of armor and weaponry with extreme ease, and had "beaten" the game faster than I imagined.\n\nThe controls, as I stated were nothing bizzare: WASD movement, click on things to interact. No complaints in the controls department aside from extremely wonky jumping mechanics. The gravity on a planet's surface varied with different planets, but none of that seemed to matter. Jumping sends you in the same, awkward arc that is extremely hard to control. Getting the right trajectory and angle of a jump is tedious and waaaay harder than it needs to be.\n\nCombat is simple. VERY simple. Like, boringly unsatisfying. Swords, spears, axes, it doesn't matter. You click when a monster is within the weapons reach, and repeat. No RNG (besides criticals) to spice things up, you click. Click, click, click. Guns are no better. All the guns seem identical. Oh, and did i mention you click? Click to win!\n\nBeing a Terraria-esque game, being able to build a house or base is to be expected. This is where the game shines, in my eyes. Having thousands of different planets to explore means having a diverse selection of landscapes and atmospheres to contruct an ideal spaceport or cozy cottage. Along with diverse landscapes comes diverse building blocks. Want to build a tropical-themed, thatched-roof hut on a frozen, desolate moon? Knock yourself out! A intimidating and looming stone castle on a world of cotton candy trees and talking birdmen? I dont see why not! Even after I "beat the game" and reached the highest tiers of tools and armor, building a giant fishbowl for my geisha fish girl and defending it from sphincter-headed dinosaurs was a gaming experience like no other. Make sure to bring your creativity and roleplaying mindsets with you if you venture into Starbound.\n\nMultiplayer was a different story entirely. The game was oodles more entertaining and replayable with a crew of friends to join up and plunder the universe together with. I could write an entire book of the crazy-fun times I had with my buds in Starbound, but that almost feels like another game entirely, and I'm here to focus on Starbound.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm starting to run out of good things to say about poor Starbound.\n\nBeing an early-access game, paying for and playing an unfinished game is to be expected. However, even for an early access game, the whole thing seemed rather...underwhelming. While it might just be the dying-down of my hype, the game was not what I expected it to be at all. It seemed very unfinished and empty. Even a group of good friends couldn't fix the empty gameplay. But the advantage of an early-access game is seeing the addition of new, exciting content before your very eyes, right?\nStarbound didn't get that memo.\n\nCall me cynical, or whatever you will, but I feel lied to. Cheated. Scammed. The developers over at Chucklefish were on an incredible streak of fixing and patching the game tailored to the findings of the community and playerbase. This streak continued for months. Then ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan.\nDevelopers started leaving, including one of the big-men-on-top. The developers took their patches and fixes with them. Progress on the game seemed to come to a standstill. However, the development website promised and displayed what content was being worked on and would "soon" (my definition of soon =/= Chucklefish's definition) be added to the game. Every day, the website showcased new features being worked on. Features that never seem to see the light of day. The website is a catalog of broken promises and wasted potential. The last "update" posted to the site is a collection of GIFs of monsters with promises of "...updates soon!" These no longer mean anything to me, and are just the developers' way of waving my money in my face.\n\nIn summary...\nStarbound is a sandbox, Terraria-esque game that takes place in outer space. Immersive exploration is plagued with lackluster gameplay backed with broken promises of updates and constant new content. Playing with friends makes things a bit more bearable, but feels like you're bringing an umbrella to protect yourself against a rain of flaming dookie.\n\nAs much of a ♥♥♥♥ I've taken on this game, I sure had a hell of a time eploring and building. Who knows? Maybe the developers will but away their hashpipes for a bit and work on the game. It might have a brighter future ahead of it, but for now, spend your money elsewhere. I truly await better times for this game :(","July 19, 2014","false","136.0"," 35 of 54 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","35","54","0","0"

It looks like Terraria in Space. It is not Terraria in Space.\n\nStarbound is clearly an early access game, yet it's been on sale for over half a year. There has been little progress made in the development, even though the developers have received $4 million on Kickstarter and countless sales on Steam.\n\nWhatever. The game itself is what matters. It's very boring. There are fundamental issues with the movement, combat, and progression. Movement is clunky, and getting around on planets never gets particularly fast. Combat is incredibly bland. There are only 2 boring enemy types, and some ridiculously overpowered bosses. Progression is bizarrely linear for what is supposed to be a sandbox game. It essentially boils down to : grind for way too many resources, cheese a boss to death, craft a new workbench, fly to next area, repeat. Every tier is not much different than the last, and there's very little reason to revisit previous areas. You'll spend most of your time gathering some resources, then quickly checking lots of random planets for their dungeon loot. Sometimes the dungeons are interesting, at least. Too bad finding them is a huge chore.\n\nYes, these concerns could be resolved in due time. However, these are fundamental gameplay issues. Starbound looks great, and it has lots of toys. The problem is that the devs keep focusing on superficial elements, instead of fixing the game itself.\n\nDon't waste your money or time. I doubt this game will get any better. The developers have clammed up, and now they refuse to listen to any criticism. That's a sure sign this game won't see any real changes.","July 1, 2014","false","115.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

I funded this game during it's Kickstarter days with enthuisasm and such blind faith in the development team without learning their history of making games. Let me tell you this, the Developers are very shady. Not the shady kind of scheming but the kind that seem to hardly do anything in terms of game content. This game has been in Early Access for a very long time now, and there hasn't been a single patch in four months to improve content. They aren't great with decision making either; considering they made mining gratutitous and repetitive, you used to be able to farm ore from sand blocks and get them quicker than spending a few more seconds on a mineral chunk, but now it disappears for some reason because screw logic.\n\nThere's no real difference between planets, every planet pretty much as the same sub-biomes and there's not much difference in monsters per planet either. They're all the same pretty much.\n\nOh and you have to progressively mine now; stone picks to mine copper then use that copper to make copper picks and then mine iron with it, etc. Honestly I really liked this game before the developers decided to start working on a whole new game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eonomega/recommended/211820/","eonomega","Harbin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eonomega/","190 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR: This game is the spiritual successor to the steam hit Terraria, promising a lot but fulfilling very little of its promises.\n\nWhen I started playing this game, I loved it. It was like a 2D minecraft with a lot of possibilities, and an actual progressing "plot", that gave you boss monsters and better armor that gave you cool little bonuses.\n\nYou could modify your characters and while some parts were more boring than others, it was a fun game.\n\nBut this isn't a review for Terraria, so I'll stop there.\n\nStarbound takes a lot of inspiration from Terraria, almost as directly as Terraria takes from Starbound.\n\nHowever, it doesn't follow through on a lot of its concepts. It attempts to make a Skinner box of leveling progression, except there's no real "fulfillment". In Terraria, finding a chest early on was a cool thing, generally significant, and especially significant if you got an item worth using for a good amount of time.\n\nStarbound relegates that strategy to one or two chests, and a "maybe". You're better off scouring the topside of the world and moving on to the next one directly after. You become less of a Starbound Traveler, and more of a Tourist, flicking through snapshots.\n\nThe worlds are lively enough, but there's no soul or character growth behind them.\n\nThe plot is piecemeal and unsatisfying, giant chunks of it are missing, and the chunks that are there are disconnected and uncooperative. In Terraria, the mystery served them well. You didn't know what the corruption was, and it was spreading. You could destroy parts of it, and parts of it would come after you. The eventual path to power gave you more and more interesting paths. It was a magical little experience that sent you from the ends of the world to hell and back.\n\nStarbound splits up the worlds into randomly generated pieces, which end up feeling generic and lacking a lot of the charm as a result of the lack of a common 'goal'.\n\nI would not recommend this game based upon its virtues, because it doesn't overcome its severe weaknesses as a game. As a sandbox simulator, it's fun enough. As a story, it's bad.\n\nThe promised features for the game are not in the game, and that's what honestly brings it down. It's a damn shame, and I think it's a symptom of the "Kickstarter Game".\n\n\n5/10, was fun for a bit, then lost interest when the unfinished nature of the game revealed itself like the pretty tablecloth ripped off to reveal that the table only had one and a half legs, and no actual centerpiece.

Since my last review, which was already months after no updates, there has still been no real updates to the game. Not only that, but they've apparently removed things from the game, such as temperature function, that really detract from the survival aspect. The devs apparently feel the game has been good enough to be considered done for a while already and there's talk that the next update will be the 1.0 release.\nIn that case, I'm going to remove the caveat from my original review and say don't buy this game at all because the game that was promised is now non-existant rather than a long time away.\n[END EDIT]\n\nI had a lot of fun playing this game when I bought it. I stopped playing after my character was wiped. I'm not upset about the wipe, I knew that was coming, I just stopped playing because the devs promised streamlined, weekly updates (their words, not mine) and I wanted to make sure characters would no longer be wiped. 4 months later, there hasn't been a single update of any significance and the devs put out a steady stream of excuses and blame (if they spent half as much time coding as they do making excuses and blaming fans, the game would be done by now).\n\nAny attempt to address the game's shortcomings is met by obnoxious fanboys spouting months old excuses and mods banning you for posting a negative opinion or asking a question.\n\nI liked the game when I bought it, honestly I still kinda do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/recommended/211820/","VultureBike","Ernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/","240 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR Not gonna lie, Starbound has a lot of potential, but the state that it's been in for the past >6 months is disgusting. I know that the company has had a lot of issues and they recently decided to actually have  HQ and they're still settling in or whatever. I also know that Early Access is kind of expected to be an unpolished game, but there have been so few updates it's really upsetting. I can't recommend this game due to the fact that it's just not getting enough done. I am totally willing to change this review whenever they decide to update it (last big update was in February and it's July now)\n\nKeep in mind that this game is in Early Access (for better or for worse) and this review is based on playing time up until July 2, 2014.\n\nStarbound is an open world exploration/adventure/sandbox type game, basically Terraria in space. The appeal to these games, of course, is gathering materials and just basically playing with legos that you never have to clean up. I personally enjoy this. It's a nice break from being super competitive in every other game I play. I mean, there's a pvp type thing in this game in that you can totally kill other players, but it's pretty broken.\n\nThis game surprised me. In Minecraft I was really into redstone and just playing with circuitry and just seeing how much I can automate. While you can't automate as much in Starbound, there's defintely potential to automate more. I rigged up something to automate lighting in my planet so that whenever you enter my base, lights follow you on and turn off when you leave the room. Unfortunately, due to a bug, I have to rewire it every time I boot the game up because wires disappear for no reason. Now, this is to be expected, I mean, this is an Early Access game after all, but it's been an issue since day one and they still haven't fixed it. That alone is certainly a reason why I haven't booted up the game in forever.\n\nCombat is kind of wonky. There's no real way to know what type of enemy you're going to fight. I personally thought that was kind of for the lore because you're traveling to unknown planets so you wouldn't know how threatening anything is on that planet, but I've heard other people say that they really don't like that approach. I personally just tried to avoid fighting because the goal of the game isn't to fight things and they're really easy to avoid. A friend of mind was telling me about how she really doesn't like the fact that armor doesn't really make you super overpowered against mobs even at the highest tier, and sure, I can understand that being an issue. I personally am of the belief that this is the survival aspect of the game and you can't be expected to actually fight everything in the game; that's just impractical for actually surviving. Instead, I picked my battles and only fought when I was out of blocks to bridge over enemies.\n\nResource gathering is pretty normal, just mine out blocks and hope for ores. The more advanced you get in the tier, the easier of a time you'll have finding ores from lower tiers. At the highest tier, you can mine asteroids which are super rich in ores and kind of break the game since you don't have to actually scavenge for resources, but, instead, just head to the nearest asteroid for a half hour and have all the resources you'll need for a while. Something that was kind of off-putting early on was that the basic tools performed better than the fancy matter manipulator item you have. I mean, I totally get specialization of items and how that contributes for better gameplay, but it didn't make sense to me that an item clearly more advanced than a pickaxe or a regular axe is outperformed by both. I mean, you can totally get drills later, and those do way better, but it's still weird that this space traveler is reduced to using what I would think is archaic, uncharacteristic items.\n\nThe drops in this game are kind of weird too. You can totally have a friend take you to a high level planet and just loot surface chests for gear you can use and it'll carry you forever. There's also a chance that you find actual literal trash in the surface chests and then you're kind of upset. Even at high level planets, you have a good chance at finding super bad weapons. It's kind of irritating.\n\nAt least building is pretty easy. I didn't really play Terraria, so it had to be explained to me that you have to actually fill in the background for stuff to not spawn (I thought it was a lighting thing like minecraft). After a bit it all makes sense and it's pretty intuitive - Select a block, press the mouse to put the block, repeat until done. There's also a pretty large variety of blocks and colors of blocks. That's pretty cool, but, in my opinion, the best blocks that can be used for building are generally hard to find and also uncraftable in vanilla. That's pretty upsetting. There are mods that allows you to purchase them with the otherwise pretty worthless pixel currency and that's totally cool.\n\nProgression in the game relies on you to find a certain amount of an ore and or it's additive to make it into a new refined ore to make a new tool thing or armor so that you can progress to the next area. That's totally cool, but it does feel kind of unrewarding. Sure you unlock a bunch of new things to build, but I really don't see a reason to limit a player on what they're able to build based on how far they've progressed like that. I do, however, see the need that some materials need special resources to create. I mean, you have to basically jump through 10 hoops to finally be able to craft everything.\n\nSome issues I personally have with the game are the fact that the pixel currency is virtually worthless; the cosmetics sold by some vendors aren't really appealing and the machine that lets you scan/reprint decorative blocks is cool, but I really wish the mod that allows you to print blocks made it to vanilla. The idea is that it's a super advanced 3d printer anyway, who is to say that it shouldn't allow you to recreate ANYTHING you've previously seen rather than just a handful of things you'll just place around for looks.\n\nChests are also kind of a big deal. They don't really upgrade in capacity. I mean, and I bet you're maybe getting tired of hearing me say this, there is a mod that lets you have higher upgrade capacity in specialized chests, but these types of things, especially considering there's a forced progression, makes me think that there isn't enough thought being put into the game.\n\nI've already mentioned wiring. I don't know the cause of it, but it's always the same combination of 5 wires that I have to reconnect each time. That effectively makes building with wiring in mind irrelevant because it's going to break. It WILL break. Maybe not all of it, but just enough to make you irritated.\n\nFortunately, despite all the bugs, the modding community is excellent. A lot of really cool mods have been added that give existing game mechanics a boost. Starfoundry comes to mind as something exceptional that really increases the game's playability.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. As I've mentioned, I'm totally willing to adjust whenever they're comfortable saying that they're actually gonna release the game in full as they see fit. It's tragic, though, because I really want to like this game. It's got a lot of potential, but just isn't there yet.","July 2, 2014","false","62.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

HOWEVER, i quote what the developers say, "Updates will come thick and fast, though, as we listen to your feedback, push fixes and add new content.”   What updates?... the game is pretty much the same since Dec 4, 13  with a few minor fixes... i cant recall the last huge juicy update.\nWith that being said, once you get to the wierd part of the game which you can call "the end"  you can farm overpowerd weapons easily making everything die in the blink of an eye, then there really isnt much to do in the game after that. To me it feels like taking a nice peacful journey that feels like it couldnt end, then BOOM right as it was getting good, dead end....\nthe game is fun up to that point... but that point is really easy to reach once you get the hang of things, there are also a ton of useless things in the game, useless mechanics, useless weapons and armor, useless ores, they can take that crap out and add more content please.

Tigers everywhere thought she would be the legend among them.\n\nAs she neared adolescence, her outstanding talent showed itself. Were there already fast tigers in the community? Sure, but Stound was faster. Were there tigers who were experts at hunting? Sure, but she brought in more game than anyone else. It became clear that she had potential.\n\nAnd then it happened...\n\nA circus came to her habitat and was swiping up other tigers, but when they saw Stoundbar, they stopped in their tracks. They released the other tigers and took her instead. Off to the circus. The circus... named "♥♥♥♥leChish"\n\nAt ♥♥♥♥leChish, her talent was displayed. Her best qualities; her running, her hunting skills, and others were all showcased for small audiences at first; introductory gigs where people got an exclusive glimpse of Stoundbar's excellence. Other acts, performances; other animals fell in her shadow. All people wanted to see was Stoundbar.\n\nAfter awhile, ♥♥♥♥leChish began a fundraiser to develop Stoundbar's talents even further. Apparently, word of StoundBar's unique talent and glory had spread internationally, so their fundraiser raked in millions. By that time, they had their own place for their increasingly popular shows, but they decided that, with these new funds, a change of location was in order. Over almost the course of a year, they moved to a new location, and excitement for StoundBar waned the longer they took.\n\nWhen they finally moved, however, ♥♥♥♥leChish Circus' popularity died, and with it, Stoundbar's did too.\n\nAnd then came the abuse...\n\nWith Chucklefish--err, I mean.. ♥♥♥♥leChish seeking a desperate revival of Stoundbar's audience and notoriety, they began to beat and batter the last remnants of her brilliance out of her over time. They spent months at a time between shows pumping her with harmful steroids and hormones to try and boost her lore. Enhancements which seemed amazing on the surface were soon revealed to be harmful for her in reality. For about a month after Stoundbar, with her brand-new enhancements, were exposed to the world, her fans returned to the stadium. However, they got bored and stopped attending shows once again.\n\nEventually, ♥♥♥♥leChish fell into a depressing pattern; a downward spiral of desperate enhancements for Stoundbar which slowly began to kill her. The fans, however, rush back temperarily (in increasingly small numbers) and then retreat to other shows in only a matter of weeks.\n\nStoundbar's fur suddenly didn't seem so bright;\nHer talents.. no longer special.\n\nStarbound's era passed prematurely, and for that... all thanks can be given to the poor management of Chucklefish.\n\nI was one of her fans; there from the first show she gave to the massive, cheering crowds.. and now all I can say is.. show's over kids, now it's time to move on to the next great act.\n\nEDIT: 1.0 drops soon, and I will play it. If it's good, I'll change my review, if not, I ain't changin' a thing. Also, to anyone who might be confused by all of my hours in this game, it's because I've had it since the day it came out and I played every update and played a lot with my ex girlfriend and Steam friends. I've had a lot of fun, but I still don't recommend someone buys it now as it was actually more fun when I got it and got 10 runtime errors in that same day than it is now.

Unfortunately you can't buy groceries with potential, and even a broken clock is right twice a day.\n\nThat said, there are some good things about the game.\n\n- Potential. I can't stress enough that this game looks like it COULD be super good once it's finished and it IS still in beta, so you never know.\n\n- Sci-Fi...sort of. You can argue this for sure, but it's nice to see an exploration game that uses at least some space and sci-fi elements instead of the standard gantasy game tropes.\n\n- Addictive gameplay. If you're a fan of Minecraft or Terraria, you know what I'm talking about. In the beginning you could easily lose hours and hours to this game as you explore and build.\n\n- Neat Bosses: All of the bosses I've encountered have been fun and interesting. I won't spoil them for you here, but check out some gameplay footage if you want to see them.\n\nOf course, with there being good stuff, there's always bad stuff to go along with it:\n\n- Update frequency, there isn't any. For a game that was promised to be full of "thick and fast" updates and a constantly growing list of features, there has been extremely little delivered on. At the time of writing I think the last update was six months ago, and the most recent dev blog update is pathetic: A screenshot of a single mob, no context and "I don't feel like writing much right now."\n\n- Stale Progression: One of the things that initially attracted me to this game was the idea that you'd progress through research, learning to build new things through maybe trial and error or exposure...and the game has utterly failed to deliver on that idea. So far all you do is craft a new set of armour, fight the new boss, and then move onto the next section to repeat. There's no quests beyond the starter ones, no story and overall nothing to do except the same thing ad nauseum.\n\n- Uninteresting Worldscapes: When I first loaded into Starbound my loading screen showed a black planet surrounded by tentacles. I COULD NOT WAIT to go find a planet like that and explore the heck out of it. Sure the planets I was on right now were boring, but I could deal...until I found one. I found one of those tentacles...only to discover it was just a reskinned tree. It was chopped down like a tree, fell like a tree, and produced wood like a tree. And unfortunately that's all there is. Each planet is just a reskin of the ones before, with the same landscapes, dungeons and cities. Even the cool enviromental stuff you see at the beginning of the game becomes stale and samey after it's repeated dozens of times.\n\nThere's some pretty ugly stuff that goes on in the forums for this game as well that paint some pretty unflattering pictures of the Dev team and the Mod Team for their forums. I'm not going to get into it here becayse you can easily find accounts of it all over, but this is a Company i have come to mistrust, and that can sink a lot of enthusiasm.\n\nAt this point I doubt Starbound will be released, and if it is, I suspect it will be a shadow of it's own potential. I hope I'm wrong, but wait for release if you MUST give it a try, otherwise I recommend giving Starbound a pass.","August 25, 2014","false","16.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TenaciousTurnip/recommended/211820/","TenaciousTurnip","Boy Ladd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TenaciousTurnip/","338 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTLDR: Don't buy this game, or at least wait for it to be finished first.  Now that the hype has died down, people are starting to see that this is just a suckier version of Terraria.\n\nI wanted Terraria in space.  I needed Terraria in space.  I thought I was paying for Terraria in space...but no...\n\nI like a lot of things about this game.  The art style, the music, the concept, the sense of adventure, but in its entirety, this game falls flat on its face.  When you start out, you'll have a few tutorial quests teaching you how to do things, and you'll cut down trees and make a fire, and then you'll be sent out into the world.  In my first few hours, I found military bases, ancient pyramids, sewer monsters, and all sorts of fun stuff like that.  The frustrating thing was that when I got to these places I usually got killed instantly by the enemies there.\n\nNow, here's the devastating part.  To get armor and weapons, you need to get a bunch of metal bars and pixels.  Pixels are what everything is made of in Starbound, so you'll need them to make everything.  So even though you have a bunch of iron bars, and you want to make an iron chestpiece, you'll still need pixels to do it.  You get pixels by killing monsters, but when you die, you lose two thirds of your pixels.  So you'll need to be very careful, killing monsters one at a time and sleeping or bandaging if you get hurt between fights, which is just waiting and waiting.  And you will get hurt, because monsters in this game move at lightning speed, and they jump thirty feet into the air, so you can't hit them with your bow (Which wouldn't kill a monster at your level in just one full charge anyway), and then they kill you instantly when they get close.  And after a couple of hours of frustration, you finally have that iron chestpiece.  After that, to get the bow, sword, helmet, and pants, rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd here's the best part:  Once you get fully geared up and the monsters aren't a challenge, you move out of the Alpha sector and move onto the Beta sector!  And you get insta-killed by the monsters again!  So start grinding to get that gear!  (If I wanted to grind in a video game, I'd play World of Warcraft, which is mind-numbing in a pleasant way instead of an agonizing one.)\n\nCompared to Terraria, where it was really fun to to progress through the tiers of gear, and fight bosses, and make cool houses (In Starbound, time doesn't pass on a planet when you're not on it, so be prepared to have a farm and all of your chests on your ship), Starbound is too repititive and grindy.  I haven't gone through all of the game's tiers yet, but I've put over fourty hours into it, and I feel like that's enough to give it a fair judgement.  Of these fourty hours, perhaps half of them were spent in either frustration or the mind-numbing sensation of doing the same thing over and over to reach a goal.\n\nI believe that Chuckfish have said they'll change the progression system in the future, but this game is in Beta.  I'm not giving this game a negative review because an ice planet I went to had a warm temperature, or a lava planet was freezing.  I'm not giving this game a negative review because it's a bit laggy for a 2D game with pixel graphics.  I'm not giving this game a negative review because they haven't added in a wide enough variety of food, or guns.  I'm giving this game a negative review because its mechanics seem to be utterly broken, and if it's that way in Beta, I doubt they'll ever be able to fix it.\n\nEdit:  This review is out of date, and I really don't feel like updating it.

I thought the whole idea of Starbound was quite interesting, but I wasn't really playing games that much so it wasn't until recently that I decided to check it out again.\n\nWhen I bought the game, I thought I was going to be getting a close to finished/complete game since it has been "Early Access" for god knows how long now, but that simply wasn't the case.\n\nWhile the gameplay is actually fun, and I was able to sink in a few hours of enjoyment, the game rapidly stagnated for me, which while disappointing, was something I should have known.\n\nI neglected to read the reviews on this game, and now I see that the studio behind this game is incredibly disorganized and inept, especially the lead devs. When I asked on the forums about the lack of updates in nearly 5 months, I was swiftly banned, but I'm not alone it seems, hundreds of others have been banned on the forums regarding inqueries to the games stall in development.\n\nI would not recommend buying this game at this time, the staff doesn't really seem to know what they are doing, the game is unfinished, and while you may have some fun for a bit, the game is not worth the $15 as it stands.\n\nOverall, disappointing with how this whole thing has turned out.","July 15, 2014","false","9.1"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

I expected to interact with npc towns, go one quests, spelunk dungeons, and discover lots of fun stuff before going to another planet and beginning anew.\n\nInstead I got broken promises and months without any content being actually worked on. For a long time most "updates" were simply the developers taking mods the community made and making them "official" and adding one or two cosmetic items that did nothing but look nice.\n\nI understand it is in "early access", but the good people at Chucklefish have yet to actually implement basic features such as the ability to change keybinding or even a button to delete your characters. The devs have also failed to implement any promised features to the game in many months.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TenaciousTurnip/recommended/211820/","TenaciousTurnip","Boy Ladd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TenaciousTurnip/","338 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTLDR: Don't buy this game, or at least wait for it to be finished first.  Now that the hype has died down, people are starting to see that this is just a suckier version of Terraria.\n\nI wanted Terraria in space.  I needed Terraria in space.  I thought I was paying for Terraria in space...but no...\n\nI like a lot of things about this game.  The art style, the music, the concept, the sense of adventure, but in its entirety, this game falls flat on its face.  When you start out, you'll have a few tutorial quests teaching you how to do things, and you'll cut down trees and make a fire, and then you'll be sent out into the world.  In my first few hours, I found military bases, ancient pyramids, sewer monsters, and all sorts of fun stuff like that.  The frustrating thing was that when I got to these places I usually got killed instantly by the enemies there.\n\nNow, here's the devastating part.  To get armor and weapons, you need to get a bunch of metal bars and pixels.  Pixels are what everything is made of in Starbound, so you'll need them to make everything.  So even though you have a bunch of iron bars, and you want to make an iron chestpiece, you'll still need pixels to do it.  You get pixels by killing monsters, but when you die, you lose two thirds of your pixels.  So you'll need to be very careful, killing monsters one at a time and sleeping or bandaging if you get hurt between fights, which is just waiting and waiting.  And you will get hurt, because monsters in this game move at lightning speed, and they jump thirty feet into the air, so you can't hit them with your bow (Which wouldn't kill a monster at your level in just one full charge anyway), and then they kill you instantly when they get close.  And after a couple of hours of frustration, you finally have that iron chestpiece.  After that, to get the bow, sword, helmet, and pants, rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd here's the best part:  Once you get fully geared up and the monsters aren't a challenge, you move out of the Alpha sector and move onto the Beta sector!  And you get insta-killed by the monsters again!  So start grinding to get that gear!  (If I wanted to grind in a video game, I'd play World of Warcraft, which is mind-numbing in a pleasant way instead of an agonizing one.)\n\nCompared to Terraria, where it was really fun to to progress through the tiers of gear, and fight bosses, and make cool houses (In Starbound, time doesn't pass on a planet when you're not on it, so be prepared to have a farm and all of your chests on your ship), Starbound is too repititive and grindy.  I haven't gone through all of the game's tiers yet, but I've put over fourty hours into it, and I feel like that's enough to give it a fair judgement.  Of these fourty hours, perhaps half of them were spent in either frustration or the mind-numbing sensation of doing the same thing over and over to reach a goal.\n\nI believe that Chuckfish have said they'll change the progression system in the future, but this game is in Beta.  I'm not giving this game a negative review because an ice planet I went to had a warm temperature, or a lava planet was freezing.  I'm not giving this game a negative review because it's a bit laggy for a 2D game with pixel graphics.  I'm not giving this game a negative review because they haven't added in a wide enough variety of food, or guns.  I'm giving this game a negative review because its mechanics seem to be utterly broken, and if it's that way in Beta, I doubt they'll ever be able to fix it.\n\nEdit:  This review is out of date, and I really don't feel like updating it.  Sorry.","August 3, 2014","false","48.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

Welp.\n\nNow granted this is early access and all, but several design decisions the devs have made have all but eradicated my faith that they know what they're doing. Tedium is not challenging. Inconvenience is not challenging. If I wanted tedium and inconvenience, i'd volunteer as a civil servant after hacking my limbs off and putting my head on backwards.\n\nThis game also suffers heavily from the curse of procedurally generated content - sure, there's plenty of permutations of biomes and creatures to see in the galaxy, but it still comes across as soulless and dull on top of the fact that once you see the underlying engine behind the generated permutations, it's all just window dressing - and most often not even pretty window dressing at that.\n\nIn addition to this the devs seem to have fallen into the trap of leaning too heavily on the expectations that modders will pick up the slack. Now don't get me wrong, mod support is an awesome thing to have around and extends a game's viability greatly, but hopefully you spotted the problem when I used the phrase "pick up the slack" back there. There shouldn't BE slack in the first place, and there's more slack here than Paris Hilton on a vodka and cocaine bender. The devs really should have focused on moddability after getting the base game into a good shape.\n\nI wanted to have faith that this game would be great and I tried my best to get fun out of it or MAKE it fun (I do have several mods up on Chucklefish's mod archives) but at this point I just feel too burned out on waiting for the devs to get their act together and make a game that's not just a hollow shell of lost promise. It's like Spore all over again.\n\nBarring a miracle turnabout from the devs, avoid this game.","July 24, 2015","false","172.5"," 92 of 159 people (58%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","58","92","159","21","7"

Heard they were going selling a Beta, decided to jump onboard. The Beta claim was a lie, this game in 2013 was a barely started alpha. Where I expected a nearly finished game (As is warrented when playing a BETA) I got a game that was not even close to a finished state. This was clearly an Alpha that I was playing, and ChuckleFish clearly lied about it. But, I liked the concept and I had fun with my friends for a short while, so I was willing to overlook that detail. I would give them the benefit of the doubt. They promissed consistant updates and quick development.\n\nThat was about seven months ago.\n\nI have what is essentially the same alpha that I had when I first purchased this game.

Starbound, NOTHING.\n\nTop this all off with creepy amount of censorship that ChuckleFish has on its forums and Reddit and its easy to see why there are so many negative reviews of this game.

One of the biggest disappointments in my entire Steam library (and believe me, I own lots of disappointing games).\n\nStarbound doubtlessly has tons of potential and I was overwhelmed with joy when I heard of what game Starbound's supposed to be. Sadly it's been in the first of three Beta phases forever now and obviously this won't be changing anytime soon.\n\nMost main features are still missing and the game is buggy as hell. Of course it's still a Beta, but updates - which usually keep players from giving up on Betas - happen far too slow (or not at all). I'm quite sure that Half Life 3 will be in stores before Starbound reaches the end of its Beta phase(s).\nIf you're expecting something like "Terraria in space", forget it, because currently this game lacks basically everything which made Terraria fun to play. While looking pretty similar on the outside and concerning several game mechanics, Starbound has less depth and less need for exploring (despite its huge universe).\nAnd while people are waiting for necessary updates on things like NPCs, severe bugs or other content of major importance, developers rather enjoy adding some cosmetic bullsh*t or stuff that is absolutely not important right now.\n\nWARNING!

They just wanted to give us a horrible game for a price that is higher than actual good games. If you really want a good game go buy Binding of Isaac, or better yet wait for rebirth.

This is not the case; the developers’ website is full of deceit, falsified updates and broken promises of updates and ideas. You have been warned, this game is no longer in development - and don’t go believing the lies about unstable 'nightly' updates. This game has lost focus and the developer has moved on to their new Kick Starter campaigns and new game ideas.\n\nPutting all this aside, the game is average; it lacks much of the character and charm of Terraria - the game it attempts to copy. Rather than a focus on developing and exploring a random world, the game focuses on a repetitive grind consisting of warp to planet, see if anything good, warp to next planet, repeat. There is no sense of achievement, and the tirelessly repeated 'dungeons' can be overcome with simple block placements around enemies. There is no feeling of adventure and there is no reason to 'dig' deep into any planets, the easiest way to get rare ores is to just run over the surface and then move onto the next planet.\n\nIf the developer actually puts some effort into this game they might be able to salvage it, but I implore you to take some time to look over the comments, reviews and forums; you'll notice that the developer has taken the money and run. Please don't support this money grabbing developer, wait for games to be fully developed before handing over your hard earned cash – no matter how small the amount - if the industry keeps going down this route it's going to be bad for all of us.","August 7, 2014","false","54.7"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

The sprites are very detailed and their animations quite fluid. The environments are all unique and visually distinct from each other, the monsters all look different and weird (as far as I understand it, they're created by mixing various different sprites and messing with their colors, so you'll always find new weird creatures to kill) and you can build some really good looking structures because there are tons and tons of furniture that all look really good. The music is not bad either.\n\nBut here's the thing: it all looks different, but it plays the same. You'll meet a thousand different looking monsters, but they don't change much. They can fly, walk, be passive, aggresive and that's it. The environments looks distinct, but apart from some instances where the game messes with the gravity or the temperature, they're all the same.\n\nMy first hour playing Starbound and my fortieth were basically exactly the same. Starbound changes its visuals, but the mechanics never reflect that; you'll always be doing the same thing: mining, maybe chopping up trees, maybe building another house if you're bored. You'll be grinding (mining different minerals) so you can defeat the lackluster bosses so you can mine some more. The name of the minerals will change after that.

It's a good game, it just has a lot of growing pains and i wish I could say "wait til it develops more" instead of just "Yes or no". Anyway... there's a lot to like and dislike about Starbound. I won't drone on and on about it though, and try to sum it up.\n\nIt's got a good style, good polish, tons and tons of items, content, enemies, the map and word system generates procedurally and with a surprising amount of interest. There's quests and ship progression, item and skill upgrades... there's no shortage of content in the beginning. However, once you're through with the quests, have a big ship, and are free to explore the universe, it kind of... falls flat at the moment. I feel there should be, at some point, either more interesting quests, bosses, things to find and explore at the end game. Before the questing, this was more free-form and fun, experimenting and discovering. Now with quests it's a bit too restricted, but.. if they want to go that way, fine, just develop them more. The other part is the ship, making no reason to build on planets. While I like the ship upgrades and progression, I think it goes a bit too far and too much, as one other review said; you can put everything in your ship, so what's the point of building on planets?\n\nThe progression is alright, except I personally found the bosses to be INSANELY difficult solo. When you die, too, you re-navigate the entire level. Extremely frustrating and annoying... but customization is extremely high, music and visuals, polish and controls, all very high.

Developers are no longer required or even promoted to release quality products, or even release products early and update them, instead, they get away with releasing a half-finished product as a a 'beta' or an 'alpha' and never do much else on it. Not too long ago Starbound had all good recommendations, and was expected  to be "terraria in space", but by not doing much other than reproducing the same game, Starbound quickly becomes boring and tiresome, with the elements they DO add in are often only further adding to a grind like experince that is unpolished and unpleasant. This isn't a terrible game and if it's on a great sale maybe you should consider it, but I didn't enjoy Starbound as much as I thought I would and would probably wait until it is more polished, which may, sadly, be a number of months or years, which is another reason to avoid this game.","July 21, 2014","false","6.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

What I can say is good is that you have several difference races you can be, you never have to exit to the main menu to go to a new map, since new maps are planets you can travel to ingame, and the game is very simple to mod, much easier then say, modding Minecraft.\n\nThat said, your choice in race almost doesn't matter, as they all play the same, looting items from planets can be a hassel, more so if the planet you went to doesn't have any on the surface, and having recolors of the same building materials gets kind of boring to dig up and toss away. On note of building materials, pre-made structures are few and far between the planets, with no way to find out what a planet has except to land on it, which is horrible when you're ready to advance to the next stage of planets as it costs you fuel resources each time you travel between planets and solar systems. Monsters are varied, but they fall into the same boat as picking your race, as they all tend to use the same basic monster scripts: land-based monsters just simply charge you, sometimes unleashing a rare elemental attack to change things up, while the aerial-based monsters usually shoot a stream of elemental energy at you, like bubbles or lava.\n\nAnother issue that rises up from the building material is actually digging up stuff, as the starting matter manipulator digs up blocks in a 2x2 pattern, while the pickaxes and drills do a 3x3 pattern. However, when building structures like houses and you screw up, you end up digging up more then you wanted to, making you take longer in building your planned designs, be they homes to live in, or dungeons for your friends to challenge.\n\nDungeons is another issue with the game, as with not knowing what will be on a planet before you get down to it, you are not guaranteed to even encounter a dungeon on every planet, and some dungeons shouldn't even be classified as such, like the prisons the humans and florans have. Also, All the dunegons currently implimented, with exception to the Apex challenge dungeons that act like obstecle courses, almost always have nothing to loot within, and even sometimes the Apex challenge dungeons don't have anything either (although you usually find a tech chip at the end of those).\n\nTech chips are few and far between, and it becomes frustrating when you run into the same chips over and over while looking for newer ones to expand your options with. The only reliable weapons in the game are the ones you make with the end game metals, as the randomly generated weapons found on planets are very rare to come across, and perchaseable weapons from the rare NPC's you find on settled planets are no better then what you can craft.\n\nAll in all, Starbound needs to be updated. Badly. Like, developers, if you actually read these reviews, take this one to heart and get back to work on it! You mention giving players choice on how they want to play the game, but in its current state, there are no real choices.","July 25, 2014","false","270.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","3"

There hasn't been anything exciting to pull me back in. After I lost my first charecter to an update, I started anew hoping that there would be more to the game than: mine ore then move to next planet. But I found myself doing just that and it grew stale. Once the quest update came around while I wasn't excited I had hoped it might make the game more interesting. Unfortunatly the quests feel boring and fairly pointless. After a long while of waiting the exciting update I have waited for still hasn't shown up, and it makes me sad because I feel like this game is missing out on being great.\n\nThe only other game I can compare this to is Terraria which was recently updated to 1.3. I thought I had played enough terraria but then the update was big, exciting, had tons of new of cool things to do, more interesting things to learn/discover and an epic end boss. This game just doesn't come close to Terraria and until a worthwhile update comes out it never will. I have 197 hours on terraria and want to play even more.

They just kept the unfinished game there for what should be around 2 years now, releasing an upgrade once every 8 months or so just to claim that they're not abandoning the game (wich, believe me, they ARE) and that's it.\nThis game had such potential, but all wasted. At this rhythm, the game gets 5-10% better every 8 months... and it still has A LOT to do before it can be labeled as a complete game.\nThey keep changing the already existant stuff instead of implementing the stuff missing in the game to finish and release it already, and change existant stuff with further patches if needed.

So I bought this game based entirely on the fact that, "everyone else is doing it so it must be good."  I know, dad always said just because everyone else is jumping off a cliff doesn't mean I have to do it too....... But sometimes it's fun to jump off the cliff with everyone else.  With that known, this review will be from a non-Minecraft/Terraria fan and what my impressions are.\n\nMy first game play into Starbound was solo.  After all, I didn't want to look like a complete n00b when I start playing with friends.  I think I was expecting some sort of 2D Minecraft, to which I wasn't let down in that aspect.  There was mining, crafting, building your home/base all those things that make Minecraft interesting.  Then I see one of those cute little aliens and I'm like, "oh cool, hopefully it won't attack me at a snail’s pace like the monsters in Minecraft.........ohh, oohh.. WTF it's spraying some sort of fire barf all over me and jumping at me.  Good gods get it off... I'm dead."  It would take me another few fights similar to that to get the hang of the combat system which thankfully is much more active than Minecrafts.  Being one who likes challenging game play, (my favorite game series is Monster Hunter after all,) this was the first thing in Starbound that made me want to play more.  Hanging out more in the game, discovering that different mobs do have different attacks and there are boss monsters, I've not been let down in this area.\n\nAfter reading a bit online about how to get a good start, (if you’re a game player that likes to be lead by the nose to everything you need to do in a game then you may not enjoy this game as much...) I felt I was ready for multi-player.  A friend of mine asked if I'd like to join him and off we went.  After playing a bit I've seen that multiplayer is certainly where it’s at in this game.  Don’t' get me wrong, solo was fun but there's just something about teaming up and traveling to other planets, building fancy bases, exploring random dungeons, it's all much more fun when you've got a friend to hang out with.  Throw in some Skype so you can hear each other panic as some monster from hell rips though your group and your set for some very fun times.\n\nOverall I enjoy the game a lot.  Even in early access there's a ton of content and things to do and well worth the money spent to buy it.  I eagerly look forward to what the future holds for this game.\n\nPros:\nMinecraft style gathering, building, and crafting\nHundreds of sandbox worlds in one game\nChallenging monster and boss fights\nTons of content in terms of places to explore, an entire universe full of planets\nEach planet has a different feel to it\nSurvival feels like survival since you actually have to eat and watch that you don't get too cold\nMultiplayer is tons of fun\nReplay value is super high\nGreat music\nShould only get better with age\n\nCons:\nVery little guidance.  You will need out of game resources to figure out the game entirely\nSome monster fights can feel repetitive as they have similar combat modes\nPlanets can start to feel similar in terms of graphics\nDifferent races seem to be only cosmetically different at the moment\n2D pixel graphics may turn some off\nStill in beta/early access so there are some crashes, glitches (tee hee) and maximization things that happen\n\nPlease note that many of the cons are things that will/may go away or be changed as the game leaves beta and gets more fleshed out.  Overall though the game is already well worth the listed price of $14.99us and if it's a game style you think you'd enjoy it will be money well spent.\n","February 11, 2014","true","44.7"," 81 of 141 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","81","141","0","5"

They have a bad habit of banning anyone who trys to offer constructive criticism on their main forums and steam forums so it doesnt seem like its going to get any better. They also stopped doing playable somewhat monthly updates updates in favor of nightlys which the developers themselves stated were not for people to play on.

Don't be fooled by my listed hours of disinterestedly trying to get my money's worth, I regret the purchase still.\n\nStarbound is, by developer admission, molded in the likes of Minecraft and Terraria. However, Minecraft is all about the vast world where you can create whatever you want. Terraria more focuses on allowing the player to create a home worth defending and then sending challenging and enjoyable enemies after it to be fought with a smooth and complex combat system... Starbound seems to be about the developers showing off.\n\nStarbound promises so much and delivers so little. The enemies are supposed to be endlessly varied, but they're all mishmashes of a few parts with ridiculous colors and functionally identical programming. There are different races, each with their own background and collectible bonus text; but nothing can ever come from any of it, and the limits of what it means for you the player is the occasional bit of racism from NPCs. The supposed vast galaxy of more complexly generated planets feels very small nonetheless: every planet of the same biome is basically the same but with everything palette swapped. Planets have hidden sub biomes which are supposed to be treats to find, but you can't make anything useful from the supplies of just one and looking for more is incredibly tedious. There is a massive variety of items, but a sparse handful of purposes between them... and an absolutely HORRIBLE inventory system to manage them. NPCs have really nice villages and dungeons... TOO nice, it feels rather futile to try and build your own stuff when the NPCs are handed vast structures of perfectly coordinated furniture with 20 different kinds of blending blocks and a massive variety of decorations. There are powerful bosses and minibosses, but generally 'powerful' just means with all the stats jacked up rather than cleverness, since basically all of them can be foiled by making a tiny shelter of dirt blocks. There are vast dungeons to explore, but they seem to have an alarming tendency to contain absolutely nothing worthwhile. The game pretty much fails at EVERYTHING it does.\n\nAside from merely not having actual content of merit, the engine where all the effort seems to have gone has problems too. The ability to explore different planets is mostly just a nuisance... since you HAVE to go to different planets and flying is slow and tedious. Gathering fuel is a pain and does very little to enrich the experience as well. Though able to run much more complex games well, I found there are severe lag issues as well. My absolute least favorite aspect of the experience is the fact that when trying to explore planets I repeatedly run into enormous squares of nothing that I have to wait several flow breaking seconds to see load.\n\nBut more than anything I take issue with that idea of blurring the line between developer and player. Because you can't, for one very important reason. The developer is the one getting paid, and the player is the one who lost money. If Starbound was free, I'd be much kinder to it. It's bright and entrancing for the first few minutes, and there ARE some good mods. However, virtually nothing about this game is something I want to encourage or support.\n\nWere I to describe Starbound in one word, it would be this: Unfulfilling. It is a miserably unfulfilling, unimmersive mess of a game that feels like it does not need nor want players.","June 15, 2014","false","186.4"," 32 of 51 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","32","51","0","2"

This was due to the arbitrary imbalance of the Novakid class compared to the other classes in the game, and the short longevity of the game's linear tier system.\n\nRight now, it hits the right spots for a good 2D adventure game. With the new release, Glad Giraffe, All two-handed weapons, including ranged guns e.g. the Novakid have now been given a unique ability with their racial weapons e.g. Piercing Shot. With my new playthrough as the Novakid, I blasted through hordes of enemies with ease, and it's a lot of fun! The Novakid genuinely feel like they have presence with other races.\n\nThere are also new enemy types, elemental attacks, and some cool two handed weapon abilities such as dashing with blaze of trails, sticky bombs, and spin attacks! The new combat system allows all races to use all kinds of tactical strategies as to how they can tackle combat.\n\nThere are also new 'Challenge Gates', which I really like their idea of making these stages about pure challenge. I wish I can create my own challenges, as this will make in-game building much more satisfying and less frivolous.\n\nChucklefish have certainly stepped up their game, but I'd say this is nowhere near great nor amazing.\n\nWith over 2 years in development, there are some problems that need to be addressed and fixed.\nTo name a few, they are:\nStarbound needs to optimise robustness:\nFor example, My first Novakid character was deleted when I closed my game several times while it's loading.  This means that the save files load properly while the loading screen plays.  I had to start with a  new Novakid character  and in Multiplayer have I got my items through cheating. I also get excessive FPS drops when entering the Outpost, especially in multiplayer, where the game kicks me out of the multiplayer server. The game does run fairly smoothly on fullscreen, however.  As some of the comments have suggested, this may have to do with Starbound not being able to run the game in 32-bit as smoothly as it would in 64-bit.\n\nThe game lore is lacking:\nThis would be an amazing game if it were to have a cohesive story with all races. For example, Why are the Novakid not well known? This is probably where gas planets may come into play, but if all races had a story behind them, the game wouldn't just be a survival game, but there's a narrative within each race that can potentially keep replayability to a very high standard.\n\nStarbound could improve its linear tier system even further.\nThe game is a blast to playthrough across all tiers! However, when you reach tier 6, I feel that that    it's already the end of the road for my character's development. When I reached tier 6 with the Novakid and defeated the 'final' boss, Of course, this game is at an early access stage, but I'd really like to see at least a form of satisfying ending when I finish the game. Also, the game feels sluggish when you play it again with a new, second character after reaching tier 6 with your first character.\nIn conclusion, Chucklefish have done a good job of making Starbound a good game again. With the new combat system, new enemies, and new challenges, the game certainly feels less monotonous. However, due to its early access stage, you might expect that your characters will be deleted and become corrupted. so  backing up your characters just in case is important  to ensure gameplay flows smoothly. Gameplay and storyline needs to be developed even further in order to make replayability reach high standards. This is a good game, but not a great nor amazing one as of yet.\n\nKeep up the good work, Chucklefish!","December 13, 2015","true","176.1"," 47 of 79 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","47","79","0","4"

All these positives are fleeting. It won't be long until you've completed all the actual content; obtaining the endgame armors, beating all the bosses and sampling each type of planet, which gets old very fast, given that each planet has copy pasted dungeons you'll be sick of seeing.

It's pretty nice, definitely worth the pre-release price I've paid.\n\nStarbound is a breath of fresh air in the 2D sandbox genre, of which there aren't many successful titles. Terraria is perhaps one, but not one I'm particularly satisfied with. Terraria feels undeveloped, wanting, and repetitive. Starbound shares some qualities, but branches out in a unique way that is invigorating for those of us who might enjoy it.\n\nStarbound is not a pure sandbox, where you are left to your devices in a single worldspace. Starbound possesses a basic narrative, that you can pursue at your directive, with some sparse side quests for enjoyment. You travel to other worlds, where - gasp - there are other people! NPCs can occur, some of which may not kill you on sight. Some you can trade with, others are atmospheric. Biomes have variety, monsters have variety. I'm not sure how many max tier playthroughs it'll last you until your bored, but I think for someone who's serious about the genre - it should last you at least 60-80 hours worth, as I'm not serious about it and that's what I'm clocking at.\n\nSo, $15 for 60-80 hours of gameplay? Seems fair. That's not even including multiplayer.\n\nEquipment is also a new take in the right direction. You have TWO HANDS. What does this mean? Well, I feel this game actually takes an account for different playstyles. You can use two one-handed objects at once, making dual-wielding items, keeping a weapon and a utility object handy, two-handed weapons, two-handed tools, and all sorts of situations possible. There are also body upgrades, a basic armor system with cosmetic slots, a dye and sign creation system, upgradable ships, one and two handed guns, and many different biomes. You also have a pet, that you can play with, which my lady found very amusing.\n\nYou also have your computer, which can handle tech upgrades and something called 3D printing. Essentially, any non-crafting based item can be deconstructed, then recreated using money. This is good for builds, as most of the 3D printing produces furniture. You can also find a guitar, where you can play music, and download mods to give you even more to play with. There is a hub that is unlocked that you get easy access to, and where your 'main quest' sequence is generated. I haven't finished it yet, but it keeps some appeal by tempting you with a mysterious gate in an ancient ruin out in space. The main quests are in isolated areas where you can't build, but you get a challenging combat, with a distinguished boss that may or may not have a gimick used to kill it. Very reminiscent of old Zelda or SNES titles. There are also SO MANY DIFFERENT WORLDS in a single save, that it's unreal.\n\nGameplay is solid. I've only ever crashed in its earliest versions, attempting to run different modes for testing purposes. Standard modes run rather well. One patch I had to use OpenGL, but - that lasted a week I think. The community and the creators are determined; I was worried at the start, feeling they weren't cranking out content. Though, they've proven those concerns wrong, developing core mechanics and pushing the game to a more polished state.\n\nSome issues? Hitboxes aren't perfect. Some creatures have their heads slightly out of hitbox because they're elongated, and you can't wammy them. Creatures don't have critical hit regions, but I think players do - so there's that for PvP. I haven't tested multiplayer extensively, but I know it works. Descending down through platforms can get tricky since you can't drop through them, and you jump so high. I created a character for my girlfriend, and apparently, I share the same universe as her, as the homeworld her different race, new character has was my homeworld - complete with my base and chests. She has different bookmarks though, so I set her up with an unused planet in the system that she could farm and start off in. Tiers might get repetitive later on, but - playing this game casually solo has still been keeping me interested, at the very least having finished the Titanium tier. The most serious drawback? They update this game very slowly. But, the updates bring solid content, they produce other titles, and they're a new company. Maybe they'll learn from it, maybe not.\n\nTo compliment all of this, the modding community looks like it'll really take off. The developers are really supporting them, and giving them spotlight. I anticipate with the modding community the game has, it'll be great to see in the future if the game finishes early access - or stops updating. Also, whoever the audio artist is, he's a godsend. The game's music is fantastic, and the art - yes pixel-art is art - is pretty impressive. Very clean, with good animation and articulation. Solid character customization too with aesthetic things to find and wear in your cosmetic slots!\n\nMy personal feelings on the game?\nFor $15 USD: 7/10, pretty impressive, and I write this with no plans for improvement. Great additon to the visually basic, but functionally deep Sandbox / RPG genre.","July 21, 2015","true","81.4"," 74 of 129 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","74","129","6","12"

They have problems. Look at this list here:\nhttp://pastebin.com/jAWKJnHy\n\nThe developers are unable to take any criticism and the fans of the game are rude and sadly hateful preventing any constructive feedback from getting to them. At this point I can only strongly urge people to stay away from this game as it has the potential to be another Towns. I maybe mistaken, it could in a few years turn out to be a great game. As is? Not worth your time or money, and that is the bottom line.\n\nAs a note: It remains such a heavily played game on Steams watch list because the developers haven't fixed a "bug" where the launcher stays open or sometimes the exe even when you close the game. Shady when this has been reported to them numerous times since this alpha released in December.\n\nEdit: It has been a a bit now since I wrote this review and thought I might expand on it a little now that they have released a nightly build feel I should expand on the gameplay itself some. I didn't touch on it in my first part but focused on the larger problems, and plan to correct that now.\n\nAt the core, the game itself is at present a stripped down Terraria. It may generate planets, but all these are is procedurally generated worlds just like Terraria. Only, rather then most of all biomes in one world they have maybe two biomes per world. Other then that worlds are bland and fairly uninteresting. There maybe generated villages but all these are good for is grabbing decorative items.\n\nNext on the list is combat. The combat is, even in the new nightly, clunky. A borrowed shield mechanic from Secrets of Grindia doesn't really help matters much. The monsters are all spazy with little variations despite the procedural generation nature of them. Also healing becomes an issue the higher in tier you go.\n\nExploration, or.. why Terraria blows this out of the water. Every item in Terraria has a use that you find early on. Every biome has reasons to visit it. Every npc has a reason for being besides background fluff. The major difference between them is you feel rewarded for exploring in Terraria. Starbound throws out tons of things at you but none of it feels as exciting as when you get a hook item or magic mirror in Terraria, because these things have a use. They have meaning that makes exploration worthwhile.\n\nNow when it comes to fluff the game itself has some serious issues with bloat, lack of direction, and speed of development. The pokemon like mechanic is somewhat of an interesting idea but is half implemented and not done well. The expanding ships are not customizable, the various biomes are pallet swaps. The list goes on of fluff, while core things like selling items and various other necessary mechanics have at the time of this writing been left to gather dust. The whole "story in a sandbox" is a big selling point, and there is no story almost to be found!\n\nGiven how slowly the team works as the game has not changed hardly at all in seven months.. we are left with many things unfinished while they work on silly side items rather then the main progression path.\n\nThe game has spent three years now in development, and does not show it at all. It still remains not worth your 15. Also as of this spring chucklefish stopped allowing refunds, despite the assurance they always would. Further shady dealings with a team that has made millions and is hardly making any progress at all.\n\nEdit2: The 2014 very end of the year winter update of restriction.\nI'm only going to touch on this shortly for now. The developers have finally put in the framework for quests/missions. Ones however, that bring you out of the sandbox. Only as a way to restrict your progression for the most part as well. You are now metaphorically bound to a hubworld as they are along with most things of importance now set outside the sandbox, where you will find tech that allows you to explore planets after doing a bunch of run around more or less. Also they have removed several features such as temperature and hunger at the time of this writing. Main progression path still doesn't have as much done as should be after a years worth of effort without any sort of effective communication from them on steam.\n\nThe game is becoming a non-sandbox restricted game with block building tacked on and features being moved to post release, later, or culled all together. I believe this will be my final update to the review until the full release. I still cannot in good faith recommend this game. Not because it is incomplete but how it is being handled and where it seems to be going along with the scant little still in it. The developers spent almost a year not listening to feedback while also not even managing to put in content that modders did in weeks after the beta dropped. The final result of it all is a less open exploration, chore to play "game", then what was there months ago.\n\nIf this is the future of Starbound, it looks bleak.","May 9, 2014","false","25.7"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","4"

There is no fun in exploration after first 5 hours of gameplay, everything feels the same and lacks challenge.\nThe game does have great visuals, exploration soundtrack and ambient sounds, creating a very cozy atmosphere on pretty much every planet you set your foot on, and building is much better than in Minecraft/Terraria, but it's not enough to keep you playing for long, even with friends.\nKeep in mind that updates pretty much stopped after the developers got on Steam, and one of them up and left without saying a word, while others keep crying on their twitters how no one likes the game they're making and how everyone with a little bit of critique is a jerk and troll.

Allow me to be blunt here - that's an utter, absolute lie.\n\nI'll elaborate. As an Early Access product, Starbound was released in a very basic, unfinished state and while that was to be expected, Chucklefish seemingly lost any and all motivation they had to actually work on this game as their first couple of paychecks came in. Thanks to a Kickstarter-esque early backing scheme plus getting their game on Steam, they made a very decent amount of money quite early on and then grew lazy on their laurels. Once they'd released a handful of post-launch hotfixes, Chucklefish redirected all their attention to idling about on their official forum, subreddit and Twitter accounts, to taking a long vacation and moving their office across the world and even getting a puppy for it so it doesn't look quite as empty, but the actual work they did on their game was lackluster in anything except for controversy. Updates never came thick and fast; they were largely cosmetic and took ages to be released. The last update was rolled out approximately three months ago and the Starbound team does a great job at consistently ignoring community feedback (unless passing off modders' content as their own counts).\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Starbound is a trainwreck of a game and Chucklefish is a bunch of borderline fraudulent people. Don't spend any money on this game until - if - they get their act straightened out and actually start doing their jobs instead of spending their money.\n\nUpdate: This image nicely displays how Starbound's "development" process has been coming along. Do note that while it has yet to be updated to reflect blog posts and what-not made during the months of July and August as of this review's update, there's been no game updates whatsoever in that period of time.\n\nhttp://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140704032751/nochuckles/images/1/15/Calendar.png","June 29, 2014","false","213.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Since then, he's been responsible for a quite successful faux-Kickstarter that landed him $4M for the purposes of "speeding up beta," signed on with Steam for an additional estimated $15M, moved the majority of his team to an incredibly expensive-to-live-in city (minus Bartwerf, one of his more talented programmers), and failed to deliver much beyond a tech demo for an entire universe of promises and assurances. Having failed to meet the 2013 deadline and with 2015 rapidly approaching, it seems that the "1.0" sticker will be applied to this game in order to avoid dishing out the refunds that so many Early Access supporters have been clamoring for since they realized that they were only inflating the massive ego of the sprite artist that nearly sank Terraria before it even left port by stealing Final Fantasy V sprites for Redigit to use. If you liked Terraria, you're in good company. Tiy loved it so much, he ripped it off himself."\n\nNow for Part 2. The new stuff.\n\nThe new stuff was a welcome change... until I reached the outpost.

Sectors have been replaced with nanosuits (Which you have to swap out EVERY TIME you want to visit a planet) that allow you to access planets with certain environmental hazards, such as heat, cold, or radiation. The endgame armor progression has been replaced with two tiers of what, by any other name, would still be class-based equipment. Oh boy, more of the same thing that pretty much every other game has done. You know what else features branching classes after a certain point in the game? Terraria.\n\nOn a positive note, music is pretty cool.\n\nIt's still Terraria in space, but now it has errand-boy quests.

The best thing about it was that it was a sandbox exploration game with no plot - you  had no purpose, and damnit it was beautiful. You could make new characters and just cut do the basic intro and you could be outa the starting planet in a few minutes, ready to explore. Each planetary system could have planets of all dificulties and types, to explore at your leisure.\n\nIt was a simpler time...\nIt was a better time...\n\n...And then  The fire nation attacked  Starbound updated. With every new character requiring you to dig to the center of the planet before you may leave, starting new games is tedious. On top of that, you can not go to harder planets untill you complete a series on bossfights and quests, which you must complete in order to progress father into the system as well as upgrade your spaceship. These are mandatory, and they are always the same for every character. so there after you complete them once it is no longer a new and random experience, and is now a tedious time sucking part of the game that you must do for every new character.\n\nDo not get me wrong the game is good, it has many new items and enemies and yes once you do all the quests you have freedom, but now the systems are labeled, you know what kinds of planets to expect, no more just spending 200 fuel in the name of science. If there was an option to be able to skip the whole questline with starting characters (perhaps after beating it 100%) then I could recomend the game, but as it stands now, you might be tempted to play an earlier version.","August 20, 2015","false","650.5"," 129 of 231 people (56%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","56","129","231","19","16"

This game alone, mainly due to Chucklefish's shortcomings as a developer, has turned me off of "Early Access" as a whole.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bladecookie/recommended/211820/","bladecookie","Bradstion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bladecookie/","369 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLoaded with awkward 'features' that make gameplay unbearable such as the stale, randomly generated enemies that all manage to feel and act about the same way have ruined this experience. Speaking from playing this game and watching its development from its early days up until now, I can tell you that the more finished this game gets, the more vile it becomes. Possibly because the charm has all worn off, or maybe because the development team keeps making the -dumbest- decisions. Now, I don't really know the dev team so I don't know what their vision is, but trying to patch up this game by having forced mission sequences when the core of the game is about exploration, building, and player-driven advancement is more than a little wrong. Instead of finding new, awesome, and cool things on planets, you find that every single place you go to is exactly the same with a different coat of paint. It's the same -everywhere-. The hazards feel like background noise, the enemies all look and feel the same, the combat is dull, and no matter what you do or what you run into, it's always -disappointing- in the end. That's what this game is summed up in one word: Disappointment.\n\nHow a game that started out with such crass graphics and such a small development team as Terraria could far surpass this particular endeavour in every way, that started with a -modest- goal, and as more or less a 2D minecraft clone is beyond baffling. Terraria doesn't boast multiple worlds, and the only thing that's randomly generated is the terrain, but I'd still rather waste my time in the world of Terraria than this game. Why? Because when you explore you find things that -matter-. It feels like you're in control. Everything -- even building -- has a point to it. So basically, Starbound managed to completely ruin itself by being the exact opposite of Terraria. You're not in control of anything, everything is pointed out to you, exploration renders nothing satisfying, and there's so much randomly generated content that it all blends together into one static mess.\n\nUnderstandably, this game is early access which means that the developers are constantly working on fixing it, and at some point in the future, say, maybe 2020, they might have all of the bugs and quirks in this game fixed, but until then, it's not going to be fun for anyone.\n\nIf you like disappointment, this is the game for you. Otherwise, just leave it alone, buy and/or play Terraria, and save yourself the grief.\n\nPost August '15 Update Edit: This review might've been written with more venom than what was intended, but I stick to my guns on this: You're better off playing Terraria or Minecraft. The update I've noticed has added a lot of features that seemed interesting, but ended up, again, not adding much to the actual meat of the game. You can dress a mess up however you want and even throw some neon lights on there to attract the rave kids, but at the end of the day, it's still a mess.","August 3, 2015","false","89.6"," 112 of 200 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","112","200","4","2"

The developers of this game, Chucklefish, got 4 million dollars in half pre orders, half kickstarter PLUS an early access which did 1 million sales initially at $14.99 a pop and 3 years 5 months from start of development to now and this game is STILL in alpha. This is scandalous. This is litigious. Because they weren't short on time or money and let's face it, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing procedurally generated 2-D sidescroller. They haven't worked on anything but minor bug fixes and superfluous mechanics and artwork for a long, long time. The topping is this game is far from complete.\n\nThis unfinished game which currently has incredibly dull gameplay, shows no sign of completion any time soon. And at the end of the day, even if it is finished it's probably going to feel as the game it is now. Dull, dry, monotonous. The height of tedium, from building to combat to mining to questing. Every facet of this game is incredibly droll and boring, and I will go into further detail in the actual review segment.\n\nBottom line:\n$4,000,000 in pre orders. According to SteamSpy, there are roughly 1,891,483 owners of Starbound. Assuming Steam takes a 30% cut, then approximately $19,000,000 in profit.\nSo in 3 years, 6 months and profits of 23 MILLION DOLLARS can not get this game complete.\n\nHouses in the Bahamas, off shore bank accounts. Which would be perfectly fine if the developers were competent game makers and made a polished, complete product in a reasonable timeframe. They are not and they did not.\n\nThis company is either incompetent or conmen. I'd seriously advise against buying this product and view every game this company develops in the future with avid skeptism.\n\nReview:\nStarbound is an open ended galactic themed 2D sandbox game heavily based off the very successful Terraria. But this is also a sad tale of disappointment that profits off the good intentions of the consumer supporting the underdog indie developer.\n\nYou start the game with a tool that allows you to mine at a very slow pace. This device can be upgraded, but only by use of rare loot based drops. And with each upgrade you need more of this rare item. The game excruciating hands out mining progression, which is a running theme.\n\nThis is one of those games where building absolutely does not matter... That's it. Building any structures is pointless. I would argue this would be a game of creativity, but you have to unlock schematics in order to get access of cosmetic objects, and these are unlocked at an excruciatingly slow rate.\n\nThe combat is dry. Quite simply because this is not a survival game. At a time you will have three mobs on the screen, half of which will not be hostile and winning is based more on the tier of your equipment than any meaningful combat decision making.\n\nQuest Progression In It's Entirety:\n\nMine tier 1 ore -> Make tier 1 equipment -> Complete tier 1 quest -> Mine tier 2 ore -> Make tier 2 equipment -> Complete tier 2 quest -> Mine tier 3 ore -> Make tier 3 equipment -> Complete tier 3 quest -> Mine tier 4 ore -> Make tier 4 equipment -> Complete tier 4 quest -> Mine tier 5 ore -> Make tier 5 equipment -> Complete tier 5 quest....\n\n(This is literally what the quest system is. Developer has nothing but contempt for audience.)\n\nI can't wait for them to finish this game so I can ♥♥♥♥ing do the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing again and again and again with absolutely no excitement. Then I can just ♥♥♥♥ing kill myself.\n\nAnd what are the main quests? Mostly a dull gauntlet run to a boss which. Don't be fooled, that makes it sound better than it is. It's wandering through a multiple path procedurally generated environment filled with enemies which more often than not becomes a battle of attrition due to the fact you're just wandering the same rooms which no sense of direction coupled with how you start to inadvertently soak damage because of how dry and monotonous it is. To be fair, the bosses themselves can be moderately challenging as they have patterns that must be adapted to but they are still ♥♥♥♥ easy. If you die the first time you'll win the second.\n\nWhat about side missions? Someone needs a cake for no reason, your reward is a weapon that is worse than anything you can craft. Oh boy that was fun. One wanted me to give them a vanity item in exchange for another vanity item and that was my reward.\n\nNow this is the most glaring and obvious criticism most players bring up without actively targeting. The established universe is subject to development whims and not subject to any form of grounding, especially when this doesn't factor into any form of gameplay. This is a problem. Having a space terraria style sandbox, but still digging through the mud with a pickaxe and using rusty swords is the biggest bait and switch I've ever heard.\n\nEverything in the Starbound universe is a joke or reference or whacky in nature with absolutely no grounding, so you are incapable of being invested. Why should you care? The game doesn't. The races are a joke, settlements are a joke, quests are a joke. And they're all bad jokes in the Douglas Adams vein. The game goes to such length to show how it doesn't take itself seriously at all, but there is no payoff.\n\nThis is the video game equivalent of someone handing you a bad finger painting and saying "Here's my bad finger painting! Look at how bad it is!" expecting you to laugh. How are we meant to respond? "Hahahahahaha! You don't care at all and I paid you for this! I guess the jokes on me! Haha... ha... ha...."\n\nYou can have a joke game but you need actual jokes. When Chucklefish's idea of a joke is making fun of their own flat universe... Jesus christ, really? Could you have more contempt for your audience and more self awareness?\n\nLong story short, it's Terraria but worse. Much worse. Technically it has more "content" but the whole game is dry and dull, dry and dull.\n\nEssentially a sprite artist from Re-Logic (creators of Terraria) remade a subpar, stagnating Terraria and made millions and consumers are torn between lynch mob and white knights.\n\nThe only thing I can say to this games defence is it has a lot of pixel graphic assets (oh very taxing) and it's music is good.\n\nThis company is fascinatingly cynical, because no aspect is fleshed out and it's not even a focus.\n\n"I'd really love to see some more games made on the Starbound engine, its so flexible and easy" - Tiy Jun 27 - 2015\n\nDo you know what this says to me?\n\n"We ♥♥♥♥ed up. We don't know what we're doing. Someone please make a good game for us. All we can do is make innocuous content."\n\nI resent this company, for being the most obviously cynical cash grab bare bones example of a game completely supported by hype, false promises and implications.\n\nWe have enough problems with EA, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers without ambitious little ♥♥♥♥♥ doing it as well.\n\nPS. Hey Tiy, I don't think you were meant to use the millions of dollars you got to start a publishing business... Pretty sure it was to just make a game.\n\nNote: I edit this review frequently to better express my supreme disappointment of this title and to convey that Chucklefish are as trustworthy as EA.\n\n2013 Indie of the Year: You know how Starbound got this award? For just being a popular release to Early Access. It looks like Chucklefish isn't the only one without integrity. You'd think you'd have some ♥♥♥♥ing shame giving an award to a unstable, broken alpha game, www.indieDB.com.\n\n2013 PC Gamer Top 100 award: Came in at number 95. Apparently this is better than Monkey Island.

All they do is show little gifs of things they are "working" on. And seem to be waisting time by adding little minigames, and other useless stuff. Seriously. Work on adding gameplay value to the game already.\n\nIn this game, all you'l be doing is grinding up stuff just to get to another tier, all the way untill you reach the last one. And don't even get me started on the building feature.\n\nSeriously. Building in this game is a heck of allot of fun. Because the mechanics for it are actually nice and fleshed out, and easy to use. But there is ZERO motivation for you to actually build, and put stuff outside of your spaceship. Your going to be needing to craft things in your spaceship all the time. So why build a little home on a planet, for you to teleport to whenever you need to craft a few things?\n\n\nI highly suggest not purchasing this game. Unless you've got money pouring out of your nostrils, and just want to have fun for a first time playing through. If however, you charish your 15$ like any other person. I'd suggest you go look elsewhere.\n\nIf however you do want to play a good 2d, RPG. Go and play Terraria. It just got a Huge 1.3 update. And is currently brimming with content.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/largemountainjew/recommended/211820/","largemountainjew","The Large Mountain Jew","http://steamcommunity.com/id/largemountainjew/","294 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIts taken a long time, but this game is finally starting to be worth it.\n\nLong ago, in the age of myths, Starbound was first conceptualized as Terraria in space. Everyone rightly thought that that sounded like the best idea ever, and gave Chucklefish all of their money through an in-house version of kickstarter. In return for giving Chucklefish all of our money, they would throw in some more features into their game which would be out "soon". Fast forward to the present day and we've got one of those promised bonuses, sorta. (Novakids are finally in the game, but they're lacking some features of the other races)\n\nI'm finally reviewing because the recent update has made the game feel like something approaching what could be called a full release. My rule on Early Access Games is don't buy unless you are happy with the game as is, and if the game would still be good if the devs all vanished over night. I don't know how many more features the devs plan to implement, but Starbound now has enough in it to be considered good.\n\nThe quest system is a welcome addition, particularly in how it functions as a tutorial through the early parts of the game. Unlike every other open world crafting game, you're not just dropped into the world and told only to "figure it out" with no direction. This can be both a good and or bad thing depending on how you see things. This is because certain quests serve as "checkpoints" to the open-ness of the world. For example, you're not getting off the starting world until you do a certain amount of mining and exploring. The game opens up more after that, but once again this is something you're likely to see as either good for slowly easing you into the world or bad for keeping you from just going hog wild in exploration of the galaxy. You're also not going to survive on certain planets unless you get your hands on suit upgrades that you're only going to get from certain quests.\n\nAs it stands, I think the whole quest system could use some work in that exploration of the sandbox is restricted by whether or not you have done certain quests to obtain upgrades needed to survive more than a few seconds in certain environments. I found myself more accepting of this once I stopped thinking of Starbound as "2D Minecraft in space" and as a game that placed more emphasis on the Metroidvania aspect. There is a decent variety of quets available, though there could stand to be more.\n\nOne thing I do love that more open world crafting games could stand to copy is your ship. In most open world crafting games, I'm reluctant to "settle down" and build anything greater than a mud hut for a base as I'm going to be spending most of my time out in the world, gathering resources or exploring. Starbound solves this by giving you a ship (whose size you can upgrade) to customize to your heart's content. It really lets you have the best of both worlds, as you can still go out and explore every planet and moon in the galaxy, yet as long as you're above ground you can easily beam back up to your base of operations.\n\nStarbound still needs some work, and it shows, but as it stands now it has enough in it to keep you busy long enough to justify the price. Further updates can hopefully turn this from being just a "good" game into a great game.\n\nUpdate Edit: Reviewing early access is a funny thing. When do you stop reviewing it? The game changes all the time, and potentially the quality goes up and down. Well let this edit serve as a review of the updates and the theoretical direction of the game. The updates have been varied. Some good, some bad. However the recent combat update has cemented my view that the devs have no idea what direction they're going for in this game. Said update brought back damage on touch, which you may remember as that feature you have never once liked in any game ever. The problem gets worse when most enemies in the game have an AI based around charging at you, and damage also causes knockback. This all adds up to you getting stunlocked to death unless you kill enemies in the first shot. The devs reacted to the near universal hatred of the return of this feature by declaring that this was part of their vision for the game so get used to it.\n\nMore importantly though, it confirmed a heavy flaw of the current update process for Starbound. Huge updates separated by several months, after which any complaints about changes are ignored as the devs declare mission accomplished and move on to some other aspect of gameplay. Taking a look at the dev blog reveals that things seem to be largely unorganized as everyone has some side project they're busy with and occasionally a huge update is pushed through that maybe incorporates some of them. At this point in time Starbound seems to not have a lot of focus, and what focus it does have is *so* focused that it ignores criticism. The story is still nowhere in sight, which leaves the game itself in a State of like Terraria except the combat isn't nearly as good, and like Minecraft except the crafting and exploration leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nMy positive review remains, though I remain very cautious about this game.","January 31, 2015","true","101.7"," 105 of 188 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","105","188","10","2"

Nothing beats building, hunting, gathering with friends!\n\nSo I guess this is all I got to say for now about the game since I haven't really spent that much time in it but I can already recommend the game, especially if you liked minecraft or terraria, I am sure you will enjoy this game, and it is only about 13,99€.\n","December 5, 2013","true","93.7"," 85 of 151 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","85","151","0","8"

Now it has come out on the other side of the last patch as crap. There is nothing interesting about it that I can find anymore. Just an annoying boss and no incentive to keep dying.

Since then, the game is still not a finished product and is in EARLY ACCESS at the time of this review. It's fun for what it is, but any hopes of maintaining a character that you have built from scratch was destroyed over the last few months after many character and world resets. Though, Chucklefish (the developer) has stated that there will be no more full character or world resets from here on out.\n\nIn addition, I don't really agree that I need to rent a server just to play multiplayer with other people that own the game. There are other options to get a multiplayer game going, but it's not something your run-of-the-mill gamer will know how to do. There are growing pains when trying to get your multiplayed games going, and what started out as fun slowly trickled into dissapointment. A year might a little long to be in the EARLY ACCESS stage of development.\n\nThe gameplay and soundtrack were what drew me in a first. It plays similar to Terraria, and having different races and racials made it interesting.\n\nIf it wasn't for the massive Winter update they had in 2014, I almost assumed that the developers had abandoned this game. Starbound has a lot of potential and can very fun, but I don't recommend buying it until it's a finished product.","January 28, 2015","false","163.1"," 38 of 64 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","38","64","0","0"

I think I made the right choice, putting it in my "meh, I dunno about this" account. It pretty much sums up my opinion of it.\n\nI have absolutely no idea where they are going with this thing. When I bought in, I thought I had a good idea about what I was getting, but with constant changes in development, I really just don't know anymore. Sure, developing a game requires changes here and there, but SB is a game that really has no idea what it wants to be ultimately. It doesn't give the buyer much faith if the Devs keep changing their ideas. I can't possibly believe this game to be a "vision" when the vision changes every week.\n\nWhen I bought in, I was given this picture. Like all other early access games, you are given a gist of what's to come. When that "gist" is deluded with constant backtracking, and slow development, how can one help but to feel left in the dark?\n\nHere recently, there is a lot of talk about "progression". What is being described with this new content is NOT what I was expecting in this game.\n\nThis linear progression stuff that is being talked about is fine in some games, but in a game that uses a procedural generated universe as its foundation, I feel the mechanics will collide.\n\nResources as they are right now serve a very finite use. Once you've made your favorite top tier armor, found your favorite weapons and other gear, the whole value of resources comes to a halt. I would be okay with this if the mechanics change in the future, but it doesn't look like it's going to with this talk about "armor progression". It seems as if they want you to eventually find your favorite armor, favorite weapon, and that's that. Like I said, that's fine in some games, but in a game meant to be "sandbox", it doesn't fit well.\n\nSo my question is: Why go procedural? It seems like a lot of pointless work. If I get armor and other items that don't require iron anymore (for example), why have an infinite, procedurally generated universe full of the stuff? To build with? Okay, sure. But building needs to connect to everything else in the game. I don't want to build just for the sake of building. I want to build to store and maintain my value and power in the universe. Not just build and horde items I'll never use again. What about selling this iron? Okay, sure. But if I already got my fav gear, do tell what I'll be buying with this money I'll be making.\n\nResources need to have a constant tangible and economical value in a game meant to have no true end. In a game like Minecraft, having a procedurally generated world works because ALL resources need to be maintained. Since all materials need to be maintained, it has a constant value to all players at all times. All the mechanics come full circle because of this. In SB, the linear mechanics collide with the non-linear mechanics because it does have this infinite universe with resources, but they will eventually fill their finite use.\n\nImagine in Minecraft once you've made a certain pickaxe, it never broke, and it never needed to be maintained. What would happen? You would no longer need to look for that material, and that whole massive world holds no value to you anymore. Now I'm not comparing Minecraft to SB as the same game, I'm only comparing the procedural generation mechanic they both share.\n\nI'm not saying weapon degradation needs to be in SB to make it work. I'm just saying it needs something to make this infinite playing field flow smoothly. Otherwise, we are all going to get our top tier armor, our favorite top tier weapon, and run around killing each other for the sake of killing each other.\n\nI want battles that are about power and resource. It's the key motivation for any pvp. You can't blame me for thinking that SB was going to be this. So much features promised, and so many different things planned, I feel that everyone who bought in found something about it they wanted, and they pictured their own little piece of paradise within it. That right there is what was banked on.\n\nDo I recommend this? How can I recommend something that changes it's tune constantly? It's a moving target right now, so no, I can't possibly recommend it. I don't know who it's trying to please in the long run. All I can say is: If you got the money to blow, and you're curious, go for it. If not, just wait and see what it will be when it's considered "finished". Whatever that means anymore.\n\n\n\n","August 6, 2014","false","242.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

That was the end of it. Nightly builds actually means:\n- instead of fixing existing bugs/problems they keep focusing on new micro-additions, some of which totally useless or just cosmetic (who cares about importing or playing ABC text tunes when tons of items still lack a decent description? )\n- every other day (almost) your steam client will redownload the bloody damn full game (that is around 1 gig).\n- sometimes you will have to manually delete your char and world folders, otherwise the game will just crash and won't run (so much for their "no more character wipes" statement).\n\nFrankly i think the biggest problems is the devs wanted to make this the ULTIMATE Terraria clone game - with every feature they thought of - and they didn't focus on finishing the game itself!  If they just kept fixing what was wrong before starting to add stuff on the to-do list, this could have become a true classic!\n","December 18, 2014","false","109.0"," 40 of 68 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","40","68","0","0"

Not even close!\n\n\nThis is a good example of what happens when a game gets too much hype, ( like DayZ ) gets overrated and exaggerated,( like DayZ) and the company  takes too much advantage of the so called "Early Access Game" feature (like DayZ again!) it's like game companies use it as something to fall back on nowdays!\n\nIt's been a couple of years and I feel as if Stabound hasn't progressed that much at all, it's still somewha bland, boring, and most of it still has no replay value at all.

(Progression still feels unsatisfying)\n\nI wouldn't be expecting this game to be better in the near future since Chucklefish would rather use the time to make another game like Waywardtide or publish other games instead of finishing this one at all.

Each star system is in every person's own universe with key placements at each location. An example would be that if I found a major floran prison in the Artella system, the outter orbit ring from the star, at Kremler III-b planet... chances are your game will have a giant floran base there too. However! It will not be identical. Your universe will generate the planet, wildlife, most loot conatiners, some structures, and even sub biomes differently. Think of it as a marriage between using seeds and proceedural generation.\n\nThere is over half a dozen major races. Most of then playable. Each has its own lore and background which you can sometimes find bits of while exploring the 423 qadrillion worlds. You will find quiet peaceful villages of NPCs. You will find hostile military bases. You can start your own colony and recieve randomly generated quests. Sometimes your colonists will dislike other colonists. Sometimes a colonist wants more respecting and standing. Sometimes they just might ask for a cake.\n\nThe creatures you find on worlds are all randomly generated as well. A giant really big codex of different heads is consulted. Which world type biome and sub-biome filters things. Then a random head is picked. That head has a list of attacks and other features, which one is picked. Then onto the body. Arms. Legs... and so on. Then colors are selected. That species is then tagged as passive or hostile by defualt and you will find those on that planet. Each planet has multiple creatures, of course. Eventually you can play Pokemon and capture some. Use them to help you in combat or build a zoo. Robotic things, flying things, creeping things, lumbering things... there's just so many possibilities of creatures you will see.\n\nWeapons. Think Borderlands. There's a LOT of weapon types. Each with their random rolls. 2-handed weapons have a random secondary attack. I have a spear that does fire damage and it doubles as a flame thrower! Its also nice because fire = a strong light source for exploring deep down inside of caves. There are melee weapons, modern weapons, futuristic weapons, magic weapons, consumable weapons like grenades... the selection is impressive. Armor increases damage so if you find a FANTATSIC weapon 2 hours in you will still be able to use this weapon in the harshest of worlds effectively once you completed the progression tree.\n\nThere is a good wiring system to let do intresting things with items. Its just like redstone from Minecraft basically. There are so many block types. SO. MANY. You can color some blocks with a painting tool. Some blocks you can craft some you need to get out there and collect. Some blocks, like dirt, come in many colors. All this is good for people who whish to make a colony or intresting bases and such. More then this there are thousands of other items. Thousands. You might find an arcade machine. A coffee maker. A floran statue. Litteraly so many decoration items... best part is you can scan these into your ship's 3D printer and make more of them for your building projects.\n\nStarbound offers amazing exploration in a gigantic universe which you can explore on your own single player then take your same character online to your favorite servers. What I enjoy about Starbound is the game is built to be modded. When this game comes out there are going to be exceptional projects out there. Already the game feels alive to me offering more then just fighting and killing. It has such a scope but at the same time it feels casual. Does not make you eat every 5 mins nor will there be gigantic game ending alein attacks every hour. Play at your own pace... go to planets with difficulty levels you find enjoyable. Do or do not do what you find fun :) Starbound is a game I adore so very very much. Perfect? No. It takes these guys a YEAR to push out a major update. Which is stupid and far too long. Other little things I dislike too but all in all?\n\nOne of my fav games. Overwhelmingly I give it a solid 5 out of 5 ... this is one of my favorites!","December 12, 2015","true","462.0"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","42","72","5","0"

Nothing more to be done. You can always build something nice, but most of the block variety is uncraftable, and must be hunted out and collected.

Because it looked and sounded charming, a delightful Terraria like game that dipped into the splender of randomly generated content and i was quickly suckered in.\n\nDon't believe for a ♥♥♥♥ing second this game is actually worth the money. It looks good, it sounds fantastic on paper, the art style is utterly charming and it was those hooks that brought me in, yet, after many hours of play, i walk away feeling betrayed, annoyed, bitter and frustrated.\n\nDo not, i repeat, DO NOT allow the games initial charm to fool you. As i was very exicted when i started playing, being a big fan of Terraria, i thought this game would be right up my street, by god, how i was wrong.\n\nSo, why exactly is Starbound bad and not worth your money? Its mechanically awful, hasn't been updated in months and the developers are a bunch of censoring ♥♥♥♥♥♥. If those reasons aren't enough, then try the constant lies, horrendous "nightlies" and complete lack of communication with the community.\n\nMechanically awful - The game plays badly, very badly. Combat is ♥♥♥♥. Exploration is ♥♥♥♥. Character design and progress is ♥♥♥♥. Loot is ♥♥♥♥. Progression is ♥♥♥♥. Its all ♥♥♥♥. Why? Combat is clunky and stupid, absolutely no depth or fun to it what so ever. Exploration is an illusion, the game boasts infinite numbers of explorable planets, what it means by that is infinite recolours of the same boring ♥♥♥♥. You get absolutely no reward for exploring anyway, its crushing, you spend hours digging through a planet, hoping that you might stumble across something interesting and useful and time after time you find nothing, absolutely nothing, you may find some silly little village underground and you'll think "Woah, this could be cool" and the game crushes you again as that discovery yields nothing, there is nothing to find and no progression via exploration. You progress by mining. And trust me, you are going to have to mine your ♥♥♥♥ing arses off because MY GOD are those ore costs high. You'll spend hours in lifeless undergrounds, digging away, breaking pickaxe after pickaxe until you gather what seems to be a collosal amount of ore, cart it back up to the surface, only to find it barely makes you a knife and a helmet (Which are both completely useless) and the armour set + boss items (Items used to summon in the painfully boring bosses) actually costs 5 times more... and its at this point you realise why theres infinite planets, and its because you need to ♥♥♥♥in' mine them all to get through the game.\n\nAnd trust me, this mining isn't fun. It isn't Minecrafts mining, where you never know whats around the corner, where each block of ore brings you a little pleasure and a little hope, where delight is found in knowing you are ever closer to finishing your next chosen goal, where your hard work is reflected in your creations, where you look upon your mighty mountain fortress or spanning tree house with a sense of accomplishment that only you understand... This isn't Terraria's mining, where every cave is an unexplored bounty of new threats and treasures to plunder, teasing you deeper and deeper with ever more delicious rewards and ore veins to beef your armour and weapons up, just one more cave.... just one more cave... until BAM, you knew you should have turned back, but you couldn't help yourself... but with a smile on your face you dive in again, picking up right where you left off, one death smarter than before... where you fear the corruption and the crimson until you find that perfect sword, that oh so perfect sword that fits your hand just right and gets you where you couldn't before and it was worth every second... Oh no. Starbound is NONE of those things and believe me, i wish it was.... No, Starbound is empty. The randomised monsters end up being meaningless, just reskinned health bags to paff at. There is no charming music, there is no reward, there is no happiness at the end of your tunnel, just more ore to dig for that boss item that'll end up being dissapointing, like the rest of the game.\n\nThe game hasn't been updated in months - Well, this is both true and also a lie. You see, there are 3 versions of Starbound right now. The Stable, the Unstable and the Ugly. I mean Nightly. To explain, the Stable version is supposed to be as bug free as possible, the unstable is supposed to be as new as possible and the Nightly is supposed to be as new as possible... Uhm. Well, initially, there was just stable and unstable, but they decided they needed something more unstable than unstable and made Nightlies, where the game gets updated every night. So since the release of Nighties, the game has technically been updated every night, at the totally neglect of stable and unstable of course which haven't been updated since 2013. But thats not too bad right? I mean cmon... Well, it is, because nightlies are ♥♥♥♥ing awful. They are massively buggy and... well... to be completely honest with you, the development of the game through nightlies has been awful, its gotten worse since the last stable update. Things like ores dropping on death and stupid little additions that no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about plague the nightly updates like a curse and i can tell you with utter certainity that they are not worth your time or money.\n\nWhy should you not buy this game because of bad developers? Simple, don't support them or their actions, show them its not ok to do the things they do by voting with your money.\n\nI will end this review with a sentance i used earlier as i feel it fits perfectly. There is no light at the end of your Starbound adventure, there is no light at the end of your tunnel. Only crushing dissapointment, over and over again. Don't be lured in, don't waste your time, effort, energy and money. Go play anything else, Terraria, Minecraft, just something else.\n\nI don't want Starbound to be a bad game, but i can only tell it like it is. I wish it was good and getting better, I really do. But its not, and at this point... i don't think it ever will be. Thanks for reading and i hope i helped you out.\n\n\nAs a very final note, to developers who may be reading this, i advise you to think very carefully about putting your game on early access. Seriously. Its not a god send or a financial aid, its a business strategy and you need to be prepared to carry it out properly, lest you end up like Chucklefish and Starbound.","October 7, 2014","false","79.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"

And I am genuinely disappointed by that. I was really looking forward to the "Terraria in space" experience I was advertised.\n\nConstruction\nThere is no point in constructing anything as the game's progression requires you to ditch old planets. Sure you can fly back to them (at considerable fuel costs) but all of the resources there will be useless. This makes the entire constructive aspect of the game worthless, because it has no lasting effect. There's no point in building anything grand or impressive, because you're going to make that area obsolete just by playing the game. In Terraria or Minecraft you can start laying the groundwork for a huge project at the very begining of the game and improve on it as you progress, getting new materials and what-not, all the way to the very end. And there's not even any point in building little dirt huts either. You can just stand by a campfire all night because hostile enemies don't spawn near enough to spot you and aggro. In Starbound your best bet is to load your spaceship full of chests and store anything useful in there because it is your only constant throughout the game. Perhaps instead of a spaceship the player should be given a floating asteroid base to be built onto.\n\nProgression\nMining is very slow and there are so many tiers of materials that you can't hope to get lucky and happen upon a rare ore that will carry you to near end-game. And even if you do find a material within your tier that is one over what your pick is currently made of, you can't use it because you have to go through each stage of upgrades for the pick. For example; copper -> iron -> silver - > gold. If you have a copper pick and find some gold you can't just make a gold pick. You have to upgrade your current pick to iron and then to silver and then to gold.\nAdvancing through the game requires a ton of grinding to create some item which will summon that tier's boss which upon defeat will allow you access to the next tier of materials and planets. This would be novel if it happened once our twice, but instead this pattern is used for every level in the game. Oh, and by the way, if you don't win that boss fight on your very first try the item you used to summon it is still lost and you have to grind all over again.\n\nCombat\nCombat in Starbound seriously lacks variety. Nearly all melee weapons operate the same (stabbing sword or overhead sword) but with slightly different stats and ranged weapons are weak to the point of being useless. A lack of variety is also found in your foes who are just random palette swaps of several base monster designs granted one special attack. This means a design for a friendly neutral creature in one instance can be the same as an aggressive creature in another. There's a bizarrely out of place energy meter that keeps you from attacking with ranged weapons too much, but why? Isn't the whole point of ranged weapons the ability to engage a foe at a distance? Why kneecap them like that?\n\nVariety\nAt a surface level (screenshots) it looks like there's a lot of different worlds to encounter in Starbound. But after actually playing it you'll find that they are all pretty much the same planet but with different colored dirt and trees. Sometimes all the water is poison or there's an abandoned prison or there will be a specific biome, but none of this matters. There are no specific weapons or armors or anything that makes a difference to be found only in specific biomes. Again, advancing in this game is solely about grinding to get enough ores and pixels. The only unique materials you'll find in these biomes are used for decoration making them, as previously explained, completely worthless.\n\nOverall, just not worth spending your money on in it's current state. I know, I know, "early access" but that doesn't explain away game design that is bad at it's core. No amount of bug fixes and updates can fix problems that are at the core of what this game is. If they really changed it enough to improve it, it would be an entirely different game. If you liked Terraria you'll like it even more after playing this and realizing how much better Terraria is.","October 11, 2014","false","38.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","1"

Do you want to feel like you're helping create a game that you want to play? Do you want to see that hard earned money you forked over reflected in the dedication of the developer?\n\nIf you answered "Yes" to any of the above questions, then don't buy Starbound. Not convinced? Well here is why:\n\n1. It has very little content. It has been in development for years, and very little has been accomplished. Most notably in the past 12 months. So little progress in fact that many players believe the game is dead. It hasn't recieved even a minor official update in the last 9 months and counting.\n\n2. The team behind this game is incredibly out of touch with it's players. The creators made a public announcement a while back meant to sooth supporters in which they stated "Chucklefish could fund Starbound for another 9 years at least.” They also explained that "even if Starbound and Chucklefish never make another dime, the company has enough money in the bank to pay for office costs, employee salaries, and other expenditures." That would be reassuring if any tangible progress has been made since then. They post update blogs on the official website weekly, detailing what they're supposedly working on, but since none of it has been added to a stable release we can only go on faith that they're not just sitting on our money.\n\n3.  The "Nightly" Build. When accused of slacking the Developers tell players to download the "nightly build". This is an incredibly unstable version which they themselves describe as "more beta than the beta". Unfortunately, it's so broken it's not easily playable. The starter missions are incomplete and impossible to finish, requiring console commands to progress and all the while avoiding obscure/mudane actions to prevent crashes. This could almost be tolerable if these same major issues haven't existed since the very first "nightly" builds. None have been fixed.  Remember those update blogs I mentioned before? They are all about minor cosmetic improvements, or about some new items they've mocked up. The game's basic progression and structure sits ignored and unfinished as they post screenshots of a gun shaped like a crayola crayon (seriously). It speaks volumes about their priorities.\n\nCombine all these issues, and it becomes apparent that the Starbound team cares very little about their fan base. If you are still on the fence, I urge you hold off and keep an eye out for when (or if) this game comes out of early access. Make your decision then.","November 7, 2014","false","153.4"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","2"

I know for many of us this was supposed to be the 'spiritual successor' to games like Terraria where ideas are expanded upon and the sandbox environment reaches a new tier of enjoyment and creativity.  I once believed that Starbound may well be this next step; based on my last playthrough as of roughly a week ago, I am closing in on the certainty that it will not.\n\nI initially played through Starbound when it was early released in the Early-Access 'Beta' (and to be perfectly accurate it was far cry from what I would have considered a beta game).  I fundamentally enjoyed some of the mechanics and certainly bought into the hype of what it would eventually become: a space-based exploration game with an element of combat built into it.\n\nIt was interesting, it still was linear and boring in the end, but I knew that it wasn't ready for prime-time.  I had the serious expectation that it would be within some amount of time; after all, Tiy was involved.\n\nI've recently switched to the nightly builds and went through another playthrough of the game.  I frankly will say I'm shocked that the game essentially hasn't changed in the year since I've played it.  Sure, there's some reorganization of the quest system, the way in which progression proceeds changed slightly but overall the game was still in the same state it was in the initial 'beta' phase it was the year previously.  Some improvements, I'll grant, but certainly not to the level I would have expected of a 'full time commitment to development' as promised from ChuckleFish with a full year's worth of effort.\n\nIt simply lacks focus and is still not enjoyable.  The combat has been reworked, reworked again, and then reworked again.  Numerous small additions (primarily in the in-game clutter department) have been added but fail to deliver any cohesive theme or point.  The planetary exploration has had random new bits associated with it (like underground mini-biomes that apparently house 'fabulous loot' which is generally procedure-generated garbage) that contribute very little or nothing to the experience.  The quest system is resolved within a few hours.  The upgrading of tiers are the same thing for each tier just with a new name.  The combat is still clunky and boring.  Sure, there's lots of new random items to craft (most of it useless, because it's still not apparent how or why I should build or craft anything in the game) but that's essentially it.  The towns, castles and sewers are still there but just like a year ago have no motivating goal to prod me to explore them.\n\nNo unifying vision.  No known objective (other than the straightforward quest system).  Nothing.\n\nIf its current state is soon to be labelled 1.0 then I would highly recommend you avoid.  I had hoped by this point that the development team would have centered in on what the game's purpose should be about and refined the experience but they have not.  I agree with most of the steam reviews that, aside from the few cheerleaders for the company, the progression of this enterprise has been lackluster at best.  Devs continue to blame their customers for not being patient enough while simultaneously - get this - have NINE OTHER GAME forums for other games that are either in kickstarter or development mode.  ChuckleFish had better, in the very near future, decide if they want to be known as a company that promises the world and delivers a gold-plated turd or if they truly appreciate the fanbase and buckle down on projects they commit to.","January 17, 2015","false","255.9"," 575 of 1,073 people (54%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","54","575","1","33","18"

Considering the game is still in 'beta' development stages, there are new updates and content added, extremely often. With Character and World wipes coming, this will make it difficult for most players to do anything that they may get attached to, such as, developing a home world, or collecting rare, high tier items/weapons/armor.\n\nThat being said, for a gamer who may like to experience the raw nature of an early access title, this one is right there. Nearly as many things broken as working, and a flood of new items/monster behaviours/events to experiment with at any given time. Being able to have your input considered, during these crucial development stages, is one of the nice things available to players at this point.\n\nWhile it keeps the traditional feel of the mining/crafting genre, it adds a few fairly straigtforward sets of goals to accomplish in order to progress in the game, allowing players who could not get into the driveless feel of games like minecraft, to get into this genre and still have a sense of actual progression.\n\nWhen Starbound emerges from beta, and into full development, it is a game that will be hard to match in terms of shear explorability, and potential replayability.\n\nAll in all, another highly recommended title.","January 21, 2014","true","563.4"," 32 of 54 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","32","54","0","2"

Most of space is an  vast, empty, boring place in reality and ChuckleFish choose to reflect this in Starbound. There are tons of planets but nothing really on them to keep them unique or give them flavor besides different colored grass and wierd trees Starbound seems proud of declaring "biomes" but they serve no purpose beside eye-candy and the occasional acid pool or rain. The creatures are randomly generated as such they are just a bunch souless cannon fodder devouted to bump into you and deal damage. Oh some of them have lasers but usually just the flying ones( the "randomly generated" claim really goes out the window here). Items are breathing some life into the game but I literally have scoured hundreds of planets and never found anything of interest besides the occasional village and dungeon, both of which are so badly repeatitve that I cant stand to go to other planets and see the same science dungeon that I just saw on the last planet and every 3rd planet I go to. If you want a game like Starbound go get Terreria, the systems present give it more soul then this sham, and you dont have to wait for terrible developers to "fix" the game or claim that it's Early Access as an excuse to not address problems for months at a time.\n\nEdit: recently it has come to my attention that the Dev ChuckleFish has been banning people from thier website and steam forums for showing any signs of critism of thier game or shady Dev strategy(they are developing multiple titles alongside Starbound).

By that, I mean it just took literally over 5 minutes. It's a gameplay feature. Ah yes the fullscreen option, also known as lowering the windows size instead of fullscreening the game. Gameplay feature.\nGreat game early access is great quality game quality content lots of fun great game perfect and flawless. I love it lots of neat gameplay features.\n\nDo you like Terraria? Do you like space? Do you like EARLY ACCESS? I HAVE THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\n\nAfter waiting half a year to see if it'll let me play, it does, but still takes a long time to load and fullscreening doesn't work. It's also the hardest game to run in my Steam library, other than maybe Witcher 3. It had none of these issues when I first played it, the updates are adding these.\nIt also lets you bind things to mouse4, mouse5, f7, f8, etc. but they don't lose their functionality. So f8 still does whatever it does, and if you try to press f8 to do what you bound it to your game freezes. And it just lies about mouse4 and mouse5 support, by the way, it only says they're bound on the options menu and they don't do anything.\n\n\nThey also removed hunger and temperature. Replacing having to eat with food being useless and cluttering, no reason to buy it, find it, grab it, or farm it, and replacing cold planets being more hostile and frozen planets even moreso with "Don't worry about it, there's no hostility in this game anymore". Oxygen also isn't an issue because you immediately get "never lose oxygen no matter what", so oxygenless environments also aren't even hostile.\nAnd you can always beam back up to your ship, they removed the limitations.\n\nThe game is no longer about exploring space and overcoming obstacles to go into more hostile environments, every environment is friendly. It's "Here you go, oxygen is never a problem" then "Can you go underwater and cut down 30 trees (which they made annoying because you vacuum up liquids now, making breaking things near or underwater start sucking water up, and vacuuming makes lava/poison no longer obstacles and just inconveniences) without anything stopping you so you just wait a long time while they cut so I make it so you can go to new areas?" so on and so on. The enemies will oftentimes also just run into your attacks so they're not really threatening or anything, and I'm really dissapointed with the direction this game is going.\n\nOh, yeah, also, what does everything mean? There's tons of new content that isn't explained at all, like these buffs / debuffs looking things that don't have any tooltips.\n\nI have now become so immune to everything the textbox isn't big enough http://i.imgur.com/YCqCVZo.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vngNnNf.png\nYou also have a choice to equip the previous tiers, even though the higher ones contain all previous.\n\nAll in all it's pretty okay, but pretty buggy and unreasonably hard to run. Lack of content, too. I felt like I was just starting the game the whole time because I hadn't been playing long or done much, and then it turns out I'm at the end, with little to do, and not the beginning, with a lot to do.\nThe AI keeps disabling, and even if I touch the immobile enemies nothing happens. Sometimes it half disables where ranged units kinda walk but don't attack, and melee act like they do mentioned earlier. It's really annoying.\nI also keep experiencing immense lag in singleplayer, something I've never seen before, especially on the hoverbike.","July 18, 2015","false","88.0"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

That's probably one of the reasons why at the beginning, the game looked really interesting. However, my initial dose of exciment almost ran out after about 30 hours. My impressions, starting with the negative:\n\n- for most of the time, the game feels empty and lonely. I know it isn't finished, but so far - no quests to do (except for initial quests leading to first boss), no NPCs to talk to, no interesting places to visit, no story. Maybe I didn't search hard enough? If they're there, maybe they should be more accessible? I just wandered alone in the wild, killing mobs and gathering resources. That's the single biggest flaw in the game for me - at some point I just got bored.\n- speaking of gathering, game requires too much grinding. Realizing that getting to second boss involves no quests, just more grinding for pixels and steel - was a huge disappointment.\n- even for a moment, I didn't feel a need or desire to build a permanent house; I only dug holes on the road just to sleep at night. Which makes the sizebale amount of craftable items useless for me. After all, why stick to one planet when there's so many of them.\n\nOn the bright side:\n- Starbound's graphics and visual style are really, really nice. The soundtrack is simply beatiful, I have to admit that sometimes I listen to it outside the game. The overall aesthetics and atmosphere make a very strong advantage.\n- different biomes, weather effects and game physics really are cool.\n- crafting system is fun, I like it.\n- the races and lore are quite interesting from what I found in the wikis, and I hope that eventually the game will allow to experience that.\n\nI probably won't play Starbound until next serious update or final release. And I hope it will bring real improvements, because so far I'm not sure if it was worth the money - and I can't recommend the game to my friends.\nI also think that calling what I played 'beta' is a really annoying abuse - 'beta' denotes software that is almost feature complete, but needs only polishing and bugfixes. Current version is nowhere near that state.","August 17, 2014","false","43.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The rest was left for you to discover.\n\nNo matter how simple and innocent this game may look, don’t let it fool you; it’s quite unforgiving. Beaming down to my very first planet I was greeted with my first contact of alien life.  And let’s just say they didn’t appreciate my presence, which resulted in a swift death for me. The game’s difficulty is challenging but not unbearable and what keeps you coming back is the games complex and deep mechanics. For example upon building my first pick axe and digging through my first few levels of rock my pick axe quickly broke and I was left with my first tool, to harvest at a slower rate than I previously was. Along with this mechanic there are a plethora of others including the crafting system which allows you to build everything you need to make your game more unique, from new armor and weapons to different star maps to travel to more distant and difficult galaxies. Or perhaps you would like to craft a few rainbow bricks to give your new house some much needed color.\n\nThere are no real limits in this game and the items, mechanics and worlds are always being discovered. Each time you pick it up you will find yourself doing something entirely different than you did the time prior. Who knows you may find a guitar along the way and find yourself playing a marimba with your friends over multiplayer. Another time you may find yourself coming across a local village on a new planet and raiding it like Genghis Khan! Regardless of play style, fast or slow, hostile or peaceful this game offers many different ways to be played and hosts hours and hours of enjoyment. I would highly recommend Starbound.","April 4, 2014","true","82.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

You can jump to the next tier too quickly and the difficulty doesn’t scale well at all. This is due to the fact that the bosses drop unique items needed to progress to the next tier. It's a great concept, kill boss, gear up, explore and progress to the next boss, rinse repeat. What you get isn't implemented very well at all; the fights are dull and lack the challenge of bosses in similar games like Terraria. On top of that they can be easily exploited simply by building some blocks as a barrier.  This leads to my next point.\n\nCombat\n\nCombat is very cumbersome and becomes boring rather quickly. While it's awesome to have futuristic weapons like plasma rifles/laser guns most of the crafted melee weapons are exactly the same with the only difference being swing speed. Most creatures can be killed with one or two hits from a melee weapon of the same tier and that’s basically it for almost every creature with the exception of some NPCs. Sure you can find awesome weapons, but they don’t feel powerful, you just keep clicking and whatever is in front of you dies. There’s never any sense of diversity with enemies and the AI combat is basically just jump attacks with some decently powerful ranged attacks from flyers. NPCs could be a challenge due to their weapons and armor, but the AI is too limited. The NPCs never work together and basically become cannon fodder. The system isn’t broken, but it definitely needs tweaking with a lot more weapon and AI diversity, especially mobs of NPCs.\n\nSpace Travel\n\nI’ve played MineCraft, Terraria, Cube World and many other sandbox games, but it was the space travel which drew me to this game in the first place. Having basically unlimited planets to explore seems like a great idea, but again it needs work and balancing. There’s “sectors” that get progressively harder and have more diverse “biomes”. That makes it fun to jump from solar system to solar system to discover new planets and find weapons, tech, dungeons, towns, etc. While the biomes are interesting, I like the asteroids and moons, they still don’t feel that much different from each other. Again the enemies in the biomes are basically all the same with the same AI but different skins, it’s a blue slime instead of a yellow slime. That would be OK if they AI acted differently but you’re basically fighting the same stuff over and over.\n\nBuilding\n\nBuilding stuff is easy, fun and there a ton of objects to acquire throughout the universe, but again things need adjustment like some materials take way too long to break if you made a mistake building your structure or simply want to make a change to an existing structure.\n\nThere’s a lot to love about Starbound and I still have fun playing it, but there’s a lot of work to be done. I’m not going to get into any comments about the Devs or Chucklefish, but I will say they have a hit on their hands if they concentrate on getting core mechanics, AI and combat working.","July 7, 2014","false","64.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nastumi/recommended/211820/","Nastumi","Nastumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nastumi/","127 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter spending hours in Terraria, I saw like a lot of other players in Starbound a dream coming to life. Seriously, Terraria in space, countless worlds to explore, different races to choose from, NPCs, quests, tons of items... That's some heavy stuff !\n\nAfter launching the game, the style is nice, and being in command of your own starship is exciting. The first quests acting as a mini tutorial are nice.\n\nAnd that's all, saddly the fun ends as you need to craft the antena. At the point, the game reveal it's true self, and the false sens of freedom is crushed by the Bosses acting as marks for you to go to the next tier. Ok, Terraria had Wall of Flesh you need to kill to go to the "second" part of the game, but it felt more like a fun thing to do than an obligation.\nHere, you HAVE to kill the boss to move to the next tier, and as soon as you do that, everything done previously become totally useless.\n\nSpeaking of doing things, gathering ressources to craft or build is incredibly slow, and borring. What should have been one of the most important and fun part of the game quickly transform in a sad necessity. You have to craft, but you don't do it just for fun, you do it because the game tells ou to do it. Same goes for building : you may be tempted to make houses, or even towns, but it's useless, as your ship will quickly become your only house, as going back and forth between planets is useless, ressources and time consuming, and boring. So you end with a nice storage ship, leaving a planet to never set foot back again.\n\nSpeaking of towns, it's fun to find random NPC villages and structures, but in the end, you just storm in, grab the loots and leave. No point to settle in, vendors most of the time only sell junk, it's like the whole "random generated buildings" purpose is for you to open some chests, and leave as fast as you came.\n\nBut hey, we still have fighting ! I can still remember those super fast paced hard Terraria fights with crazy weapons, flying all around the mobs and proudly getting victorious of that damn boss/wave. In Starbound, it's the same, without fast paced action, weapons, and abilities. Yep, fights are you smashing the mouse against mobs jumping randomly around. And forget those guns, not only they are uber rare drops, but when you finally get one, it's most of the time weak, and consume ammos so fast it's not worth it at all. The bosses add a bit of a challenge, meaing they kill you faster, not they are actually fun to fight.\n\nOk, so gathering sucks, fights are boring, and crafting is a pain... what's left ? hunting and farming ? sure, hunting gears stop being upgradable at some point, so you either come back to lower tiers just for that, or struggle to get some materials with a totally underpowered weapon... farming could have been a fun idea, but as nothing happens when you're out of a planet, it's pointless, and end in your spaceship, like the rest.\n\nLast point : quests and story ! I got bored of the game before I could see any real quests, past the tutorial-like ones. Not even some hidden stuff to do to have that NPC join your crew... Story-wise, you grab some lore here and there, and you can read them later in your ship...\n\nI won't speak about the public relations of the dev team, seeing the reactions of most of the people, I stopped myself from going to CF website, I'm disapointed enough with Starbound to add more.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Starbound is a game that could have been a real killer, it had so much potential... Instead, we end with promises, and a sad game reminding us all that time what it could have been with a devoted team.\nIf you haven't played Terraria, go for it, it's worth every penny. If like me, you played Terraria so much you have chests filled with every possible item, and would like to play a game like it.... send me a PM when you find one ;_;","July 22, 2014","false","23.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

All you do is grind resources to advance to a harder sector, to grind resources, to advance to a harder sector, and so on. Gameplay does not change between sector difficulties. All enemies mostly charge and spit bullets, despite the touted 'loads of possibilities' with the random monster generation. Combat is clunky and awkward in every way, shape, and form.\n\nDevelopers have promised plenty of content, but have failed to deliver on many of their stated goals - past schedule, etc. You can cry and tell me 'BUT IT'S A BETA' all you want, but the fact of the matter is, these issues are at the heart of the game, and no amount of beta polish will fix them.

YES if you like the imagination behind Minecraft and the graphics and gameplay of Terraria.

I played around 41 hours then. Recently came back and have put in about 44 hours now.\n\nBack when the game first came out, it involved many of the survival aspects that other games had. Such as hunger, being too hot/cold, certain creatures coming out at night, and so forth. To progress, you would mine down into the ground of the planet, gather materials you needed to craft a certain object, and summon a boss with said object which would give you an item to progress to the next "tier". The next tier would provide you with better crafting options in armor and weapons, which would require higher tiered ore, which in turn would usually require going to a more dangerous planet. All of this involved the survival mechanics as well. Dig too far down into a planet, and it would become so cold that it'd begin to affect you, so you may need heat to survive. If you died, you lose all your items... I think. It's been so lnog since I played back then.\n\nNow things have changed. Currently there are three difficulty levels. Casual, you lose 30% of your currency when you die, called pixels. That's it. The next up in difficulty makes you drop all your items when death comes for you. Then the last, Hardcore, makes it so that once you die... your character stays dead. Keep in mind, that many of the survival aspects were removed. You no longer get hungry, food slowly regens hp when eaten. There is no longer a hot/cold gauge when mining down into the depths. Day/Night doesn't matter creature wise, aside from being harder to see without sufficient light sources.\n\nKeep in mind, that the Devs have stated that the survival aspects will be returning in a "Survival" difficulty mode.\n\nProgression is now different. I hear they are going to change it further, but for now I prefer it this way instead of the old way. Instead of building an item to summon a boss. (And cheese the boss, by simply placing dirt in a way that makes you untouchable while being able to kill it), you are now given a mission in some form. These missions will bring you to a dungeon that's preset, and you aren't able to simply mine and tunnel your way through them. At the end of the mission, you fight a boss, and are usually given knowledge of some kind. Usually to reach the next tier of technology. Before any of this happens, of course, you have to repair your ship using the resources from the first planet you are stranded on. This serves as a way to ease someone who may have never played into the game, as it explains some of the mechanics through quests.\n\nTher are some other things you can currently do. Like creating your own village/city and populating it with tenants, who will pay you with rent in some fashion. They also provide randomly generated quests, which at least gives something to do once you hit the final tier level... aside from ransacking outposts for materials and objects you want in order to expand your colony. Which reminds me, the "mini-dungeons" can't be ransacked and mined apart until you fight through their guards/puzzles and destroy the shield generator that's protecting it. This can add some variety when jumping around planets and searching for things you may want.\n\nIn closing, I've read about the planned changes coming up in the release of Starbound with version 1.0. I'm honestly excited for it. Since the full story is going to be available, I'm probably going to delete my older character and start fresh. I hope you have as much fun in the stars as I have! Remember, the adventure is what you make of it.","May 25","true","89.2"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","0"

It was going to be what Terraria wishes it could be.  Things looked good when it got added to Steam, with a planned release for 2013.  And then Chuckle♥♥♥♥s happened.  The game's updates slowed to a complete and utter halt, with no new or meaningful content being added to the game as it changed from having a closed beta available to preorders into an Early Access Title.  The races all lack and will continue to lack any racial traits and/or differences, with the only things unique to them being the look of the starting ships and the racial armors, which any race can wear to gain the effects.  Combat is tedious and boring, with guns being nearly useless and most enemies just having a static "RUN AT PLAYER" attack.  They still haven't added the 7th race they had planned on adding due to reaching a high enough tier in their Kickstarter, something that should have been added about a year ago based on the timeline they had been following.  By this point, Terraria has received a major content patch that has added a ton of new weapons, armors, spells, and enemies and reworked a ton of the already existing content and while Starbound has done some things better than Terraria, it is nowhere near being as polished or as feature-complete as Terraria was at launch.

Whether you want to build a tower so high it grazes the stars, dig to a planet's molten core, or simply fly your ship from planet to planet indiscriminately blasting hostile, brain-washing apes and peaceful bird-men alike you can in Starbound. Despite being in early beta the game plays very well; it has most of the major game systems already in place, smooth performance, and a welcoming, burgeoning community. That said, the developers, who are pushing out updates every few weeks on average, are planning many more features. A longer quest line, side-quests and FTL style space ship combat to name but a few.

Very much so. But it's more than that, if a comparison has to be drawn between the two then Starbound is like Terraria 3.0, in Space! Starbound has certainly learned a lot from Terraria and improved on it in many aspects. There, that's said, now onto the game itself.\n\nStarbound is a space survival sandbox and even in this early beta version it offers so much. Quests sketch up an over-arching story and give the character a purpose other than just surviving, and owning a space ship enables free travel to different worlds whether it be for a change of scenery, to seek natural resources (yes, the distribution of resources differs between planets!), or for conquest!\n\nCharacters can be customized in many ways, starting with one of 6 different races (each with its own lore and guiding philosophy) through a multitude of hairstyles to lots of clothing styles. Equipment-wise characters can use backpacks, hold items in both hands, or wield two items at the same time (like an axe and a flashlight). Then there's crafting, with each menu offering instant recipe search, categories, direct input of quantities - seems basic, but it all adds up.\n\nThe survival aspects include the basic need for food and shelter, but also body temperature or a sanity-like dependence on light. The environments are varied, from the casual green meadows to raging ice storms in the frozen wastes, and each environment has its own challenges or advantages. Then there are the inhabitants (if any) - beasts either passive or outright aggressive - that come in different shapes and sizes and can look so outlandish you won't believe what you're seeing. And if beasts are not enough some planets may sport humanoid colones or settlements -- those again may be friendly or not so, but the way to deal with them is comletely up to the player.\n\nWhat appeals to me the most though is the music! The background tracks are great and change to suit the current circumstances -- battle, day/night, storms or sunshine -- it's so good that I can just sit and listen instead of playing. The sound effects are real good too, surfaces have their own footstep sounds, bests roar when attacking or just in their unique ways when idle.\n\n\nHonestly can't recommend this enough and will certainly be following the development.","December 8, 2013","true","74.0"," 37 of 64 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","37","64","0","2"

You can "merge down/up" blocks so that they are slim or "fit just right" allowing you to accomplish more than what several terraria bricks can do.\n\n- This game has lore, and lots of it, discovered via book drops and dialogue.\n\n-This game has better ambient tracks than Terraria, with combat themes playing when in danger.\n\n- When you get hit, you don't sound stupid. Seriously, the most annoying part about Terraria was that one sound effect when you get hit. Luckily, this game has an exponentially *less* annoying sound effect when you get hit.\n\n\n\nHOWEVER:\n\n- This game is in early beta, which means not everything is final yet.\n\n- NPCs are almost as dumb as their Terraria counterparts, in that although they may walk into their demise from time to time, they're smart enough to run and hide or call for guards.\n\n- This game is poorly optimized, but playable.\n\n- The wildlife is just about are almost entropic as their Terraria counterparts. Pray for Saint Jiub when your house is swarmed by bird-like creatures.\n\n\n\n\nFinal verdict? Buy it if you're interested, but if you want the complete experience, wait for the final product. The recent update also means no more character/ship/world wipes, meaning your progress is permanent in these early stages!","February 13, 2014","true","92.9"," 37 of 64 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","37","64","0","10"

It looked great and i loved the idea, but when i actually played Starbound it felt like i was lied to. The only way i managed to find fun in this game was by playing with a friend of mine, as playing alone would have been frustrating and just plain boring.\n\nThe beginning of the game is a mad dash to either set up a farm or farm the monsters for meat, because starvation is a very real issue. Unfortunately, the monsters are very cutthroat in Starbound, and won't hesitate to destroy you as quick as possible. Once you get enough meat, you're free to mine down into the world without too much fear, except rapidly respawning monsters love to surprise you in tight corridors and murder you there too. It doesn't help that monsters are randomly generated, so it's hard to find out which ones are friendly or hostile until they're breathing toxic smoke or charging at you at full speed. This aspect does not get any easier or better later in the game.\n\nThe combat is simplistic and boring. There is no strategy to any enemies because they all attack the same way, which is "Rush the player and if i have a ranged attack then use that while rushing". Combat boils down to swinging your weapon at the enemy until it dies, or shooting it until it dies. Dodging is hardly a factor except against the flying enemies on the surface, as underground enemies force you into tight corridors to make avoiding projectiles near impossible.\n\nProgression in Starbound feels lazy and uninspired. To get better equipment and to reach planets in other sectors, you need to beat certain bosses. To even fight these bosses, You need to craft a specific boss item that requires a great deal of investment itemwise. Pixels and your valuable metals are commonplace, but some bosses require even more work than that(Such as the robot boss, which requires a rare drop using a weapon that does annoyingly low damage). Most of the bosses are also pathetically easy. As me and my friend fought each one, the boss's sole strategy(With one exception) was the same as the monster's tactics of rush the player while using ranged attacks if possible. The 1st boss is th eonly one with a different strategy, and feels quite epic to fight the first time, but that only makes the coming bosses disappointing. The 2nd boss charges the player and thats all he does. The 3rd and 4th are easily defeated by simply making a thin cave of dirt. The 3rd boss can't break through it and the 4th can't either, leaving both open to attacks with no way of being a threat.\n\nEquipment-wise, Starbound fails spectacularly as the game progresses. Lets say you get the best armor you can at the beginning, and now the starting planet seems easy in comparison. You go to the next level planet, to get new ores and materials, only to find that it's like you're on the first planet with starting equipment. This is how it is ALL GAME. You go to the next level planet to get better equipment(such as titanium, or aegisalt) means the enemies now one or two shot you again, and your weapons aren't very threatening to them. Once you upgrade and are ready to go to the next planet, you face the same dilemna each time. It makes the endgame very unsatisfying, especially since the final boss(the fourth, in case you were curious) so far is basically the halfway point for gear collectors. it becomes a boring grind to get better equipment that means nothing at the endgame. It comes across as uninspired to just have the next planet be a gear check to the best you have. Theres nothing unique about later enemies or later armors, except for the armor's look.\n\nThere are a few redeeming qualities about Starbound however. The planets look very nice, with beautiful visuals and different biomes. There are dungeons to explore and villages to trade it. These feel like where the real work of Starbound is. The villages full of friendly people and guards who will attack you if you come across as hostile. The dungeons that feel scary and unique and feel rewarding(at time at least). Finding my first Glitch castle was an amazing sight, though all of the enemies went down easily, and the treasure was lackluster at that point of the game. It was still amazing, seeing the unique decorations, the atmosphere of each dungeon, and the enemies that filled them. It's a shame the enemies have no real AI beyond the standard though. Would have been nice to raid an avian temple and find snipers or grenade traps instead of guards with guns that were hardly a problem for my two swords.\n\nOverall, the game is disappointing to anyone looking for a Terraria-like experience. Even looking at this as it's own game, it's bland and there is no real difference between the races besides visuals. The bosses are not a challenge, the enemy AI is overly simple, the equipment feels pointless, and progression is sluggish and frustrating. For this game to cost 15 dollars is insane, especially since Terraria is ten bucks and frequently on sale for a quarter of that. Theres alot i didn't cover, such as the pixel system(the currency you use in almost every recipe that'll keep you grinding), the weather system(Acid rain can bite me.), and the unique bits of planets at times(Poison water everywhere!? and now i'm freezing?!). Just.. Don't get this game till it's done.

Building is okay but there's already tons of other games that allow you to do the same.\n\nCurrently, the main path of progression can be distilled to a pattern; go underground and find relevant minerals you need, make the best armor you can from them, do an instanced mission that requires you to be suited up in said armor, and get a passive upgrade which always makes death from drowing impossible and allows access to a new tier of harder planets (atmosphere reasons) where you repeat the process. By the time you hit the final armor tier, there's only sidequests remaining and the only relevant rewards they lead up to are bigger ship sizes, which are also required for all kinds of tech upgrades. Those can be fun, but it's probably very late by then and thus probably not worth the effort. Having a mission hub that's accessible from literally every system in the game via gates is also not really the best approach to a game that supposedly allows us to explore the universe and its mysteries, I really hope this is a temporary beta thing. Especially when there's a threat trying to kill off the playable races in hiding.\n\nBy far the most insulting gameplay aspect however are the actual planets themselves. They are all practically dull and generic mono-biome worlds with little variation, so you'll only ever see an ocean if you go to an ocean planet and a forest if you visit a forest planet. Every planet has its underground with some mini-biomes shoved in between the surface and the planet core (a bottomless pit covered up with lava), and regardless of what races have a settlement on the surface you're guaranteed to find a mix of buildings from different cultures scattered about that are just...there. If we compared world generation to something like Terraria, and remember that we're going to all kinds of planets, there is definitely so much lost potential. Of all features in the current product, this is definitely the most underlooked of them all. Planets need to offer much more than just one biome and ideally should have some unique qualities to separate most of them from being samey. There needs to be more to them than just being there to be stripmined by the player.\n\nAnother nitpick would be the energy system, which is tied to both weaponry and tech. The two would be better off having their own resources so mobility enhancements and ammo aren't one and the same.\n\nWorst of all, the game is very definitely held back by its development. It takes absurd amounts of time for Starbound to have some kind of meaningful update and the game has been on the early access market for quite some time now. Development is very thin and slow, and thus it will likely be many more years before it gets any real meat on the bones, and that's if it even does get any at all. Hell, playable races do not even have their unique traits yet despite the specific bonuses being planned ages ago!\n\nThis is yet another 'what could have been' game whose potential will likely go forever untapped. Unless a gigantic and ambitious game mod can tap into that, I seriously cannot recommend this game for those who are fond of games such as Terraria.","September 3, 2015","false","55.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Honestly, I'm not sure why it's still listed as early access.\n\nFirst of all, you will discover very quickly that the game devolves into nothing more than repetition. Go to the new tier of worlds, get the new tier of resources, use new resources to go to the next tier. Rince, wash, repeat.\n\nThe exploration is admittedly exhilerating for a while. It didn't get boring to me until after I got to the 4th or 5th tiers when I realized that all 5 million planets are essentially the same exact thing. When I finally got to visit exotic biomes like the tentacle biome, I couldn't even tell the difference between it and the rest of the planets. The same boring algorithm randomly generates all planets using the same pieces. Once you seen the pieces, exploration is never thrilling again, so enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nLastly and most importantly, it's been half a year since I've seen a noticeable update to this game. I guess the devs got all the early access money they wanted and just stopped bothering.\n\nThis game is just one of the many successful early access games I've seen, and contributes to a larger problem I'm having with early access games. Once a game goes early access, it never seems to be anything but early access. This is the problem with a business model where the customer willingly pays a game company the full retail price for their game before the game is ready. The company no longer has any need to continue spending money and time on the product because they've already been paid. Unless some sort of contrat legally holds the company to a set of promises, the early access model will continue to be a flaw in the industry.","July 28, 2014","false","97.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I found out the good news while browsing my email box on the toilet. I had ingested quite a few microwave burritos that I found in a box behind my garage, earlier in the day, so naturally my stomach felt as if it were filled with a sludge of toxic dooky matter. But I digress, I was sitting there on the toilet perusing my netbook and reading email when *DING* I got the giftcode in my inbox. I was so surprised that at that moment my unpuckered ♥♥♥♥ began expelling the most raunchiest blast of poodoo ever, launching me far across the bathroom and lodging me in the wall between rooms. That is where I am now, typing this missive while awaiting the latest patch so that I can continue my Starbound adventure.

Any updates we got were just filler to make it look like the game was actually going somewhere. On top of that, those updates constantly killed mods, servers, and save files. I revisited the game recently, and I can safely say that it is not any better than it was when it originally launched, in some ways it's even worse than it was originally.\n\nThe game falls under the same problem that a lot of Early Access games have, where the devs say "Hey we aren't going to be like all the other Early Access people, we care about who buys the game and will make a lot of updates!"\n\nIn short, they are exactly like those people.

But, with all the bugs and uncompleted places this game has to get a negative and this is why:\n\n-no updates:\nI don't understand why but the site shows that they got a lot of backup (tons of back up from fans, a big team, and a lot of time) but for some reason we barley get any updates, the last update (the winter update) was pretty good but still this is an early access game and if we are going to get just 1 update every year than that's just lazy, and what makes it worse is they have so much resources why so slow then?\n\n-not much promises made:\nThey promised a new race (which is the only promise they kept) and a lot of new biomes and races having each their own ability and pets and I can seriously just go all day long with these promises that aren't being made.\n\n-so much unfinished part:\nThe game is pretty huge and and vast. But, after hours of playing it i find a lot and I mean A LOT of unfinished materials that makes you feel that this is just a cheep game.\nThey show you a lot of biomes in the trailer which is true. But, after a while playing it you'll find yourself just playing on the same area but with different sand and stone blocks, biomes like jungles and forest and snowy areas are quit different but because these are just the vanilla biomes, when they "supposed" to have huge acid biomes and weird sand areas and huge mountains and asteroids it's literally just the same dangerous areas over and over again, there is no difference between acid and lava they both do the same damage, asteroids just feel like I'm playing with the snow biome but with low gravity, there are so many planets with (what I feel is) just random hazards, I mean when I'm in a forest planet and you tell me that there will be raining fire on my head I'll just sit and say "wtf does fire do with a forest biome" or I'm on a snowy planet then it starts to rain acid for some reasons or (not sure if it's a bug or just a one time thing (FYI it happened to me twice)) I'm on one of the new ocean biomes and it starts to rain rocks on me.\nAnd now we are done with the biomes let's start with items:\nWhich my main anger is ITS BEEN 2 F***ING YEARS AND YOU GUYS STILL HAVENT MADE BULLETS TO GUNS, yes just like what i said, it's been 2 years and yet guns still work on energy system and if guns would of shoot lasers I would be "ya kinda makes sense I mean its freakin laser why wouldn't it use energy" but no,they use god damn bullets so why does it consume energy? does my characters finger gets so tired from pulling the god damn trigger that he consumes energy? And why I'm b****ing about this because you need energy to use your special ability (the abilities you get from collecting data chip) which makes you have to worry about using your gun or abilities (it get seriously frustrating when you only have low tier armor)\nAnd not just that, but shields have 0 stats, they all just BLOCK which makes me scratch my head when my wooden shield blocks grenades, missiles, energy blasts, probably nukes at this rate.\nAnd because this game is still unfinished there are no upgradable beds which makes when you try to regain health it takes ages especially when you have high tier armor.\n\n-bugs:\nSo many bugs so little time so I'll just count the funniest bugs that happened to me.\n-Once I was getting attacked by a mob of animals so I tried hiding by digging underground and close above me and when I did they just kept jumping above me when suddenly the started to teleport in and attack me and I died\n-another time I was fighting the skeleton dragon boss when suddenly I jumped and he hit me and instead of the normal nock back push I instead went flying in the air (I reached outer space) and died of fall damage\n-and the best one yet, I was messing around so I provoked some robot knights and when they came they hit me a couple of times but for some reason one of them hit me and I went right through the ground and died........HAZZA\n\n-probably just a personal preference but so much god damn SAND (let's see how many times I'll say sand in here)\nSO. MUCH. GOD. DAMN. SAND\nReally feel I'm alone with this one but GOD why do I find sand every f***ing SAND and it gets in my way so many times, "I'm in the forest what's that in front of me SAND, I'm going to explore a mountain hey what's that? SAND I'm underground MORE SAND......I'm now on a god damn asteroid what the actual hell do I find? ROCKS......also more SAND"\nOn a lava planet SAND/ in an amazon MORE SAND/ under the sea EVEN MORE SAND\ngod damn it gta SANDandreas had less sand than this (see the word play)\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThis game is really unfinished and I don't think it will get finished any time soon now.\nA lot of people ask me why do I hate it though it has a lot of content, I answer "there is a game that also has tons of content and it's called terraia but the difference is that the devs for terraia made sure to not just shove sh*t loads of random content (like what this game is doing) but to make a lot of good content and a complete game"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-also why I hate the devs because I feel like they are taking the fans for granted because the game got more that 4 f***ing MILLION dollars and god knows how much from steam and other parties and they still haven't finished the game.\nmake me feel like they just took the money and ran off\nsuch disappointed because this game had a chance to become a huge hit game but the devs just went greedy and ran :/","July 27, 2015","false","34.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","2"

Don't gert me wrong the PvE is okay.... at best.\n\nHowever its sacrificed exploration for linear story it got rid of fantastic, brillant content and replaced it with okay and sort of run of the mill stuff. As I mentioned the bosses were hard but you would have to find the materials and thats were the game outshined all other games on the market at the time almost literally. I explored a pirate ship that sold rocket launchers and machine guns I just found an anchor and climbed to find Avion pirates sweet jesus I thought this is brillant a pirate airship but I want MY pirate airship....\n\nSo I killed the pirates raided there equipment and built a similar model my self had guards e.t.c on board and chefs had everything a old rustic 500 block long pirate ship wanted. I fought bosses on there my security turrets gunning them down whilst i was running around shooting rockets using tech I've found to bareley survive on the deck that doubled as a death dealing arena with the hardest and most dangerous of fights I've ever had the pleasure of doing. Then assualting glitch (robot people) strong hold killing their knights and slashing my out with machine gun fire accidently summoing military army penguins complete with their boss donning a U.F.O whilst my security systems on my ship were doing all they can and I blasted him thinking goobye you son of a gun you fought well broke some of my men and turrets but it was the most fun I've ever had...... that is until they updated the game....\n\nWhere do I begin? for starters they still let you build but have given you a hub okay not a badarse capital death dealing pirateship with over 200 guards but I can live with that its just an outpost on some asteriod pretty cool.... but wait linear quests that are pretty boring go get a coffee cup and spoon in that order then a paper plane to fight the penguins rather then you DISCOVER the boss for yourself.\n\nNext you have the PvE (if it can be called that) of the game, again previously you would explore and come across dungeons and structures of immense proportions now the game is setting you on a path that once you die you have to  do it all over again and again... and again which gets pretty boring. Ordinarily I'd think "right lets have some fun summon a boss or explore see what chaos unfolds" now it's go do a dungeon we have set it so thats EXACTLY the same over and over\n\nSecondly I originally played terraria for a while and got to hardmode thought okay a whole new experience thats pretty cool mechanical bosses and difficulty ramped up so much compared to normal mode.... but since 1.3 they have added in so much. Whilst not a new difficulty its added martian madness, enjoy killing aliens and cultists of ridiculous power and challenge yourself so you can get cool new items and fight in the sky whilst spells from the cosmos try to obliterate you, oh by the way did you want a epic boss fight here we have the moon lord kill him and get amazing loot to alter the worlds gravity or harness amazing spells as if made from a deity or a oracle.\n\nStarbound what have you added exactly.... secondary attacks and staffs.... a very narrow story a couple of new enviroments and pets that don't really do anything?....\n\nFinally the main nail in the coffin for me is...\n\nTHIS GAME HAS BEEN IN EARLY ACCESS SINCE JUNE 2013!!!! almost 3 years\n\nSo to round it all off\n\nPROS\n\n-Has a excllent exploration\n\nNEUTRAL (things that are opinated in my books)\n\n-Crafting and progression is not really intresting (as its just a straight upgrade)\n\n-Community are gradually wading into negitivity for games release\n\n-Sandbox has now become linear (not nesccarily bad but needs work)\n\nCONS\n\n-Got rid of MOTIVATION to explore the world thanks to the outpost\n\n-Combat is terrible just use hammers and a really powerful ranged weapon (you win everytime)\n\n-Bosses are boring and whilst new mechanics have been introduced its still the same fight over and over rather then destructable terrain and minions popping in to ruin your day e.t.c\n\n-The legendary enemies are just total garbage due to being able to craft a better weapon at next tier tier 10 beats all weapons IF used correctly\n\n-Devs raely update the game since I posted this it was 27th June 2015 the last update was on 27th April 2014 3 months nothing new... and previous patches made this game slowly slope downhill\n\nThats my full on honest review from my opinion if I were to rate this I would say...\n\nHOLD OFF ON ALL COSTS\n\nStarted out great went bad didn't meet my needs then went toxic and everything about the devs makes me annoyed since they almost abandoned this once lovely game GO PLAY TERRARIA INSTEAD ;)\n","July 27, 2015","false","67.5"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

It used to be hard enough to find settlements that it felt fufiling when you found one. The procedurelly generated enemies used to be amazing. The enviroments used to be unique and look amazing. There used to be a bunch of unique trees and such. There used to be a bunch of unique bosses that were fun to fight and challenging. The combat system used to be unique, interesting and fuctional. There used to be randomly generated treasure caves which was essentially like exploring a world for hidden treasures, which was fun.\n\nEverything about this game can pretty much be summed up with the three words "used to be"\nThis game used to be a fun and unique experience and was personally one of my favorite games, but then the devs just removed everything unique and fun about the game and made it so generic. You can now find dozens of settlements on every planet, removing the fun of searching dozens of planets to find one. The procedurally generated enemies have been replaced with generic stock enemies. Survival stuff such as cold and hunger have been removed, which makes surviving on ice planets (which used to be fun and challenging) a piece of cake. The treasure caves that I love so much have now been removed and all tresure is now in the pre-made dungeon on planets.\n\nEssentially, to put it midly, in order to understand what the current version of Starbound is... take Terraria... remove all the bosses and replace them with generic easy to beat ones... break the combat system... and generally remove everything fun about it...

My friends and I bought 2 4 packs and we gifted copies for everyone. We thought it was going to be the new Terraria. The new Minecraft. The new hotness. We were wrong. When we started playing, I was shocked at how little content was in the game. The planets had one or two monsters. The planets were tiny. Gameplay consisted of looting the shamelessly tiny planets and moving on. Planets were mostly just randomly generated blobs of terrain consisting of 1 or 2 monster types. You left click them. They die.\n\nThere are bosses, however... You can encase them in dirt. It makes them powerless. This has been a "feature" of the game since launch.\n\nThe pace of development has been painfully slow. There are updates that are released, but they consist of minor bugfixes and some tweaks. Very little content has been added since my original purchase.\n\nI've played Terraria. I've played Starbound. Terraria is a much better, more fun, content-filled game. Starbound feels like a game with no purpose.

But why develop content for a game that you've already sold? You cant sell it twice. I feel that they are leaving too much to the modding community, and not focused enough on delivering a solid, stand alone Game. Maybe they dont' want to release any patches that hamper the modders freedom to customize the game the way they like it, but who knows.\nMy only major gripe is that the game being incomplete makes me feel that at any time all my works will simply vanish; the way my ship locker did. I have no desire to build at the moment, because they will wipe the worlds again when they finalize the universe map.When progression is changed to center around various hazards that will be found on the planets, it will probably be safe to build again. I cant' complain about the lack of content too much since the game simply isn't finished yet, but they really havn't made much progress towards their ideal, randomly generated game structure; as the current quest line ends after the first boss. Progression after the fourth boss is so fast, I'd really have prefered they left out the remaining levels.\nThe game is VERY FUN and addicting, right up until you hit the "Impervium Wall." A damning blow that launched all my friends out of the game, and confined me to my ship. The game will need much more substance than what is currently available before I could recommend it as it is now. That all being said; dont' buy this game YET, but you'll definetly want to play it later on. Starbound will have far more, longer lasting appeal ONCE ITS READY for showtime. If you get it now, it might spoil the fun.    also... their other games are looking pretty decent too.","March 23, 2014","false","610.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I've always internally defined "beta" like this: "The game runs for longer than 20 minutes without crashing, and the bulk of its initial featureset is implemented, however don't expect completeness or stability". While the first part of this definition interestingly disqualifies certain Skyrim patches, Starbound fits the definition perfectly - I can run the game for hours on end, with no crashes, and I do get the odd bug here and there (also it doesn't seem like Chucklefish has figured out balance yet at the time of this writing). If you buy in early, be prepared for character wipes - they seem to be rare currently, but\n\nNow onto the game itself. Essentially, the game is "Terraria in Space". This isn't a bad thing. In fact, Starbound improves on many concepts Terraria introduced (e.g. player manipulated background tiles - no need to convert your stone blocks into "stone walls", just select your cobblestone and right click), as well as adding brand new things such as FTL travel to other planets. Getting bored of your starting planet? Drop some fuel into your ship and take off, you never know what you're going to find! Heck, the new planet may already have people and civilization there!\n\nAll in all, I give this game ten Florans out of a wood table (positive marks).","December 11, 2013","true","10.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The architecture and design team is un-focused. This team does not appear to have anyone leading it whom is capable of drawing out their potential.

The first thing I did was travel to a new planet. After realizing I shouldn't break sequences in the game even if I could, I started over. I collected a bit of wood, and tried to accept the main quest reward. It wouldn't let me, but I did delete and give up on the main quest, so now I'm no longer able to progress the story. Nice.... So I tried one last time, went down, got some wood, next thing I know some insane alien starts attacking me.

Created by British indie studio Chuckle Fish Ltd, Starbound is more a spiritual successor to Terraria than a clone. Starbound is also very successful with over 1 million copies sold compared to Terraria's 2 Million. Starbound is still in early access and as such some of the things discussed in this review might change.\n\nPlayers start on a random planet in the alpha galaxy, they have to build a base, find ores and build a distress beacon which will trigger your first Boss battle. Starbound combat is more RPG like than Terraria's. playing the game was a lot like some of the popular Japanese RPG, where Terraria's combat was all about crazy weapons Starbound is more about exploring and combat feels more slow-paced. but that's not really bad. it's just different.\n\nStarbound has a some story unlike Terraria or Minecraft. each race is different and exciting to learn about. The Humans, forced to flee their planet after a monster invasion. The Glitch a robotic race that is stuck in medieval times. the Avian a bird-like race that fight for their god. the Floran, a violent race of plant creatures who are hated by most of the galaxy. the Apex, an Ape like race that is Superior in mind. and the Hylotl a pacifist fish race.\n\nStarbound seems to have looked at Terraira and try to do what it did but better. and in some areas it is. for example in starbound to place a wall all you have to do is right click. and the cool thing about Starbound is that with some many planets out there its hard to see them all. however Starbound's planets can start to get boring after awhile. the only types of planets are Deserts,Forest,Jungle,Moon,snow, and lava. i wish there where more water like worlds. the kind that always rain and stuff. also when on Moons the gravity doesn't seem to change that much. one cool thing in Starbound is the fact that some planets get asteroids that rain down on the surface. the not so cool thing is that these will destroy a good part of any surface buildings you may have built. in Starbound you can place NPC spawners, with this you can spawn guards, merchants and just some friendly NPCs to stay in your base. the NPCs will sit down on chairs, sleep in beds, and chat with each other. it helps to make your world feel alive.\n\nStarbound like Terraria has a lot of furniture and objects you can place to make your house/base look any way you want. and with a unlimited galaxy you have millions of maps to mess around with. also your maps stay with you no matter who you play as. so if you build a base with one person then go make a new character and come back to the same planet the base will be there. the same thing applies for mulitplayer.\n\nSpeaking of mulitplayer, Starbound does have multiplayer but because it is in such an early state getting into games can be hard to do. but if you can connect to games the mulitplayer works fine. and allows you to have chaos with your friends.\n\nLike Terraria, Starbound has bosses that can be summoned for you to fight. right now there are only four bosses in the game, but more are on the way. so far i have to say that the bosses are pretty bland. a giant UFO, a Robot, a jelly fish, and a dragon made out of bones. there is a fifth boss in development that looks unique but right now the bosses kinda of suck.\n\nIf you enjoyed Terraria or Minecraft then Starbound is a good choice for you. the only thing else i dislike about it is the fact that it sells for $15 during its Early Access while Terraria a fully completed game that is STILL getting new stuff sells for $10.  to be clear Starbound is in NO WAY a "clone" or a "copy" of Terraria, it is a game that was inspired by Terraria but it is its own game","May 16, 2014","true","63.8"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","2"

I really can't recommend this game enough, it's absolutely fantastic and even more fun playing with friends. A great game that I absolutely can't wait to see the finished product of.","January 16, 2014","true","78.7"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","26","44","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/planr/recommended/211820/","planr","Planr, King of Noobs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/planr/","37 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nStarbound is my first 2D-style indie game I have ever played before, so I write this from my perspective, as a person who is new to Terraria-style games; and who is much more experienced with 3D indie games like Starmade, Blockland and Minecraft. I've been playing indie games for many years now and I have begun to get rather bored with nearly everything I play. So, I decided I would play this game hoping to be surprised with a new and unexpected style of gaming.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nA moderately fun game to play overall, but it tends to get boring after playing it for 3 days, with nothing really new or interesting to do. I mean, sure, it's all different environments everywhere you go, but fundamentally none of it is much different; you'll find pretty much the same stuff no matter where you go.\n\nThe gameplay is quite repetitive, with your main goal mostly being to just keep your ship fueled so you can travel to new places, where you will spend yet again most of your time mining for more fuel. And once you level up to the top tier of technology, weapons and armor, there isn't much else that's new to do. There is a quest system but even though I played the game for over a week solidly, I could not seem to find any quests of any sorts to give it any use, other than the tutorial quests I started out with.\n\nIt has a considerably steep learning curve. When I first picked it up and played it, I found its controls unintuitive and difficult to use, and the tutorial didn't help much either with figuring this out. If you are a person who is completely new to Starbound and know nothing about it when you start a new game, expect to die many many many times, until you figure out the way to play. Because of this, I highly recommend looking at player-made guides to the game, though those may contain gameplay spoilers.\nAfter you figure out the basics, you will mostly spend your time trying to advance through the different "tiers" of armor, techology and weapons. In search of resources to make better stuff for yourself, you will also stumble across underground ruins, creepy tombs, tribal villages, and even robot/monkey space facilities of sorts. It's also very fun to launch a big attack on a village and burn their buildings to the ground, if you're the sadistic type.\n\nUnfortunately, the resource requirements for items is absurd. To get better weapons and armor and technology, you have to spend many tireless and rather boring hours of clicking and popping your way through layers of blocks to find large amounts of resources for a small piece of body armor or that next gun or sword. And if you get injured while off exploring, you better hope you get lucky enough to find some sort of vine or cactus vegetation in a cave and collect several of them to make a tiny bandage that heals only a small percentage of your health.\n\nAs for gameplay difficulty, it's very very difficult to survive when you first play, and the difficulty options don't offer much choices that would go easy on newbies. You have difficulty option choices like that in SCP Containment Breach: Temporary death or Permanent death. There is no "peaceful" or "normal" or "hard" option like in Minecraft. Oh, and you can expect to be constantly falling into pools of deadly poison when stumbling around in dark caves, or getting attacked, with no real way of your body regenerating health on its own. So, have fun with that.\n\nAs for aesthetics, it is a rather appealing game and carries its atmosphere of 2D alien planets fairly well, with cute cartoonish textures that reminded me of some nostalgic Cartoon Network flash games I used to play when I was a little kid. The graphics look fairly nice I guess for this genre, but I haven't played any other Terraria-style games so I don't have anything I can fairly compare it to.\n\nOne feature I especially like is the way the liquids work. Unlike Minecraft and other games where liquid sources are either just solid blocks or flowing things that don't really spread out evenly but act like an illogical geyser, the liquid physics in Starbound act like you'd expect liquids would in a 2D game. If a pond springs a leak into a cave, you can expect that cave to be filled with all the pond's water quite soon and no water left in the pond. If a pocket of lava is mined into, there's a big danger it could fall right over you and kill you!\n\nThere is very little actual space-oriented gameplay. You can't change your ships appearance except for adding furniture on the inside, you cant pilot your ship yourself (everything is done with an onboard autopilot; you just choose a destination), and you cant have space battles. This is a significant blow to the "Star" in StarBound.\n\n\nFeature wise, there are many different things you can do, though in the current state of the game there are some things which one could obviously wish they could change upon.\n\nFeatures:\n- Build a base/house/evil lair of doom on planets, asteroids and whatnot.\n- Fight cool and seemingly procedurally-generated monsters\n- Explore endless open planets with different environments and even multiple different biomes on each of them\n- Pillage and conquer villages, homes and secret bases built by monkeys, anthropomorphic birds, talking flower creatures, aliens, and even robots.\n- Craft and arm yourself with a plethora of different defenses and offenses\n- Collect resources for your base by mining for more resources, all the while digging towards the planet's core.\n- Research technology to let yourself have special moves and powers to help with combat, climbing and digging.\n- Play online with friends and have even more fun building things together, or just messing around and pillaging other players for fun\n\nAs for pros and cons...\nPros:\n- Game is very stable, quite impressive for an early-access game. Very few crashes.\n- Lots of different features, as mentioned in above list.\n- Decent graphics\n- Online gameplay\n\nCons:\n- Very little actual space-oriented gameplay.\n- Unfitting soundtrack of symphony-piano style music.\n- Extremely sharp and difficult learning curve.\n- Gameplay gets boring after several days\n- Not much to do once you get to the top tier aside build more and shoot stuff.\n- No story/campaign mode\n\n\nOverall, the game is like that one gift you get from an estranged distant relative, which you find appealing to look at and hold for several days, and then never touch it again. It's fun and sparkly to play for a little while, but it gets boring fast if you're a serious and dedicated gamer. I can honestly say the experience I had with it was interesting but I wouldn't want to play this game again until it gets a massive future update that fundamentally changes the way it's played. I guess 2D games just aren't for me.","March 3, 2014","false","25.4"," 47 of 84 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","47","84","0","2"

The world presents itself as a magnanimous, peaceful haven with birds chirping and the wind blowing. Your character has the freedom to dig deep, deep down into the planet you've landed on, or search in either direction for goodies in caves and randomly-generated establishments. While the option for customization in terms of aesthetics isn't mind-bogglingly large, the game offers a wide array of materials, colors, and clothing options to choose from. Maybe not on the level that Minecraft has been famous for, but it's enough to complement the game's beautifully serene and awe-inspiring landscapes.\n\nHowever, at nighttime, creatures of all kinds stalk the surface (and underbelly) of each planet. The game, too, gives you a selection of weapons to choose from, each with their own statistics and features.\n\nThere is enough here to purchase the game: from the jaw-dropping mountains, caverns, lakes, and forests, to (personally) one of the most relaxing and beautiful soundtracks to a game I've ever heard. I have literally felt my shoulders ease up tension and relax from listening to the title screen song.\n\nNevertheless, the game is still in development. Yes, you will come across useless items with no current purpose. Yes, you may encounter a character wipe as a result of a patch. And yes, you will grow tired of the redundant mining, chopping, and crafting necessary to get the momentum going in this game. But in the end, it is all worth it, because when your character lay there in the bed you've crafted under the warm glow of a finely perched torch in the dark of the night, your home will seem more than just pixels on a computer screen: you will feel a sense of impending happiness and accomplishment in your tangible self for having created something so unique from the recesses of your mind. You will feel part of a planet, of a solar system. This game could be argued as a metaphor for the insignificant-yet-significant impact humanity can and has made on this planet, and, heck, maybe the next one over.\n\nExplorers, get this game. Thinkers and creators, pick it up ASAP. Adventurers, don some armor.\n\nStarbound is not a revolutionary idea in any sense in terms of gaming, but it is a fresh start to the void of game development games have seldom crossed: limitlessness.\n\nIt is unlike any Minecraft or Terraria knockoff you will find on the gaming market. It is a personal, transcendent experience with the great beyond, right here on your computer.\n\nIt's an entire universe, and it's just begging for your attention.","January 7, 2014","true","63.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

It is, its not worth the time and honestly it has alot of potential, but the devs really screwed up. The controls are confusing, the first boss is a Penguin in a UFO, that hard to beat unless you have a bunch of good stuff. Mining is impossible since ores are so far and few between. You never know which animals want to be friends or eat you, so getting jumped by fluffy monsters is really misleading. After the first 20 minutes you sit back and wonder "Why the bloody hell am I playing this, back to CS:GO"","May 2, 2014","false","40.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schismm_/recommended/211820/","schismm_","Schismm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schismm_/","79 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is an AWESOME game. Tons to explore, so much stuff to do, the enemies are challenging, the variety of planets is astounding, and the setting makes a great place for roleplay if you're into that. The dungeons are strange but exciting, and there's almost always a reward (with the exception of Sewer Dungeons). The randomized enemies make it even better, as you almost never see the same creature on a different planet. 10/10 easily. If you liked Terraria, this will sell it for you, big time.","December 8, 2013","true","81.1"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"
