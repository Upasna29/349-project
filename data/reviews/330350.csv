What I find strage though is that they didn't change/optimize anything for pc, I won't go into details but the menus are poorly exicuted.\nAfter watching a shrot movie, level 1 drops you into the game with no instructions. I pressed all the keys and found "U" and "e" brings up a basic menu, "r" restarts the level, "space" and "x" ues a jetpack and "Z" fires a missile. I didn't even know he could fire until 15 min in and there's no options screen so you can't look over the controls. There's a startup popup box where you can change the controls... In theory. It doesn't actually work, and the keys I described don't show up as bound to anything.\nAs a runner game, the screen will always scroll you right. The gameplay is nice, the levels are well put toghether and while the artwork is appealing, it isn't very defined. I keep crashing into objects look like they're part of the background. It's also not clear which objects damage you, which ones you can blow up and what powerups do. The biggest problem I have is that my jetpack keeps stalling. At first I thought it runs out of fuel but now I think it has to do with how high you are on the screen. An indicator of when I can and can't use it would be nice. This game gives you no information.\nEvery now and then you will get to ditch the jetpack robot and use bigger ships, I found these levels the best. There are 2 chapters with 10 levels each and 4 bonus levels in the game.\nIt is playable and can be fun, but understand the production values are low and no one bothered to put on much polish. While I can't find the mobile version, this is a standard android game. On the android marketplace, the first chapter would typically be free and the rest would be $1. Or free all the way with ads maybe.","November 20, 2014","false","2.7"," 106 of 126 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","106","126","7","2"

What I appreciate about this game is the option to choose your robot(ex) skin, with nods to some cultural characters like Iron Man. Even the weapon arsenal is a welcomed feature, although I have tried so far 3 different types, each one of them better than the previous one. I would have suggested to put them, along with the skins, as unlockables for the replay value but judging by the overall experience, these features can't redeem the game enough to get a positive review.\n\nThere's not much to say besides the fact that this game is so unpolished to the point that it's like a C-grade school project by aspiring, wanna-be game developers. The amount of visual contents, weapon/skin variety and such does show promise of the developers' ambition and might serve as a stepping stone to something better and more playable, should they learn from the critics.

For the most part you are automatically moving forward, there is no back or stop unless you count rocks and scenery. Unbreakable rocks scattered along the ground must be scaled with the thrust, but thrust has to be used very gently else you fly off the top of the screen and that kills. Timing is everything or you bang into enemies, gas clouds and many other things that will kill you, some being quite hard to see against the background.\nSome levels have you in a turret position and all you have to do is shoot, these levels are too easy and ultimately dull.\n\nThere is a choice of weapons pre stage start and none of them blew me away, excuse the pun. The menu system where you choose your stage/level and especially the replay/after death (which you will see a lot of) are poorly designed and irritating. The graphics and sound are nothing special.

It could be better.\n--\nNote: There's a "Classic" mode and a "Turbo" mode.  This review is based on "Classic."\n\nRobotex is a hybrid of puzzle and shooter.  It presents itself like a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up, but earning medals is more like solving a puzzle.  The "puzzle-shooter hybrid" was fantastically executed by another game, Ikaruga.  What differences are there between these two games, such that Ikaruga was fantastic and Robotex lackluster?\n\nShmups present a lot of information at once.  Skillful players can filter out the important bits, like where the player hitbox is and what's going to kill you.  Robotex fails to adequately distinguish gameplay elements from fluff.  The background elements blend with the foreground elements so much that it's unclear what is an obstacle and what isn't.  The "cloud" enemies are a good example of an important element that's hard to see.  Special effects, such as explosions, are painted on top of all other elements, including lethal projectiles.  Being unable to see what killed you leads to a lot of unfair deaths.\n\nShmups require precision both to dodge and to aim, and precision requires tight controls.  In other words, the player model should react instantly and predictably to my commands.  The controls of Robotex require you to look ahead, which is impossible with these graphics.  Pressing the "fly" button builds momentum (until the robot crosses an invisible line, with no indication that the rockets have stopped), after which the robot goes into freefall.  Holding "fly" an instant too long or too short can be disastrous, and you may not know which until it's too late.  Aim and movement are combined, so that you can only aim down when you're moving up, and can only aim forward when you're falling.  To aim at an enemy directly ahead, you must fly above it.  The delayed, sometimes unpredictable movement makes Robotex a game of trial and error, rather than a game of skill.\n\nAn example of a difficult prediction: http://i.imgur.com/eiAUcfn.jpg\nThe black cloud damages anything underneath it.  Start flying too soon, and you won't land on the rock.  Start flying too late, and you'll hit the cloud.  Let go too soon, and you won't land on the rock.  Let go too late, and you'll hit the ceiling and lose all forward velocity.  By the way, the rock is above the "invisible line" where rockets stop working.\n\nAny game with a score system challenges the player not only to complete the game, but to complete the game well.  The "puzzle" aspect of Robotex is to acquire all the bonus medals.  That means playing each level again and again, figuring out exactly how to approach each enemy and then executing the plan.  Unfortunately, it's hard to see the enemies in the first place, and harder still to perform the plan given these controls.  Shmups are enjoyed for requiring the player to react to the environment while permitting different ways to tackle the challenges presented.  Robotex offers very limited choices, which makes replaying each level routine instead of unique.\n\nThere are many smaller areas that could be improved.  There could be more variety to the graphical themes of levels.  There could be more variety in pacing, slower sections with fewer enemies contrasted by frenetic sections with many dangers, or static obstacles contrasted with moving dangers.  There could be music.  There are bugs.\n\nAll in all, Robotex is a game that was worth the nine cents I paid for it.  With some spit-shine, it could be worth up to a dollar.  If you're a game designer, it's an excellent example of what goes wrong when you fail to follow certain shmup tropes.","August 28, 2015","false","2.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you came here for trading cards, get it; if not, leave. NOW. The sound mixing is awful. The controls are unresponsive. There is no way to tell what part of the scenery can be hit, and what can't.

The buttons showing the controls stay at the bottom of the screen the entire game, and take up a 4th of the screen.

I guess with abilities that are not explained instead they require you to either guess or play each and every single picture ability until you actually find the decent one.\nThere are only 2 buttons need on a keyboard for this which as said by ithers is Z and X. X uses the projectiles which you shoot at things. Z is like a jetpack that just goes up. The game automatically moves forward. Honestly if it was a flash game on a browser then it would be fine but to pay on steam is a disgrace and leaves me wondering how something like it could even dream of getting past greenlight.\nHonestly though as I mentioned if it was a free flash game on browser it would be O.K. not great but not bad.

I had no idea what anything was, but I did manage to select a new character face and a laser weapon.\n- Unclear game. The enemies and objects aren't explained, so you just end up shooting everything.\n- Getting stuck. I fired up the jetpack and had a feeling I was playing Jetman (AKA the game that came before Flappy Bird). I then flew into a wall and got stuck within it.  I reset the level by pressing 'R'.  I got past the wall this time and flew myself right under a falling wooden log, it didn't kill me - but I became stuck.  I had to reset the level again by pressing 'R'.  Thinking I'd beat the log I flew upwards and got stuck on something again, only this time it was a pink fog and it didn't kill me (I found out later it's poison that does kills you).  I reset the level game by pressing 'R'...  Got stuck on a few more things again and so closed the game by pressing 'ALT+F4'.","April 17, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, having said that I have to mention that it is not clear what the user-interface items are.  The game drops you on a selection screen but gives you no indication why you are selecting something and what the difference between those selections is.\n\n*Spoiler* On the first level a tree falls on you without any warning (ie. it is not even visible on the screen until it crushes you) and your robot is stuck.  You cannot move, but you do not die.  You just sit there until you restart the level.  There are a couple buttons on the "menu" but none of them are explained, and 2 of them seem to do nothing.\n\nLike the other reviews I paid next to nothing for this to get the trading cards, so I cannot complain.

The maps are all the same with just added clutter to make it more difficult in the aspect of not knowing what the hell is even going on. Not to mention the lack of instructions on what buttons does what and what setting is relevent. Nothing tells you what cons and pros each weapon type or character has so you need to just spam Z and X (which is basically what this 5$ flash game is) until you die or by luck figure out what the hell does what.\n\n5$ is too much to charge for such an unpolished and lacking game, its worth MAYBE 1$, but i've come across a couple 1$ gams with more to offer than this entire game.

I bought it on 90% sale and it still wasn't worth it.\n\nYou can tell how bad the game is going to be from the amateurish-looking main menu.\nThere's no Tutorial, no explanation of what you are doing in the game whatsoever, the game just starts and it's like "yeah, figure it out for yourself".\nAnd even if you do, it's so frustrating because it's so poorly designed, you can't tell what can harm you or help you. Things just fall off the sky and crash you, things just appear and kill you instantly, things electrocute you even though you can barely see them...\n\nThe developers put in the description of this game that "The game is hard."

Whoever ported it over did a really, really bad job. It has simple controls, hold space to go up, let go of space to go down and press P to fire. Another issue with the game is that is says it has full audio support for 27 languages. The reason they have full audio support for so many languages is because it has no audio, except music. After getting used to these 2 issues, I started playing the game, only to realise that at some points, stuff would randomly fall on you without any visual que. I found this really frustrating and found it hard to believe that this game even managed to get onto steam. Overall, I would rate this game 1/10. Only buy this to gift to your friends to cause them alot of pain and suffering.","April 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"
