It loads slowly, it is ugly and even the terrible graphics sometimes can not handle the game.\nIt also crashes, making it impossible to get 100% achievements, because you have to complete the game without ever closing it.","June 6","false","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
