I especially appreciate the deep and complex skill trees that allow you to play the game however you want, currently I'm using the shekel smith perks but I'm thinking of trying out a run using the kung fu panda or land before time ones. My only issue is that the sequel isn't going to be released for at least another two years due to budget constraints at the Treyarch offices, but considering how immense the game is and how much there is to do I think this game can occupy me until the next game releases.\n\nAll in all probably one of my favorite games to date.\n10/10","February 7","true","26.1"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","64","27","42","16","1"

I personally like the resemblance to early platformers (not surprised considering that this is an indie game). The levels and characters are reminiscent to the likes of Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, and other cartoony adventure games from the past. If you are interested in those kinds of games, you may want to try this one.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Interesting concept\n+ Cartoony graphics, nice special effects\n+ Has a lot of variety\n+ Inexpensive\n\nThe Bad:\n- Hard to control characters\n- Soundtrack doesn't fit the mood of the game\n- Has several glitches","January 30","true","0.7"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","57","21","37","8","0"

Absolutely nothing works right.\n\nThe first 5 seconds of this is already a nightmare, Zipple doesn't control like any good platformers, but instead plays like the mythical ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D Platformers with tank controls, like Bubsy 3D.  However, it is even much worse here, he turns at the speed of sound, with no way to change the sensitivity, so there is absolutely no way to put any finesse into the job, it's literally based on luck if you manage to point him in the right direction.\n\nThe objective of the thing is to bring some useless crap back to your house, as if it wanted to become a collectathon, and with the controls, good freaking luck.  I do love how the objective goes from wanting 6 crates down to 4 after you die, at least it makes the experience shorter, if you're as stupid as I for wanting the achievements.\n\nButton mapping is broken as hell, it has 3 firing buttons (Fire 3 seems completely useless), but you wouldn't know what does what until you test it out ingame, it even has two "Submit" buttons (which is also Pause), despite actually doing the same thing, and while mapping my vertical axis, it got somehow inverted.  The game forgets my resolution, so it goes 13600x7200 accross my two screens.\n\nI would also add that the overall aesthetics, although fitting for the gameplay, isn't even something I would've done in my first semester in college; a cartoonish theme for the levels, while the characters seems to come out of some hardcore 18+ fantasy game.  The decorations also disappears when you get close to them, as if Carlo D'Apostoli didn't understand how "Level of detail" works.\n\nAgain, it just all fits together that this was all a big joke.  Truly a work of art.","June 6","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no storyline introduction and the movement is crap so you get killed so quickly into the game that it makes Dark Souls look good.\n\nI can only surmise that almost all the positive reviews are trolling because there is nothing positive about it for me and I'm thankful this just happens to be a game that's part of a bundle so I don't feel bad about it. I'd slap myself for spending money on such ****...\n\nI've done my part to write this review.
