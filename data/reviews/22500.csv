"http://steamcommunity.com/id/curryhax/recommended/22500/","curryhax","Snake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/curryhax/","1138 products in account","First off, buy the BASE GAME + the GATHERING OF POWER expansion. It includes all the features and content of the other two DLCs and it's a very naughty move on part of the developers to still sell the older two expansions on Steam, potentially making you pay $30 to buy all the expansion content, when you can be buying it for $10.\n\nWith this unpleasant situation out of the way and despite it, I still highly recommend the game. It is co-developed by Richard Garfield of Magic: The Gathering and Netrunner fame. The game uses many concepts similar to MTG but is presented in a more casual framework. The major differences from MTG are: a) no card draw or deck but a set of semi-random given cards that don't 'run out' and are always available to cast if you have the mana, b) slot-based battlefield with two lines of 6 slots in which players summon creatures.\n\nSpectromancer is far easier to pick up and play compared to MTG. As there is no deck building, gameplay offers more limited options but the game livens things up with its unique class system, with each class getting its separate set of cards. Creature interplay is far more important and summoning order and spell support often require as much strategy as a game of MTG.\n\nMultiplayer, a very big factor for Spectromancer's appeal, is still alive and well, with available players at all times and lots of replayability given the large number of classes available.","December 16, 2013","true","62.9"," 58 of 72 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","58","72","0","0"

Do i try to get an advantage by being more mana-efficient than my opponent, do I try to win via board control or do I just rush my opponent? If you want to win you have to play to your decks strength. Also a big part of the game is reading your opponent and predicting what cards he has.\n\nOne example: I'm ahead in board control, my opponent just played a very low impact card and he has a lot of fire mana saved up, that means that he is probably preparing to play Armageddon which deals a lot of damage to all creature on the board. So if I correctly predict this I can take advantage of it by not overcommitting and not playing any expensive creatures next turn because they'd probably die.\nAdvanced players will use this to bluff you. e.g. a player might save up a lot of air mana which makes the opponent afraid of the spell Lightning Bolt, which deals massive damage to the enemy player's hp. So the opponent may waste his turn by casting expensive heals even though it was a bluff and the opponent doesn't have Lightning Bolt.\nAll this predicting and bluffing wouldn't work as well if the game didn't have a limited number of cards.\n\nOh I almost forgot the most important point about not being a TCG, the game isn't pay to win, it's all about skill.\n\n\nOther important points:\n- The game has still an active online community even though the game is 5 years old\n- The computer AI is really clever and good at predicting your moves, so if you don't like online play, it's never boring to play against the computer\n- The campaign is pretty okay, every fight has special rules, so it's nice and varied, though as I said the best thing about the game is the online play\n- you can get a lot of value out of the demo. I played like a hundred online games before I bought the game (but a year or so ago they added a 5 games per day restriction to the demo)","November 28, 2013","true","309.3"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

Steam takes care of all the DRM'y goodness you need.

I don't have much opinion on single player, as I was drawn to duel games right away. But let it be said that there are several varying game modes in addition to a campaign.\n\nMultiplayer duels is what made this game for me. There are no cards to be found or unlocked through winning or other achievements, no grinding. You have all the cards available to you right away (with an exception of expantion pack cards, which are additional entirely new decks).\n\nCards are dealt randomly, but within a predefined system, to keep things balanced. From then on, one gathers mana each turn and it's up to the player which cards to spend and when. This is a brilliant mix of luck and strategy, but with the point that you still have a chance of winning if you got bad luck. There are ways of bluffing your opponent, trying to outsmart them, manipulating them to reveal their hand, and various other tricks.\n\nThrough the two years that I have played this game, servers always have been populated enough so I would rarely have to wait more than 1 minute to find an opponent matched approximately to my level.","December 30, 2013","true","175.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopoopoopoo/recommended/22500/","poopoopoopoo","forsan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopoopoopoo/","623 products in account","Its a card game. If you don't like sometimes losing because you draw a bad hand, you shouldn't want to ever play card games. Well, Spectromancer is a bit different.\n\nThere are 4 basic elements and 1 special element depending on your mage. For each element, there are 4 cards you can play costing various amounts of mana. These cards can either be spells or monsters. These cards are reused throughout the entire match. You don't get to choose which cards you get, and you don't draw cards. You may get a different combination of cards in different matches however as there are more than four cards in each element.\n\nYou can have up to 5 monsters on your side of the field. Normally you get one of each mana per turn, but some spells give mana and a few monsters boost mana generation.\n\nI believe you start with 20 hit points and you can play a single card per turn. Gameplay is generally fast paced. You can die in a couple turns if your generated cards are weak against the enemy's. Since you get mana every turn, you can play several weaker monsters while waiting to cast a strong spell or monster.\n\nBalance between monsters is pretty good. Some are virtually unkillable with regeneration, some hit the entire enemy row, some are immune to magical spells. Spells can range from healing the player to wiping the entire field.\nThere are quite a few deck strategies to use, but since you don't pick you cards you generally decide the strategy on the first turn.\n\nCards that enhance mana generation are generally weak, but are very powerful in combination with monsters that grow stronger based on that type of mana.\nUse tanks to hold the line while nuking your opponent's life directly.\nRushing the enemy down with swarms of low mana monsters. This isn't as strong since there are several spells that do damage to multiple creatures. It could be used to safely bring out a stronger monster once your opponent has nuked the field.\n\nThe campaign is pretty fun the first few times you play. The opponents start off fairly easy and then get pretty brutal. Different decks help keep the game fresh, and the random combination of cards means you can't rely on solely one combination of cards to win games.\n\nI haven't tried the DLC, but they seem to add new mage types. These mage types represent the fifth element of mana. They are the unique cards that add even more depth to the game.\n\nI believe this game has been in an Amazon bundle recently. Therefore it probably stands to reason that if you have a backlog, you can probably wait for the eventual sale to buy this game. With Hearthstone coming out in the future, I can't see much reason to buy this game. But since that's not out yet,  you should pick this up if the game goes on sale. Fast paced card game with little rng.","January 10, 2014","true","22.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It not only captured the hearts, minds and wallets of nerds everywhere who can't get enough of it, it made the founders wealthy beyond dreams of avarice. Just like the Federal Reserve convinced everyone that paper money was better than Gold, Wizards convinced nerds everywhere that cardboard was better than paper money. One day Wizards had an epiphany. If the Federal Reserve can print unlimited amounts of money, why not print unlimited amounts of cardboard? And so they did. In a perverted form of Magic Quantitative Easing, the printing presses ran non-stop. A litany of problems symptomatic of rush releases and lack of playtesting soon plagued the game: endless erratas, rule changes, Bannings, etc... The game slowly transformed from Magic: The Gathering into Lawyer: The Travesty. A game only someone like Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney can appreciate and Barristers play as a warm up to litigation. Co-created by legendary Wizards of the Coast founder Richard Garfield, it is not surprising that Spectromancer bears some resemblence to Magic. However there is no deck building and no rare power cards to 'collect'. The rules are simple and skill plays a bigger role than luck.

Each turn, a player gets one mana for each card block, and can use it to sumon a creature in one of 6 different fields, or cast a spell. After that, the turn ends, and each creature automatically attacks the opposing creature, or, if the opposing field is empty, the opponent.\nAnd as simple as that may sound: this is one of the most demanding games i have ever played. You will need to think several turns ahead and overthink many opportunities each turn, to become a good player and achieve a high ranking.\nStill, it is very entertaining and motivating, never gets boring and combines lots of content for a small price.\n\nIf you like card games, you cant do anything wrong with this game","July 26, 2014","true","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Each match starts with you being shown your entire 20 card deck (no randomness here), and each turn you choose exactly one card to play that you have enough power for. That's the extent of your interaction with the game. You don't control who your monsters attack or block (they just attack directly in front of them), nor can you move them to a different column. Your opponent then does the same.\n\nEach of the twenty cards in your deck has some different effect. So do your opponent's cards. The winner ends up being the person who has the right one card in their deck of twenty to counter the other player's attacks. These sort of "I Win" cards are a problem in games like Magic, but at least you know they aren't guarenteed to be in your opponent's hand at all times like in Spectromancer.\n\nThere's a lot more to a good digital card game than the matches. Unfortunately, Spectomancer is lacking in these areas as well. From the stock sound effects to the mundane card graphics, this is a very severly budget effort. The campaign consists of reading a page of fantasy trope nonsense, and then competing against your opponent.\n\nWith so many other great digital card games, including free ones like Duel of Champions, why play this one?","December 19, 2013","false","0.2"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"
