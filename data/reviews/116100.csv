"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/116100/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Super Toy Cars feels like a game that escaped out of early access with a reassuring smile and a lot of fundamental issues unaddressed.\n\nAs I was playing through it I kept having to double check that it was indeed fully released and not still undergoing development, with so many prevalent bugs and a general lack of basic racing necessities popping up as if I had somehow been slipped a beta build in place of the final game. But Super Toy Cars is indeed "finished", or at least unlikely to receive any major future updates, so we're left with the game we've been given and it's a rather disappointing end result to something that started off with such promise.\n\nSuper Toy Cars wants to occupy a space between kart racers and somewhat more realistic arcade racers, with the handling and track designs of the latter and the zany power-ups and silliness so often associated with the former. In reality it adheres almost entirely to traditional arcade racing, with the inclusion of power-ups being rather unnecessary and pretty useless on the whole. There was rarely an instance where launching a missile or dropping an oil spill gave me any noticeable advantage, occasionally being a slight annoyance but usually something I forgot was even there.\n\nI think a lot of this though has to do with how spaced out racers inevitably get over the course of a race. After the first lap I would often be so far behind or ahead of everyone else that there wasn't any chance I'd be able to hit someone with a power-up even should I want to, and even in the rare instance I was in the middle of the pack it so often felt like I was the only one driving. It's a mystery to me how so many racers can exist on such a small track and remain largely entirely separate from each other, but it definitely makes the game feel rather isolating when the only reminder that you're racing against someone is the fraction in the upper corner of the screen.\n\nAgain this is linked to another issue in the game, that being how unbalanced the different cars are and the laughably inept AI racers the game pits you against. Drift is by far the most important stat in the game, so much so that it means cars with a high drift rating will almost always be far and away the best vehicles in the game, rendering all but two or three cars impractical to try and drive. After only a few races I'd settled upon the Panther and found myself dominating every race despite driving like an absolute madman and crashing into things on a near constant basis. If the game starts out easy it trickles down to a virtual void of challenge, as I blew through race after race wondering if I had somehow been caught in a loop and wasn't actually moving forward in events.\n\nKeeping with the trend of every issue being intrinsically linked to another, that feeling of consistent repetition is the result of an abundance of redundancies in track designs and event types. There are only twelve tracks in the game, and at least half of them feel almost interchangeable with one another, with the others being iconic mostly for their backgrounds and not any interesting track layout. The handful of different event types again double up on each other, with checkpoint and single lap time trials feeling nearly identical and the only alteration between elimination and evade being the obnoxious mines placed along the track. There's already a noticeable lack of content in Super Toy Cars, but having so much of it feel so similar to each other and stretch on so long somehow seems worse than if the game had just been half as long.\n\nThe monotonous grind of repeated events robs the game of any sense of progression. You aren't looking forward to new tracks because there aren't any; you aren't looking to improve your skills because the AI is never challenging you. There's no desire to buy new cars as so many are useless, and upgrades are needless and so inexpensive you can be fully upgraded after only a half dozen races or less.\n\nAnd then there are the usual hallmarks of unfinished games: glitchy audio, constant collision issues, hitting invisible walls and clipping through solid ones, random frame rate drops, and a rather embarrassingly bare bones online mode (which doesn't even support private lobbies or inviting friends).\n\nI like what Super Toy Cars is going for, and I think with a few more months of development it could have become a lot more than it did, but being ostensibly finished it feels pointless to hold out hope that its problems will ever be fixed, or that it's even in a state that could be remedied with a few patches. I'm not sure if it was pushed out the door early or its developers really thought it was finished, but the end result is still a game that's in need of attention it won't receive.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 27, 2015","false","3.5"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","54","63","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/116100/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","A racing game with a variety of different competition styles, all set on a miniature scale as the toys of children race around and around. This is the exact premise of Super Toy Cars, as one could easily imagine from the name. Going into the game, I was expecting something either trying to rekindle the days of the Hot Wheels PC games or something to compete with racing games based around cartoon style mayhem such as the Mario Kart series, or even the long forgotten Diddy Kong Racing. What I found was neither here nor there, but something in between.Getting into my first race was simple enough. I opted to do the Career mode to experience the game as well as gain the required points and coins to unlock new races and cars. The race itself lacks the feeling of high speed you would expect from a racing game, but with all the vehicles evenly matched, at the very least there was still that thrill of fighting for first place. Racing around through a course lined with children's toys, shortcuts, and sudden jumps here and there made up for the lack of high speed intensity; then came the power ups, which vary from game changing heat seeking rockets to mostly useless giant 8-balls that the other drivers always manage to avoid with ease due to the slow speed.The tracks themselves are interesting enough, but other than the default races and the elimination modes, there isn't much that grabs your attention to make the game fun. Luckily, the races and elimination modes occur often enough in Career mode to maintain that level of interest.There is the ability to upgrade your vehicles but the upgrades make little to no difference in the overall feel of the vehicles. At most you will get to the front of the pack a little more quickly, but when other vehicles can boost and use power ups the same as you it usually won't matter. Considering the way the AI is established as well, getting to the front of the pack without the upgrades is usually doable anyway, so it's purely a coin sink.Vehicle variety is very nice, however, relating back to looks overtaking the statistical aspects. Of all 16 vehicles, each with several paint schemes, each has a unique flair about it that appeals to someone.Outside of Career, Quick Race, and Multiplayer, there is the Track Editor. Simplistic but fun, it's easy for anyone to jump in and design their dream track within the limits set, of course. Players can adjust the size and shape of the track, fill it with props of their choosing, and, by being able to do those things, they can make a race as exciting and challenging, or as boring and mundane, as possible.Super Toy Cars is not a game aimed towards adults, and yet it was still a rather enjoyable experience even for me. Though it lacked the challenge of big name racers, or the finesse and quirky attitude of games such as Mario Kart, Super Toy Cars still manages to shine where it matters most: fun factor.","January 22, 2015","true","8.3"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","31","35","0","1"

Originally released through Early Access in March, Super Toy Cars has gone through months of updates and polish and is the better for it. It's definitely one of my favorite racing games on Steam, if not one of my favorite games on Steam, period.\n\nThe mechanics of this game are more influenced by physics than most other kart racing games I've played, and though it takes a little bit of getting used to, is very enjoyable once you get the hang of it. I'd highly recommend checking out the guides I've written to understand things like the drift system when you get started. It took me maybe two hours before I got proficient at it, though with the refinements to the system since I picked it up back when it was first available you'll probably get the hang of it much quicker.\n\nTrack design is pretty good, though the art for such is not as inspired or unique as something like Mario Kart (which of course has a long history of games to draw on). It's certainly by no means bad though and will keep you going as you progress through the game. Car design (and here's the relevant guide on that), on the other hand, is much more interesting, drawing on a number of real life cars, and providing lots of cosmetic options to keep you from getting bored. The cars also handle very differently and provide their own unique challenges, though they do fall into a few general categories. The difference between the light and heavy cars is far more pronounced than it is in other kart racing games, and some cars can really keep you on your toes!\n\nThe career mode is probably where you're going to be spending the bulk of your time. There are a large number of challenges to complete and it will probably keep you occupied for 5-10 hours. One of my guides goes in depth on each game mode so I'll spare you the details. Completing each one will take some work, especially in later levels, but is definitely do-able.\n\nThis game has both local and online multiplayer, with support for up to 4 and 8 players, respectively. Unfortunately I don't have anyone to test the local multiplayer with so I can't say if the game handles splitscreen well (for example, in the recent Mario Kart 8 people have noticed reduced frame rate with four players). Local multiplayer is also where you can choose any track or mode to play singleplayer. Online works well though, with no bugs in the netcode to speak of. Hard to say how many people you'll find online at this point, though I don't expect the player population to be able to match that of AAA racing games on Steam like Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. I have played online a few times and found it quite fun. There's AI to fill in for missing players, and it's generally pretty competent (both here and in singleplayer).\n\nNow for some miscellaneous details. Steam Workshop support is a thing in this game, and there's a track editor that uses it. Performance is pretty good as well. My computer (a four year old mid-to-low tier laptop) can run the game at a stable 45 FPS at low settings, and the game looks pretty nice turned all the way up if you've got an actually good computer to handle it. The achievement list is fun, with a good balance of challenge, and it's one of the few games I've bothered to 100% the achievements in. The devs are great people and are very open to feedback, making this one of the best-handled (formerly) Early Access games on Steam I've seen. The price is fair, and if you enjoy kart racing games you can't really go wrong with this one. In short, this game is great!","March 2, 2014","true","16.6"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

Nice variety of tracks, several cars with unique handling, a really fun local split screen mode and decent online. There is a track editor as well that's pretty intuitive. Only major complaint I have is the cars feel a little "floaty", hence the Penny Racers comparison (besides the general look of the game)...other than that I think it's a fantastic game.","February 27, 2014","true","9.2"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

It's as the title indicates: you are a toy car racer. The tracks are set up in some kids bedroom, lol. Anyway, although this game isnt super intricate, the car upgrade system works well and the car choices present you with options based on your driving preferences. They all look like the Mattel or Tonka or wahtever...toy cars we grew up on, so points added there.\n\nThe music is catchy, the tracks look cool, and the cars handle well enough. There is no realism involved necessarily, but then they are toy cars, so why would there be? btw, there are power ups throughout the course which give you weapons or boosts. Those add another fun element to the races.\n\nThis is just simply a cute and fun little racer. I played a bit offline, so my total time is a little skewed, but yeah, easy to recommend this one.\n\nOne sad note though...while there are some cool tracks in the workshop for this game (and btw...creating your own tracks is super simple as is sharing them on the Workshop), the online itself is largely dead, so if you really want to play against other people, try to make sure you have friends with the game (and/or be a good friend and buy them copies).\n\nAll in all, good simple fun.

As well they should, because Re-Volt owned. This one tries but is a little too buggy and unpolished to make the mark. There's a good variety of cars but the tracks are pretty samey, with no good gimmicks or unique features and some frustrating invisible walls. The drifting mechanic is also pretty weird and stiff if you're used to Mario Kart, but I got the hang of it eventually. Races aren't too hard if you keep buying and upgrading new cars, though it should be mentioned that there's zero rubberbanding, which is both a blessing and a curse. If one CPU driver pulls away from the pack he can be impossible to catch, forcing a restart if you want gold. Most races are basic time trials or eliminations, but there is one neat one called Evade where the track is covered in mines, and the last place car is eliminated every 15 seconds. Those races are more about driving carefully than fast, and they can be pretty intense. It's not a bad game, just an unpolished one. I got all the way through it but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are dying for an arcade racer right now.","August 31, 2015","false","2.3"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","2"

I like it a lot, it is a little buggy here and there, nothing devastating, but it's still Early Access so that's to be expected. It's another "Top Downy Toy Car Racery Arcadey Game" * in the mould of Little Racers STREET, Bang Bang Racing, Mini Motor Racing EVO etc. I'm gonna post some pros and cons for this one.\n\nPROS\n\n- Very nice graphics, one of the prettier of the genre so far, on par with Bang Bang Racing.\n\n- Different cars have fairly different driving characteristics, which you can see from their specs on the Purchase screens. Acceleration, Top Speed, Handling etc ratings are shown here and DO make quite a difference. Some cars are quite "drifty" on corners, others have better handling and grip but you can apply the handbrake to drift on the sharper turns.\n\n- Weapons - Like Mario Kart, Wipeout etc you can pick up "single use" weapons off the track to use against other drivers.\n\n- Choice of three views - close behind, further behind and a Micro Machines style zoomed out and directly overhead view (I had the most success with the far behind view. I would prefer an option of far behind and higher up like the one's available in Little Racers and Bang Bang)\n\n- Fun tracks, all kinda toy themed, like the old Micro Machines game\n\n- Great soundtrack by "The Spin Wires"\n\n- Track editor and Steam Workshop support (although it seems fairly complex compared to Mini Motor Racing EVO's)\n\nCONS\n\n- A little buggy, in the hit detection you can clip objects that don't seem to be there. On one of the maps, a small raise up in the track can flip and flick your car up and get you sideways. In the "Minefield" track a mine can suddenly appear directly in front of you giving you no chance to evade it. Again, nothing too serious though. For an early access game the game is very highly polished compared to some.\n\n- The tubes you have to drive through on some maps, are a ♥♥♥♥♥. Extremely difficult to negotiate without clipping them or getting flipped onto your side on the exit. Some cars seem a little better at getting through them cleanly.\n\n\nIn the Battle of the "Top Downy Toy Car Racery Arcadey Games" * , I'd place them in this order:\n\n1) Little Racers STREET\n2) Bang Bang Racing\n3) Super Toy Cars\n4) Mini Motor Racing EVO\n\n\n* The term "Top Downy Toy Car Racery Arcadey Game" © MinDRioT 2014","March 17, 2014","true","5.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

It's cute, it's Mario Kart-like, and it plays like a classic fun racer. There are a few bugs in the game (I'll outline the good and the bad below) but for $5 or so, it's one of those Early Access games you can play with and feel really good about what's to come.\n\nBefore I contrast the good and the bad, I should mention that if you're wanting a realistic racer, this isn't for you. Hence the title, "Super Toy Cars". Expect there to be some over-the-top physics and gameplay. It feels much more like a console game that is reminiscent of the old Micro Machines games and Diddy Kong Racing on the N64. As of now, it's a blast to play. I've been sitting here for a couple of hours just getting to know the game, and it's got some fun dimensions to it that would make it even more of a blast when you're playing with a bunch of friends online.\n\nThat being said, here's what I've found good and bad (mind you, this is based off the Early Access):\n\nThe Good:\n- A wide selection of cars to choose from\n- The upgrades to your vehicles are noticeable, and add a whole new element to your favorite car\n- You WILL have a favorite car\n- Drifting is encouraged and fun to do to gain "Boost" (I thought it would be a downside, but it's definitely not!)\n- The controls are simple, making for a game pretty much anyone can play and enjoy\n- Nice, consistent graphics that any decent machine can run\n- Looks decent at 1080p\n- Full XBox 360 controller support (for those of you who use controllers)\n- Wide variety of tracks that you can set the difficulty for\n- A set of different race types that are fun to play\n- A track editor! An awesome track editor!\n- Different camera views to suit your prefence of gameplay (even a top-down, view!)\n- Beautiful potential for multiplayer\n- Nice array of power-ups (and a neat little subset screen to watch your opponents run into them)\n- Each car is unique in how it handles, and there is most likely going to be a car editor in the future\n- No rubberband AI! You can lap around opponents and not feel like how well you've done on a level can be taken from you in a second because of stupid freaking rubberbanding!\n- Very well-scaled AI\n\nThe Bad:\n- Definitely not finished\n- Invisible walls to some of the maps make it difficult to judge how to turn\n- Sometimes landing a high jump will cause your car to embed into the track\n- The physics need to be tweaked just a little bit\n- When you "die", you have a moment or two of invulnerability - just beware that other cars do, as well. Once you or them "pop back into existence", be sure that your car is clear of the other ones, or you might ping off into space\n- The tracks and races in career mode don't have names, making it seem very vanilla\n- Tracks also don't have very much special about them in career mode\n- No way to set the difficulty in career mode\n- BIG ONE: Very limited options for display settings (anti-aliasing and the like)\n- No way to take off upgrades you've purchased for your vehicles\n- Though there are a lot of types of pick-ups, it would feel better if there were even more (invulnerability, for example)\n- In career mode, the tracks start to become repetitive\n- Sometimes just driving outside of the lines of a track will reset your car\n- It has the feel of a game ported from a console\n- HUGE CONCERN: There is an inability to be able to customize the controls\n\nRecommendations:\n- If you haven't had the thought to already, making custom tracks available for multiplayer would be amazing\n- The ability to run our own music through the game (for example, being able to choose a music folder on your computer and play that instead of the in-game music - which is very good, by the way... some others may disagree, though)\n- MORE ACHIEVEMENTS!!\n- Better control of the graphics\n- Assignable controls (PLEASE!)\n- ^^^ASSIGNABLE CONTROLS!!!!^^^\n- Once again, assignable controls\n- More color options for vehicles\n- Steam Workshop support (might be reaching a bit, but there is just so much potential here)\n- Assignable. Freaking. Controls.\n- The game could maybe use a little bit of humor along with the gameplay... I mean, it is satisfying and hilarious to crush your opponents with a giant 8-ball, but maybe some "Ohh YEAH!" sound effects. Or maybe if it was a random object that you chucked forward? Something like a baseball, a cheeseburger, small dog, Gilbert Gottfried, etc...\n\nAll in all, this game is amazing. It really is. At the small price it's at for an Early Access game, you're going to get your money's worth and see a TON of improvement. I'm sure by the time this thing is polished 100%, it's going to be a top-seller here.","March 2, 2014","true","8.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

They are all interesting with a fair bit of replayability\n\nRe-Volt made you feel like you were handling actual toy cars, in addition to having an impressive selection of cars/tracks\nCrash Team Racing was just the best. Small-ish selection for cars and tracks. But the power-ups and the sheer uniqueness of the entire game made this a gem\nMario Kart was the great grandfather of kart racing, and had a fairly large track selection and had plenty of multiplayer mayhem\n\nDoes Super Toy Cars do this?\nYes. For about an hour and a half. Then it gets *really* dull *REALLY* quickly\n\nThe number of tracks described in the description is slightly wrong, or at least pretty misleading. They mean there are 12 tracks TOTAL, and there are 4 different locations TOTAL. It doesnt mean "there are 12 tracks in 4 locations for a total of 48 tracks" Moreover, the tracks are very simple affairs, nothing really unique about them at all\n\nThe cars are meh. Between the hitboxes being helariously random (as they collide with the track funkily, making drifting a chore when you clip a tube wall wrong, or get bumped out of a drift by a guy 3 feet away). This also makes ramming quite literally a hit or miss situation\n\nAlso, each car has stats that determine how they run. The only way to see these stats is to go into the campaign mode and memorize them, as you cannot see the during "quick race" or "multiplayer" modes. But again, unless if its an extreme stat (insanely high or low) you will not notice a difference. Without fail the high speed models (formula 1 car generally) will have a piece of cake for the races, where as the more maneuverable or more weighty models get lapped constantly with very little balancing\n\nThe powerups are lame. There is not much really to be said about them other than they feel weak because of the funky physics on the car's part. If a car gets hit with an 8ball (a very powerful weapon) it kind of gets spun a little... It also has the annoying feature of replacing your powerup whenever you drive over a new one. Making sure that you cant save them for when you need them\n\nSo in summary, I would give Super Toy Cars a 4/10\n\nIts not a bad game, just a game done poorly.

The gameplay is as expected from a kart racer, or, in this case, toy car racer. Be the first to cross the finish line after that last lap and make use of items and obstacles along the way to either benefit you or put your enemies at a disadvantage. I found the game to be surprisingly easy. I’ve yet to lose a race, or maybe I’m just too good for the game?\n\nSuper Toy Cars has some pretty neat graphics, on top of a nice soundtrack. There are a variety of cars and tracks to choose from, a nice addition (and still more to come, as the game is in early access). The game even has a track editor, which is awesome!\n\nThere are a few minor bugs that I’ve run into, however. One being that collisions with other vehicles and objects are wonky and don’t seem to work as expected. This is really noticeable with the tubes that can be driven through. You’re easily clipped into them, which is quite annoying.\n\nOther than that, Super Toy Cars is a pretty solid game and earns my recommendation.","April 7, 2014","true","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

More than anything the chunky hit boxes and punishing reset mechanics made for an infurating experience.  That said, I'm glad I re-downloaded and gave it another shot.  It's still not perfect but it's a whole lot better.  In some ways the racing experience is among the most satisfactory of the arcade racers I play (among them, Bang Bang Racing, Mini-motors EVO, Little Street Racers) because it feels like the AI cars neither cheat nor are handicapped in an unrealistic manner.  What remains imperfect are the hitboxes on some areas of some maps, which occasionally will find you stuck on parts that should clearly be traversable. Also, the heavily-mined elimination maps in career mode are almost hair-on-the-tongue annoying, at least if you're the sort that tries to get first on every map.  I would rate myself as mediocre at this genre, for what it's worth, so if you're an ace at driving games, this might be too simple for you.","January 2, 2015","true","3.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Ala Mario Kart, this game delivers in all the right places.  It's not as diverse as our good friend Mario Mario, but it also hasn't had the money/time thrown at it (yet).\n\nI haven't really dug deep into the playing of the game, just yet.  Mainly due to the Early Access.  What I have played (100% score on first "Career Mode" level) has shown me all I need to scribble this down:\n\nThis game is awesome!  The speed/handling of the cars need work, sure, but even as is it's still a LOT of fun to test.  (Heck, it's so fun I could call it playing over testing.)  <--Few Early A. games get that honor.  Keep in mind it is a "Fun Racing" game though.  If you're after realism, a game with "Toy" in the title should be all the review you need ;)\n\nHere is where I would moan about "not enough cars", but I can't.  It doesn't have tons upon tons of cars, or customization (But I am sure that is chalked up to Early A.)  You start off with one car, a Jeep looking thing (Without the tail...)  If you ace the first "Career Mode" levels, you will have enough to buy any of the "unlocked" cars (and max out it's upgrades).  That's right, there are quite a few cars and upgrades already; I just stress the room for moar!\n\nNow, being forever alone, I have not tried multi-player.  So, I will skip that part and move right into the Track Editor.  This wonderful addition is my favorite part.  I hope they give it some love, since it's a little restrictive with the camera (and placement of pieces)  Otherwise, it's a very nice way to design your own (and in my case better!!!!) tracks.  With 4 settings, crammed with tons of props/hazards; let's just say you'll want to get your kart on.\n\nGonna have to say 9/10 (A few, to be expected, bugs hold back the elusive 1)","March 2, 2014","true","7.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The cars handle strangely but entertainingly and the tracks are great fun as well with lots of flying jumps and obstacles.\n\nIt's great fun, though still somewhat buggy, and apparently still under development.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/56279/recommended/116100/","56279","Remedous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/56279/","51 products in account","This game had lots of design work. It feels great to pull around those corners while pulling down the hand break. The cars are fast and hard to control (compared to mario kart). The items enrich the game act as a boost for newbies. How many racing games let you say that you race in a jeep? In theory. I realise that that isn't technically complete, but mmmyyyey.\n\nThe problem is in graphics. Now I know that lots of you are going to get up a proclaim "I don't need shiny graphis!". You are probably mostly right. When people say this they are generally refering to detail and quality. The problem is in lighting. The lighting is fine in brighter levels. It's still kind of ugly and we've had better lighting on things for a long time (the early mario karts), but it's some thing I'll live with. On darker levels I end up with areas of my screen entirely black and the head lights don't help. It's immersion breaking and just rips you right out.\n\n\nI recommend this game, but only if it's on sale.\n\nPost Script: I haven't played this in a while, they might've fixed it by now. If you're reading this I will give an update shortly.","February 20, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cunin/recommended/116100/","cunin","Cunin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cunin/","1446 products in account","One of the many games that could use a neutral sign, instead of just thumbs up or down.\n\nThe value of this game depends on your needs as a gamer, and on your age too.\n\nI've got it from a bundle and I'm happy I didn't pay the full price, but at the same time I'm happy to own it, because sometimes I just want to play a casual, easy game just to relax for a bit, and this is especially good at it.\nIn fact, this game is even too easy if you're an experienced gamer as me, and probably even as an average one, but you know, sometimes you don't have the mood to get into simulators or hard games, and just want those 30/60 minutes of relax with an easy and fun game.\n\nThanks to the good graphics and catchy soundtrack, playing this game is fun and puts you in a good mood.\nYou've got a good selection of cars which you need to purchase with the money you collect by playing, and a positive thing is that they really feels different and there's usually one to match your preferred play style, or even to match the needs of certain tracks. You can also upgrade some aspects of them, but at a certain point you'll have to buy a better one anyway.\n\nThe game spreads into many levels of increasing difficulty, each of which has 6 tracks to play. The game mode can be any of the few that the developer created, like normal races, elimination, time attack and so on.\nThe variety of the tracks is decent enough to me: they can have one of the few backgrounds available (like kitchen, garage and what else), and each has an assortment of different tracks available, and I guess you play at least once for each game mode on each track of the campaign.\n\nTo beat your enemies you have to play well or you won't have many chances, unless you use a car that's so much more powerful, but that obviously cannot be done on the latter tracks. You can also collect power ups and use them at your will, and you can find both attack and defense ones. The last thing is the boost, which can be used only when it's full and can be refilled through a powerup or through jumping/sliding.\n\nThis game comes with online/local multiplayer, and even with a track editor with Steam Workshop support, so there's a good amount of toys to play with.\nOther things worth noting, that cannot be found so often even in mainstream games, are a replay system, and even a photo mode.\n\nIt may sound like such a great game from this description, and in fact the potential is there, but there's also many things done wrong here.\n\nThe main problem is the engine used: Unity. Once again, it can deliver a game quicker than using a better one, but the problems it gives to the users are too many, especially on bigger projects.\nSuper Toy Cars suffers from the usual performance problems that all Unity games suffers, although here they aren't as bad as in other games, but in a racing game, a framerate stutter can lead to a loss of control of the vehicle.\nThis is an arcade racer so that's less important, but since I can play GRID2 in full HD, with 16xAF and 4xAA, with all settings to High and some to Ultra at a stable 60fps with the graphics you all know, I know that the very simple special effects used in this game (fake env-mapping for example) and the simple models should run smoother than it does, especially since this game is more suited to kids, and you usually don't give your kids the most powerful pc you have around to play with.\n\nThe physics are also quite bad which, paired with really weird track objects bounding boxes, it can lead to moments of frustration.\nYou may want to cut corners sometimes, because the game seem to push that strategy with a lot of cars that slides while just steering, and the fact that you obtain boost by doing so, and that you even have a button on your gamepad just for sliding, but the objects put on the track have strange bounding boxes which sometimes are smaller than the objects themselves, and sometimes are bigger, which leads you to hit your head into invisible walls that just shouldn't be there.\nThe cars also becomes less controllable at times, especially while jumping and when the framerate stutters. Weird behaviors can also be observed while hitting other cars or any other object in the game.\n\nOther Unity-related problems are lack of support for dinput and older xinput gamepads (needing you to use x360ce), some weird audio-related glitches and general stability. The game didn't crash often (like twice so far in-game), but it crash on exit for some reason, like other Unity games that I have (no profile data loss anyway).\n\nI can't comment on the multiplayer as I could never find anyone playing this game and I don't have anyone to play with here.\nI can't comment much on the track editor either because I don't have time to learn how to use it, but I can comment on the fact that I hoped it would be easier to use. One little thing the devs can do is to add some tooltips on its GUI so that you can easily know what each button does, but I guess it won't need a lot of practice or a lot of reading to get used to it.\n\nThe whole in-game shop is also looking like it was rushed, because you just can save up to power up your current car and you'll be able to win so many races, which leads to you save enough to buy a car powerful enough to win another 1/3 of the game. You can basically win the whole game with just 3 cars, and by that time you'll have enough money to buy the rest of them with their powerups, but that's probably because the game is easy and therefore more suited to kids.\n\nIn fact, I see this game like a little gem for kids, as they can play a game that is easy enough for them, play local multiplayer or online with their little friends, and spend additional time using the built-in track editor to make their own track, that can be shared on the Workshop for everyone to enjoy (or hate).\n\nI have to thumb down this game because for my age and likings, this game does too many important things (for me) wrong and it's also too easy and short, but it would probably be a thumb up if I were a kid or if I had kids.\nI also know many people of my age that just can't drive serious racing games, and this game may be good for them too (lol).\nThere's many other arcade racers out there which does things right, like Little Racers STREET, so consider the alternatives before buying this, unless, as I said, you need a game for your (young) kids.","March 11, 2015","false","7.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

That being said I honestly thought the game was going to be a lot better then it is currently. The Career mode should be diveded into classes instead of the any car can race in any race. Because at the later levels your gonna get pounded on if you use a slower car. I wish they would have done it like Little Racers Street and make them into classes. Like the A thru E class. I think it would make a lot more sense.\n\nThe handeling for cars is just strange. The truck is terrible at handeling it cannot take a tight turn for whatever reason. The drifting does not feel right. Its slows you down a lot.. Its just strange. It doesnt feel right. The tracks are fine but like someone else said a little boring.  The powerups as some one said before are not very good. I would agree if your ahead then your more then likely going to stay ahead because all of the weapons require a car behind you. For example a missle or the 8 ball both need line of sight. Their are a few traps  that stay on the track but are easily avoided.\n\nI would have liked to see a system of drops that gave out turbo perhaps to the other cars behind to keep it interesting and every race would be close. Also it takes a long time to respawn weapon drops so if your behind some other car good luck on getting a power up. As it is the game is just ok. It could have been so much better. Graphics are good but everything feels chunky. Although that might be what the graphics guy wanted.\n\nSo their you have it. A good game but not great.","February 6, 2015","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I suppose you can't expect much from an indie game, but there are a lot of things that need work. The graphics aren't terribly interesting, and most tracks just look the same. The tracks themselves aso feel very self-contained, and not like they're part of a bigger world (which is what I'd expect from a game about tiny cars in a big house). The soundtrack is a few rather forgettable songs from some indie band you've invariably never heard of, and it will liekly leave you muting it and playing your own choice of music instead. And last but not least, the whole thing seems like it took big ideas from other racers (small scale, wepons, upgrades, etc), but didn't grasp what made them good. If you're looking for a new Micro Machines or Revolt, try something else.

Sadly, the effort is mostly in vain.\nThe graphics are ugly, especially the edges are very rough, even with 8x MSAA activated. The screenshots shown above are highly post-processed and do not represent the ingame graphics. The sound design is plainly bad. While the music is good, the few tracks get repetitive very quickly and the sound effects are incredibly hideous. The gameplay overall is also subpar. The cars, while feeling distinct from another, all are floaty, act unpredictably in terms of physics, the sliding mechanics requires you to hold a button, which feels unnatural and there are also very few tracks in the base game. However there is a track editor, thus this problem might be solved by the community.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend Super Toy Cars. If you are desperate for an action-racing game and are looking for a couple of hours of enjoyment, maybe with friends, Super Toy Cars could be it, since there is not much other stuff out there. But it's no Mario Kart, Blur or Micro Machines.","June 27, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It tries hard to be Micro Machines, but fails in every aspect. The environments aren't even explorable, so you're just sitting racing on a track that looks like every track. If you try to veer off, you just get reset on the track. The game reuses these tracks over and over, so even though you just finished 15 races, you did them all on the same three or four tracks. The physics are terrible, and try too hard to be realistic. For example, a single tiny bump in the track can send your car flying, and if you don't hit jumps exactly dead on, your car will flip. This is not the kind of stuff you want to see in a fun racing game. The car upgrades are limited and I swear they don't help any. The drifting is as bad as the rest of the physics.\n\nSo yeah. Don't buy it expecting a Micro Machines clone.

If this was a game still in development I would be the #1 fan and avidly follow it, but as it is it just can't be enjoyed.\n\nFirst of all, the controls: pressing up will give a constant speed to your car, while left-right will change its angle. That's all. I wasn't expecting something super realistic from a toy car battle game, but I really need some more variables under my control if I must feel that I'm responsible for my results. To be fair, the cars have stats like "handling" and "grip" that you can improve by buying upgrades, it's just hard to imagine where they could be possibly used. The few times some physics seems in play it feels totally wrong. For example when it rains it's hard to turn, but it doesn't seem like water on the floor... more like water got into my keyboard causing it to malfunction.\n\nThere are a few powerups, but they could be condensed in just two: "hit the car behind you" and "hit the car before you".\n\nAnd I was always winning first place without even thinking what I was doing. The problem is not that the game is too easy, but that the player is not responsible for the result. If the difficulty was increased, you would always lose rather than always win.\n\nThere is little content. I played for one hour always going to the next challenge, and I think I only saw three different tracks. To add a bit more variety, there are four different modes: a normal race, a solo race against the clock, a mode where every 15 seconds the last car gets eliminated, and a fourth mode that is just like the third, but with random mines on the track. None of them got me involved.\n\nBesides all these problems, for some reason the game just isn't fun. The developers clearly tried to replicate the mario kart formula, but that isn't enough. It looks like they completely skipped the part where you tweak the game until you find a combination that makes it enjoyable.\n\nI really don't enjoy writing a review that is so negative, I guess I hope they read it and decide to go back working on this project (maybe as a new game). What I can't understand is that the big work seems already done. The graphics are cool, and the engine works, what's left to do is the fun part.\n\nI'm not bitter about this because I got the game in a bundle I bought for something else, but I certainly don't recommend you pay 9,99eur for it (or any price really).","April 18, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got clunky hitboxes and glitchy hit detection; it's possible to drive right through stage walls in some places.  Collisions behave really oddly.  Powerups aren't too useful.   There's not too many pre-programmed tracks, either.\n\nAlso, there's a highly overpowered mechanic called Drift; sliding around curves filles a boost gauge that can be activated for a major speed increase at any time; with a bit of skill, high drift cars will spend half of every race in turbo mode, and low drift cars will be left in the dust.  This limits your car choice options.\n\nHowever, there's positives, too.  A variety of game modes keeps things feeling fresh.  Races are fast-paced and don't drag on.  There's a fully functional track editor.  Vehicle handling is actually pretty okay.\n\nAs a MAJOR plus, computer AI does not feel cheaty - Cheating AI is my major issue with most other racing games.  The game is fairly low challenge, but a large part of that is because the devs weren't seeking to add artificial difficulty with rubber-banding or any such rubbish.\n\nThe verdict: There's fun to be had here, as long as your expectations aren't too high.  Fly through all those tracks with drift, buy a bunch of upgrades, snag a ton of easy achievements, and it makes for an enjoyable afternoon.","April 19, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Especially this track that changes pitch all the time (or is this also a bug?)\nSo at the end of the day: Yes, it's a fun tabletop racer, especially on the higher levels, but there are better ones, like TableTop Racing (iOS, Android).

And I really enjoy playing it. Because the game sometimes plays for you. Giving you the opportunity to watch how the tracks are designed and how the car controls ever move. Except for flipping.\n\nBut there was one other reason why I bought this game. I was interested in the Workshop feature. For creating a track and then clicking share. Which I'd assumed it would've uploaded it to the Workshop. But after I exit the game and view the uploaded Workshops. Super Toy Cars track that I had shared that I can see with my other Workshops are blank. There doesn't seem to be any writing which I did include a name and description. Also the screenshot. But the Workshop content is bare. I would've not recommended this game but since the main game theme is marvelously designed. I would still recommend this game, regardless to the Workshop problem which I hope will be fixed in the future.","November 26, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
