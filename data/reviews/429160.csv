Your ship shoots automatically and you move by using the mouse only, I should also mention there is no controller support.  There are also barely to no settings except music. sound, and preset visual quality.\n\nThe concept is there, I like how theree is online co-op, not too many shumps nowawdays with online capabilities.  Too many "if only..."'s with this game..."if only" this where fleshed out more and were turned into an actually shump, with proper controls and more variety in everything, this game would be really great.\n\nI hate saying this, but I honestly feel you shouldn't purchase this game.  It falls short in many areas and does not justify the current price tag.  If you really want the game, get it at 75% off or something, not at 50%, 40%, 30%, etc...not worth it.","February 20","false","0.2"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","19","25","3","9"

You pilot your spaceship moving your mouse and use your abilities with right and left mouse buttons.\n\nThe coop can be played with real persons or AI, the AI is quite good so you shouldn't have any issues playing with it.\nYou have campaing and match modes, they looks the same except match mode is shorter than campaing, you kill a single boss and get your points.\n\nWith points you can buy new spaceships, the more you play and get points and advance in game the more ships will be avaiable to buy. Each spaceship has a different ability, one has a shield and the other has a missiles and so on. There is a minor customization option, you can change the color and it will affect your ship, your cannon blasts and your thrusters.\n\nYour objective is simple, you have to destroy enemy ships and avoid their shots until you reach the boss so you have to defeat him. If you or your partner die then you have to wait 8 seconds to respawn and the other can't die before the 7 seconds, otherwise you lose.\n\nGreat game, the perfect choice to play with a friend.","February 20","true","1.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Keep that in mind while reading this review. Just to be clear, I was not given the game in exchange for a positive Steam review.\nSpace shooters or shoot em ups are not exactly my favorite genre. It takes a lot to impress me in this genre. This game didn't impress me, but I was pleasantly surprised that the game was actually good. I was initially very turned off by the visuals, the menus, and the UI... but the game is fun. When it comes down to it, a fun game is better than a pretty game.\n\nThe game is very simple to learn and easy to control. While the controls could be tightened a bit, there isn't too much to complain about there. The core gameplay is very fun. The autofire is a nice feature for those of us who don't want carpal tunnel injuries! Something other games in the genre could learn from.\n\nThe way the entire game is played on the mouse just makes sense in this game. You steer with the mouse, you use skills with the mouse. It just works. The skills are one thing I really loved about the game. The combo of offensive and defensive skills made the game feel strategic, which was unexpected.\n\nThe game could use a visual upgrade. As it is, it really just isn't much to look at. There's no character to it visually. It just looks bland and generic. Pretty much the same thing can be said for the music. Although, the music is not too bad. That being said, I actually liked the voice acting. The voice acting in these sort of games is normally non-existent or absolutely terrible. The voice acting in this game is actually pretty decent.\n\nOne particularly nasty thing about this game is the fact that the multiplayer is totally dead. That's not really a fault of the developers. The multiplayer is only dead because nobody is playing it. That's likely due to the game being fairly unknown, not because the game is bad.\n\nMy last complaint is that the game feels lacking in content. I'm not exactly sure what I would change as far as that goes, but it's just something I feel is worth pointing out. Maybe some more unlocks and just more visuals in general.\n\nI know I've listed a lot of complaints, but the game is really pretty decent. I'm giving it a recommendation. The amount of content in the game is low, but if you like these sort of games you will likely enjoy this one.","February 28","true","1.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NekroG/recommended/429160/","NekroG","Nekro G","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NekroG/","614 products in account","Well lets start with the first thing I hear the Music, it isn't bad, has a little bit of energy, would't have been my choice but it works.\nA Few things on the first level I didn't like, The mouse seems to drag when moving slow and move more freely when making fast movements, it feels like theres less percision when moving slowly this way. I didn't like that there wasn't a tutorial even if just a single box that popped up and said move the mouse to move ship, I was pressing the arrows and  a,w,d,s and all over trying to move ship for half of first level then thought mouse. I will give it some credit as I don't recall any side scrolling space shooters previously using a mouse to control the ship like this. This game reminds me of R-type or any other side scrolling space shooter from the 80s. Only Problem with it being that genre is it has to compete with games like the R-type series, and that is not easy to do.\nI do like that it auto fires for you, that is helpful, there is alot of time where your flying and theres no enemies, Another thing that I DON'T like is I couldn't find a pause button. When you press escape you quit, that sucks. I like that the backround moves and changes up, The first boss fight was cool.\nMy biggest issue was there is no way to remap the keys, and I have no middle mouse button as im using a laptop, this hinders my gameplay and made the first boss incredibly more difficult to beat without that thing that takes the shield down.\nWas unable to find anyone online to play with, but im sure that would of made the game more fun. I would suggest adding Pick up power ups that give you shot power like Contra has where it changes your ammo type.\nOther than what I already said its not a bad game, just needs a lil more polish.\n","April 12","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has just the right difficulty so that you are able to play the game with a challenge and still be able to progress through it. The storyline is funny and informative and I enjoy the fact that the tutorial is in game as part of the dialogue without seeming to mess up the storyline. The music is great and keep up the adrenaline.The ships are equiped with what you need in order to complete the mission and the AI is very helpful. I really enjoyed this game.","February 29","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you're good at space shooters, this gives you a new twist on it.  If you're not so good at them, like me, you have a buddy to help out.  Instead of wearing out your fingers shooting, it has a well made gun that does such for you.  An interesting twist on a space shooter.  It reminds me much of "Life Force" on the NES, but so different at the same time.  This is a great game for a quick relaxing play and for extended periods.\n\nI hope you guys enjoy this game as much as I have. :)","March 11","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's nothing special about it. It's just like every other game in its genre. It's boring, repetitive, and has an awful storyline. Feels like a game developed as a college project. Don't buy.

Co-op usually means couch co-op, apparently no so with this. It's online multiplayer, if you can find people on, but 2 minutes into the game we can't see anything. Not that it matters, because you move the mouse around and that's it, no other interaction. This game was given to us by Black Shell Media because we have a Let's Play channel, and we appreciate any game given to us. This is an insult that we wouldn't wish upon our worst enemies. This is like receiving the kiss of death.","April 2","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
