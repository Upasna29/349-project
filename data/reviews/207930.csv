There wasn't really much to the game. There are only 4 acts and our characters became so over-powered by the end of the game that we just wanted to get it over with. We didn't even use the special, power enhancing crystals once.\n\n- Graphics are nice but sometimes I lost my character in some chaotic battles. The Act 1 boss was the only unique fight in the entire game (except MAYBE the last boss, but that's pushing it).\n- Music was fine (some of it sounding like Golden Axe at times)\n- Sound needed more "umph" to make me feel like my hits were doing any damage. The sound could have helped make the game more exciting if they put more effort into it.\n- Controls were easy but the game can be beaten with one simple attack combo for the entire time and then the "special move" saved for boss fights.\n\nAs of this writing the game sells for $15 (before sale discounts) and I'd have to say I'd pay at most half that price for Sacred Citadel if you have run out of beat=em-ups to play.","December 28, 2013","false","6.2"," 93 of 114 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","93","114","0","0"

The game is from start to finish: mash X to attack. That's it. Every so often you press X-X-X-Y for a combo to knock enemies down to give yourself breathing room. That's all you do in this game.

Not only is it often so, that you're being attacked by enemies that you cannot attack because you're not in the same depth, but it's also hard to tell which depth they're in at all, leading to some frustration from time to time. Also some items might sometimes drop in a depth that you cannot even reach.\n-It's not hard. Now you might say this is very relative, but for me, these kinds of games is about growing in power, since you level and acquire new gear, so that you may overcome harder challenges. This point is especially important since your experience & gold is saved, even if you die, so you can just keep doing the same thing til' you get past it. Sure, you might die here there once or twice, but we beat every level in the first try and overall found the game to be too easy. Even on the last boss we made it without grinding a single level twice and we didn't even dodge most of his attacks.\n-The game is very short. A little over 5 hours of gameplay was enough to beat the entire game with one class, and that's taking into account idling in the menu probably about 30 minutes and restarting it due to bugs like being unable to move or even just crashes.\n-Tanky monsters. When I'm saying that I'm not talking about the bosses, the bosses are fine. But this is something I see very often in games. Instead of making the monsters challenging enough, you make them very tanky, so that it'll still take time to take them down. It's not fun, it's just repetitive and tedious.\n-Constant knockback. You're constantly being knockbacked, there's really nothing to explain here, you'll spend at least about 30% of your time in combat lying on the ground.\n\nThose are the main points for me that are bad. But here's the good ones.\n-Story. It's definitely not that great of a story, but it's somewhat humorous and you want to find out what happens, so I have no complaints, the story did what it was supposed to do, it made me want to play on.\n-Gear, I felt the excitement for getting a better weapon/armor. That's at least more than what many other games do.\n-Pretty fun multiplayer. Since you're constantly getting knockbacked, mashing buttons, filling up the screen with you power attacks or getting thrown around and ending up in bad positions, it's pretty fun to play co-op in it. As always it's more fun to play with friends.\n-Music. The music was not that kind of music that got stuck in your head or something you'll sing/dig along to, but it was decent, and I have no complaints about it either.\n-Graphics. The graphic design is nice and overall I enjoyed going through the world, especially paying attention to the background scenery at times.\n\nOverall I must say this is a pretty mediocre game from a game design perspective, but it was decent entertainment for the 5 hours I played it. Do I consider it to be worth 10 euros though? No.","August 16, 2014","false","5.1"," 51 of 70 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","51","70","0","1"

This essentially falls in the same category as Castle Crashers; although, Sacred Citadel loses on the comedy it picks up on the graphics.\n\nThe Game:\nSacred Citadel is about the far away land of Ancaria, which is under attack by the evil Ashen Empire. You play a random soldier (Warrior, Ranger, Mage, or Shaman) with each class uses different techniques in order to defeat the many enemies ahead. Mama Grimmoc, the evil orc mother, is attacking the civilizations which you have become accustomed to. As such you decide to take up your weapon to stop her. You eventually realize Mama Grimmoc is working for a mysterious man, The Merchant, who requires her to retrieve him two artifacts. Upon realizing their value you decide to take it upon yourself to obtain one of the artifacts in order to gain the huge reward The Merchant has promised you for them. The campaign involves fighting off hordes of orcs, bandits, soldiers, monsters and more. As your adventure goes on you must fight your way through four acts totaling twenty levels. Each act contains four levels and a boss fight. You must fight your way through each boss in order to progress to the next act each of the bosses require you to use different strategies. The bosses are Mossback, Mama Grimmoc, Queen Digestya, and Gatebreaker.\n\nGameplay:\nThe There are only forty levels, which mean you cannot max a character out in every single attribute, but instead must divide them up appropriately. Luckily as you’ll quickly realize, you don’t need to put any points in defense in order to complete the campaign. The game itself is relatively easy and I believe I only died twice through the entire campaign, one time because I forgot to use my potion and the other time because I couldn’t figure out how to defeat the Gatebreaker. The game doesn’t get more difficult as you progress. The game just gets easier because you figure out how to play better. You don’t need to spend any of the games money; in fact I beat the entire game without spending a single coin.  But if you don’t mind playing easy games and just want to hack ‘n slash then this is a really good choice.\n\nMultiplayer:\nMost of the negative reviews focus on the server instability and glitches associated with the multiplayer. Well I never played the multiplayer, so I cannot tell you how that goes. If the other reviews are correct then I would highly recommend avoiding this game if you are looking for a multiplayer co-op experience. On the other hand, if you just want to play a fun little campaign that doesn’t pose much of a challenge then this is a great choice.\n\nJungle Hunt (DLC):\nAct Five is added to the campaign and finally you can defeat the monsters that began the whole war. Mother Grimmoc has run the jungle and you must go in to retrieve the artifact she stole at the end of the original campaign. The campaign adds an additional five levels which push you to the metal as you fight off new, but similar enemies. They are all essentially stronger versions of past enemies, and in fact one boss is just a larger version of one of the orcs you fight. The game is intense and adds new weapons, but sadly doesn’t add a new village. This means you have to earn the weapons by playing the levels rather than just purchasing them.\n\nResult:\nIf you enjoy hack and slack side scrollers then this is the game for you. I would recommend getting this game if you enjoy a single player campaign and don't really care to venture into multiplayer. In all honesty there seems no point to multiplayer as this campaign is so easy with one person adding three more would make the game a cakewalk. Although based on other reviews if you are looking for a four player co-op experience this may not be the game for you. Sacred Citadel offers fun combat, rather interesting enemies, and mixes hack 'n slash combat systems with platformer mechanics. The game is riviting to play by yourself and if you can get it for a good deal it's definitely worth the buy.\n\nPros:\n+Easy to master combat with few combinations to memorize\n+Lots of loot and weapons that can easily be obtained throughout the story mode.\n+Interesting item add-ons that allow you to boost the power of your character beyond your maximum attribute points\n+Easy, but fun campaign that allows for a single person to enjoy the adventure.\n+Missions challenges that add replay value for already completed missions\n+Easy to use controls\n+They have added DLC to the game.\n\nCons:\n-No mouse functionality (I set my mouse to preform keyboard functions so I could use my mouse and keyboard)\n-Does not support 1080p resolution (I just played in windowed mode)\n-Apparently the multiplayer did not function well (I have no experience on this)\n-The campaign was relatively short\n-There is no way to increase the difficulty","March 19, 2014","true","9.4"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","27","39","0","0"

Really great graphics and art style however it isn't the most engaging and I could only play it short spurts really. There are a number of combos you can do however it really boiled down to doing the same one over and over which proved to be a perfect tactic for getting through most of the levels and dealing with most enemies. There were some difficulty spikes here and there but with plenty of health drops, for the most part you were able to survive them if you kept your wits about you.\n\nI enjoyed my time with it, although I must say I nearly gave up twice, once when I realised I had borked my character (with no respec available) by not investing in "defence" when levelling up, meaning I took way too much damage in the later levels, and a second time when I hit a bug which stopped enemies spawning and the level progressing.\n\nThankfully I was able to get past the first issue by using some "defence crystals" which could be bought from town, these gave a temporary boost to defence meaning I could get through the levels I was having trouble with,  slowly upgrade my defence stat over the next 6 level ups and eventually wean myself off the Crystals. The second issue I was able to get past after finding a helpful forum post on Steam which detailed a solution, simply ALT+TAB out of the game and back in again.. which weirdly worked. Enemies spawned again and the level progressed.\n\nProblems aside I did play it to completion so it can't have been that bad and 6 hours was just enough I think.","February 4","true","6.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

A time when we had little to no context to motivate us - only raw, monotonous gameplay, when characters were one dimensional and everything tended to be oh so shallow. Were being good in a game ment to be effective in it by knowing what was about to happen. A primitive, barbaric past we have long since overcome with elaborate, media-milestones such as Half-Life or Bioshock. Praised be the new digital gods called narrative, context, meaningfulness and away with the ugly olden idols of simplicity, mindlessness and fun.\n\nIT'S A LOAD OF ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, ALL OF IT!\n\nSo, people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over Sacred Citadel for a lot of things it is NOT. Yet, they completely miss the point of what it actually IS! Essentially it is a good brawler that could be placed somewhere between Golden Axe and the Aliens versus Predator arcade. Button-mashing, big bosses, simple attack patterns and basic crowdcontrol. It is not Street Fighter III in Fantasia nor is it a proper Action RPG (it does have a loot-component though). It's a damn solid spin-off, with great visuals and music, a stupid storyline and one-dimensional characters. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nI recommend this game to people who want to introduce their kids to classic dark age gaming, wanting to plant the seed of the oldschool and prepare their offspring to enjoy juggling, aerial raves and combo-strings in a 2D environment.\nIt is also good beer & pretzels fun for the rest of us who can grasp and enjoy the concept of a time waster being a time waster.

Some argue that when DLC feels like it was something stripped out of the original game and repackaged (and sold) the publisher is ripping off the consumer. In some cases yes, but here it feels more like a complement to the main game, in that Jungle Hunt's Act, and the several bonus levels added onto the main game's Acts, require high-level characters. There's also the matter of not having the DLC preventing a 100% of the game's achievements, but that might only perturb a certain subset of gamers.","May 2, 2014","true","35.4"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","1"

I really like the artstyle in the game and soundtrack is pretty unique. There is one pretty major problem, though - character development. On early it doesn't seem to be very good. All early combos (up to level 15 or so) look different, but do the exactly same thing. Of course, characters have different secondary attacks (mage and archer are ranged characters and warrior and shaman are close combat ones), but besides that, early combos are really all the same, but just look different. If you want to play it through as different characters, prepare to have to level up quite a bit before feeling the difference in gameplay.

You can get through most enemies by mashing the main attack (which stunlocks them every time) so you barely need to touch the glitzier heavy attacks and combos-honestly waiting to power them up without getting hit only makes the game slightly harder. If you DO use them though they're pretty fun to watch (I once accidentally turned a group of monsters into chickens. NICE). Since every stage allows you to move up/down you can miss enemies that appear to be right in front of you, which is annoying but thankfully not as often as you'd think. Overall fun for what it is. I've only played the single player campaign and can only imagine that the multiplayer modes would be much more entertaining.

Enemies aren't particularly difficult, but take quite a lot of hits to defeat, making the entire experience feel like a chore. 3 player co-op just turns into a confusing mess of button-mashing as the screen is cluttered with effects. Weird design choices also mar the experience further, such as making you wait until you've cleared a section in order to pick up any weapons or armor that drops (and if the section is immediately followed by a cutscene it will force you to miss the drops).

Though, is it worth spending your time and friend's time playing this game, let me break down the game for you.\n\nThe visuals are 3D models placed on a 2.5D plan, think of Double Dragons Neon. Actual they share similar style. I'm not a fan of the art-style, but I never judge a book by its cover.\n\n\nThe combat is sluggishly slow. You can't block every attack yet the game tries to encourage you to do so, you can roll but it too feels sluggish. I don't believe the game is polished. There were times that I got hit but was certain I was not within range. Later on my suspicion was correct, this game doesn't do an excellent job at detecting where the enemies' hitbox is from yours. At a particular boss fight, it was in the middle of the room and wouldn't jump onto my platform. I took advantage of this and started to range it. It did a bite attack in the middle of the room nowhere near me, and I received  damage.  I started to pay attention and noticed a lot of the enemies attacks were committing the same crime. This is a big deal! To be punished for not avoiding an attack that is nowhere near you is shameful, it should of been caught and polished during testing.\n\n\nThe story is dull, the dialog is dull, the soundtrack is dull*, the characters you play have no voice so they are husks, and the villains make Saturday morning cartoons look like awesome super villains. The characters play style don't really vary from one to another. Your "Power" attacks is the only difference but it isn't much of a difference, if that makes any sense. There is loot drop in this game but it feels like it was tacked on. If you were to remove it you wouldn't notice any change to the game. You also level up and can drop points into certain stats,  again this comes off as a tacked on feature.\n\n\nI beat the game in about 4 hours, though I did leave the game on while I was eating. I can't really recommend this game. If you have $10 there are much better games to drop it on. If it goes on sale there must still be a much better game to get. The sluggish gameplay, the tacked on features, dull characters, unpolished hitboxs, and I have little want to replay this game. One of my favorite genres is mindless beat-em ups, but this takes the cake for being one of the lamest I played.\n\n\nIf you liked it that is fine, but my opinion is my opinion. I doubt it can be changed even if I got a friend to suffer through it with me one last time. If you are looking for a beat-em fix I recommend Castle Crashers, Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara, Guardian Heroes, ....\n\n(The entire soundtrack sucks, if I am going to be smashing skulls I need something cool playing in the background. Look at Streets of Rage boss encounter music, awesome! Castle Crashers when things start to get heated, awesome!)","May 15, 2014","false","5.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/207930/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Sacred Citadel is aan old-school inspired beat 'em up with some RPG elements and a focus on Co-op, set, of course, in the Sacred Universe.\nI have never played another Sacred game, so I couldn't really say how loyal it is to the franchise, regarding the setting and classes.\n\nGoing into this review, I've finished the game with a character in single player mode. I've also tried every other character. Unfortunately, there were no online games up for me to try it.\n\nI haven't played many Beat 'em Up games, but I've played a few with unique twists and they're generally just pure fun!\nSacred Citadel started out that way, and I enjoyed my time with it, I'll give it that. Unfortunately, it's very limited, and despite having good foundations, it seems very rushed and shallow compared to what it could have been.\n\n\nThe game is structured with 4 Acts, each one with 5 different levels (including a Boss Level). Each act has a different set of enemies and takes place in a different place. You'll find occasional mini-bosses, which are essentially more powerful versions of normal enemies, and then a big boss fight that requires some pattern recognition.\nBetween each level, the player can go to the Town, where he can buy Weapons, Armor, Gems, Potions, or make bets to increase challenge.\n\nRegarding presentation, I have very few criticisms.\nThe game was made in 2.5D, with a clean, cartoony artstyle, and I really like it. it's colourful and the backgrounds look really good, in my opinion. There's also a decent variety in the levels to keep things fresh.\n\nThe music is something that I have mixed feelings about. It sounds pretty good (perfect amount of organ - a lot!) and you can hear the old-school inspiration from it (more melody, less atmosphere), but it's very repetitive and gets easily lost in the background, unfortunately.\nI had the music volume up, but it seems to miss the *humpf!* to complement the combat. I like it, but I don't think it's all that great to go along the game.\nStill, it's not bad.\nSoundEffects were serviceable, nothing noteworthy. They do the job well enough.\n\n\n\nI'll talk about the features, and then go to the combat itself.\n\nIn this game, you have a few RPG elements, as mentioned. By killing enemies, you get some loot, and experience. When you earn enough experience, you level-up, restoring your health right away. You can then attribute some points to Attack, Defense, Dexterity or Power, after finishing a level. You get 2 points per level-up.\nThe loot is essentially Gold, Health and Potions, and then Weapons or Armour. You can use gold in the town to buy new equiment or bet. Potions can restore your health, have you do more damage, or restore your mana, which you use for special attacks.\nOne major criticism regarding equipment, is that everything is literally an upgrade. There is no real choice or change in playstyle by picking up certain weapons or armour. You can have Elemental Damage/Resistance, but it doesn't change anything, combat-wise. So, everytime a weapon or piece of armour is dropped, you can equip it if it's better, or just leave it. It has virtually no impact in the game, aside from scaling your damage and resistance to the enemies. Missed oportunity, in my opinion. No variety, no change, no choice.\n\nUnfortunately, this game has no difficulty modes. The one thing you can do, is bet in the town, accepting challenges for an upcoming level. I love the concept behind this. It could make for a much better experience, fit for very different players.\nThe downside is that it's not done right... at all.\nThere are 3 types of bets. Life, Time and Score (Health requires not dying. Time is well... finish a level within a time limit. And Score is to finish a level with a certain score, earned by combos and the like). Each costs from 100 to 400 gold (scales with the Act), and you can only have one active per level. I suppose this was a way to improve replayability, but these challenges barely change gameplay at all to justify replaying them a lot. Besides, not all of them scale well. If you're higher level for a level, Health and Time become very easy, but Score is essentially impossible, since you 1-hit everything and cannot combo.\nUnfortunately, neither of them make the combat harder or anything, it only forces an artificial objective that helps absolutely nothing regarding replayability.\n\n\nLastly, there are 4 classes: Warrior, Ranger, Shaman and Mage (if I'm not mistaken). Each of them have a different special attack, but that's about it. And it serves as a segway to the combat.\n\nDespite being a fairly fun game, there are barely any combos for the player to memorize, and you unlock them all within the first Act. That would be fine, if there were a lot of them. But it seemed to give you variety in combat for a while, and then it just stops, leaving you with barely anything to use.\nThis makes the combat very, very repetitive and simplified, which is a big problem in a game that encourages replayability.\nYou can not change classes as you want either. Each class as its progress saved, and you can get switch between them at will.\nAs a result, if you want to try out different classes, you need to play the same levels from the beginning.\nEvery character has personalized animations, and they're all fluid and look pretty good. But, every combo is essentially the same in every character, only with a different animation. Despite switching characters, there's no change in gameplay, rendering it all pointless. That's a shame, and it's the combat and its shallow systems that make me not recommend this game.\n\nLevel Design is also barely existent. It's mostly pressing forward, with the occasional vehicle/mounted combat. The downside of it is that it's far harder to combat when you're in a mount, since you're thrown down of it whenever you're attacked, and the mounts attack much slower, being more of a pain in the ♥♥♥ than a good change of pace.\nThe game was way too easy, even with challenges. The Bosses were fairly enjoyable, but mostly too easy as well, with the exception of one of them.\n\nEnemy Variety is pretty good, changing with each act, making for a more varied combat which is great. Flying enemies, however, were not very enjoyable to fight, due to their placing. Since there is a bit of a third direction in the game, flying enemies give a weird perspective, making them much harder to hit, and just clunky, really.\n\nIt could have been a very, very good game. Unfortunately, despite the idea being there, it just doesn't do much to execute their ideas well.\nIt's just the outer shell of a great game. I did get some enjoyment out of it, but it was a repetitive experience that tries to mask what it actually is by having some very artificial RPG elements.\n\nIt's not a very good beat 'em up, specially when compared to some other great games out there.\n\n\nP.S.: I almost forgot. The voice acting in the game was really good! Despite being brief, it was really well done!\nAlso, I saw many people complaining about bugs, specially online. Since I saw no one online, I can not test it, but I didn't encounter any problem in singleplayer mode. Only BIG complain about the port is the lack of option, specially resolution and aspect ratio.","April 12, 2014","false","4.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The largest problem Sacred Citadel has is that it just doesn't 'feel' right - there's no sense of impact when you hit an enemy. The action feels unsubstantial, floaty, and fake.\n\nWhile this title has some good ideas, they are completely wasted because of core gameplay that isn't satisfying in the least.

The sound does the trick, and there's some surprisingly fitting dubstep, though that's not something you'd associate with a fantasy game.\n\nSadly, the battle system is a bit shallow. There are some pretty good ideas in there, but combat just doesn't flow as smooth as it could. That's unfortunate, as with a bit more polish this could've been great. As such, I wouldn't quite recommend this game if you are planning on playing it alone, but if you want to run through it with a friend, its a fairly fun experience.\n\nNote: I don't know if everyone has the same problem with this game (that would be a hube mess-up on part of the devs), but if for any reason the game doesn't let you select 1080p from the options menu, you can edit the renderconfig.txt file to get the resolution you want.","October 24, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The game figures your level time into the level completion screen. This means you run almost everywhere while navigating screen to screen. I always felt as if I was flying into holes on accident and that it really broke up the flow of the game to slow down and carefully jump across smaller gaps. As someone who quite enjoys platformers this behavior could've been cleaned up a bit even though this is mainly a brawler style game.\n\nThe inventory system is essentially located in towns. In lieu of actually picking up an item after killing an enemy, you must first kill them all and then immediately determine if you want to equip an item or just leave it behind. The problem with this is that each stage takes time into consideration at the end. If you run across a few items you may want to equip during the course of a stage you may end up hurting your time and not be able to achieve the gold leaf at the end of the stage.\n\nThe voice acting is bad. I have at least some modicum imagination, I wouldn't fault simple text over the inclusion of bad voice acting.\n\nI've seen some criticism that the combat is monotonous. I think if your goal is solely to beat each stage that may ring true but if you play each stage a few times to try to achieve a gold you will level much more appropriately and understand the reason for the style of combat used. If your objective is to get a gold leaf on each stage it seems like you'll need to play each one around 2-3 times. This is only the case if you aren't trying to mainline the stages or overpowered though.\n\nThe controls are a bit odd on a Xbox360 controller with the dodge roll mapped to the right stick.\n\nIn summation I feel this game serves as an adequate brawler that is probably most interesting when played in many short bursts until completion.","November 22, 2015","true","33.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

Neither of us could connect to eachother, so naturally we started to look at our connections - nothing wrong. Everything ran fine, we had no connection trouble but yet we couldn't connect to eachother in the game.\nAfter doing various of things such as restarting routers, reinstalling the game, seeing if firewall or anti-virus programmes blocked we still couldn't play.\n\nBefore all that - when the game actually did work, we ran into many bugs. Such as:\n\n- Not being able to pick up and/or equip offhand weapons that dropped during "dungons" even when we switched weapons around.\n- Random lag issues\n- Enemies getting stuck off-screen not letting you finish whatever section we were on\n- Enemies not appearing\n\nWith the company who created this pile of rubbish being closed down nor will we see any updates and bug fixes.\n\nGraphically it looks alright. That's when you look past the fact, that you can't set the resolution to higher than 1600x900 - so playing in fullscreen wasn't really an option. I found myself being forced to run it in window mode which felt annoying.\n\nWant to play with a controller? Well get an xbox 360 controller then. And don't you dare to touch the keyboard before you have reached the "press start" screen. Otherwise, everything will pop up with keyboard instructions (while you can still use the controller).\n\nIt simply lack settings. For instance, when the multiplayer actually did work for us we liked to hang around on a voice com. Playing with a controller and not wanting to reach for the keyboard everytime we wanted to use push-to-talk, we set the activation button to LB (on the xbox 360 pad) seeing as that button isn't used in the game.\nJust to found out - pressing LB in the lobby opens up whatever team mates steam profile in the steam overlay. Annoying! And there's no way in the settings you can rebind that.\n\nIs it worth €9.99? Absolutely not! Even the €2 euros I paid for it is stretching it.\n\nNo matter what cost, I can't recommend anyone to get this, unless they want to travel through a short and boring single player campaign, and only being able to play with friends sometimes.","July 6, 2014","false","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Or gain new gear by defeating enemies or purchasing them.\n\nThis game feels right at home for me, the story is kind of immature, but I didn't expect more than a reason to go to the right and kill things.  It isn't like Golden Axe had a major driving storyline, we just want to push buttons and see bad guys die.\n\nAnd the satisfaction of earning new levels to your magic is still just as nice.\n\nI think people complaining, were just looking for something deeper.  This is right next to Golden Axe, Legend, Knights of the Round, etc.\n\nIf any of those names hit home for you, score it on sale.

I love Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, Castle Crashers, Final Fight, the Konami X-Men and Simpsons games, and the arcade D&D games, but Sacred: Citadel fails in almost every way. What's more is it fails at even being a game that you want to ackowledge in the Sacred game universe. If you're a fan of Sacred 1 or 2, chances are, you will not have a good time here. Even if you play with friends, even if you like arcade games, even if you like humor about flatulence and overweight people, you will likely find this game to just be annoying. I like the occassional joke of bodily functions, but it seems like this game has more fart jokes than actual story. This game lacks style, substance, and almost any familiar tones to the games that made Sacred a great series. I like the art style, I like the animations, but everything else just annoys me. I know it's not the gameplay because if I shut my brain off, I can enjoy myself; but then a character speaks and I want to quit to desktop.\nInstead of playing this, just play more Sacred 2 or Sacred 1. If you don't own those games, but you're looking at Sacred: Citadel, think again and just do yourself a favor: Buy either of the amazing, top-down, hardcore role-playing games with the right balance of humor, action, story, and character progression.\n\n+ Some loot\n+ Classic arcade style gameplay\n+ Art style\n+ Animations\n\n- Nothing is Sacred (bah-dum-tish)\n- No familiar classes (Is that a Seraphim or a wannabe?)\n- Not enough loot\n- Not visceral enough\n- Not near enough role-playing elements\n- Shared loot\n- Solo is boring\n- Lackluster story\n- Way too easy\n- Doesn't feel like Ancaria\n- Not enough familiar enemy types\n- Leveling doesn't feel rewarding\n- Humor falls flat\n- Even co-op can be dull due to game's difficulty","September 16, 2014","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Both genres use the "belt-scroller" style of level design, both have the standard "move forward, kill enemies, repeat", but there are numerous subtle yet key differences that set them apart. Usually the simple answer is that everyone has weapons in hack & slashers (Konami's TMNT arcade games, Castle Crashers, etc), but uh...hmm. Capcom's Arcade D&D games feature characters with weapons, and I consider that a beatemup. On the other hand, t...\n\nWait...What? Uh...let's just get on with the review.\n\nSacred Citadel is a videogame. You kill things, acquire stuff, and complete challenges. I don't recommend this game, but it isn't bad. Out of 10 I'd give it a 4.1. By IGN's standards that might mean SC is a terrible, horrible, no good pile of etc, but eh I think it's ok. The plot is traditional fantasy fare. Big Momma is causing trouble, some mysterious person is seeking artifacts, and there's a bunch of monsters that need a good killin'. I imagine fans of the Sacred series will have a better understanding of what's going on. I played through Sacred 2 on the Xbox 360, but I lost track of the story in the middle of thousands of quests, billions of items, and hundreds of lands/dungeons/universes.\n\nThere are four classes to choose from (Warrior, Ranger, Shaman, Mage).\nAfter deciding on your class (which IMO doesn't make a huge difference) you'll set out on a journey through 4 acts with 5 stages apiece. The level-designs are very traditional, but this game mixes it up a bit with mounts, falling objects, and even a little platforming.\n\nThe monsters typically consist of um...Grimmocs? Bedellers? Digestya? Covinters? I think I'm just making words up. There are "orcs" with spears, "mutant tribals" with swords, "robots" with shield-thingies, and you get the idea I hope. Whatever they're actually called is irrelevant, because they're mostly fodder for you to make disgusting paste out of. I play a lot of arcade beatemups (& hack & slashers). These tend to be really difficult. The odds aren't fair in the slightest, you get 2 or 3 lives, and enemies can do a lot of damage. Sacred Citadel is pretty much the exact opposite.\n\nThis isn't an easy game just because it has RPG elements. One of the standard tactics in a belt-scroller is "herding". You move around to manipulate the enemies, so that they crowd up together. When enemies separate, they tend to surround you, mess up your attacks, and generally ruin your day. It's like some awkward dance with occasional punching. It definitely pays off if you know what you're doing. With SC...all you have to do to herd enemies is X X X Y. This sends them flying to the corner of the screen. Aftwards you can just press X X X and X X X and X X X and you get where I'm going with this? Decisions in this game tend to consist of:\n\n"Do I press X X X down Y and stun them?"\n"Do I press X X up Y and juggle them?"\n"Do I just press whatever because it doesn't really matter?"\n\nIt's nice having RPG elements, it's nice having many attack options, but there's no incentive to doing well because there's no challenge. Even if you choose a supposedly squishy class like the Shaman, you can still take lots of damage, healing items are prevalant, and you can even keep a few healing potions for emergencies. It's not uncommon to play through this game for the first time, and never die. The only aspect where you are liable to fail involves the stage rankings, book-keeper challenges, and certain "don't get hit by XXXX" achievements. All this other stuff really amounts to is a grind, since it requires playing through every stage a handful of times.\n\nStill, while it eventually becomes a boredom-inducing ordeal, Sacred Citadel can be a satisfying in terms of leveling-up, acquiring loot, and gutting monsters by the dozen. If you expect anything more; like a challenge, or some truly compelling game-design, you're bound to be disappointed.","February 7, 2015","false","11.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Four characters, a few short acts, and one or two abilities are all you are going to get.\n\nThat being said, what is in the game is pretty fun. The combat connects well, the enemies are frequent and malleable, and the controls are easy to pick up. If you are looking for a quick COOP game to introduce someone to the beat'm'up genre, this wouldn't be the worst place to start.\n\nMy recommendation? Get it for a buck or so if you really need a game to play, but otherwise keep looking. There are far more fun and interesting games out there.","May 13, 2014","false","8.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Its a side scrolling, action-packed, button masher. We both know you button mash anyway, so quit hating on it for that reason.\n\nNow. This game is perfect for those who have low-end PC's and want to play locally with their friends, meaning you can hook up to 3 xbox controllers(depending on your PC) and start kicking ♥♥♥. There is an online mode, allowing you to play with four players(As far as I know, you can't play online with more than one local player).\n\nIt is actually quite interesting in some ways. There are 3 types of challeges that you can complete while on a mission, making it tougher to complete missions without just slicing your way through the game. And like in most fighting games, you can perform combo's, devloping more powerful combo's as you level up. Some of the attacks are quite visually appealing(I'm playing as the Mage, and she is badass with her magic attacks).\n\nYou have the option to purchase(In-game currency) or pickup powerful normal and elemental weapons as you progress. Your enemies also start to get stronger as well, and more intelligent AI's start to pop up. The Bosses can be extremely difficult, because some can summon enemies while they prepare special attacks that do tremdeous damage, even 1 hit kills.\n\nThe levels themselves are very appealing to the eye, and what I really like is that there are traps in hidden locations on the maps that can be a game ender.\n\nAre you an achievement who.re? Then this game is perfect for you. There are some extremely impossible achievements for this game, and it WILL have you rage quiting multiple times ;)\n\n*Note: If you go into town, you can get free coins that are hidden in crates that are on the exit end of town. Just smash the boxes and you have infinite money because it respawns everytime you go to town!! Abuse it! ;D","October 15, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That really is the best way to think of this game - don't look for continuity with previous Sacred games - it's not meant to be like that.  Great brawler with some light RPG elements.  Lotta folks don't seem to like it, but I thought it was pretty solid.\n","January 9","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
