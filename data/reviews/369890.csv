Rarely do I ever need an excuse to play a game over and over just for shinier loot, some unlocks, or acquiring dollarz for the game art-galleries I'll never peruse. Arcade ports at or around full-price are a hard sell, so it never hurts to have extra modes or something to shoot for besides a hi-score. The nicest aspect of these extras is that they create another incentive for gamers to replay the game. The more they play it, the better they get. For example: By the time I filled out the art gallery in Dynamite Cop on the Dreamcast, I could beat the game without dying.\n\nHere's the rub. When you play an arcade port, you're already given everything you need in order to complete the game. Your ability to get further is determined by practice, knowledge, and talent. Riddled Corpses gives you nothing, and expects you to work like a dog for several hours. Only by grinding enough cash can your character become strong enough to beat the game. This is a twin-stick shooter, but you start off crazily underpowered. You can be an ace in the genre, but it doesn't really matter. Without leveling up your damage-output, you will become overwhelmed and killed.\n\nFrom Metroidvania to Disgaea, we are always looking for more efficient grinding methods. With Riddled Corpses, survival mode is the only way to make cash. Typically, players are given incentives to attempt the story mode. Even if they have weak characters, they should still be able to eke out some rewards to build their abilities. Not so with this game. The most baffling decision is that there are no cash rewards for completing stages. Furthermore, there is no way to increase stats in-between stages. There is a shop, but it's only for temporary items like med-kits and dynamite. So all you can really do is die, then upgrade, then give it another shot.\n\nBut why fuss around with that? Playing story mode before you've maxed out your character of choice is a waste of time. It's faster and less time-consuming to grind out Survival mode for everything you need. While this mode gets overly difficult in a short amount of time, it doesn't require any serious effort. Maybe you'll get lucky, score some dynamite, and collect an extra 700-1000 gold an attempt. This becomes a very mind-numbing experience. You may find yourself wondering why your precious hours in survival mode couldn't be spent elsewhere. Maybe you could have seen a movie? Learned a stage in a difficult 2D shooter? Trolled messageboards? Anything would be more fulfilling.\n\nThe worst part is when you're finally ready for the arcade mode.\nYou discover that It's too easy.\n\nDue to the rate at which enemies/bosses appear, survival mode is eventually going to become more difficult than anything in the main mode. You've got dozens of enemies spawning from every direction and they're flooding the screen with projectiles. It's an absolutely hopeless situation. The arcade mode is breezy by comparison (provided you're sufficiently powered-up). Yes the bosses will fill the screen with projectiles but...well let me break it down.\n\nIn a 2D shooter, bosses will make use of a variety of bullet-patterns. At times they will create something mundane and easily dodgeable, but mix it up with other projectiles in an attempt to throw off your rhythm. Riddled Corpses never really moves beyond the mundane. There's a constant bullet-pattern for every boss-fight, and they do very little to deviate. You'll occasionally see one or two additional projectiles, but it's never enough to cause problems or force you to adapt. The possibility of death still exists, but it's only via running into large zombies. Also, you can always stock up on med-kits & dynamite in-between each stage.\n\nIn short: If this game didn't have the massive grind, it would be much shorter. This is a textbook example of bloat. An arcade title can be seemingly insurmountable at first, but still be well-designed. Riddled Corpses is a brick wall, and can be overcome only through nonsensical work. Beating the game didn't really feel like an accomplishment. Instead, it felt like the expected result of having too much free time.","July 1, 2015","false","10.9"," 118 of 142 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","118","142","6","3"

Well, it is if you use a controller, that is. This arcadey, zombie-shootin' extravaganza set in a bird's eye view will send you back to the classic age, setting you free to wreak beautiful carnage and chaos upon the cute- yet terrifying- little zombies, and various mutated creatures. Upgrade your weapon to dish out the damage you need to save the local area... and the world! Don't forget about explosions! Play lots of varied maps to defeat all the local monsters, claim the area for your own, and earn gold to buy both upgrades and new characters to suit your style. Build yourself up and get as strong as possible with the gold drops, and have a blast doing it!\n\nPros & Cons\n++  Pros\n+ Controller compatible\n+ Easy to learn\n+ Easy controls\n+ Fun 8/16 bit pixel art\n+ Fast paced\n+ Great sounds effects\n+ Co-op\n+ Trading cards\n+ Great Character models and art\n\n-- Cons\n- Crude anime menu screen\n- Lacks customization\n- Lack of different guns\n- No online multiplayer\n- Visuals are hard to make out\n- No story\n\nSummary     Though this is a simple game, it still has much to offer. You play as a character “Jon" and you defeat waves of enemies as you walk down the road. Every now and then you will even get waves that have small bosses and different enemies. As you defeat more and more waves you will notice an increase of difficulty that will keep you on the edge of your seat. As you achieve higher level waves, more and more zombies will come and more and more gold will drop. Though do not fret, most of the time when you die, you will have gained enough gold to purchase upgrades and do even more damage your next time around. Most of the achievements are for leveling and defeating difficult monsters.\n\nPersonal Opinion     I am definitely happy that I got this game and I will be playing this game often. The fun and chaos makes it definitely worth the price! I am also glad that its 8 and 16 bit, because sometimes its nice to fall back on easy graphics after spending hours on a high intensity graphics game. This is a nice game to sit back in your chair at night with your controller and just have a good time. Nothing to complicated, nothing too simple, just a perfect blend of enjoyment.\n\nFinal recommendation:      I give this game a 7.5/10, mainly because there could be a lot more polish to this game. There could also be a lot of additions to make it a better experience overall. This is a great game to play solo, but as with most games, it is better playing with a buddy. The price is decent, but don't pick it up unless you are really interested or it is on sale. Maybe pick up two, send one to a buddy. Most of the downsides can be forgiven due to the fun you will have with the intense gameplay. Hope this helps you decide the correct path.\n\nProofread by Novusuniversitasvir & Frey Cloudseer\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:\n\nLike here!","September 14, 2015","true","5.9"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","31","37","2","3"

But where the issues start to arise is the gameplay. The lack of variety becomes a huge issue when the games design format forces you to replay the same areas over and over again, as the game has an RPG mechanic to up your damage and fire rate, which is necessary to get through the hordes of enemies that come on the later waves. A lack of spawn point protection in particular causes a major problem, as dealing with a huge horde of zombies can lead  to instant death, which then causes to go through the same boring waves that you are overlevelled for. That's what kills the game in the end, as that combined with the lack of variety with limited powerups and only your regular weapon and no different pickup-able weapons makes a game that plays very much the same every time you play: and that's a bad thing.\n\nFor Game Play Video and Audio First Impressions: http://youtu.be/DW8dHqpsbDA\n\nLists\n\n+:\nTechnically competent. Game runs at 30 FPS but with no lag or frame rate drop.\nControls are competent and are the necessary precision that you would expect from a game with this genre.\nVisuals are reminiscent of the 16 bit era and do the job for the most part.\nFor those difficulty chasers who are willing to put up with repetition, this game is up your alley.\n-:\nLack of gun variety and gameplay variety hurts the game overall. You're just shooting dudes, and nothing really changes in the variety of that with only 2 power ups, and no weapon pickups.\nGameplay requires repeated runs with the upgrade system due to hitting walls in game. Your firerate/damage eventually hits a point where you can't deal with enemy spawn rate and health, and that causes you to do things repeatedly over and over again by starting levels again.\nLack of protection regarding enemy spawns means that an enemy can spawn on top of you when you are trapped in the corner. This leads to frustrating deaths as the health system is unforgiving in that way. And there's no pattern here in terms of those spawns from what  I see.\nBecause of the repetition, the music, which initially is fun to listen to, wares on you rather quickly, to the point where you want it out of your head. Some more variety in music could have helped this.\nDeceptive hitboxes are larger boss enemies in terms of attempting to move above them.","June 2, 2015","false","2.4"," 43 of 65 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","43","65","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomineh/recommended/369890/","nomineh","Nomine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomineh/","759 products in account","A fun and challenging twin-stick shooter with some flaws that sadly has "arcade mode" where you don't have checkpoints as it's main game mode. Why is this bad?\n\n- You have to die to progress - enemies start having too much health for your firepower\n- When you die, you have to start all the way from beginning.. there are LOTS of enemies to kill again.\n- Upgrades are costy, characters are pretty costy and other characters have to be unlocked either at extreme cost or by repeating levels over and over again with almost the same gold gain on each level, even if they are harder.\n- Slow progression\n\nIndeed, levels take long to complete and award almost the same amount of money, with the early levels getting more and more trivial each time and only becoming a chore afterwards.\n\nAnother small problem would be the amount of things you have to look out for on your screen. Bosses themselves might be just a little challenging, but the true challenge is in the spawn system - enemies spawn anywhere on the screen and sometimes even during boss fights. Every now and then you get these extreme spawns of enemies that shoot at you right after spawning and you have to evade that while evading 10 other shots coming from all directions.\n\nUsually you will get hit a few times from the insane spawn in such encounters unless you have money for dynamites (you most likely won't have for extra in the first few hours). In these encounters you need to:\n\n- Run away from many shots coming from different directions\n- Keep moving to avoid those shots and enemy spawns\n- Avoid unkilled enemies\n- Destroy high HP obstacles to have more space to move in\n- Have some dynamite if your firepower isn't high enough\n- Kill a miniboss while doing all this (1 hit from miniboss or boss = dead)\n\nThe game has a fitting soundtrack. Good and sort of addictive, but repetitive.\n\nThe game has some grammar errors / poor english.\n\nEven though that's a lot of negatives, I would recommend buying or at least trying the game because of the fun factor. The idea is there, but I think it could use some polish.\n\nThen again, I wouldn't be surprised if the "grind" is a intended feature because of recent Steam Refund update - it at least keeps people playing.\n\n8/10 for now","June 9, 2015","true","12.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Not sure if this would be easier with a local co-op friend helping, but it would take atleast a few hours before you have a decently leveled character to start advancing to the next stage.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/369890/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1846 products in account","**QUICK THOUGHTS** Riddle Corpses is a throw back to the classic 16-bit era, but with the modern standards of grinding. Picture clicker titles like Crusaders of the Lost Idols crossed with Shmup physics and an on-rails progressing Survival Mode, and you get this very grindfest. Sadly, it lacks a good amout of definition.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic, and the score is spot on with the days of SNES and Sega Genesis. The problem is that you don't really get to choose how you progress your characters. Instead, you have the simple choice of spending money you earned in game to level up your chosen character, of which there are a number of to unlock. I'd love the option to choose strength over health or other upgrades, but that's just not the case here.\n\nIt's also a pain that uou have to exit out of Arcade Mode or Survival Mode to access the Upgrade Menu to make said purchases, making doing so more of an inconvenience. An in-game option to upgrade would also have been nice, but, alas, it is lacking. There are additional rare objects you can pick up, but aside showing up in the Upgrade Menu, I don't really see the point other than bragging rights.\n\nThis title also has local co-op, which is a nice feature. Sadly, I don't have anyone willing to join me in it, as grind-based games aren't exactly everyone's cup of tea. I'd love the option to take this title on-line, and hopefully one day the developer will put that mode in. But, until then, I'm sure a good amount of my time will be devoured by just grinding my way to level 130 on each character to unlock the game's achievements.\n\nAll that said, I do recomend this title. It's a fun little pick up and play game that grind fans will find more a casual experience to widdle the time away until your next task in reality.","April 9","true","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/recommended/369890/","hippyshake","Hippyshake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/","1352 products in account","(TL;DR is final paragraph)\nRiddled Corpses (RC) mixes the "twinstick shooter" gameplay of Robotron 2084 with the Forward Crawl & Stage mechanic from "Beat 'Em Up" games (such as Double Dragon or Bad Street Brawler). If you're an oldschool gamer (or just old, like me) you'll recognize and appreciate the choices made here, and the respect and love that RC displays for the genre.\n\nThere's really no plot: Select a character, hold down the fire button and decimate zombies; pick up health or dynamite (what we used to call "smart bombs" back in the day); rinse and repeat. Coins dropped by zombies can be used to upgrade or unlock characters. That's it. But, really, who cares? The genre is tried and true, and still loads of fun. Better yet, Riddled Corpses features so many thoughtfully designed touches, that you don't even notice them at first.\n\nFor example, power-ups make a different noise when you collect them, so that you don't even have to see them to know that you have one (and sometimes, you won't see them amidst all the on-screen chaos, so this really becomes useful). Likewise, the end of a wave also features a special sound, so that you don't have to take your eyes of the frenetic battle surrounding your character.\n\nThis type of game is, by its very nature a grind,. However, that doesn't mean it's boring. Two modes of play (Arcade and Survival), along with unlockable characters (each with their own special quality, such as a magnet that attracts money and perks) keep things interesting. Some enemies offer bullet-hell styled run-n-gunning, which also keeps the action moving. In another nice touch, each character has their own weapon and upgrades, so the graphics for each one are different. I really appreciated that; even though the level 15 weapon for one character may do the same amount of damage as another character, the fact that they look different keeps things interesting.\n\nThe music and art are well above average and, while I'm not generally into bit tunes, this is a soundtrack I'd listen to if it were available.\n\nThere are some things that could be tweaked. Boss deaths, while satisfying, create such massive and prolonged explosions that it's impossible to see what is going on in a signifcant portion of an already-cluttered and chaotic playfield. More than once, I've lost a game simply because I killed a boss and the explosion (which doesn't seem to cause any splash-back damage) allowed a baddie to slip beneath, unnoticed.\n\nAlso, the random perk drops, such as first aid kits and dynamite, seem a little too random.  I've played games (in RC) where multiples of the same perk have literally dropped too fast for me to use them before the next drop, and then I've played games where I've gone ten minutes or more without a single drop. In a game as well-structured and thought out as Riddled Corpses, this seems to be a bit of an oversight. Another curious choice is that health packs are consumed as soon as you run over them, whether or not you are at full health; it would be nice if they couldn't be picked up until after the player has taken damage, to keep from accidentally "using" them.\n\nFinally, keys are not rebindable, which is a pretty big deal, particulary for the arcade genre. Keyboard players (such as myself) need to be able to feel comfortable with the controls, as they may be scrambling to hit the right key milliseconds before potential death. Also, menu selections (including resuming from a pause) can only be done via the keyboard, which means (if you're a keyboard and mouse player) you must either take your hand off directional keys or the mouse (firing button) in order to resume a game. If you had to pause in the middle of an intense fight, there's a possibility you'll die while trying to resume due to this (so plan accordingly). The game does offer gamepad support, although I have not tested it, so it's possible that gameplay can be resumed via a button on the pad for those gamers who use them.\n\n(TL;DR) All that aside though, rarely have a played a game in this genre where the difficulty curve is this perfect. From the very first level, the challenge took me far enough to know that I wanted to see more, and it was an easy decision to press that replay button one more time. The developer is active on the discussion boards and seems open to improving the game. Even if he weren't, Riddled Corpses is fast, frantic, and fun, and it's one of the finest arcade games I've played in a long, long while.\n\nRecommended.","October 8, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No. Is it still worth playing? Yes, and here's why:\n\nRiddled Corpses is a throw back to the arade games of the late 80's: mutants, zombies, and Engrish. It's a frenetic twin-stick shooter that demands zen-like concentration at times and a willingness to invest a few hours of grinding as well.\n\nThe grinding is what polarizes peoples opinions of this game. "Grinding? In an arcade shooter?" Yup. In order to get stronger and to get sub-weapons, you need cash. You get cash by killing enemies. Survival Mode is the best place to get cash. So you'll spend quite a bit of time there. See, at that point, RC becomes a score grind which reminds me of classic Atari-age shooters where the score was all that mattered. For that, I'm cool with it.\n\nThe graphics are bright, varied, and colorful. Enemy design is nice. The music is pretty good. It controls as well as it should. It's just the grinding. Raw skill only gets you so far with RC, and while some feel that it's a poor design choice having to grind for more firepower, it needs to be addressed that if it wasn't for the grinding and steep difficulty, this game would be over in a single sitting offering little replay value.\n\nIf you can accept nut-punchingly difficult shooting and a required sense of dedication, this game is worth the purchase.","August 20, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MogeVR/recommended/369890/","MogeVR","MogeѴЯ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MogeVR/","59 products in account","There comes a point where Originality becomes nigh-impossible, so instead, unless you are a whacky genius, your best bet would be to take a already established trope, and injecting into it some variants rarely seen to create a unique concept, along with cramming your game with love and entertaining design, that's where Riddled Corpses comes in.\n\nStoryWhat was the name of the overused cliches undead people again? Yeah, those.\nAt this point, I swear im totally fed up with them, is no different here, things go badly and suddenly we have a plot device that's just as generic as possible, however, while the story is no longer than 3 lines, everything else makes up for it.\n\nGameplayZombies and Bullet hell-Shoot'em'up gameplay, so this is what psychodelic drugs would make you come up with, huh?\nK, free of awful jokes, this mix is quite unique and well dam implemented at that.\nThe shooting mechanics are great, annihilating every abomination in your way is very satisfying and while the Screen can get very worked with the amount of bullets present at times, it is exhilarating to slip around bullets like a boss, plus it manages to run silky-smooth even with a cabbage PC like mine, so I dare to say this game can be enjoyed even with 2009's Notebooks.\nThe Items you can use to your aid are also pretty sweet stuff, mainly the Dynamite which blows everything up and gives you cash money for every killed enemy, the Stopwatch and Turret lose a lot of effectiveness in the later Levels where mostly everything shoots at you, so they are not bad, just situational.\n\nDesignWhile the Shoot'em'up and Bullet Hell mechanics are very well implemented, the Level Up system is beyond being a tiresome chore to handle, you need to constantly rack up Gold in order to enhance your firepower and make yourself more effective, you can even purchase some other Chars that have special traits if you have enough Gold.\nThe Lvling starts cheap enough, but afterwards, nearing Lv20, the prices turn obnoxiously high compared to the amount of Gold you would gain from Arcade, some could call it Replayability, but considering there is only 2 Game Modes, i would rather call it padding via limitations.\n(I personally reccomend unlocking Liery as soon as possible, her 2x Money and Survival Mode (Wave 4 onwards) will give you the highest profit possible).\n\nNow if there is a slip-up, is how when using the Keyboard, the HUD remains opaque, even when there are mobs or you are nearby, so you could get pot-shotted if you don't have a sharp eye for that sort of thing, I once tried it with the X360 controller and the HUD became transparent.\nThere is also this bug where if you pause the game around the time a Mini-boss or Boss would spawn and the game is still paused, the game will crash, so... Patch?\n\nGraphicsPixel Art at its finest, ladies and gents.\nThe level of detail in this game's art is just dumbfounding, the brilliant colors and some of the dark or bright aesthetics in the levels mix into a art direction that i love and can't get enough of, even during the most down-to-earth and dark locations, it still manages to be greatly polished, and for that, i applaud it.\n\nSoundtraxIn my personally opinnion, it hops up and down throughout the game, the Stage 1 theme is embedded into my head and the Stage 2 tune is pretty nice too, but afterwards, I legit am unable to hum any other theme by heart, yeah, that includes Stage 5, in which i had to replay possible more times than Stage 1, is not terrible, is just a bit roller-coaster...y.\n\nDurationAs hinted during the Design category, this game's length is entirely up to how much of a completionist you are about this, you can easily try to get better and you can Lv the base character to 20 and get through Arcade mode in like... 30 mins.\nAfterwards, Survival is there to challenge you to see how much mobs can you slaughter before you rip in peace... If you are behind a Hi-score.\nFor so, if you are not seeking the Achievements, this game can be no longer than a pair of hours once you get some good fire and beat Arcade mode, but if you decide to go full Achievement, expect your game time to near 20 hours.\n\ntl;drFor its asking price, this game is worth checking out, specially if you are particularly interested in the cliche zombie trope and also like your Shoot'em'up to be hard as balls (Almost like a kid-friend version of Touhou at times), charming art style and very competently designed gameplay mechanics, this game is a quick but solid burst of entertainment (or sheer frustration depending on your Skeelz), perfect for a Arcade-styled game.\n\nConsequentially, i shall rate this game...\nBig Booty in the Main Menu/10","May 28","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Riddled Corpses looks great on the surface - good graphics, solid premise, and a decent upgrades system which incentivises continude play. Then after the first half hour you start to notice the things that aren't quite right, and they sour the whole experience.\n\nThe largest issue is visibility - large portions of the screen are obscured by the HUD, and it's just unnecessary. And it gets worse the more you play - boss bars, wave timers, and your turret (once purchased) all take up additional screen space. Environmental objects in stage 4 further hinder visibility. It's no exaggeration to say that whatever difficulty the game has, it owes to hidden enemies and blind dodges. The game makes other cheap shots with its large enemy spawns, which appear as circles but can drop enemies of any size on top of you.\n\nControls are another sore spot. The game was clearly designed for the X360 controller - and for the basics, this is fine; left stick moves, right stick shoots, everyone is happy. But items are assigned to the face buttons (again, no option to remap) and if you want to use them you either have to stop shooting or contort your hand into strange positions, which is ridiculous when the shoulder triggers are available. Keyboard controls are nonexistent, though there is a terrible mouse+keyboard control scheme you can use (for further irritation, the game does not even tell you which of the three item keys uses each item).\n\nThere are other smaller annoyances - the only at all effective way to grind gold is to dynamite stage 1 over and over, turning off sound effects will allow random effects to still play, pacing is quite slow (stages can be up to 9 minutes long by my timing). I'm also disappointed that Arcade Mode is not really what I expected - it's simply not possible to play like an arcade game, as it's tied in to the rest of the game's grinding system and it quickly becomes impossible without prepurchased upgrades. But Riddled Corpses would have been a fine game for what it is without its many extremely obvious (and easily addressed) flaws.\n\nReaders might notice that I put quite a few hours into this game. It's not unplayable - as another reviewer noted, it's not a bad side activity for listening to podcasts. But it's frustrating to see a developer do so well, then start dropping the ball on things that are not small details. The strong start just intensifies how much Riddled Corpse's flaws hurt it - real fun is right in front of it, and all it delivers is mindless activity.","December 11, 2015","false","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
