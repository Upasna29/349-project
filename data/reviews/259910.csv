I requested "tech support" thru Steam and they granted me an audience 2 weeks later with the standard remove the game then re-download, etc. etc and obviously didn't read my ticket that I carefully typed out to them explaining exactly what it was doing and what the problem was. This game is buggy as hell (before Steam got a hold of it), and they had to have known it was going to be a problem based on the reviews of this game online. Add that to completely incompetant and nonexistant tech support via Steam and you have a waste of money on your hands. There is a group out here on Steam warning people about Steam's refusal to stand behind the games they sell, nor give refunds, nor give store credit, etc. We need to join together with groups like this to demand Steam take better care of its customers and starting appreciating our $ and act like a real store.","November 30, 2013","false","1.6"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","49","57","0","1"

My primary complain is that there is no competition; no other farms are trying to service the cities so the only game over is if you spend yourself into a corner. Trying to create a grain farm is thankless and unrewarding, which might be realistic, but it pretty much mandates that you enter into beef cattle or dairy (dairy has a huge ROI). The graphics are pleasant, but the SFX for clicking buildings is obnoxious and the music is wildly out of place for this bucolic setting.

Sadly, Farming Giant's method of play, has left little excitement in playing one you find out how poor the interface is, and how limited your actual farming operation can be in the early game.\n\nThe game forces you to have to raise both animals and grow crops in order to level up your "character" which would in turn allow you to build additional processing facilities, barn/silo/vehicle sizes and even allow you to sell specific products.  However, I kept finding myself having massive grass shortages due to limited equipment in order to feed my ever-increasing cow population, meaning that I had to continuously tinker with the very-poorly designed vehicle action tools, which sometimes I didn't even know if I had actually selected the correct options to begin with.\n\nThe interface was not very intuitive and that really hurt the fun aspect of the game.

I would personally also like it if the chilled storage allowed you to store milk.\n\n\nThere are not many farming simulators from a business point of view out on the market, so if the above issues were addressed this game would be perfect. It does take a little extra patience to put up with the crashing but sometimes you can tell its going to happen (sometimes you will notice the game "Lag" a little when running x3 speed, that's your cue to save the game as it will crash in a few seconds).\n\nThere is plenty of different crops to grow, animals to breed, and you earn achievements which you can spend on the skill tree to boost many different things, driver speed, growth rate of certain crops, breeding rates, have your buildings use up less water/electric. you can build your own wind turbines and solar panels and eventually build a bio-gas plant to turn manure and corn into electric!\n\n\nThere are two game modes, scenarios with pre determined objectives and campaign, campaign is a free play mode where you have to "level up" to unlock crops/animals and buildings, however the achievements earned, and your level are saved so if you start a new campaign map you don't have to climb the ranks again! so its great if you fancy a fresh start but don't wish to lose your level.\n\nI apologise for the rambling, I just wanted to write my own little review on this game as while yes it has bugs, but hey a lot of games do -cough EA cough- it's defiantly worth the price and worth it even better in a sale.","October 8, 2014","true","68.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

There is some issues with crashing, but there are work arounds for this. You just need the patience to fiddle around with it for a while. For me it worked when I deleted all the scenario saves. It works perfectly now, and trust me, it took quite a while to figure out!\n\nEven with the bugs, it's worth the price. It's realistic, absorbing, and though the tutorial could be better, it's pretty easy to learn and once you do, it's really fun. Build your buildings, decide if you want to buy or raise your supplies, whether you want to sell live animals or raw products and sell them or if you want to process them first... But remember, the more you have, the more you have to manage... Even if you're just growing crops, you have to watch the water, ph levels, your machinery maitenence... Where you buy your land affects those all...\n\nIf you love farming, or sim games, or both, you'll love this.","June 22, 2014","true","53.0"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

You need to layout fields, seed crops, fertilize, water, harvest, care for animals, make deliveries, etc. This is a true sandbox and every little bit is up to you.

Ones u give a truck an order u can not change or stop it until its completed. If u accept an order job for example they want u to deliver ### cows to them.. and if u deplete your supply they wont breed anymore.. and it takes a lot off paying attention and anticipating to prevent this from happening. It has no auto save system which is semi-standart on these type of games. Also vital for crashes and windows update restarting itself in the background etc. The UI is very limited especially regarding where your trucks are, since u can only give them commands when their in the garage and they are usually in the middle of no where without a simple way to check what they are doing and were they are heading.\n\nnot only did i have to try 3 diffrent solutions to stop it from crashing. The trucks sometimes stop riding and stand at the middle of an intersection untill you save the game and reload the game again.. ntm u will fail your deadlines if u dont notice them getting stuck on another part of the map..\n\nBottom line.. this game had TERRIFIC potential.. but for some reason they, as i would say.. released an unfinished game.. Too bad really.. im hoping there will be a sequal where they will actually "finish" this game.","December 14, 2013","false","16.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Nearly all of their games feel rushed to market with very little play testing for bugs and once they are on the market there seems to be little to no support from this group.  As for this title?  I like the idea behind this game but it is no different than any other released by this group.  It plays very much like a meaty version of the old 90s versison of Sim Farm and it could be a decent game if it were properly fixed and updated.  But as it stands it has a very flimsy tutorial that doesn't tell you much, the game is prone to crashing (the dev will tell you it's your fault despite it being a constant complaint online by many people), the mechanics stop working within the game often (things stop working, machines stop working for no reason, etc), and the game takes micro-managing to the extreme.  Not only do I NOT recommend this title but I very strongly do NOT recommend this title or any other title from UIG.
