Aesthetically, it feels a bit like a graphics card demo.  If you have a 3D monitor, you will want to use it here.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it manages to combine unique (and often challenging) puzzles with a powerful sense of tranquility and exploration.  The game has a very soft open, meaning that it is entirely up to you to discern what you're doing and why.  In a way, that leaves almost the entirety of the game vague, but more than anything this enhances the sense of immersion and discovery.  The game is NOT simple, and yet it never leaves you feeling pressured.  And, interestingly, long after you're likely to have forgiven the game's opening vagueness, it is compellingly explained.\n\nThe story, which the game absolutely has, unfolds at an unusual pace that might have been created as a challenge to traditional story arc diagrams.  Without resorting to spoilers, I suggest you simply play and wait for it -- it works, and it works well.  Anyone who might claim that the game lacks a plot or makes dismissive comparisons to "Dear Esther" etc. didn't get very far.  The quiet, early game atmosphere counts for a lot.\n\nA beautiful, instant classic.","May 28, 2015","true","38.5"," 252 of 268 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","252","268","12","5"

But I can't recommend buying it. Definitely not at 15 USD.\nI'm not even sure if I had fun. It felt a little tedious and the slowness of movement was padding for time, not atmosphere.\nThe puzzles were a little fun, but a little on the easy side. The hardest aspect and quite fun at first was learning to read again.\nThis game is GORGEOUS. Up there with the prettiest at the moment, like Ethan Carter. But the game is WAYYY too short, and there's little variance with the setting, and not much to explore. I beat this in two hours, and that was with getting stuck on the freaking drawers and spending a lot of time figuring out that one.\nAnyway, if you have doubts about buying this, probably don't.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/244910/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","What is it?Homesick is a narrative-style indie game that sits somewhere between The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Dear Esther (but with considerably more 'game' than the latter).  Your objective is no more than to find out what happened, why you are there and how to escape by a small amount of puzzle-solving and decyphering of cryptic code to reveal what happened.  Homesick is a short game and mostly entails you unlocking access to various areas that form one floor of an abandoned apartment block and eventually piecing together the story before finding your escape.\n\nHow long is it?The game will take no more than 3-5 hours if played thoroughly (that is: solving all the puzzles and then, after decyphering the remainder of the code, backtracking to read all the pages and letters you were unable to read earlier in the game in order to properly piece together what happened.  If you don't backtrack, you're probably looking at an hour less.  Whether or not it offers replayability is a tough one.  I can imagine I will play it again much further on in time, but of course will remember what needs solving and when, so will likely just play it just to repeat the experience in the same way I might reread a good book.\n\nIs it scary?No, but it is haunting atmospherically and can feel a little tense at times (in the nightmare sequences).  The bleakly beautiful music score creates a melancholy backdrop to your waking hours shuffling through decay and detritus of a building's former existence.  The visuals are superb as is the music.  Minor spoiler if you like to know about anything scaremongering at all: there is one minor jump-scare at the very end of the game, but it's not one of those where you scream and drop whatever happens to be in your hands at the time.  Even if you're a self-confessed gaming-wuss like me, you'll be fine.\n\nIs it difficult?It's about on a par with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in terms of difficulty, perhaps a little simpler.  The few non-code puzzles are easy enough to solve after a bit of thought and logic - especially if you use audio as well as visual clues.  The code decyphering is fun, and you will have decyphered it fully by the time you finish the game - even if you think you're struggling at the beginning (trust me on this one - you'll nail it).\n\nAnything not to like?Not really.  Anything I didn't like initially transpired to have a very good reason behind it.  These ranged from pace, to camera views and areas of accessibility - but ALL had reasons (ie deliberate by design), so if you find yourself grumbling about this or that, bear in mind that there is likely a very good reason for it.  The only gripes I had beyond these were the somewhat unwieldy inventory system (would have been easier to have a popup screen to click the required item rather than scroll through each until the correct item was equipped) and I missed the sound effects that might have accompanied my movements as I shuffled through debris, trod on papers and such (just scraping and crunching sounds - the usual stuff).  But they are minor and petty, and are no reason not to enjoy the game itself.\n\nIn summaryIf you enjoy short, narrative driven games with a bit of mystery and puzzle-solving, and think exploring the ruins of abandoned buildings is a bleak but moving experience, then you will enjoy this game greatly.  I hope the developer gives us further, similar experiences in the future.  In the meantime, this little game deserves to occupy a small space in your library.","August 15, 2015","true","5.0"," 65 of 66 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","65","66","4","0"

Playing it filled me with a vague sense of trepidation, but also an overwhelming need to explore and to find out where I was, why I was there and what my purpose was in that place, if I even had one. The puzzles rely on real world logic, so they're quite straightforward and uncomplicated, and I didn't wish they presented a bigger challenge, because to me, it doesn't seem like Homesick is the kind of game that focuses on brain challenges: it's all about exploration, and the puzzles (and their solutions) are just a way of helping you better explore the place around you. The way most of them leave a mark on the environment was amazing to witness: it feels so satisfying to solve something and watch its result bloom around you, an explosion of colour in a landscape almost entirely devoid of all colours that aren't blinding white or washed out grey. The atmosphere in Homesick is exceptional, too, thanks largely to the soundtrack that impressed the pants off of me. It would be an entirely different game without it, which is easy to realise when you're solving one of the puzzles that requires almost complete silence, and you realise how much you miss the music.\n\nSome people have complained about the game being 'too short' - I think it's the perfect length, because the pacing is done just right and no part of the game feels too short or too long, but rather it lasts exactly as long as it needs to.\n\nNo spoilers, but after playing through the game and reading all the documents etc. that I found on the way, the ending left such an emotional impact on me that I cried, not because I was sad, but because I felt sort of... at peace, perhaps, for the game ending the way it did. I can't describe it, it was a mixture of relief and happiness, but it was also bittersweet because of everything that I knew and everything that had preceeded it. I've felt a LOT of different emotions playing games, but never quite something like this. It was amazing. And yes, I think it does have replay value, despite being linear and short, because this is a story I'd like to experience more than once.","July 15, 2015","true","4.4"," 67 of 75 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","67","75","0","0"

The last thing I noticed was also how beautiful it is. The game is just a joy to look at the entire time, I wanted to take a screenshot every  time I turned a corner (and often times I did) just because of how captivating each bit of environment was in the game. Whether it was the stark blasts of white light leaking through windows or it was the shocking amount of wallpaper peeling off the walls, everything is built with such detail and is the obvious result of a lot of effort from the developer. Environments are spectacular, and so are the bits and bobs of info and story you will find in them. I would go into the story more, but I would rather not spoil it, part of what makes this game worth playing is discovering the story for yourself, so I will let you do that.\n\nBut before you do enter the halls of "Homesick" I must warn you that if you are not a fan of games like "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter" or "Gone Home", this is not for you. Most of the game consists of simple puzzles that are solved with either very logical solutions or kind of out of the blue. But there is one paticular section towards the end of the game where the game gets the balance between mind numbingly simple and oddly aloof right, and it finally feels like you are doing something fantastic that also makes sense.\n\nThe game has flaws, specifically the "game" part of "Homesick", but it gets so much stuff right. "Homesick" is a tour through a meticulously built set of rooms that have this oppresive sadness to them but I always had to turn the next corner. Play "Homesick" if you want to see a game made with a lot of heart and double the talent.","June 4, 2015","true","4.1"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","41","44","0","1"

As promised it perfectly brings together the good things of the Point&Click Adventure genre with First-Person-3D-Graphics (where actually only The Vanishing of Ethan Carter did a decent job so far).\nThe puzzles are logical, brooding yet not too difficult. It is at times a bit creepy (in nightmare mode), but you should't expect a horror adventure per definition. What you also shouldn't expect is interaction with other characters, as Homesick obviously plays in a solitude setting.\n\nThere are some puzzles and other things that really impressed me, for example the piano you see in the screenshots that is operational (which I have never seen in a fully 3D game) and of course the extraordinary detailed and beautiful graphics (usually only known from real old-school First-Person-P&C Adventures in 2D, like Scratches or Dark Fall: Lost Souls), especially while keeping in mind that this game is essentially made by only one person. The soundtrack perfectly accentuates the mood of the game, while it isn't something I would like to hear as stand alone. But that's absolutely not a bad thing, as music can either be very good background music (like here) or if it works too good for itself there is the risk that it works distracting from the actual game.\n\nThe play time may be be relatively short (mine is not realistic, as I've been a tester since the first alpha) but Homesick is a true experience if you are into games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter or maybe Gone Home and The Old City ("maybe" means rather didn't really enjoy them because of non-existant puzzles and enormous amount of text to read).","May 28, 2015","true","33.5"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","37","43","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/244910/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","953 products in account","Overview:Homesick is an Indie first-person 3D puzzle-adventure title driven by exploratory gameplay, environmental interaction, and an emotionally sensible narrative. The game has a focus on atmospheric surrealism, and is the first game developed by Lucky Pause on the Unreal Engine after a successful Kickstarter campaign. It is a relatively short game, spanning about four hours. The game deals with sensitive themes, and manages to grasp everyday life in a way that is both foreboding yet serene.\n\n\nStory:You wake up, and your first and most important clue is half a drawing of a child next to some blue flowers. Homesick lacks anything close to a dialogue, what it doesn’t lack is information sprawled throughout the game’s world (a building), all there for you to decipher so that you can deduce what happened that left the inside of a building in such decay. Any text that you might come across -be it a book or a loose piece of paper- is in something that appears to be code or a foreign language; in the last puzzle you are able to decipher these and turn them all into proper letters. That progression encourages the player to turn back and revisit the previously explored places, and in doing so, revealing the lives of the people that resided in the building along with what catastrophic event left the building in its current shape.\n\n\nGameplay:The gameplay consists of exploring a decaying building and interacting with various aspects of its environment. During the day you can go nearly everywhere you want, but cannot stand too close to the windows because you are hypersensitive to sunlight. When you go to sleep you have nightmares, these consist of darkness seeping and dripping upwards from the floor; you have to try to keep moving so that it doesn’t swallow you and wake you up, which prevents you from further progress. Parts of each puzzle are done during the day and other parts during the night. I will not mention the puzzles as to not spoil any of the story, but I will mention that they are satisfyingly challenging without being frustratingly difficult. To solve each puzzle you will have to explore and search, as well as interact with as many things as you can.\n\nAs I mentioned above, a big part of the gameplay is picking up and reading texts laying around the building. There are books, letters, and newspapers from which to acquire information.\n\n\nVisual:Okay, this is where the game shines brightest (figuratively AND literally).\nThis is one of the most photorealistic games I’ve had the pleasure to play. What little animations the game has are done well. All the environments and every object in them are modeled extremely well, but most of all it’s the textures that make this game a truly and strikingly impressive feat, and an absolute joy to look at.\n\nHere are some of the many screenshots I took of the game, the third of which is my personal favourite:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=684680358\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=684679555\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=684681725\n\nSomething I’d like to add about the visuals, the game is relatively customizable for its genre. It has console commands, where you can change your FOV and how fast you move, to name a couple of its features. Another thing that is completely worth mentioning is the built-in camera; if you press ‘F4’ while playing it will save a screenshot that is double the resolution you’re playing at (this is the reason my screenshots are at 4K resolution).\n\n\nSound:Homesick has a soundtrack that goes very well with the atmosphere and ambience that Lucky Pause is trying to achieve, courtesy of Heather Schmidt. The music has a little bit of a relaxed acoustic style to it, with a hint of classical. Other than the amazing soundtrack the environmental sounds -such as doors opening and closing, keys jingling, or file cabinets opening and closing (and falling over)- are also done very well. The true MVP in sound for this game though, is the soundtrack, hands down.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:I saw this game on the Humble Store[www.humblebundle.com] during its spring sale. I decided to buy it because the game looked particularly appealing, with its great visuals and almost-psychedelic nightmare scenes it was something I felt I couldn’t pass up. It was a good decision, I absolutely loved this game. The two most enjoyable parts of the game were the graphics and the underlying story behind the game. I felt that Lucky Pause conveyed a story about a man-made natural disaster that resulted in the end of many people’s lives extremely well. Not only that, but the experimentation with other themes such as people and their everyday lives, it moved me; the politically charged contents of the newspapers (which are central to the narrative) are also food for thought. There’s nothing more I could ask of this game, it absolutely blew my expectations out of the water and delivered a wonderfully emotional experience, with great puzzles to boot. Lucky Pause should pat themselves on the back for making such a positively melancholy game, and I give a standing ovation to Barrett Meeker and his dog.","May 15","true","3.8"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","0"

I thought Dear Esther was a nice concept but it lacked basic gameplay, which I found to be a bit of a shame.\nSure, there is not a lot here, the puzzles are basic and simple and the focus lies heavily on your own interest in the world as a player and your love of exploring a mysterious world. Nevertheless, I enjoyed every minute of it because it is just creepy enough for me to enjoy it (Not a horror fan..) and the music and story makes this a very unique experience.\n\nWell balanced between the relaxing daytime explorations and the nighttime stress of running away from dark creepy sticky looking blobs.\n\nThe ending was amazing and it surprised me even though I though I had it figured out completely.

It's not a super-long game, but it's also not super-short; it gives you just enough time and detail to piece together a lovely narrative without getting bogged down with too many red herrings.  There are a few diversions, mainly to be found in the "bonus" manuscripts, but they mainly provide a light palate cleanser in between stretches of growing dread.\n\nAnd yes, the game is creepy.  And it's creepy in a way that's engineered purely by scenery and mood.  Most of the game is actually rather peaceful; it's just that you KNOW something is terribly wrong (obviously), and you keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.  It's just a question of how and when that will happen.\n\nThe puzzles, wonder of wonders, were all common sense.  There was not one instance of "tie this string to that eggbeater while the moon is in the seventh house, and lo, the door will be opened."  If at any point I said, "Huh, I wonder if I can do this...?" the answer was yes, yes I could.\n\nThe music is just phenomenal.  I never got tired of it, and it was just eerie enough (those breathless gasps underscoring the strings!) that despite its tranquility, it completely fit.\n\nThe only thing that I would list as a possible con is that, well, there's a Message behind the game.  And I have to say Message (with the capital M), though if it was a little less heavy-handed, it would have been merely a Plot Point.  Did you like Little Inferno in spite of its Message?  Then you'll like Homesick.

Homesick just wants to entice you with pretty scenery, puzzles that are so simple that they WILL go over your head (three hours of "I don't get it! What? OH! Wow I feel so stupid!") and then kick you in the gut within the last five seconds you're playing this game.\n\nIt's beautiful and I love it. It's wicked and I love it.\n\nHomesick forces you to go in blind and refuses to tell you any of the plot because the written language is so alien to you as the main character. This gets remedied later, but you're left looking at photos and faded books while pondering why you're the only one left in this abandoned place. It's beautiful and it is creepy. If you have a love of urban exploring or enjoy following people who do this, you'll immediately love the setting in this game. The way that light is suddenly your enemy and that nightmares can give you a startling sort of solace is something noted early on, because learning to manipulate your nightmares is what will help you solve some of the puzzles you face.\n\nThe light as an enemy/puzzle to solve really is something I have to repeat as something I loved. When I'm on my worst days as someone who is disabled from a condition, I get photosensitive. While the lighting effects do hurt (take note gamers this could give you a migraine), it's enough to replicate that feeling I get when I'm just trying to open my blinds. The sun is suddenly blaring while I'm simply trying to function. A game was able to recreate that feeling, even in just a tiny way. Kudos, really. You've won me over.\n\nI honestly forgot that this was a walking simulator with how the puzzles were set up. Everything made sense. I wasn't listening to innane dialogue rattle on and on and on. I just got to take my time and enjoy a story that was hinted at to be heartbreaking and at some points, scary for the people who once lived in that building. Each clue and each puzzle were tasteful and everything meshed perfectly. I cared about these named people who were long gone by the time I had begun my journey.\n\nThis was a game to just take one's time with and it was three hour's well spent. Sure I probably spent a little too much time reading over things in the library or staring at photos, but I wanted to know more. Homesick gives you just enough story, leaves you wanting more, and ends with beautiful imagery swirling around you.\n\nI have to admit, the decoding system made things difficult and if I could have solved that earlier, it would have made things less stressful on me, but that would have eliminated a lot of tension and the suspense of finding out why the building was there and what it was for. However, I'd be worried that other gamers would lose interest by then and wouldn't think to go back and check to see the stories and get more hints to what happened. If that is my only complaint, that's probably it.\n\nGet this on sale. It's pretty short and you'll finish it in an evening. But if you like games like Dear Esther, The Path, Gone Home, etc, you'll probably like this. If you like staring at pretty scenery and forgetting you're playing a game, this is a perfect choice. If you like puzzles? Decent game with some simple puzzles you'll hate yourself in the morning for not getting.\n\nIt was so pretty it hurt my eyes!","August 12, 2015","true","3.1"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

Down-right beautiful.\n\nI've been a tester for this game since the beginning, and I've had nothing but positive things to say about it since then. This is a wonderful example of storytelling without dialogue. I can tell you that you'll get lost in the scenery much too often! I find myself taking screenshots for personal wallpapers.\n\nAs for the story, you're wondering around trying to figure out what happened to this institution you've been supposedly staying in. What kind of institution it is, however, is the question. You can get ideas of where you are through pictures you find in cabinets or reading documents. It really is a mystery up until the end, because they give you just enough information to give you ideas, but not enough until the end to know for sure.\n\nThe puzzles are quite challenging, but very rewarding. I wouldn't say they're very difficult, but they definitely do make you go "Aha!" multiple times!\n\nOverall, this game makes you feel good all throughout the experience. It's not very long, but the bitter-sweet story is worth a play or two. I'd say playing through two or three times will give you the full experience due to so much reading material (in which you have to learn how to read in the game, so backtracking is a big part).\n\nI totally recommend this game to any Gone Home fans or fans of similar games.

I thought to myself 'well, I backed this game when this Kickstarter thing was still pretty new to me and I had too much money on my hands, so I backed every single project I though that looked pretty. Also, back in the day these "Walking Simulators" were trending so of course, indie developers try to hop on the success.' I even mixed it up with the similar sounding "Gone Home" a few time, a game (yes, I call it a game) I actually enjoyed.\n\nWhat I remember about Homesick were its beautiful visuals. I don't think, I have seen such astonishing realistically crafted surroundings in any game so far. Well, I expected this game to be mediocre, good at best. But what I got was an emotionally touching experience I haven't had so far in game coupled with the promised, excellent visuals.\n\nThe game follows the footsteps of the aforementioned Gone Home or Dear Esther but with a bit more puzzle solving, that can get tricky some times. However, these gameplay elements are very basic and easy to solve. What's really important is, how you slowly unravel the past of the place where you live as well as your own. What I loved about this game is that you do everything yourself. One thing, I didn't particularly like about Gone Home for example were the seemingly randomly played audio diary entries. While these told the player what happened, they also totally broke the immersion of the what I though was the intended feeling.\n\nThere is no such dialogue in Homesick. And that's for the better. If you, like me, enjoy emotional experiences, many downplay as "walking simulators" with a heart touching backstory and mysteries to be unraveled, this game is for you. Also, if you just like very, very pretty looking games, you might still like it.\n\nVERY highly recommended.","May 28, 2015","true","5.0"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","0"

I am a big fan of modern ruins, reclaimed by nature. And this game gives me just that. The game overall feels like a Dream. You end up in a strange world that you have just woken up in. And you have no clue where you are but there are things around that look interesting. You find clues as to what to do and explore a modern ruin of a tall building, all by yourself.\n\nWhy do I say that it feels like a dream? The overall setting already feels very much like a dream.\n- You open your eyes in a world you dont know, yet you go with it and just do what you can/want.\n- You take a look around and do what you can to get further into the building.\n- Somehow the light does not grant you acces to the path it shines upon which is intentional.\n- But when Night falls the light no longer blocks your way.\n- Now off to the next room to find out more about this strange and unknown place.\n\nOne thing before I end the review.\nThis game is not easy and it certainly does not hold your hand.\nThe game gives you hints, clues and pictures as to what you are looking for. But what you are looking for is sometimes different. This means that the clue you just found has something to do with it and that is where your brain comes into play. Think. Think. Think. And think again. Search everywhere and think about ever logical and maybe not logical outcome. It will most certainly help you.\n\nFor those that like the athmosphere of a modern ruin, reclaimed by nature, this game is certainly for you. Plus you get to uncover a mystery and solve, maybe not too simple, puzzles. I can say that after only playing for an hour, I have gotten what I wanted out of the game. I couldnt want more than what I wished for. A game, set in a modern building which became a ruin over time and was reclaimed by nature. That plus the feeling of a dream makes this game perfect and I still wish that we would get a full on game similar to this one, with open world similar to Fallout.

The music score which is included in the game's folder) is excellent and fits perfectly with the general mood of the game.\n\n","June 1, 2015","true","5.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The music is hauntingly beautiful and I could just sit there for hours listening to the soundtrack. It adds such a somber tone to an already depressing environment that it can’t help but invoke feelings of being alone in a harsh world. And the building itself is so realistic that I practically felt like I really was trying to get out of a bad situation. The ending itself also leaves lots of questions unanswered.

It's got a fair few flaws and you'd probably be better off with another walking sim. Original review below.\n\nIt's a very pretty walking sim. It is quite short, in terms of the (admittedly flawed) time/£ comparison, it's the same ratio as an actual film, if that matters to you. It is fairly understated, most things are alluded to obliquely until the final twist. It has a nice use of colour in the level layout, even if it is a bit drab to look at generally.\n\nHonestly, if the creators read this, I understand the reasons to set the walking speed so slow, but you have erred on the wrong side of the line there. Also how on earth is anyone supposed to get the final puzzle except by accident? Archimedes called and he's very disappointed in your grasp of displacement. And I'm all for not feeling like my hand is being held, but it could have done with more feedback for the incremental parts of the puzzles; label the valves and light switches open/close, on/off, little things like that. Everything being so far apart with the walking speed being so slow made trial and erroring the light switch and radiator puzzles a chore. I did love the cipher puzzle though, then going back and reading everything I'd missed.","July 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

And how they reach this somber tone by dilapidation is even more common, running the gamut from post-apocalyptic games adhering to more eschatological worldviews and the games like Homesick, that uses it as a symbol for something a little more personal. The world is as always, but uncannily in distress when in our sudden awakening from the slumber of ignorance we notice its despair. Such is the way Homesick presents itself, as a distressed world we have to manipulate to adapt to psychically and better. Or as stated in the history of the game's development on Lucky Pause's website: “figuring out how to continue to grow when the world is falling apart around you“.\n\nThis is what constitutes the aesthetics and tone of Homesick. Degradation, dilapidation, disaster, world as inhabitable, world as impossible to come to terms with. Puzzles that you solve lead you into news articles in lost languages, but it being a newspaper and newspapers being what they usually are – fear-mongering, attention-grabbing, often elucidating the pain-stricken and the suffering – serves its purpose as pointing to the same type of cynical outlook on the world. This is further made clear by photos found in the game, picturing different natural disasters and industrial monstrosities.\n\nIs the world that bad? The corporate politics and industrialization of the world seem to worry the creator of this game. Progression and positives boils down to fulfilling the potential of germinal flora (watering plants), progression lies in moving on the obverse side of pollution and general destructiveness of our beloved, morally just nature. In reality the world is a lot more complex. Nature is not nature unless for the knowing subject. The knowing subject interjects moral into an indifferent nature and becomes outraged, reacting accordingly. . . but is this the right way to go about things, or better: to think about things? To revel in indifference, not making equivalent the flesh of man and animal, or even worse, of man and plant, is in a way more comfortable, less existentially terrifying, but at the same time impossible as a being of morality and poetry. Even though the game puts forth a rather naive ecological message, I appreciate it due to it being put in a quaint way, with some piquant moments of sheer beauty being emitted from every pore this game has.\n\nMoreover, the models and texture qualities are truly great. From the flaky paint on the walls, to the buckles of water-damaged ceilings, to the wallpaper's bleak and torn appearance, it all looks crisp and detailed enough to feel powerful, to feel like you are in a world truly on the verge of collapse. There is no glaring issue with the looks of the graphics or textures, as far as I am aware of. Although I did manage to get out on a balcony I wasn't supposed to get out on, which subsequently let me see a black textureless wall above. This also forced me to reload the game, since I got stuck out there. But the saves are frequent enough, and progress once made is easily enough retread, so that this was not too frustrating.\n\nI find it is always nice to see simple mechanics but complex puzzles in an absolutely beautiful setting. Where gamecreators find the balance aesthetics and mechanics, finding creative solutions to making puzzles interesting despite a lacking set of mechanics available. While the balance is good, I do find the walking to be tiny bit too slow for my taste, making especially some of the deciphering of the language in the game frustrating (it required a lot of walking to and fro between blocks and texts so to verify the correctness of your decoding). Beyond this, and in general, the puzzles are fairly logical and straight forward. Some boil down to trial and error, perhaps due to my stupidity, perhaps due to the design of the puzzle, but there are possibilities of such solutions being the only way forward. Other than that, there is an interesting contrasting of day and night, nightmare and waking life that through gameplay convey the same message the aesthetics and objects in the game do. Or at least plays into it slightly, according to my “reading” or interpretation. When a game has been made conscientiously enough for this mirroring between mechanic and aesthetic/setting to occur, you have to give kudos to that sort of effort. Which is what I am doing now.\n\nSome things could have been explained better as well, but were not too difficult to find out, and I would recommend reading some guides for the game just to get some hints as to what you are supposed to do. If you press escape you will see controls, but not all controls used in the game, or all the mechanics that are at play, so keep that in mind and don't feel discouraged to look at guides or whatever other source of information that would help you progress mechanically.\n\nIn between these larger themes is a more direct story, that I more or less neglected in this “review”. I don't think it should be spoiled, but it is foreshadowed in a nice manner with obscured effects and perhaps through another interpretation of the game's look. They do both play into each other as well, but still distinct and operate on different planes, both in terms of scope and complexity. I am staying deliberately vague here to avoid spoiling anything, and with that in mind there is no real point in delving deeper into the story or symbolism at this moment.\n\nSo Homesick is a good game, it is interesting, perhaps a bit shattered (not fittingly) in its scope or ambition, where social critique and personal story go not so much hand in hand as side by side, giving occasional glances each other's way just to make sure they are still there. But nonetheless, the game has substance, it is enjoyable and beautiful. It is worth the purchase and it is worth your time, it is worth thinking about; even if the things you'll think about are not necessarily as enjoyable or wonderful as the portrayal of them graphically.","May 28, 2015","true","2.9"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","17","28","3","0"

But the three teamed developers down at Lucky Pause have really nailed it and delivered a highly polished, extremely rich in detail, emotional tugging, and thought inducing adventure.\n\nThe objective of 'home sick' is at first vague other than the fact that you have awoken in a extremely run down building littered with books and torn pages filled with strange symbols. Eventually you realise that you need to unlock the secrets of what happened to everyone by finding solice in growing flowers, keeping the lights on in your nightmares and knocking down that next door that bars you from finding out those answers. You will need to teach yourself how to read again, if you are really to get to the core of the mystery.\n\nThe game is mildly supernatural in that it attempts to explain what a ghost is, why they flicker breifly to the living, why they haunt or are confined to a location and what they need to do in order to move on. This side of the story is all told through graphical detailed art and by also using the art form to incorporate cleverly designed puzzles to convey hidden meaning and subtext.\n\nI say mildly supernatural, because it is only hinted and never spoken or conveyed through written language. On the other hand the accompanying main story of everyone in the apartment story and what eventuated to them all is clearly explained in the hundreds of written documents that showcase as a museum to a tragic event. Both stories somewhat tie in nicely in the end leaving you with a somewhat thought provoking and yet enjoyable experience.\n\nWhile the game is relatively short lasting only a few hours there is enough here to warrant a second play through and a solitary reflection of a time that was. It helps you understand how precious life is and how industrial dreams can quickly turn into nightmares as was demonstrated on Apr 26 1986 in the Ukraine.\n\nIn final I would like to end this review with a simple 'Thankyou' to the developers. Who would have thought great inspirational games could have come from California? Where have you been all this time? The gaming art industry has been in a deep need of a great team like you for a long time!!!\n\nLook forward intently to your next work of great inspirational art. This game could do with achievements for those that like to get 100% and personally I would like to buy the truly magnificent musical score which accompanies this masterpiece. They are my only two critiques....\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AowCnc1Igto","December 17, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It has excellent puzzles, but also lays out a backstory that leaves you guessing until the very end. Reflecting back on the experience, I realize now how much work the developers put into placing certain items of interest in specific areas, making sure you don't discover them too soon, or too late. It's such a bitersweet experience. The best way I can explain the experience without giving too much away is...a surreal thought provoking adventure that throws in a few surprises along the way.\n\nI would highly recommend to set aside a few hours to immerse yourself. Take your time, explore every nook and cranny, and backtrack occasionally.

Once you dig beneath the surface though what remains is your typical walking simulator game, with all the requisite puzzles and hidden pieces of text to flesh out the world.

While exploring you will uncover puzzles that are more logical than illogical, areas that have nearly photorealistic lighting and textures, and a story that will touch you. More than the player's story its the smaller stories covered in the game that are touching, and in some cases heartbreaking.\n\nTo uncover the full story I would highly suggest solving all the puzzles, and while there isn't much help online this is a good thing. Once I got the back story of the aparment residents it all fell into a place, and it ended up being a touching exploration of lives past.\n\nHomesick is a game that needs to be experienced by gamers who are jaded, like most games that are coming out that get labeled "walking simulators" because there are things in these games that need to be seen and felt. While we have games that are AAA coming and going there are indie games like this...

In spite of the pictures/videos it is NOT a horror game.  There are things (puzzles if you will) that you need to figure out how to do in order to progress.  They are challenging but not insurmountable.  You only get very subtle hints as to what you need to do.  There is no dialog but a hauntingly beautiful musical score.  It's hard to give you an idea of the game without giving away some of its secrets so I won't even try.    It's a fantastic feeling when you finally "break the code."\nCons:\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars--this game is really short.  I finished it in 6.6 hours and most of that time was spent walking around trying out different ways to solve a puzzle.  And also "reading" a lot of things that weren't necessary to finish the game.

I really enjoyed playing it. It's a very soothing atmosphere with puzzles that don't rush you but DO engage you. It's worth it before finishing the game to put together the final "puzzle" of deciphering the alphabet and then going back through the rooms to read up on what really happened.\nThe only thing that "frustrated" me was how INCREDIBLY slow the character moves during the daytime. Made some backtracking to do something I missed a bit of a hassle.\n\nA little pricey for a game that can be completed in just an hour or two, but when considering how absolutely beautiful it is, a lot of hard work was obviously put into the game.

The narrative and the gameplay work well together, and the overall design is fantastic. The level design actually feels like a real environment to explore while maintaining a sense of progression, and though the pacing may be thrown off slightly by ineffective horror elements, the attention to detail in the map adds to the story immensely, leaving the player to piece things together. I found myself reading through every piece of text, engrossed in the universe, and though it is pulled together in a manner that fails to deliver the impact it was hoping for, the story as a whole works, and with a good message to boot. Luckily, I went into the game not expecting any horror, so I wasn't too disappointed when it wasn't scary at all. In fact, I enjoyed it as an adventure game with beautiful level design, emotional music, and effective writing. While the pacing is slow and the difficulty is inconsistent, the game itself feels the right length, and is worth playing.","September 4, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You wander from room to room, searching for clues to the mystery of where everyone went, what happened, and who you are. Both the graphics and musical score are stunning and work together to convey the sadness of old, forgotten and abandoned places.\n\nThe puzzles required to advance further in the building are well balanced, neither too simple nor too obnoxiously difficult. The pace of the game isn't rushed with combat or platformer-esque puzzles, instead you're free to meander and take in all the ambience (and Homesick has it by the bucket-load).\n\nThe biggest drawback in the game would be the length: my playthrough took just over two hours to complete. Also, while the contrasting daytime/nightmare mechanism was well executed, I felt it could have been used to greater effect.\n\nIn closing, Homesick was an incredibly enjoyable 2 hour distraction from reality. Lucky Pause did an impeccable job and I look forward to their next title(s).","August 9, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes.\nI feel like the length of this game does not effect the experience, as the opposite is true with so many games. By the end, you'll probably be wanting more but you still have the sense of finishing a complete story. Homesick's goal isn't to hit the finish line as fast as you can... You can equate this game to a short story. How far you want to dive into the story is up to you.\n\nOne of the major puzzles in the game requires some cypher decoding, this forces you to read at least some of the information about the characters. The reward at the end isn't a speed record or some count on how many 'totems' you've collected. The true reward is the impact the ending has on you. The more you uncover while playing the game, the greater the impact will be.\n\nA complaint you might see other users having is how easy Homesick's puzzles are. I can definitely agree. This is no Rubix cube. What this is, is a story unfolding; a character discovering the same things you are in real time. It might be a 25 piece jigsaw puzzle, but what you have when you are finished putting it together will give you chills...\n\nWhat i find most amazing about this game is how easy it was to learn more and more about it's enviroment. There is no dialog but it effortlessly takes you through the whole experience without any hand holding. No tutorial, no cut scene, no easy mode, it drops you into an amazing atmosphere and you figure it out. And it does it sooo well!\n\nI loved it!

Spoiler-free thoughts follow:\n\n+ The music was just gorgeous.  I could've just sat and listened without even playing the game and I'd have considered it worth the price.  Very very well done.\n\n+ The atmosphere is haunting.  This isn't a horror game and there's nothing overtly "scary" involved, but there is some definite creepiness to the locale that is a marked contrast to the soothing music.  It's a fascinating juxtaposition.\n\n+ The puzzles are relatively straightforward if you're paying attention (which you should be!).  There are some spoiler-free guides available for people having trouble; I would greatly encourage trying everything you can think of first before going to a guide, and if you do need one, definitely use a spoiler-free one so you can experience everything firsthand.\n\n+ There's a point where you can go back and get some information you couldn't in the beginning.  I strongly recommending going back and reading anything you couldn't at first, because the backstory you gain is great.\n\n+ The game isn't overly long but the beautiful graphics and soundtrack combined with interesting gameplay, plus an overarching message that is important and yet not heavy-handed, make it worth the price in my opinion.  I picked it up on sale but would gladly have paid full price.\n\n+ The ending was short but fit perfectly.  I've seen some people say it was rushed and made no sense; I would like to respectfully disagree.  No spoilers here, but I did feel it made perfect sense in the context of all the information you're given throughout the game.  Make your own decision after you play; don't rely on us reviewers! :)\n\nOverall, very pleased to recommend this to anyone who likes exploration-based games with light puzzling.","August 8, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After completing each one I felt a sense of accomplishment and the positive reinforcement that kept me motivated to play  straight through. It was the same feeling I get when I pick up a great book and don't want to put it down, along with a hint of adrenaline.\nSince the whole game is played through "your" eyes, you have to figure out who you are and why you are in this place.\nI highly recommend  Homesick for its interesting play, amazing graphics and for the true sense of accomplishment you feel when you complete  it.","May 28, 2015","true","4.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Unfortunately, there are multiple reasons why I must give this game a negative review.\nWhile I was loving the graphics (and can easily see the VR potential), it needs some polishing. Some aspects seemed like they didn't fit in an otherwise stunning game, and some rooms felt overwhelmingly cluttered. Less is more.\nThe controls worked alright, but were not entirely fluid. I found myself getting slightly dizzy or sick while moving, even though I haven't experienced it in other games (Firewatch, anyone?). Not to beat a dead horse here, but as many other players have said, your character moves painfully slow. The only explanation I can find for this is to add to the already short play time (currently two hours for a $15 game).\nThe biggest grievance, however, is the irony that this game grapples with. While it is entirely a walking simulator with puzzle aspects (which are discouragingly difficult at times and counter-intuitive), it tries its hardest to hide the story from you. In fact, you can very easily go through the motions of this game without any explanation as to why things are the way they are! The reason being that you must decode symbols in the game before going all the way back to the beginning to read all sorts of burnt pages and books streen throughout the game. Then, you must try to piece together some sort of explanation for your adventure. Upon completion, it became painfully clear that the lack of story is because there isn't enough gravitasse in the one they've conceived, but rather they found a potentially sad idea and wanted to present it in an obscure way.\nIt's important for your games to make you think.\nHowever, they probably shouldn't make you feel like you're working to haphazardly slap together why you just spent two hours walking around an abandoned building.\n\nTL;DR\nUnfortunately, the way the story is orchestrated suggests that the creators had a moderately dark story that they couldn't piece together themselves or couldn't afford to voice-cast.\nThis game gets a 3/10.","May 22","false","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The alphabet puzzle in particular was my favorite, and it's also the most important to the storyline. Homesick is a very clever game, and I did enjoy it. But I felt like it was a bit short, and the story lacked clear details. Sure, the ending and the overall cause is obvious, but I would've liked a bit more development in there.\n\nEven still, Homesick is worth playing for the beautiful setting, and the creepy shift between day and night is worth experiencing at least one. It's rare that secluded puzzle games have happy endings, but Homesick delivers.

It's practically a crawl.  The entire game I was ready to throw my computer across the room because I didn't have a run button.\n\nSecondly, the puzzles are not rewarding, or at least I did not find them rewarding.  They're mostly frustrating, again MOSTLY because of how slowly you're forced to walk.\n\nProbably the most annoying thing is the inventory system.  You're unable to simply select the item you'd like to use.  You're instead made to scroll through every item to get to the one you want.  I felt like I spent half the game walking, and half the game selecting items from my inventory.\n\nThe especially annoying part is that sometimes I would make a full rotation, while scrolling through my inventory, and STILL THE ITEM I WANTED WOULDN'T SHOW UP.  Meaning I had to make two full rotations through it before what I wanted would show up.\n\nWhy do I have to keep picking my keys back up after I use them, but the proddy stick is in my inventory for the duration of the game, even though I only used it once?\n\nAll in all, 10/10, what a beautiful game.\n\nJust kidding, this is the first game I've wanted my money back.  0/10 would not recommend.\n\nThe puzzles are illogical, unsatisfying, and the game is glitchy.

I purchased it instantly, hoping to relive the intense joy of playing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, which in much ways seemed similar to this game.\nFor those who played "Ethan Carter" as well, you will remember how the puzzles and gameplay were contributing to your comprehesion of the story. Slowly uncovering the truth was an incredibly rewarding experience.\nThis is where Homesick vastly differs.\nIts puzzles remind you of that point-and-click adventure you once bought but barely played. Once again you'll find yourself revisiting every area, clicking on every object in the hope something will happen. You'll wonder why the game isn't progressing and finally discover it was waiting for you to -whatever- water a plant or something. While the dreams (interactive cutscenes) give away the story pretty quickly, discovering the solution to a puzzle won't help your comprehension at all.\nHomesick features a linear progressing story, invisible walls, simple yet tedious puzzles and slow gameplay,\nAs such, I'm afraid I did not enjoy it.","August 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But can't the game within the pretentious poppycock be enjoyable at least?\n\nMost of the puzzle elements in this game are just tedious. A puzzle game should give you a sense of satisfaction once the puzzle is solved. Solving a puzzle in this game leads to you saying things like ''oh come on! really!? that's what I was meant to do!?''.\nFar from feeling satisfied, the player feels annoyed that they just wasted all that time, turning water valves or translating a fake language into English letter by letter.\n\nCouple that with boring visuals and monotonous background piano music, the overall experience is enough to either put you to sleep, or drive you mad.\n\nIf this game was free, or maybe even just a couple of euros, it might be worth a look.

There's probably only about 16 minutes of actual content in this game. It manages to stretch that 16 minutes of content to around 2 to 5 hours via puzzles, but the puzzels themselves are so incredibly obtuse that there's no way you'll make it through the game without having to look at a walkthrough.\n\nOh, and I encountered a progression blocking bug in the game, which ♥♥♥♥ing sucks because there are no manual saves. I lost an hour and a half of progress I made painstakingly deciphering the in-game alphabet. I just stopped playing at that point and watched the rest of the playthrough on YouTube.\n\nI hate giving this game a negative review because it's made by a small developer, but this totally isn't worth $11. If you're in it for the atmosphere/story, I would recommend "The Old City: Leviathian"... it has much more than 16 minutes worth of content.\n\nIf you're in it for obtuse puzzles, there are probably better games for that as well. Try "Anna".\n\n\n\nEDIT: Okay, so it turns out that you can manually save. You can do so by "sleeping". But once again, this isn't obvious. It isn't made clear to you that you can do this. Once you reach a new area, you can no longer sleep in the old sleeping locations, and the new sleeping location is not made clear to you. Sometimes it's a couch, sometimes its a matress on the floor, and sometimes its an actual bed.

Also it is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.\n\nThe Bad (SPOILER ALERT): But then the thought-provoking journey comes to a jarring halt. Towards the end, you get the ability to translate all of the gibberish text that you have seen before into standard English. I happily ancitipated finding some personal, intimate, tragic story laced throughout these pages, as that was what the whole tone of the game seemed to be. Instead what I found was a hodge podge of random, disjointed, distracted bits of text written by backers that killed any sense of cohesion, were filled with typos, and deflated the mood that the game had been working so hard to set up. Some of it was actually wittr and funny, but in an atmosphere like this it just made an extremely awkward juxtapose.\nTo make matters worse, there actually was a plot written by the developers into the text as well. It's a piece of environmental-awareness propaganda that's about as subtle as a drunken Marilyn Manson skateboarding naked with conga drums through a library. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for taking care of our Earth, but stooping to hyperbole that would befit a Saturday morning cartoon just comes across as immature, not bold. Also, it is a far cry from the very personal, intimate, soulful atmosphere the entire environment previously alluded to.  Also also, the developer's writing is just plain stitled and awkward.\n\nSo...there's a LOT to like on the surface and at first the game seems consistent with how it was advertised. It ultimately falls apart, though, and lives far beneath its potential. It's a real pity, and at $15 it's just not worth your money.

Story wise, things start to unfold once you are able to decipher the texts.  It was a little underwhelming since I was able to guess the ending about halfway through.  The greatest strength of the game is the melancholy atmosphere which is aptly conveyed via the excellent, yet subdued soundtrack, and the reflective, somber, and sometimes entertaining letters and book excerpts.\n\nIf you're desperate to kill a few hours, enjoy these "walking simulator" type atmospheric games, and have $15 to blow, go ahead.

That being said, it is a worthwhile experience to play through, if a little disconnected in ways. The visual presentation is gorgeous and effective, although a little rough around the edges. Ambience is solid, and nothing feels too over or under. You can either take or leave the musical score; I personally enjoyed it, though I wouldn't write home about it.\n\nThe interface is acceptable, generally speaking, but could use improvements. Inventory management is clunky; I'd rather be able to hit keys like 1-8 to get what I need, instead of having to slowly cycle through with the mouse wheel. Interactions aren't always smooth or obvious; I got stuck on the last level for a time, because I wasn't close enough to a certain object to see I could interact with it at first. Your movement speed is slow, which is grating when you have to trek back and forth between areas, and especially frustrating when you want to backtrack entirely once you figure out how to crack the game's alphabet (although, when you find out your character's current condition at the end of the game, it's easy to understand why your pace is the way it is).\n\nReally though, the roughness adds to the game in its own way, and it is an ultimately enjoyable experience.

I must say I'm a bit disappointed. You wake up in an abandoned house that looks and feels a bit Silent Hillish. Everything seems broken, like the house has been abandoned a long time ago, and yet you wake up there and got no idea what you are doing there. The light that shines in through the windows hurts you and blinds you so you gotta stay away from it. You find books and notes everywhere but you can't read them as they are written in glyphs. So far, an interesting start. Then you walk through the house in slow motion (yes, you walk pretty slow) and gather informations about what happened. Finding out how to read the books and notes took me the longest, and sadly this was the only slightly challenging part of the game. All the other "riddles" and tasks were quite obvious and way too easy for an adventure game. The story behind Homesick is not bad even, but the only way to really get it is by reading all the journals and notes that you find on your way. That's something that I enjoy doing, but a bit more in-game-storytelling wouldn't have hurt. The graphics are a pro of Homesick. They are solid for an adventure game, but not outstanding, and the engine needs to be optimized as in addition to the general slow motion, it also lagged way too much on my PC and nope, it definitely ain't my hardware. I would have ignored that if at least the story and puzzles entertained me well enough to make this a game to remember, but sadly, with the sudden and unsatisfying ending, it's rather a game that I'll soon have forgotten about.

But does the game live up to the online comic's standards?\n\nAs promised by the Kickstarter, the video game takes place in the same universe as the comic, but is otherwise its own separate story, so knowledge of the comic is not necessary to enjoy the game for what it is.  However, fans of the comic will still appreciate the occasional references to the comic's events, and they may have a better understading of the context of the plot.  For example, the protagonist is a player whose session has prematurely ended.  The game begins with the player waking up after successfully achieving god tier in spite of their limitations, and now they must learn to use their powers to navigate the deteriorating session, which has constricted them to a small building.\n\nVisually, the game is very much a departure for the series--or at least one would initially assume.  Given the setting, which resembles a colorless apartmentment complex, I believe Hussie is purposely recreating the stark, simple visuals of Problem Sleuth.  Even the puzzles are reminiscent of the puzzles the Problem Sleuth characters face; one moment, you're picking up keys to unlock a door.  The next moment, your keys have suddenly turned into an axe that you're using to chop down the doors instead.\n\nAs you learn to properly navigate the world's dream bubbles and solve puzzles that impact the real world, you will come across writings left behind by other characters.  True to the Homestuck name, there are several characters involved with the story, and none of them really take the role of "main character"--everyone is equally important.  One minor complaint, though: Those who have read the comic are already familiar with the fact that each character has a unique "voice", following different methods of punctuation, capitalization, and sometimes substituting letters for numbers according to their personality.  Apparently Hussie was REALLY desperate to continue this trend despite having already fully explored the concept, because in this game, every new character writes entirely in abstract symbols.  I appreciate a running joke as much as anyone, but sometimes you can take things too far.\n\nOverall, though, there are quite a few noticeable differences between the game and the comic.  The visuals are much more realistic and detailed, the music is slower-paced... Actually, the whole game in general is very slow-paced compared to the comic.  It makes me wonder what Hussie was thinking as he directed the game.  Maybe he's decided he wants to explore new methods of expression as he matures as an artist.  Or maybe he's just trolling all of us.  That's usually what I assume the explanation is whenever he does something confusing.\n\nIn short: This is one of the more pleasant walking simulators that focuses on exploration and learning new things about your environment at a slow pace.  I suggest it to those who are interested in taking it easy.  Sometimes it is very important to relax and not take things seriously.\n\nP.S. Steam please revive Namco High.","August 7, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet 3 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Paced with a light touch, but very effectively. Pretty short, as to be expected of an indie game in this neo-adventure/exploration genre, but I'd be happier about a $10 price tag rather than $15. Also, could do with a run button, or at least "walk faster" button. I get that it wants to encourage a languid pace, but later on there can be a fair amount of retracing steps up and down hallways. And, on a side note, while providing instructions for the piano melody is a cute idea, it probably induced panic amongst the musically impaired/people who hated the Selenitic Gate puzzle in Myst. It actually turns out to be more of an easter egg than a puzzle, but there's no reason the player would know that until after it goes nowhere, so the sheet music was probably an unwise diversion in an otherwise very focused game design. Anyway, other than that stuff, highly recommended.","November 12, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics were very impressive (even on my ancient GTX 260),\nthe score was amazing, and the atmosphere engrossing.\nThis is a more high-brow level of horror game. Not to give anything away, but it invokes the writing of H.P. Lovecraft.\n\nThere aren't many modern games that can hold your interest when there's no dialogue.\nAlthough I finished it in one night, I was so hooked on the game, I didn't want to sleep until I experienced the entire game. Truth be told, I ended using a walkthrough on the final sections. I'd estimate it would have taken at least two more hours minimum to complete the game on my own. I do plan to play through the game again in the near future.\n\nHeather Schmidt and Shauna Rolston's score alone is worth the price. I was so relieved to recall that the OST comes with the game.

Books, pages and photographic slides litter the defunct and decaying apartment building - hinting of history, of the people who once dwelled within these corridors of plaster and peeling wallpaper.   Somber music punctuates the melancholy as you explore the modern ruin seeking answers: what happened, where did everyone go, why am I still here, and why is the sunlight so painfully bright?   Some of the writings and pictures I found rummaging through the kippleized environment spoke of answers to come.\n\nAsleep, the world is transformed into a shadowy nightmare version of itself.  The unconscious world is a place of frantic, terrorized sprinting as the darkness aggressively moves in to gobble you up in its hellish maw.\n\nThe puzzles are well-thought-out, logical, and fluid; meshing perfectly with the environment.   It’s feels less like coming to a “puzzle section” like in some games, and more like creatively seeking out ways to move around the environment.\n\nThis is what I liked about Homesick, the atmosphere, the mystery, the logical puzzles, the tip-of-the-iceberg world building that promised something more; a reward for pushing further into the game’s brooding depths.  The game didn’t deliver.   I’ve clocked about three hours in the game and I can tell you without exaggeration that 80% of that time was spent staring at books trying to decipher their script.   (I managed to work out most of the alphabet, the key I scribbled down in a notebook lacking only the ciphers for Q and X).   After about 30 minutes of actual gameplay and head-scratching, Homesick abruptly ends with no answers, no story, and what amounts to a cheap jump-scare and a vague sense of “paternal-ness”, for lack of a better word.   Homesick feels like a project that someone did a lot of work on, felt strongly about, and obsessed over for a while, but got tired of producing 10% of the way through, polished it up, and slapped a half-hearted ending on it.   I bought the game on sale, so I’m not upset that I spent money on it.  But the game is in no way worth the $15 USD price tag.\n\nMy recommendation is mixed.  But since I have to pick yes or no, at this price the answer is no, I would not recommend this title.\n","June 3","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
