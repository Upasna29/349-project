Everyone seems like they have their own unique accent.  The cutscenes are slow and boring.

Nothing mind blowing but they paint a nice picture of the world, also like the cell shaded character designs.\n\nBut I'm constantly sucekd out of the world and the story by the TERRIBLE translations.  I think google translate could do better than this.  This game clearly wasn't made for english speaekrs which is a shame because its not a bad action rpg","September 17, 2015","false","0.3"," 20 of 58 people (34%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","34","20","58","6","5"
