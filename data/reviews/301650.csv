Protip #2 - RAVE GUN\n\nThis just kicked my nostalgia into overdrive. The teams at Big Boat and Rebellion have done a grand job bringing the shine back to this gem from the late 90s. The new lighting and particle effects, as well as high-poly models and hi-res retextures bring the magic back to the current generation.\n\nAfter the first samples of a mysterious material known as 'bio-metal' fell to Earth in 1952, the two major superpowers facing off in the cold war - the USA and the USSR - utilised it to construct amazing new prototype vehicles and weaponry. Ever seeking greater sources of power, this whole new world of technology spawned from the stars spurred on humanity's thirst for the untapped resources of deep space...\n\nOne of the early [and sorely missed] action-strategy hybrid titles, Battlezone's first campaign casts you into a conspiratorial wing of the United States military - the National Space Defence Force (NSDF) - which is expanding out into the solar system during the cold war. The USA has used the smokescreen of the highly publicised Space Race to deploy a division of their military forces on the moon. What is this strange, otherworldly bio-metal scrap? Can such a malleable and strong substance really form naturally? All that truly matters at the outset is keeping it out of Russki hands at all costs...\n\nIn the second campaign, you play from the perspective of a Russian cosmonaut on the other side of the conflict. The differing design philosophies of the two factions is striking. The Soviet Cosmos Colonist Army (CCA) favours brutal head-on attacks and overwhelming numbers. Beginning with much the same immediate goals in mind as the USA (though initially more intrepid and bold in their conquest), the USSR expand rapidly to the Red Planet. Of course, not all is as it seems, and the cosmonauts quickly find themselves wishing they were safely home in the Motherland's bosom, for the cold of space is not inviting, and grander things lurk just out of sight...\n\n--\n\nA great piece of alternate history fiction with excellent gameplay values. You can jump in and out of any given hover-vehicle to wander around on the surface of many planets and moons around Sol. With your trusty sniper rifle, you can whack hostile pilots from a distance and jack their ride, if you so choose. The combat is frenetic and satisfying, driven by the desire for ultimate control over these new resources. Perhaps the most gratifying element of this game is the fluidity of its movement. The jet-thruster-powered movement of most of the vehicles allows for some spectacular handling of rough terrain, cruising along at high speed and ramping off outcroppings of rock, lending the game abundant z-play opportunities. Moving effectively and working as a team is absolutely as crucial as landing hits on target.\n\nIn many missions (as well as the instant-action and multiplayer[!!!]), designing, constructing and managing your base falls to you. The bio-metal is extremely versatile and can be used in conjunction with a Recycler vehicle to construct all manner of buildings, vehicles and bizzare, devastating weaponry, ranging from tanks and mobile turrets to howitzers, rocket platforms and walkers. You will need to protect your scavengers, deploy your battle lines and make offensive strikes on enemy positions, all the while keeping track of the number of pilots you have at your disposal, and that ever-crucial supply of bio-metal scrap. You can manage every unit in your force, every building and utility vehicle under your command, from anywhere on the very sizeable maps using the fairly intuitive command interface.\n\nStrategy and tactics evolve organically lending the gameplay as much or as little head-on action as you please, requiring you to source scrap fields and expand your production line and deny those same resources to your enemy. Your co-pilots are as effective in combat as you are, and you'll need all the help you can get throughout the challenging campaign.\n\nPick this up, it's probably quite unlike anything else you'll play this year, and you won't regret it.","April 18","true","11.1"," 179 of 197 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","179","197","5","7"

Coupled with one of the best stories ever to be written for a video game, this is a game you absolutely can NOT miss out on.\n\nAs for this specific re-release, it's as well done as anyone could ask for a game that's nearly 20 years old. Rebellion has seamlessly integrated the game into Steam's workshop and brought the graphics engine up to speed (or close enough for my liking, anyway) for modern systems, and brought everything into high resolution since we no longer run 640x480 on our systems any more.\n\nI cannot thank Rebellion enough for this!\n\nHowever, I must venture a warning. If you see this game and automatically think "Activision? CALL OF DUTY!" you're in the wrong market. When this game first came out, Activision made GOOD games. Do NOT buy this game if you're looking for a call of duty-esque game.\n\nSee everyone on the Moon, or Mars, or wherever you dare face me.","April 18","true","21.2"," 81 of 86 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","81","86","7","8"

The concept is flawless- a masterful FPS and an intuitive RTS cleanly blended together in a hovertank space shooter. Remastering this timeless classic is one of the greatest revitalizations I've come across.\n\nThe game offers a unique environment where standardized FPS elements are challenged and redefined. I am a huge fan of ammo shared between all of your weapons. Combined with the mobile, dynamic RTS that forces you to make decisions based on the type of terrain you're in and what the enemy is building, just like any RTS. However, the only thing I find lacking in the entire game is the RTS itself as I personally find it quite simplified, but in exchange for the complexity of strategy there is a first-person combat experience to steal the focus from.\n\nAs a modder for the original game from 1998, I am enthusiastic about the capabilities the Redux has, especially Steam Workshop support. The unified and proven system Workshop offers will give my creations more exposure than ever before, something I look forward to and intend to make the best of.\n\nThe game has survived eighteen years of existence. Some said Battlezone was "the best game you've never played". With the Redux, that will change. Battlezone is better than ever before, and it is destined to bring both old and new players back to the front lines.\n\n- blue banana","April 18","true","147.8"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","42","47","0","0"

It's the hidden gem of hidden gems.\n\nSet in an alternate 1960s where the space race is just a cover for a cold war turned hot, the United States and Soviet Union secretly deploy massive armies into space in pursuit of an extra-terrestrial substance, bio-metal, that can be used to craft amazing and powerful weapons of war. The National Space Defense Force (NSDF) and Cosmos Colonist Army (CCA) do battle over control of the bio-metal throughout the solar system using hover tanks crafted from the precious material. Battlezone has some of the best sci-fi lore of any game- don't skip over the briefings and debriefings!\n\nBattlezone has always had interesting gameplay because of the way it blends RTS and FPS elements. You primarily play the game from the view of the cockpit of your hover tank: you can hunt down enemy craft yourself and blow them away, OR, you can deploy your recycler (main production unit) at a nearby geyser power source and being collecting bio-metal using scavengers in order to build a base, defensive structures, and wingmen to take into battle with you. If you build a Comm Tower, you can take a satellite view of the battlefieldzone and command your wingmen in traditional RTS style, but you don't need to have a Comm Tower to effectively command all of your units (in fact, most often it is better to NOT take this approach).\n\nBattlezone 98 Redux (BZR) has received many improvements over the original game. These include highly improved terrain textures, models, lighting, menus, and more, and these alone make the game worth a purchase and play through. However, because BZR is built on the code of the 1998 release, some of the baggage from years ago has made its way into this game. The net code, though improved, still struggles from time to time, and having a good connection can be important to having an enjoyable online experience. (Overall this is has never been a problem for me, though.) The sound system also struggles mightily when there are many units in play or in a battle- it will eventually just choke and cut out completely until there are fewer units. The sound cutting out is a scenario that you're for the most part unlikely to encounter during regular gameplay, however.\n\nKeeping these small qualms in mind, the game is absolutely a steal at its current price, and will buy you hours and hours of fun in space. I SAID FUN IN SPACE!\n\nIf any 90's game deserved a Redux, this was it. Especially if you never played the original (but even if you have!), this is a must buy.\n\n10 Grizzlies out of 10.","April 28","true","96.4"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

I haven't touched the multiplayer side yet, but will definitely check it out as well as the available tools for content creation.\n\nSo far probably my biggest annoyance has been friendly unit AI, mainly scavengers which seem to have horrid pathing and constantly get stuck, for example in the second Mars mission. But I can't honestly remember if they were this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the original too.\n\nAll in all if you liked the original, this makes it run and look that much nicer on modern computers and is definitely worth it, and for those who haven't tried the original it's still worth checking out in my opinion.

Space tank space race.\n\nThe gameplay is an incredibly well thought out combination of a squad based fps shooter with command and conquer-esque rts elements which has only been done just a few times, none of which has come close to Battlezone in execution.\n\nBecause let's face it, there is no reason to attempt it again. It was done perfectly the first time and all future attempts will fall short of greatness.\n\nThe base building is satisfying as you go from a small recycler to a full-on citadel of gun turrets and mines as you balance a need to finish off the mission as well as keeping your scrap intake moderated so you do not inadvertantly starve yourself of resources. That's where the first-person squad based gameplay comes in. There are a wide variety of different tanks to choose from with a varying degree of playstyles between them, starting from a nimble and weak Scout/Fighter to a slow, powerful Walker/Golem. Bread and butter Tanks to niche fillers such as Rocket Tanks and Bombers to tackle specific situations that may arise as you fight over a planet. No one tank feels completely useless and all feel as if they can be useful in a one-on-one fight if used/maneuvered correctly. If you choose that the fps gameplay isn't exactly your sort of thing, there exists more traditional RTS elements through satellites that give an overhead view of a map where you can micromanage your tanks effectively rather than blow things up yourself.\n\nIt is legitimately my favorite game, and now it has an HD remake and runs perfectly on a modern PC.\n\nThis game and all it offers deserves a playthrough, because it never got a fair shake when it initially came out. Think about it for a moment, Atari released boatloads of reboots of their old franchises and most of them were terrible because it did not do anything remotely interesting. Along comes another old arcade reboot which served as the antithesis of everything Atari was churning out. It not only features the badass story that hooks you on its sheer craziness, the gameplay has also aged incredibly well.\n\nInfinite recommends, you should play this and experience one of the most unique games to come out of the 90s. As jaded as I've become over video games along comes this one title I fawned over as a child which shows me that yeah, video games are still pretty great, and Battlezone is just as unique and entertaining as the day it came out.\n\nBattlezone revealed to me that I love video games, and it deserves to be your favorite game, too.","April 20","true","15.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","2"

After about 2-3 hours, I'm not so sure. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad, as far as a remaster goes, this is how it should be done... mod support, working multiplayer, ability to download new maps for instant action, graphical enhancements etc... this is a damn good remaster. I think my problem is truly just expectations. As someone who has heard about how amazing this game is and how it's pretty much the best action-strategy game to be released, all I can do is compare it to Uprising: Join or Die and how different philosophies they both are.\n\nBattlezone is slower, controls are floaty (because low gravity and hover tanks), units can be controlled directly and vehicles are all interchangeable with the player. You've also got 2 resources, scrap (metals) and pilots (nonrenewable). Scrap is gathered by scavengers from deposits all over the map and blowing up enemy units (or your own) creates scrap that can be scavenged and reused. Pilots are a nonrenewable resource, you need one for every unit you build. If the unit blows up, the pilot is ejected but he can also be killed thus losing him for good. If he makes it back to base, then your limit is not affected. It should also be noted that units have multiple weapon types and it doesn't seem like anyone is overly good against anyone else. Seems like numbers win the day in battles (from what I've played so far). This game also punishes you for your stupid teammates and makes you feel like you're just another soldier except you call in units.\n\nUprising: Join or Die on the other hand is more arcadey. It's fast-paced and operates more on a paper rock scissors format. Infantry beats building, Tank beats Infantry, Aircraft beats Bomber and Tanks, Bomber beats building, Building good against everything etc etc. It's more simplistic. Units cannot be directly controlled, they are called in and proceed to battle against any enemy within the area but after the battle can be recalled to gain back resources. Your tank is also your ultimate weapon, it can be upgraded with better weaponry and by the end of the game you'll be blasting away foes with about 12 different weapon types.  Your tank can also divert power to 3 areas, shields, weaponry or speed... making you take more damage, deal more damage or zip around the battlefield at ridiculous speeds. Buildings are called in on pads rather than you essentially placing them whether you want (except for turrets). It should also be mentioned that Uprising is brutally hard, but not because your allies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... rather you made a mistake and they capitalized on it. I could go on but I believe my point is clear.\n\nHere we have two different action-strategy games that took the genre and walked opposite ways with it yet still remained true to a couple of different concepts (like having a command tank).\n\nIn summation, Battlezone 98 Redux is good for those who are looking for more of a slower paced, punishing game... Battlezone is your game. If you're looking for a twitch shooter that plays more like The Outfit, then Uprising: Join or Die is your game. I still believe this should be played by anyone who is a fan of action-strategy games!","April 18","true","2.2"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","21","28","2","9"

Play as the National Space Defense Force (Americans) or the Cosmo Communist Army (Russians) and wage war across many different worlds, including Luna (Earth's Moon), Mars, Venus, and many more!\n\nTake command of your forces from a first-person perspective. You will need to be able to issue orders and fight in your own tank at the same time. This gameplay style is the adrenaline rush that is Battlezone. Destroy your enemy's forces, then gather their biometal remains to produce more of your own. Gathering scrap is important.\n\nThe gameplay has been left completely untouched, so those who have played Battlezone 1.5 will fit right in. However, with respect to the last official patch, which was 1.4, expect a completely new experience. For one, the Tank AI no longer retreats when shot, it actually fights properly. The infamous bugs from back in the day are no more! The MDM is now safe to use in multiplayer, The East-West bug is fixed, and having a framerate over 60 FPS no longer makes the game run faster. Battlezone is finally up to modern standards as of v1.5 and Battlezone 98 Redux! At the time of this review, there may still be a few kinks to iron out, but I'm sure the dev team is more than willing to issue patches as issues are found.

You have a bunch of default settings for some Joystick types, XBox Controller and Steam Controller but none of them are re-bindable and a prime example is the self-destruct button is bound to X.  There seems to be little support for modern HOTAS joysticks like the X55 (and I enjoyed playing this game back in 1998 with my Throttle joystick, I would love to be able to do it again). I would note though that keyboard bindings are fully configurable.\n\nI also forgot how annoying the *beep* *beep* noise is when an enemy approaches, and firing this up near midnight the misses wasn't too happy with the annoying noises.  Would be nice to have more options to turn that stuff off.\n\nHOWEVER other than this, really it's the same great game that is was 18 years ago but looking a bit sharper.

The remaster feels just like the original version in gameplay, but also improves on many areas including smarter AI units, updated graphics, and even adds cooperative multiplayer against an AI.\n\nIt should be noted that I have experienced some FPS drops and there is a problem with the game closing if trying to Alt+Tab while in a multiplayer match.

Obviously other Nations are going to fight over this substance, so the National Space Dfence Force and  Cosmos Colonist Army battle over control of this substance.\n\nGameplayThis game is a blend of RTS and FPS elements that really seem to fit together and join together as one rather well. With the game primarily taking place in space with a sort of futuristic style it really takes upon the genre rather well. You can play as a hover tank that you can view from the cockpit, hunting down enemys with the hovertank destorying enemy crafts is rather satifying and brings back memories of when I used to play Starwars battlefront II.\n\nAlthough the game looks rather nice and seems like a pretty strong build from the earlier version of the game, sometimes the AI on the game seems a bit unresponsive and just sits there. Sometimes their pathfinding of where they are actually suppose to be moving can be a bit weird and obserdly different than what you would expect them to do.\n\nAnyways, the game is a really good source of what a RTS game should be all about. Being able to deploy your recycler at a power source to collect bio-metal that are used in the base in order to build defensive structers and wingmen into the battle. You are able to build towers to help you in the battle, with things such as Comm Tower which can take control of a satellite and you are able to view the battlezone. This gives you the added advantage of being able to command your wingmen in the traditional wya that you would normally in other RTS games.\n\nWith the graphics remasterd from the 1998 version of the game, it looks very nice and sharp which is what you would expect a game to look like in todays standards. With the hovercrafts and towers looking very futuristic and nicely detailed, I feel like the game was refinely detailed in every way when this game was being developed. The textures look very smooth and the explosions on are very nice.\n\nPros+ Detailed graphics\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ Shows what a RTS should rally be like\n+ FPS in a RTS game is very unique and hard to come by on steam\n\nCons- Weird AI at times\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsMy final thoughts on this game are pretty high. They really took the original game and made it into a modern version, with the graphics of everything and the amount of towers you can build to help you win the battle it really shows what you can do with a RTS game. If you can get past the weird AI at times, then I would definatly recommened this game.\n\nRating: 8.2/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow KgX Gaming curator group here.","April 30","true","6.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Muss auch zugeben, das ich drei Anläufe benötigte um Level 1 zuschaffen. Im zweiten Level werde ich gerade von den Russen komplett überrannt ... Aktuell bin ich mit der US Seite gestartet um wieder in den Razor zuspringen.\n\nDas Game selbst spiegelt den typischen US vs RUS Konfikt wieder bei denen es um Ressourcen auf dem Mond und Mars geht. Basenbau kann man sich wie bei C&C vorstellen. Man muss verschiedene Produktionstätten aufbauen und Ressourcen erschliessen, wobei Gysire eine Art Energiequelle darstellen, welche man ab dem zweiten Level kennenlernt.\nGeschütztürme , je nach Ressourcenmenge sind auch baubar, genauso wie im späteren Verlauf die schweren Panzereinheiten, wie den Grizzly zb. und und.\nDie Recycler sind das A&O wie bei C&C. Ohne Ressourcen wird man gnadenlos überrannt.\nMan kann auch als Inf da rumrennen und die Piloten rausschiessen aus den Fahrzeugen oder aus Geschütztürmen und diese dann entern. Es empfiehlt sich aber immer ein Fahrzeug in der Nähe zuhaben, falls man als Inf da rum rennt. Schießt man einmal daneben ... wird man i.d.R. sofort gejagt und erschossen bzw. überfahren ... die Knappheit von 2 weiteren Kugeln in dem Gewehr lassen da auch nicht soviel Spielraum, wenn man es vergeigt ;)\n\nAlle Fahrzeuge, welche man bauen kann, kann man auch besetzen.\nIm späteren Verlauf der Kampagne oder auch im MP hat man vollen Zugriff auf alle Einheiten, die da noch kommen. Auch eine Art Mechwarrior ist dabei und kostet entsprechend Ressourcen usw.\n\nDa ich das Spiel auch aus 1998 kenne, es hat sich nix geändert. Es ist ein klasse Remake und bringt mir ...fast 20 Jahre später gleich von Anfang an sehr viel Spaß. Mein Ziel ist es zunächst beide Kampagnen zu absolvieren (US u.

To this day I can remember it all.\n\nSome of my best memories are of playing this with my dad and his friends and the journey it took me on as i developed my skills and mindset towards becoming Better and better,  Every match utilized a different  strategy there were so many different vehicles and weapons loadouts you could use that it provided endless challenge and excitement Even though I lost almost every match,\n\nJust as the year ended I donned a New mantle that would come to be my gamertag(ReaperX2000).\n\nMoments before the new millennium I defeated My father and his friends in a brutal day wrecker victory I built and ammased an army of scouts and an armory quickly hunting down my opponents by carefully placing my troops i ejected so i could overlook the enemy base, launching 2 day wreckers onto seperate targets so the blasts would overlap and cause the most  widespread havoc,\n\nI waited with my sniper prone trained on whatever red dot i could find as the bombs reached the peak of thier arc i waited anxiously counting down the moments before they would be in range, as they approached just above his base i took the shot sniping one of his scavengers to draw his attention.Perfect, Just as he had time to turn around the bombs dropped destroy his entire offensive wing most of his scavengers and almost all of the buildings lay in critical condition.\n\n"Time to send in the dogs." I ordered my wing of scouts to attack his recycler, it was a crushing blow, as the scouts many miniguns quickly lay waste to what was left of Dads installer buddy.  I quickly ordered my scavengers and a couple defense turrets into the area to collect the salvage, It was time to take on the real threat, Dad himself.\n\nMy attack had been successful but in order to accomplish this task i had left myself open to attack at my original base, Fortunately i had already tucked my recyler away in a different geyser, calling it and the constructor it had built i quickly began raiseng defences for my new base, i built several powerplants and guntowers surrounding and plugging the perrimiter turrets,\n\nI had recyled most of my scouts and sent a few to scout for the enemy repurposing all the metal i could find into tanks and walkers, and of course switching to my own walker with my favorite choice of weapons,(Flash & Mag <3) Dad had already utilized the time to construct his own army of tanks but he lacked defensive structures, With my earlier attack run i had gained advantage by collectiong far more scrap far quicker, He put up a good fight, Our tanks clashed in a battle of explosions for what seemed like an hour. But in the end my resources allowed me the victory, Sending in wave after wave of tanks as i established defenses on his doorstep to reclaim my lost scrap, Eventually he lost out and I claimed Sweet Sweet Victory.\n\nThis victory would be the driving force to push me to succeed in any and every video game,Memories of the different odds i have overcome would give me the confidence to take on any new challenge,And the theme of this game would place space simulators action and strategy games in a special place in my heart.My 7 Year old Mind would grow to use battlezone as the basis to judge every game upon, And to this day, No game i have ever played,(And I have played ALOT) compares to matches in this game,\n\nThis to me, is simply the best game that was ever made, and seeing it here in steam(WITH MODS!!), remastered beautifully, Leaving the real joy to this game completely untouched, Because it was just so masterfully done the first time. is a dream come true,\n\nI would reccomend this as a 10 Out of 10 But this game is so wonderful it would simply take its score Divide by zero and multiply by infinity, Not only do I reccoment this game, this is THE game I reccomend For gamers at any point in thier lives\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game, It could change your life.\nP.S.

Battlezone 98 Redux is great, just great, and I urge anyone seeing this to get it, for starters, it has everything you loved about the original Battlezone with an addition of updated graphics, almost nothing else has been changed, except for the addition of Mods, some of which I don't have but can highly reccommend you get as well.  One mod is the replacement of the music with the music from the N64 port of Battlezone; Battlezone:  Rise of the Black Dogs.  I loved the music from the port and now that someone has remade the music with better sound quality, it will surely fit in with your experience.  The only thing that I have any problem with (This includes the original game as well) is the extreme gameplay difficulty spike when you hit medium.  Maybe it's just me, but I've never experienced a spike like this, it must just be that 90's difficulty.  Anyway, still get the game, even if it's a difficult for me doesn't mean it will be difficult for you.","May 6","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It was before it's time, coming on to the scene during a period when Mechwarrior 2 was still fresh in the minds of PC gaming.  It combined RTS and first person (both vehicle and on foot) in a really fascinating package of the secret war between the US and USSR over the mysterious bio-metal that was spread throughout the solar system.  The RTS aspect was solid and setting up bases worked well in that you never left the action, the game was seamless.  Thanks to Rebellion, we now have Redux, which updates the game and brings it out of the shadows again (there has been an active community around this game for years!), and the various enhancements along with release on Steam will give this gem another shot in the modern gaming world.

Almost the only strategy, in which I was able to play (don't like this genre at all) and passed it 3 times with great pleasure at the time. There were Machines and Emperor: Battle for Dune also, but those were "normal" strategies.

The 2nd part was kind of stoned already, there were problems with the functions of the buttons, and it's important to me, so I don't remember whether I passed the second part.

One of the defining games of my childhood and well deserving of this re-release.\n\nOriginally released in 1998, this take on Battlezone was itself a re-imagining of the 1980 arcade game. It blended first-person vehicular combat with real-time strategy elements to create a revolutionary hybrid game experience that has only been briefly revisited since, in games such as Sacrifice and Brutal Legend.\n\nIn 1952, as the story goes, a meteor shower in the arctic circle brought a previously unknown organic material to Earth. Simultaneously discovered by scientists of both the US and the Soviet Union, this "Bio-Metal" was soon discovered to have the unique ability to remember shapes it had previously assumed. From this material, the superpowers created hovering tanks and weapons centuries ahead of anything they could have otherwise made at the time. They quickly ran out of it, and turned their eyes towards the stars in search of more. In secret, the two nations sent thousand-man armies into space. Thus began a new, hidden chapter of the Cold War- the one too brutal to televise. You will journey to the moon, Mars, Venus and beyond in search of the bio-metal, and the truth of its origins.\n\nYou take the role of a soldier of either the Americans' National Space Defense Force, or NSDF, or the Russians' Cosmo Colonist Army, or CCA. You begin most campaign missions, as well as multiplayer strategy matches, with your own tank and a Recycler- at once your core base structure, your resource depository, and a factory that produces all other essential units. It exists in a mobile or deployed state, able to travel (slowly) about until you find a geyser over which to deploy it, whereupon it becomes able to build. You have two resources: scrap, and pilots. The former are gathered by scavengers, autonomous resource-harvesting vehicles built from the Recycler that will wander the map gathering bio-metal scrap, found lying around in fields on most maps, or generated from destroyed vehicles and structures. Controlling these scrap fields and assigning escorts to your scavengers is crucial in more difficult missions, and in multiplayer.\n\nCombat vehicles include nimble scout craft, light and medium tanks, rocket tanks, bombers, and walkers. Defensive units include mobile turrets and artillery that must deploy to fire, as well as minelayers. Offensive vehicles for the most part are fast, turn quickly and can strafe, allowing you to maintain fire on a target while avoiding return fire, though the bombers do not turn quickly and are more adept at long-range strikes on static structures. Combat is fast and chaotic- focused fire can destroy most vehicles in seconds, and battles can involve upwards of twenty tanks at once- more in the campaign. You should quickly master the ability to group your units using Control plus the Function keys, and commanding them to focus-fire individual enemy targets, lest they haphazardly engage multiple enemies at once and lose the advantage of their numbers. The scouts and turrets are built from your Recycler, while the rest are built from your Unit Factory, a more specialized builder vehicle that is also built from the Recycler. If a vehicle is destroyed, including yours, fear not- the pilot will eject, and have the opportunity to return to their base and be put in a new vehicle. While on foot, you are extremely vulnerable, but not defenseless- you have a low-damage plasma gun, as well as a sniper rifle you can use to snipe out the pilot of an enemy vehicle and steal it for yourself. Be wary of enemy pilots in multiplayer!\n\nYou may also build a Constructor vehicle from your Recycler that can build fixed structures, such as powerful gun towers, repair and resupply structures, and a communications tower that grants you access to an overhead satellite view in the vein of a traditional RTS. It can also build a barracks- the only way to increase your pilot count. Protect your Constructor well- it's often a priority target for AI enemies, and getting a network of gun towers up is crucial for fending off regular enemy raids in the later campaign missions. You will also want to build an Armory, a third mobile base vehicle that builds and launches repair, ammo and weapon pickups, as it is your only means of repairing structures and allows you to resupply in the field, as well as launch bombs on enemy bases.\n\nYou can command your units either by looking directly at them and pressing the space bar or by selecting them using the number keys from a list. Units are organized into offensive, defensive, utility, with an extra section for available navigation beacons, which also function as cameras when selected, to give you remote viewing of that location. Offensive units have the most diverse range of orders- they can be commanded to move to a specific location, attack or defend your current target, follow you, defend a key friendly, or to move to a selected nav beacon, as well as to get repairs or ammunition, or to recycle- refunding a portion of scrap used in their construction, as well as returning their pilots to your global pilot count- this is good, because you have a finite cap of 30 pilots per level and they cannot be replaced. This works both ways- target enemy pilots to deny the AI access to replacement units- I think. The computer probably cheats on both scrap and pilots, and they most certainly can spawn near-infinite waves of harassing attacks on your base. It works in multiplayer though.\n\nAside from the two story campaigns, there are a variety of multiplayer modes, including deathmatch, strategy, and "MPI", a form of co-op strategy versus AI. This Redux includes extensive Steam Workshop support- you can download maps on the fly even in-game. It also includes updated models and visual effects, trading cards, achievements, and other niceties- aside from running very smoothly on modern systems, more so then it ever did in the old days. However, it is a essentially a straight re-release, and does not attempt to address any of the game's existing shortcomings- save the netcode, of course.\n\nYou are limited, for example, to only ten units of each type, since that's as far as the number keys go, as well as the hard pilot cap of 30. The AI is single-minded at best and suicidal at worst, with frequent issues with pathfinding, often getting stuck trying to scale inclines the player would have no trouble at all with. Scavengers are completely incapable of not only defending themselves but even of reacting to being attacked, and will continue on their merry way scavenging in the face of certain destruction. Artillery units will fire at will regardless of the risk of hitting your own forces and cannot be set to hold their fire. Your offensive units also require careful management ot get the most out of their attacks. The walkers are also so painfully slow that their use in most campaign missions is extremely limited- its entirely possible to finish CCA Mission 6, for example, without the use of the three Golems you are given. Most campaign missions also have only one or two safe methods of completion, with very little room for experimental tactics.\n\nHowever, most of these flaws are attributable to the limitations of the original game engine, and and while they are even more glaringly obvious all these years later, there is something to be said for bringing the game to Steam and a new audience as is, the way we enjoyed it 18 years ago, and it is certainly easier to forgive then a brand new game with these same flaws. Battlezone was something completely new and any problems it had were excusable in the face of how much fun I had with it, and it was a great pleasure to revisit this landmark title in both my young life and the history of PC gaming. I urge newcomers and old hands, shooter and strategy fans alike to pick this one up. You will not be disappointed.","April 19","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played the original version for 300+ hours.\n\nIf you've played this before, then you already know how incredible it is and have bought it.\n\nIf you haven't, this version of Battlezone is a hybrid FPS/RTS sci-fi tank/battle Cold War simulator... in space. It's every bit as awesome as it sounds. Basically, imagine a really excellent, top-notch RTS with a fantastic interface in which you get to play as one of your own units while directing the battle. It sounds complex, but the UI is so excellent that neither part of the game, the tank simulator or the RTS, loses anything in the translation; it's two first-rate games in one. You play as a pilot who can switch ships and even snipe enemy pilots and take over their vehicles.\n\nI still remember the amazing adventures I had playing this game. The heart-pounding race to escape  a planet about to explode in seconds, being chased by alien superweapons all the way. Escorting my Soviet scientists across a bridge above the fiery lava of Jupiter's moon Io, getting blown out of my tank as it's destroyed by superior American forces, sniping the pilot of an American rocket tank who attacked me, stealing his vehicle and using it to fire upon my unsuspcecting foes, saving my forces. Sneaking into a heavily defended Soviet base on Europa to see where they've hdiden the stolen plans. Being ambushed by Soviet forces on the plains of Venus. They simply don't get any better than this.\n\nThe emergent gameplay situations, the enormous tactical flexibility afforded by the strategic layer of the game, the first-rate physics and satisfying gunplay, the huge variety of weapons and vehicles- even nearly 20 years later, this game remains unmatched I truly wish more people would try to rip it off! To try to compare it to some more modern titles if you haven't played this, imagine melding the seamless tactical interface and large-scale battle control of Sins of a Solar Empire with the visceral action and FPS excitement of Call of Duty, plus the open-ended battlefield and branching combat options afforded by Crysis or Far Cry. All with a cool sci-fi story in space. I am not exaggerating. It truly is that good.\n\nAnd all this before I even get to the beautiful, loving restoration this game has been given!\n\nAll of the above refers to the 1998 "vanilla" edition. But in this 98 Redux edition, the game has been given a complete makeover and beautifully brought up to date with care and devotion. The developers really layered on an extra level of polish along with all-new graphics and options for modern PCs. New, Steam-based online multiplayer? Check. Brand new HD graphics and textures? Check? New mod support? Check. In my brief time to date with the new version, AI also feels like it's been improved and bugs have been fixed. It really feels like a whole new game with the excellent graphics update. This is NOT the shovelware, throw-anything-on-Steam junk that most developers throw up onto the Internet when they get an old license- this is the remastered, restored edition, presented with the care and attention that all developers should lavish on a game rerelease. It truly is worth a buy even if you've played this as many hours as I have.\n\nUntil then... I'll see you on the Martian battlefields... or the Moon.... or Venus....","April 19","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The rockets were especially frustrating because they fly very slowly, forcing you to lead the target a considerable amount.\n\nI could have dealt with all that if the joystick aiming was more intuitive. Most games use joystick as acceleration/force for looking and aiming, this game it's an absolute value. If you aim the stick 10% up, the guy looks exactly 10% up. Where-as in most shooters aiming the stick 10% up makes the guy slowly lean his head up until looking at the sky.","April 25","false","0.8"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","3"

The game gave me a Recycler, an Armory, and ONE Geiser to make use of, so I placed a recycler down, then it told me to go check something out and then when I got there the comms told me "Ok, cool, lock it down".\n\nHOW!?\nWas I supposed to build an army before going there?\nWas I supposed to setup a defense so that in the minute I was gone 5 russkies didn't blow up my recycler?!\n\nThis is my problem with this game over Battlezone 2 negating the fact it lacks a further in-depth base-building mechanic; it doesn't help you whatsoever and often failing can result in waiting ~5 minutes for a specific wave of enemies to arrive just to trigger something over and over again.\nI feel like i'm missing specific important controls that are vital to me controlling things, like a command view, but the game doesn't even have a full list of keybinds!\nThe redux devs completely left out all of the important controls (though i'm not sure if even the original had it).\n\nNot to mention this game feels repetitive.\nEvery mission so far has been:\n-Escort\n-Defend from enemy waves, escort.\n-Setup base, defenses, defend base, escort.\nPersonally I just hate escort missions in games overall, especially when the vehicle you are escorting seems to be made of paper mache.\n\nThe story seems decent from the first two hours i've played but it really does feel like basic 1960's sci-fi stuff, which is awesome for some people, and dreadfully boring for others.\nIt's really slow and lacks life.\nBattlezone II jumped into the more "character-based" story-telling at just the right time, when it was starting to become a popular thing to do, and is better for it with memorable characters like Braddock, John, Sharbayev, and Cooke.\nThere's a set-up, an investigation, defense, build-up, and full on attacks with a farily detailed environment.\n\nI realise BZR's setting is based on the fact that it's the 1960's and they've JUST basically landed, so there's not going to be much in the way of detail, but christ the landscapes are boring to look at.\n\nI don't know, I came in expecting an enhanced BZ1 that is also leagues ahead of BZII, but honestly it isn't.\nIt's certainly enhanced in ways, but the game is too blurry for me to notice unless I downscale 4k to 1080p which completely destroys my performance somehow on my R9 380.\n\nIf I had another hour to play before my refund, I would have tried the Russian campaign to see if that makes up for it, but honestly I just want to go play something else.\nIf Red Oddyssey expansion comes out (they are "discussing it") I may choose to rebuy it and judge the game on that, because that's appearantly the best BZ out there.\nBut not if I have to shell out extra cash for it, it should have came with the game or had compatibility for it in the first place.","April 19","false","2.6"," 8 of 45 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","8","45","0","6"

The game was years ahead of its time. Unfortunately they don't make games like this nowadays. It's a pity since with todays technology and graphics, this would be an instant hit.\n\nThe campaign(s) are well written and fully voiced. You play a commander of either the US or Soviet forces in a war for resources in our solar system, mostly on the various moons of our planets. But it is not just your standard conflict of US vs Soviet, there will be a surprise in the campaign...nuff said. :)\n\nThe UI is innovative and context sensitive, which is also absolutely a must for a tactical and strategic game like this, given the orders you have to provide on the fly. Even after so many years developers still can't get UI right and given the complexity of BattleZone, it is a refreshing surprise that a 18 year old game nails it spot on.\n\nIf you think that the price is too high for such an old game, let me tell you it is totally worth it. This overhaul comes with completly new models of vehicles, buidlings, surfaces and sky-boxes. It is not just a fake "HD overhaul".

It seamlessly blended FPS and RTS gameplay in a way that has yet to be matched by another game (apart from the sequel: BZII). Not only can the player build and direct units in battle, but they can participate directly in those battles themselves.\n\nI remember playing Battlezone consistently for several years, until I got my hands on Battlezone II: Combat Commander. My grades suffered because of this obsession. To see that it had been remastered was exciting. At only 15 dollars (20% off sale), it was an easy impulse purchase.\n\nRebellion has done a swell job of remastering this game. The gameplay is essentially the same as it was in 1998 (apart from bug fixes). Everything just feels right. With the substantial graphical overhaul, the style of the game has been neatly retained. There is no dissonance between my nostalgic memories of the original and the improved fidelity of this remaster.\n\nThe story is an incredibly captivating Cold War era sci-fi alternate history. The Americans and the Soviets battle across the solar system in a race to gather "bio-metal" and to discover its mysterious origin.

The game plays as it did back in the day, including all the out-dated bits and pieces we've moved on from, e.g. a mess of keyboard binds which you'll need to google, you'll be iterating one-way through weapons with right-click and not mousewheeling it, the voice-over audio quality is still the same original ♥♥♥♥, etc. This is just plain Battlezone, no fancy 'redux' or anything else.

Also if you want some extras, the Community its working ASAP to port the old Instant Action maps and Mods for Redux, IA's are great to test your skills in combat and MP, some missions are pretty damn hard but impressive.\n\nIf you love RTS and Action FPS games, Battlezone its for You, The old MW, interstate and DR had managed to crat this masterpice of series, Both BZ 1 and 2 are GREAT, once you play it, ther's no turning back, until you finish up the game with a Bobcat!","April 22","true","46.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Micro management is the players who ride the tanks venturing out for more resources and creating skrimishes.  If your tank gets destroyed you eject and have the chance to snipe a enemy player inside a tank to steal theirs.  My memory of the games isn't as strong on details since back then multiplayer had garbage support but this is what I remember when I played it.\n\nNow they just need to add Rise of the Black Dogs expansion as well as Batttlezone 2 redux and we will be good.","June 5","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
