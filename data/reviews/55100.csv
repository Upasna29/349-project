It has some brilliant cinematography moments, a solid shooting engine, good storyline, and decent voice acting. I enjoyed every minute I spent playing it and will probably return to do another playthrough later. Good game.","October 19, 2014","true","23.5"," 210 of 238 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","210","238","11","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/55100/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Homefront is an FPS which tells the story of a resistance movement fighting back against a near future Korean occupation of the USA.\n\nThe game play is a very generic FPS. Pretty much identical to Call of Duty and Medal of Honor; you can only carry two weapons,  and four grenades. You will have to swap to different weapons from dead enemies throughout each level as finding ammo is more difficult than you would imagine. None of the enemies use the same weapon...\n\nGraphics wise, it looks nice, but you can tell the game was released in 2011, it looks better than most games released, however it shows it's age when comparing it to more recent titles. The graphical options are wide and you can probably play this game on a potato if you really wanted.\n\nAll the maps in the single player are very well designed, sadly you can't really explore because you are constantly reminded to keep following your squad leader. You fight through various different environments such as the streets of suburbs, department stores, and baseball fields, all of which show a disturbing outcome of the quite scary "what if?" scenario from a Korean invasion.\n\nThe single player of Homefront will take about five hours to complete; this is pretty short in my opinion, and the game ends on a massive cliff hanger, I would of liked to have seen another two or three more missions to tire up the loose ends in the story.  Multiplayer is still very much alive in Homefront, I have only played in a couple of games but I had no problem finding a map full of people to jump into. A lot of the reviews you will read on here will say multiplayer is the strongest aspect of the game, so they can't all be wrong.\n\nI would like to recommend Homefront; however I would wait till it is on sale, it has recently been on sale a few weeks ago for as low as £3,75, which would be an absolute bargain if you could get it for that again in an up coming sale.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/55100/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Set in the year 2027, Homefront presents a kind of "worst case scenario" of the near future. Kim Jong-Il has died and has been succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-Un. After unifying North and South Korea, and forming the Greater Korean Republic, Kim Jong-Un begins annexing nearby countries, such as Japan and Vietnam. At the same time, America's economy lies in shambles due to their dependence on foreign oil. After a satellite-launched EMP blast, Korea finally invades America.In the single player campaign, you play as Robert Jacobs, a former helicopter pilot who is being recruited for "re-education" by the Koreans. But pilots have become scarce in occupied America, and the resistance fighters need one for an important mission. Luckily, it doesn't take them long to liberate you from your Korean captors.The gameplay is fast-paced and exhilarating throughout the campaign. The shooting feels incredibly tight and powerful, and is extremely satisfying. Honestly, I don't remember the last time it felt this good to shoot someone in the face. The AI, for both squad mates and enemies, is outstanding. Your squad mates are able to hold their own in a firefight, and even saved my life on more than one occasion. And your enemies provide a fitting challenge without it feeling like they're cheating. For instance, enemies don't automatically know where you are (like in some shooters) making for some pretty awesome ambush scenarios.As a member of the Resistance, you're almost always outmanned and outgunned, meaning that hit-and-run guerilla tactics are preferred over head-on assaults. And even though you're only a lowly member of the Resistance, you still get some neat toys to play with once and a while, such as the Goliath: a six-wheeled tank-like vehicle that destroys enemies that you mark with a targeting device. You also get to man the gun of a humvee and fly a helicopter over the course of the campaign.The only problem with the campaign is that it is over far too quickly. Consisting of seven missions, it only takes few hours to finish the campaign on normal difficulty.Once you're finished with the campaign, you can always jump into the multiplayer. The online multiplayer in Homefront is almost an exact copy of Call of Duty's online offerings. There are six different classes, such as "Assault" and "Sniper," that can be customized and renamed. As you gain experience and level up, you unlock new perks and weapons. Up to 32 players can play in a match, and most of the maps are of the suburban variety.Graphically, Homefront is solid. Environments are well-detailed, and help set the tone of an occupied America. Some textures, like the wood grain in a hardwood floor, look absolutely stunning. But shadows sometimes look a little low res, and character models can look sketchy at times. But even if Homefront had the greatest graphics in the world, they would still pale in comparison to the phenomenal sound design. The voice acting is spot-on, and the incredible soundtrack sets the mood perfectly throughout the entire campaign.If you're the kind of gamer that values quality over quantity, then you'll definitely want to check out Homefront.","February 13, 2015","true","134.3"," 164 of 202 people (81%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","81","164","202","15","5"

It has a lot of deep and though provoking moments. However be warned as there are also many disturbing moments that will stun you and test your emotions.\n\nGameplay however its basically a Call of Duty knock-off only without the fastpaced action while the movment feels slow.

Many games like to show the U.S. as "the undefeatable force" and the "people who always save the day in the end". In this game, you get to experience the opposite. What would happen if North Korea were to occupy America? Answer: It's not pretty.\n\nCAMPAIGNNorth Korea has occupied America. You play as Robert Jabcobs, a pilot in the army. You are part of the Resistance, a small army trying to fight against the KPA (Korean People's Army). Along your journey, you will see the horrors of this alternate future and experience a different  gameplay style of a shooter game. The story to me is good, nothing amazing, but simply good. the characters are memorable and have their distinct personalities.\n\nGuerilla warfare is  something that this game introduces. Usually when you play titles like Call of Duty and  Battlefield (lets just use those titles as an example), these games usually want you to be an explosive and ammo grinding hero. This is somewhat the opposite in Homefront. Throughout the game, you will be performing hit-and-run raids and surprise attacks. Also, for each gun you pick up, you might only find one magazine and the maximum ammo you can carry for most weapons will be lower than 100. Instead of spraying like John Rambo, you gotta aim  carefully like a skilled Marksman. The campaign is about 5-6 hours long for me on Xbox 360.\n\nMULTIPLAYERI haven't spent much time playing multiplayer, but there is still a small and dedicated community playing. Multiplayer has the typical customization that most modern FPS multiplayer games have.\n\nThe multiplayer feels like a hybrid of Battlefield and Call of Duty if you ask me. However, with that being said, I wouldn't recommend buying Homefront for the multiplayer since the player count is less than 200, but if you really want to play Homefront for the multiplayer then by all means go ahead.\n\nMy Own OpinionI'm one of those people who have been interested in Homefront ever since it came out in 2011.\nThe story is one that I still find amusing and I spent time playing it on Xbox 360 (when it still worked).\n\nShould you buy it?I would say wait for a sale, then pick it up. It's not the best game in the world, but it has something different to offer.\n\n- Psychii","February 20, 2015","true","11.7"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","34","43","6","2"

Much of the story felt as if it could have had real, tear-jerking moments, yet the elements are never explored. I think the largest reason for this is how rushed the game feels.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it plays adequately and looks great. Nonetheless, something about the pacing of the campaign just feels...off. Too much happens too quickly. The protagonist goes from a "military grunt nobody who happens to be handy with a gun" to "lord of war who causes the earth to tremble as he breathes in one's general direction" within an in-game week. I had hope for this game. I really did. When I saw a child's parents executed in front of him, and when I hid amidst dozens of murdered corpses within a mass grave to hide from communist invaders, I thought, "Maybe this game won't just be another lifeless virtual duck-hunt." Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nI'd much rather the game follow a more humble storyline instead of going for huge "emotional" moments and executing them poorly. Your character is a resitance member. Why not have him act as one? Why not have him smuggle objects, firebomb cars, and raid checkpoints? I was hoping for a game that would convey how Red Dawn (1980s) felt. It very obviously tried to pander to the "MURICA" crowd, which is why I bought it. Even from a totally biased point of view, I think this game fails at what it tried to achieve. A lot of work obviously went into it, yet, the campaign feels like it was rushed out.\n\nI got it on sale for 4.99.

Multiplayer is Homefront’s redeeming quality, and those gamers out there who are like me and swoon for alternate/future history settings should certainly look into it.

Homefront is an unbalanced and a bit rough game that feels unfinished. And that's the main problem me, and many, others had with this game. It sounds a bit silly recommending a game after starting the review with negative things. Why would I recommend this game then? Why should you buy this game then?\n\nThe first thing that comes to my mind about Homefront is an abandoned puppy, left with no food, no shelter and left alone in a calm understanding of failure in it's head. You can still see the hope, the brief moment of love it got in it's eyes. If you can open your heart to the sad and helpless Homefront you are treated with a pretty mediocre yet fun FPS experience.\n\nHomefront does a lot of things wrong. But at the same time Homefront does things right. Well, mostly a thing or two. Homefront is a really really mediocre game. It doesn't have any magnificient plot. It doesn't have original, revolutionary gameplay mechanics. But it does have style. And that's enough to cover the worse things with the game behind a well designed and stylized environment.\n\nHomefront deserves a spot of some sort among the FPS genre. It's nothing great. And part of it may be in the way developers treated the game. You can see the partial laziness and the lack of trust on their product made them lose interest in the game and went with the basic idea of every FPS game nowadays; "Let's make another one of these" was their motivation to even make Homefront.\n\nHomefront is certainly worth buying if you are in need of a short yet stylized single-player FPS game. Even with it's mediocre gameplay it still manages to entertain for hours with it's challenging Achievements.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","March 27","true","16.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

However, the game is far too forceful with the "oo look how terrible war is" feeling, which seems to be self-defeating: instead of being subtly led into any sort of realisation/agreement, you just feel like you're constantly being struck by a moral hammer that ends up being incredibly annoying but otherwise ineffective.\n\nThe characters are also less than compelling. Perhaps having more time in the story might help (see note below on playtime).\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay itself is ok but I remember the odd restrictions in movement popping up (having to take a specific path rather than being able to jump over certain things was limiting for the gamer who decides to mash every button to get round an obstacle!).\n\nFor some reason, the game dynamics/enemies/tools etc. felt a bit like those in Dishonored (which isn't a bad thing): weird and also quite enjoyable.\n\nGRAPHICS\nNot bad at all, can't complain.\n\nPLAYTIME\nI think I spent about 4 hours completing this game on the hardest setting and I'm not a super skilled gamer. A first person shooter should take at least twice this time to complete!\n\nSUMMARY\nGood gameplay and concept, lacking in story and playtime.

The campaign took me only 4 hours to complete on normal difficulty (even with me dying and re-spawning every few minutes)  If you are going to charge $20 for a game, make it a bit longer than 4 hours.\nDespite having a short campaign, I had a lot of fun playing this game.  It has a wide variety of fun to use assault rifles, submachine guns, sniper rifles, and not to mention goliath-the resistances armored vehicle that you control with a targeter.\nThe graphics are sub-par even for a game made in 2011.  On many cases I had to lean closer to my monitor to see if it was an enemy I was aiming at or just a stray piece of garbage.\nI have nothing to say about the multiplayer mode as I have not played it but I might update my review after I have played it.\nRegardless of the short story and the lacking visuals, I enjoyed this game, but I wouldn’t buy it until it goes on sale or the price goes down.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tannersiemens/recommended/55100/","tannersiemens","[TG$] Ewspne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tannersiemens/","323 products in account","I wanted to like this game, I really did. And since I'm sure you see alot of that in reviews let me at least explain why.\n\nI did play this game back on xbox and when I saw it for dirt cheap I got pretty excited because in my foggy memory I remember having a bit of fun on this game and kept thinking to myself that it was just  a demo I played somewhere since it didn't seem like I had played to much into before I had to end, so of course I wanted to play it again/full game.\n\nApparently the "demo" I thought I had played was actually the full game. Don't believe me? Look at my playtime and achievements, I already beat it (more on this later).\n\nI don't want to rip this game a new hole because in honesty there are good points.\n\n+Tons of weapons! When you start fighting hordes of enemies there could be ranging from 2 different guns to about 15 which allow unique firefights.\n+Great story line (We'll look more at this later.) I love "alternate universe" storylines where what-if's become the "this actually happened". Its really neat because it throws you into a world you don't recognize and forces you to try to grasp at things that just aren't there anymore.\n+Achievements! yay! (this is a personal preference in games. I like working towards something extra in games, not really a necessity for buying this game...)\n\nSo yeah some things were good, but throughout the game I found myself frusterated with it. Things I don't remember being frusterated with when I played it on xbox.\n\nWhy? Well, simply put, this game is not optimized for pc. Yesyes #pcmasterrace whatever, but this game was made for consoles like the xbox and ps, that is obvious. Keybindings are weird, moving and looking obviously needed a controller, aiming/shooting/running,crouching; pretty much anything that requires specific actions and attention are lacking.\nIE: Shooting down the sights..., dear god the sight aiming... (I won't even discuss sniping because it was better to shoot from the hip with them more than half the time). So You look down the sights, line up a head shot, or even a bloody body shot. 10m away, easy right? hahah yeah no. You could potentially (AND I DID) end up wasting a full clip(s) trying to shoot this one npc. It was beautifully disgusting.\n\n- x50; Ai. Stupidest ai since... erm... Sims? Yes, the sims. You know, the little imaginary people you get to control and can't figure out how to not drown in a kiddie pool once you take out their ladder, or are starving because they are tired and tired because they are starving? Yes them. THAT is your ai friends, who shoot at walls, corner you so you can't continue (ie:fallout, you know what I mean), and just are generally the most ridiculous things ever.\n\nAlso, they are whiney as hell and keep yelling the same thing over and over like they have one script for the area you are in. Next area? Cool they'll say something new! Over, and over, and over again; while shooting at a wall.\n\nThe enemy ai? Well, they have unlimited ammo (and yours is scarce, go figure), so not much different with them. OH, except for will direct ALL attention to you as soon as you enter the area, even if you haven't shot anything or looked at them or done anything to attract attention (including sneaking into the area and hiding behind crates. Be prepared for unlimited grenades to be thrown at you.)\n\nI can talk about damage and how you need a "few" head shots to kill a basic enemy with a m16 (decent gun in the game fyi), but with their little subs they can put you down in seconds flat, even if you can't see them, THEY SEE YOU >.> Oh and they like throwing grenades at you; not just the enemies but your friendlies too. Always a good time when they throw grenades at you, while you're searching for hidden things, when no enemies are around, while yelling at you to hurry up every 2 seconds.\n\n**ALMOST DONE I SWEAR**\n\n**Caution there will be slight spoilers ahead**\n\nStoryline? I really like the idea, but I already told you that. And by the stuff I just told you, you can imagine I died close to 200 times, easily. So with load times, getting food because food is comforting when I'm distraught, eating said food instead of moving along in the game, and actually playing the game; LOOK AT MY PLAY TIME. The game is beat. donezo. I played on normal because usually my first playthrough I want it a little easier challenge but moreso for storyline, if I go back for another playthrough I go harder (easy is like, no. Not happening, ever). SO, with that I'm concluding to you that this game is way to short. And its not even like they finished the storyline! There was so much potential like meeting "The voice of freedom" or battling to washington, ect. This comes in to where I said I had thought I played the demo and then nope? Well, after the "final" chapter I was like ooooo whats next!?! GOD, DAMN, CREDITS thats what. I was mortified. There was no conclusion (good or bad or anything), its an open ended game which is cool if you want to write fanfiction for it (pl0x don't), but there was nothing! Even the final voice of freedom announcement could have led to the next mission. I'm just, UGH.\n\nI liked the gameplay, as ridiculously not good as it was for pc. I liked the storyline, as whiney and stupid the ai were and how short it was. But, really, I'm sticking with this and DO NOT recommend this. If you don't feel the same then thats ok, but I just can't bring myself to actually hit the thumbs up in this review... This game disappointed me.\n\nIF you want to feel the horror I did when playing this emotional roller coaster, then I advise you to grab it yourself when you see it DIRT ♥♥♥ CHEAP on sale. **Caution have comfot food (pizza) at the ready**\n\n~~Sorry, quick edit here for you~~\nThis is just for single-player campaign, I will re-edit this when I bring myself to do multiplayer (its still a thing right?).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/55100/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Let me first try to explain why it was that I wanted to play Homefront.  Firstly it was the first game that I could remember that brought the fight to American soil and wasn't based on factual past battles or wars.  Here was a new idea, a new war as it were, and it was America defending its land.  Rather than America attacking on someone else’s, which is all too often the case.  The second reason was that the story they chose seems almost feasible.  The “Future History” trailer that was released told a great story that felt like it could happen.  It was a great mix of a new idea in uncharted territory with a hint of possibility.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed was the graphics, they were gorgeous.  I spend so much time playing older games that I am, for all intents and purposes, a few years behind on the graphics.  This games not that much different since its already a year and a half old.  The game started with my being taken from my home and placed on a bus to an unknown destination.  The drive down the street was eye opening to the world I had entered.  It was some time after the Korean occupation and everything was about what you would expect.  There were some moments that I thought were funny, and others that I knew were there just for my shock value.\n\nIt was shortly after that moment that I had fully removed the rose tinted glasses.  I came back to the game the next day, after playing for about a hour the previous night.  This time all bets were off and everything was on the table.\n\nCut to four hours later as I watched the ending credits scroll up my screen using all of my will not to drop a huge F-bomb in front of my child.\n\nTerrible, simply horrid and a waste of my time.  I have so many other games I could have spent that time with.  And to have the single player of a game that originally was retailing at $49.99 is ridiculous.  Even its current price of $9.99 seems a bit much for the size of its single player.  It took me longer to beat the first Portal that it did Homefront.\n\nNothing about Homefront stands out above the crowd, hell nothing about it outside its story is unique in any way.  I remember reading once that Homefront was inspired by Half-Life 2, and its guerrilla warfare.  Its clear that it was simply a handful of moments in the later moments of the game and nothing else from Half-Life 2.  Especially nothing about its ground breaking story, graphics, anything.  That’s about the same as saying that Bust-a-Move was inspired by Pong.  In other words, they say they are inspired by an already well known great game and hope more people will buy their game.\n\nThere was also mention of using real companies and logos in the locations.  It was stated to give it the real feel of these locations.  I guess this is true, but I saw it more as; “Lets stick some advertising into the game to make more money!”\n\nThere was a moment where I realized that I hadn’t seen any health, and in fact had no clue how much I had.  There was no HUD element with health nor had I seen any heath packs or med kits, not even a single bottle of pills.  It was after this realization that I noticed that as I would take damage the HUD would kind of darken, and once I took cover and stopped getting hit the screen would normalize.  Ah regenerative healing.  I don’t know how I feel about this, but on first use I’m not a fan.  Maybe its just Homefront, but it seems like it made the game too easy.  The only weapon I was even remotely concerned with was rocket launchers.\n\n{SPOILERS]\n\nThe overall story was acceptable, but left much to be desired.  There were parts however that I found annoying and unexplained.  For example there is a level where you have to sneak into this outpost/base thing controlled by a bunch of crazy survivalist.  When we arrive the other members of  my party make mention that they don’t know these people but one member of the party did, but he’s now dead.  The crazy survivalist turn on us, what a surprise, and we have to sneak into the place and steal their helicopter.  Now once this part happens we head to the church to steal the copter.  But how the hell does this Connor ♥♥♥♥♥♥ even know here the church is?  When the level starts he states he’s never been here, and now he knows his way around?  I call bull.\n\nAnother thing, again with the great Connor, was at the end of the game.  First we ignore the fact that the US Army let use join them on their attack of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Because I refuse to believe that part.  But then, right before the last climactic moments of battle, this Connor idiot gives a little speech and ORDERS THE SOLDIERS AROUND.  Seriously, this guy is telling the army guys what to do.  By this point I had pretty much given up on the game, but when that happened I knew right then and there.  I knew that once I was done, I wouldn't be playing it again.\n\nTo make things worse, the whole game you are being yelled at to do this, do that, go here, shoot him.  Just constantly being told what to do, and that gets real old, real quick.  And maybe coming off a game like Far Cry 2 has me a little skewed in my views/opinions.  But I can’t remember any other FPS that was similar to this.  This game is a rail short of being a rail-shooter.  Its really that poorly made, its really that bad.\n\nThe story has no real ending.  And to make things worse, the guy that annoyed the crap out of me since the beginning of the game martyrs himself at the end.  Yea, Connor, that idiot.  I was more than happy to hit him with that air strike, but it was a really stupid moment overall.  Because why would they need a guy on the ground to use a laptop to fire an airstrike from a helicopter doing circles over the bridge target?  Why?\n\nAnd all the cliches where present in Homefront.  The story was pretty predictable on a few occasions, and at times the sheer number of Korean soldiers was just laughable.  Possibly the worst TF2 trade I’ve ever made, and I seriously doubt that I will ever touch that game again.","May 28, 2013","false","4.9"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, it's NOT a bad game, but it's a disappointing one, especially when you see how much THQ advertised and promoted this game. So what's brought this game down? The singleplayer. First, it's awefully short; you can beat it in 4 hours. But the story, wow, there's such a cool background and the characters are totally relatable. And that's what annoyed me the most. It has such a good premise that you wonder why isn't it any longer. And the gameplay. It's like a typical military shooter. The problem is that it holds your hand WAY TOO MUCH. For example, you'll have to take out certain enemies, and there's an icon on it saying "SHOOT". Well, what else would I do? Blow a kiss to it? The problems of the singleplayer outweighed it's benefits.\n\nMultiplayer fares better. The PC servers are still up, and there's at least one full server on afternoons. It's like a combination of Battlefield and COD. You can use points in-game to purchase things like armor and even vehicles. Maps are quite good too. Ground Control, the main mode, has you capturing certain points, like Domination in Battlefield, only that you can move up to a certain area if one team dominates it, like in the Rush mode in Battlefield.\n\nIn summary, Homefront is full-priced game with budget-game quality.

All under a generic, on-rails, brainless 4 hour run and gun play style where all the guns are accurate enough for head shots, so just take a big light machine gun and maybe a weapon of choice as you grind through less than 10 levels worth of enemies, all while you comprehend why they played up that you're a pilot and you only pilot an aircraft for a single level.\n\nI do believe Homefront's single player experience was supposed to be bigger and more dynamic, but clearly development time had butchered the story into what it is today.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taksee/recommended/55100/","taksee","Taksee™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taksee/","1558 products in account","<!-- Updated Review -->\n\nInitial Thoughts & Observations\n\nI'll begin by acknowledging that the length of this game is very short. I would say that there's about 7 Chapters in the game, and each chapter varies in length.\n\nGameplay & Mechanics\n\nThere is a low amount of complexity to the game overall, and it's fairly linear as to what you can do, and when you can do it. I was constantly finding myself having to wait for NPC_1 or NPC_2 to get to a location before I was able to complete an action. There were situations where I would know where the NPC was going, but because I walked there before the time I was supposed to be there, the NPC would be stuck in an animation where they would never complete the action.\n\nStory & Plot\n\nOne are that left a lot to be desired would have to be the story. I wouldn't say the story was bad, but I will say that it would have been connected better. To me, it felt as though you went from one scenario to the next too quick, and without any real explanation to why you are doing this, going there, or meeting them. The story has the ability to be high production, but because of the inability to connect each chapter seemlessly, you don't really understand the story itself, but instead understand the overall premise, which is that you're rebelling against invaders.\n\nWeapons & Customization\n\nThere's not many weapons to choose from, I would guess about 12, and you will probably constantly find yourself choosing between 3 of them throughout the game, minus a couple chapters. The struggle that I found myself in a lot was when I would find a weapon I liked a lot, particularly the SCAR, but ammo would be fairly scarce. Now this is not the case in all levels, but seldom did I encount enemies had SCARs versus the other handful of guns in the game, so some chapters force you to pick up a weapon that you might not like. There are different weapon skins that you can see, but it's not something that you get to choose, instead an enemy may have a gun, and when you pick it up, it might have camo, or even a different color. There's a few attachments in the game, such as different scopes to use, as well as magazine sizes, but again that's randomly generated based on what enemy had it.\n\nGraphics & Level Design\n\nGraphically, the game isn't too bad considering when it came out. As far as level design in concerned, I feel the game borrows a lot from games like Call of Duty. It seems very cookie-cutter, but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. It makes it a very familiar experience, but in it's own unique way. The beginning levels aren't very innovative, but as you progress midway through the game, it does add different varieties of gameplay.\n\nFinal Thoughts & Conclusion\n\nThis was not a very groundbreaking game, and most people will probably feel the game seemed rushed. Having said that, I still found myself satisfied playing it. It's a FPS, that does exactly that. It's not trying to innovate in any areas, but is very reminescent of older FPS games. I wouldn't say this is a everyday shooter however, I would categorize this more as a casual FPS fore those looking to just play something quick. I would still recommend this game for any who generally loves FPS games, and who's interested in something that doesn't need heavy investment. I wouldn't necessarily pay full price for the game, but if you can find a deal on it, or for a reasonable price, I think it's worth picking up.\n\n<!-- Original Review -->\n\nTo start off, I will say that this game is extremely short. As in, you can probably beat it in under 2 hours. Having said that, I enjoyed the game quite a bit. The game isn't too complex like your modern day shooters now, in fact it's really limited to what weapons there are to use, and where you can go. It's extremely linear in the sense that you have to wait for your teammates to finish their action before you can proceed. I would say there's about 12 total guns that you can use, and you really only get to use 3 of them for most of the game. I wouldn't say the story was entirely bad, but it wasn't something that pulled me in. For me, it felt like any other FPS, nothing really groundbreaking, but was satisfying as well. Regardless of it's flaws, I still found myself having a lot of fun progressing through the campaign. I wouldn't say it's a great buy for full price, but if you can find it for reasonably cheap, it's a good game that's quick, and offers fun for those who generally love FPS games.","May 18","true","21.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/capnwhales/recommended/55100/","capnwhales","❀ ell ❀","http://steamcommunity.com/id/capnwhales/","105 products in account","This game is bad in basically every way you can expect a modern military shooter to be bad, so let's go over the checklist:\n\n1) The game treats you like a ♥♥♥♥♥. You're not allowed to do anything until you're told to, and your three buddies do it first.\nOpen a door? You're too dumb to work doorknobs, bettermake sure literally everyone goes through the door to make sure it was opened right before you do.\nShoot a gun? Nuh-uh, gotta wait until you're told to.\nWanna be an idiot and screw up the mission on purpose? Nope, they don't even give you the tools to fail in many places. You're forced to succeed. Not that the game is easy...\n\n2) The battles are horrendously frustrating. I don't think I've ever played an FPS with a lower TTK, but you don't have the tools necessary to handle this low TTK. Your movement is some of the slowest I've ever seen in an FPS, and cover seems almost entirely useless because your hitbox is much larger than you expect. While you may not be able to see over or around a piece of cover, you'll likely be hit from some indeterminate direction and die before you have the time to repopsition.\n\nEvery time you fail a battle, you're required to wait through the dialogue preceeding that battle, adding an extra minute or two on to every failure.\n\n3) The game is still buggy, despite ample time to have fixed these issues. Sentry turrets will often get stuck firing in one position, and if that position blocks somewhere you need to go, you have to restart from the checkpoint or die to the stream of bullets, then going back to the checkpoint.\n\nOn some less technical and objective levels, the game has weird issues with its themes and setting. It really wants to have its cake and eat it too; they want you to be terrified and disgusted by the horrors of war, but then encourages you to commit these same acts. *SPOILERS* About half way through the game, there's a point where you set off a white phosphorous mortar and one of the friendly NPCs acts horrified about it; the entire game thusfar had set her character up as complaining about everything, so the impact of this comment is hugely undercut and quickly forgotten. As well, the white phosphorous burns the battlefield completely clean, leaving no bodies. It's a weird moment that tries to 'speak out' against weapons that are already war crimes, but then undercuts and erases the aftermath of what you've done and hides the very atrocity that it's trying to preach about.\n\nTo top all of that off, it immediately rushes you into another huge firefight where you use your "cool" robot AI rocket machine gun car to blow up soldiers by the dozen. It's just bizzare tonal whiplash.\n\nOverall, Homefront is a confused game. It's confused as to how a modern military shooter works, it's confused about what its themes and characters are, it's confused as to what is fun.\n\nThe only reason I could recommend playing Homefront is to examine its flaws and ponder on how it got made and released like this.","May 18","false","1.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

About two hours of gameplay - due to getting killed and having to reload, it took me four.  NPCs would soak up entire clips of bullets without taking damage, but then later one got hit and killed by a single bullet during a scripted event - it really destroyed the suspension of disbelief.\n\nScripted to within an inch of its life - at one point you are forced to talk to every person in a farming community before you are allowed to proceed with the storyline.  They will not let you proceed until you've sat and listened to each person spout their boring dialogue - and there's no way to skip.","June 7, 2015","false","4.0"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

It seemed to me like the developers kind of wanted to copy the bridge level from Half-Life 2 but failed to get it as epic.\n- Multiplayer is still active. I just played a quick game for 20 minutes and there were 19 people in the session. Not bad for a four year old game with moderate reception\n\nCons:\n- very short campaign\n- got stuck many times in the middle of the action because I quickly wanted to move out of the line of fire but a chair or a tiny step kept me from moving\n- The game didn't start at first. This was related to physX issues. It took me a while to read the forums and experimenting to get the game working. Many players complain about this problem.\n- Extremely linear.

Not sure why this game gets the bad rap that it often does. The campaign, although a bit on the short side (7 missions, though they are beefy-sized) is very fun and adrenaline-packed. The premise for the story is original, but the progression of it is kind of bland and the characters aren't very interesting, besides a certain war machine you get to wreak some delicious havoc with a few times (if that can constitute a character). The guns are fun to use and sexy as hell. They feel like, say, a mixture of Call of Duty's and Killzone's guns. The multiplayer is very well-done too, but the active servers are a bit on the short side.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is a little underrated and didn't get the attention it deserved, despite it having a few weakspots. I had to play it on minimum graphics settings and the lowest resolution (800x600) because I had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC, and I still had a great time with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/55100/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","From what I've read, the general consensus on Homefront is that it's just average. After finally getting around to finishing it, I think the reviewers may have sold it a tad short. I mean, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but I also found very little wrong with it. I guess the biggest issue is that the single player (which is all I cared about) only took 4-5 hours to finish. So while it definitely wasn't worth the original asking price, now that it's only $20, it may not be a bad investment if you have ever had any interest in playing it. As far as the gameplay goes, it's pretty standard for a modern shooter. Mostly you shoot people (duh), but some levels mix it up with vehicle sections and other types of mechanics. The final level is also pretty epic. What sets Homefront apart from most shooters is the story, the premise being an alternate future where North Korea has occupied the US. All in all, it's a decent, but short game. Perfect for FPS fans to kill time on a rainy afternoon.","May 20, 2012","true","4.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Sadly gamers these days prefer to cannibalize franchises until they are rotten to the core, leaving games that come out under the wrong banner, to die in the sidewalk.\nFirst off if you are thinking of buying this for the single player then don't. It's in tune with other war-themed sp campaigns out there: i.e bad. So what makes this game great? Big, detailed maps. Point based perks + killstreaks to ensure balance. Most killstreaks are skill triggered/manual. Vehicles. Guns feel solid, movement is smooth and gunplay is fast. Battle commander mode is a nice twist on regular game modes. You are given all the right tools to battle both camping and vehicle-stomps/ the game is not easy to cheese or grief. Teamwork is on the lukewarm side as you can lone-wolf if you want.

Single player is incredibly short but also very fun.  With the backstory to the game there probably could have been a lot more added but even with what little campaing there was it was very enjoyable.\n\nThe story was great in my opinion.  Not the typical you are a military super soldier and you go to whatever country and kill a bunch of terrorists.  No you are fighting for the USA that's been invaded by a united North/South Korea.  The story worked for me because of the setting and enviroment that the Devs created.  There was some incredibly gruesome scenes as well a touch of realism as people are going to do what they feel is best for their survival and it wasn't just everyone against the invaders.\n\nLoved the setting and enviroments that you play through in the game.  Some of the areas are semi generic cover based shooting but some of the locations do evoke some sense of feeling in the game whether pity or anger at whats happening.  The only complaint is that as a FPS the areas are very linear and would have been nice to explore some of them a little more freely maybe open up more paths to achieve the goal.\n\nThe game also varied the pacing in the levels for the most part as well.  In some levels it was a constant frenzy of action while others were a little slower with small burts of action to break up the tension.  Again it worked for me because if it was just all 100% constant action shooting every enemy you came across it would get bland fast.\n\nGood deal of weapons in the game, mostly automatic weapons, would have been nice to get some more variety in pistol/shotguns or other weapons instead of just from dozens of different assult rifles.  I also liked that there wasn't just a ton of ammo laying around everywhere to collect.  I was switching between a variety of weapons to keep my ammo up as when I'd get a new weapon there wasn't always ammo for it and I'd be on the lookout for me next weapon or playing a little more conservatively to make what ammo I had count.\n\nOnly complaint would be that the character model gets caught up on really odd pieces of terrain and you can't tell if you should be able to get past an area or not.  Sometimes there looks to be a path but you get caught on something.","March 6, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's roughly 3-4 hours depending on individual play style. Looking back at both Medal of Honor and Battlefield: Bad Company 2 with 5 hour single player campaigns, this didn't come as a shock to me.\n\nHomefront brings an engaging story, good voice acting, and nice graphics. The gameplay has a similar feel to both Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Call of Duty 4 games. The shooter aspects definitely feel right. Taking the role of a resistance fighter, your mission is to commandeer jet fuel trucks and deliver them to the army--a tiny mission in a very big war.\n\nThe one flaw that annoyed me was the character mouths were out of sync with the voice acting. It gave the impression of a badly dubbed movie. And it's probably best to think of the game as Homefront: Episode 1 due to its length. But armed with that knowledge, I came out of it with an enjoyable experience overall.","September 1, 2012","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a review of the campaign. I can say this: The graphics are good, it runs well, the story is believable (almost), and it's certainly action packed, full of big explosions. But sadly it's let down by far too many things for me to reccomend it:\n\nFirst and foremost is that I feel so bored after completing the campaign that the very idea of even trying multiplayer makes me feel like I should do something more productive with my time... Pull a lump of wax out of my ear, pick my nose, or scratch my nuts or something...\n\nYou just play "follow the leader" for 90% of the campaign. Deviating from the leaders course is unrewarding/pointless, and in some cases causes the mission to restart.\n\n4 hours to complete, and the first 3 hours was at best: "meh". The final hour of gameplay I was sort of starting to enjoy it. Stockholm syndrome maybe. Then it was over.\n\nLacklustre animations, people sliding sideways without their feet moving, or running but not going anywhere (enemy soldier stuck at the top of the stairs for instance), wheels on vehicles that turn too slowly for the speed the vehicle is moving at...\n\nSpecial effects from two different games: explosions and the resulting fireballs look brilliant. Get stuck in an area where most of the scenery is on fire though and it's a different story... Running through a burning shop I noticed "fires" that looked like they came straight out of a game from 15 years ago.\n\nAmbient occlusion? Turn it off, it looks like lego land smoke on everything that gets close to another surface. Turning it off didn't make a noticeable difference to the general look of the game, but did get rid of the horrible blocky smoke around everything.\n\nAll the guns handle the same with nothing to distinguish them besides the scope stuck on top (of which you can choose 3 varieties of acog scope, and 3 varieties of red dot sight). Whether it be an SMG, LMG or assault rifle; recoil is non existant (with the exception of the two sniper rifles, but they auto center after each shot making the recoil pretty much pointless on them).\n\nThere's a heli flying section in the game that is absolutely dire, it shouldn't be in the game at all but part of the story is you're a heli pilot... Unfortunately whoever designed the heli section of the game had absolutely no idea of what a helicopter actually is... You basically fly a magical hovering cannon that can bounce off everything, including cliffs, trucks, enemy tanks etc. You can point the nose of the heli at the ground and not go anywhere...\n\nThen there's bugs, invisible walls, not being able to walk through certain doors when they're open because you have to wait for the NPCs to go through first and that sort of rubbish.\n\nFriendly NPCs who are totally invincible, soaking up hundreds of rounds of ammo and eating a few grenades to boot without so much as stumbling.\n\nThe stealth sections are atrocious, and the AI is pretty much non existant. My first warning of this was when I nearly tripped over an enemy soldier after running upstairs, but he didn't notice me because apparenlty he was stone deaf and for some reason was inspecting the paintwork on a door by pressing his nose against it... I couldn't shoot him, I couldn't even raise my gun (maybe your character pitied the simple minded fool or something). Then a friendly npc walks up behind him, chatting casually, and strangles him in 1 second flat.\n\nShe then looks all sad before saying "It never gets any easier". I dunno love, that vulcan nerve pinch shiz you just pulled on that soldier looked pretty damn easy to me.\n\nThe sad truth is it literally couldn't be any easier: You can literally walk around in the open in broad daylight and they won't notice you unless you are directly in front of them.\n\nOne time a friendly NPC (yeah, same one) went to kill a guard, in plain view of 3 other guards and a couple of prisoners, they didn't even blink. I shot someone on a tower with a silenced sniper rifle and the mission ended because I took the shot 2 seconds before I was told to. 2nd attempt, friendly NPC goes to kill the guard, I hide behind a tractor with my team until I'm told to take the shot, mission ended for no apparent reason. 3rd attempt, I stood in front of the tractor in the open between the friendly NPC and the 3 guards who don't care about their friend being choked to death behind me. Still standing in front of them I shoot the guy in the tower. Nobody cares, the mission is allowed to go on.\n\nIt doesn't feel like it's finished. BF3 in beta was a more polished experience than this tripe. Though you can see the influences of other games, the one that really stands out is CoD. This game tries so hard to be CoD, that it's almost as bad as a CoD game. CoD and Half Life had a baby, CoD smothered the baby. Half Life decided that things weren't working out and scarpered, but then CoD decided to keep and raise the afterbirth. Homefront, the mouldy placenta of FPS games is a casual shooter. Are you a casual? If you've read this far I doubt it. If you're really desperate for another generic CoD clone this might keep you entertained briefly... If you want a game that has real substance and lasting replayability, look elsewhere because this is duller than dishwater.\n\nTLDR: Yet another generic, run of the mill CoD clone that was a chore to play... If you've got 4 hours to waste and it's 75% off, do yourself a favour and still don't buy it. Unless you're a CoD fanboy, in which case you'll probably love it. Sad, deluded fool that you are.","February 17, 2015","false","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirbyfanone/recommended/55100/","kirbyfanone","Ryoko's Stepdad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirbyfanone/","47 products in account","Homefront was a strange experience.\n\nI was huge into Team Fortress 2 at the time and they were giving away a copy of Metro 2033 and a hat for the Soldier class aa a pre-purchase bonus so I figured why not? It turns out I got more mileage out of the Genuine hat than either game I got out of that deal.\n\nOne has to look at the media blitz surrounding this game as an indicator that when you have people dress up as the antagonists of the game at gaming conventions and events and releasing hundreds of balloons over the Golden Gate Bridge to promote it you have to wonder if the developer is putting too many of their eggs in the basket. If you can, go look up the review PlayitBogart did of Rise of the Robots to get the gist of what I'm saying.\n\nTo the game itself now.\n\nHomefront was not a hot mess; it played just fine and controlled like a modern FPS should despite all the difficulties I had adjusting to the keyboard and mouse after playing shooters on consoles for almost seven years prior. A lot of the high points of the game came in the first half of the campaign showcasing the cruelty of the North Koreans by having things such as piles of dead Americans being buried en masse in a baseball field or a childs parents being shot in right in front of you as you are transported on a bus. They even briefly touched on one of your companions facing racism due to the fact he was half-Korean. Surely some attempts to invoke emotion were expected in a game touching on this subject matter.\n\n...That's about the end of the positives however. Looking back I disliked this game for the lack of content it had and all the glaring flaws in how it tried to do what it did. For starters, all the main characters played out as pure sterotypes which for the purpose of this review I will refer to them as Jarhead, Girl, Target of Racism (TOR), and Father Figure.\n\nYou escape from a bus and turn into Dothis McPlotdrive III as you try to meet up with Jarhead's friends to try and fight back against the Koreans who were somehow able to unite almost all of East Asia and occupy an economically crippled United States. Is your immersion broken yet? Don't worry, I was somehow able to care less about the characters in this game by the end of it all. Jarhead and Girl argue constantly as you are led through the war torn suburbs to a hidden oasis where the resistance has set up a self-sufficient hide-a-way led by Father Figure.\n\nYou are then led through a night mission where you are bombarded by advertisments for actual real world companies and establishments to the point where you actualy have to fight your way through a Tiger Direct store and pass by a Hooters. I wish I was kidding. This was a design choice by the developers to try and increase the immersion but astute gamers will see this as a disturbing trend where fiction and reality break down. The same thing happened when I noticed real world ads would start appearing on billboards in Saints Row 2; it takes me out of the game and reminds me the crappy real world exists.\n\nYou go through American held lands with TOR to do something in the cornfields. I think it was to find a helicopter to escort some fuel trucks for the military to use to fight against the Koreans. The game just spirals down into oblivion after this.\n\nThe whole premise of the game is laughable at best anyway. You expect me to believe a small nation that refuses to feed it's populace would just somehow take over it's neighbors and confront the only real Superpower on the planet? Would this make more sense if the antagonists were Chinese as was originally planned? A change that was made because the devs were afraid of a people who are notorious for breaking copyright law like it's nothing and banning anything that portrays their nation in a bad light?\n\nThe worst problem I had with this game was the fact it was obvious sequel bait. When you finally get to the climax of the game you expect to confront the main bad guy that they built up all game to, only to be blue-balled by "We are finally turning this war around" before the credits roll.\n\nThere was no follow-up until recently with Homefront: The Revolution serving as a reboot of the series, effectively making this game pointless story wise. But hopefully developers look at it as a lesson of how much high expectations can sink a company. Kaos Studios was shuttered shortly after release and according to Wikipedia shares of THQ declined by almost a quarter, ultimately leading to the demise of THQ.\n\nMultiplayer was also a strange mix of Battlefield and Counter-strike where you fought in tug of war style battles and earned credits to purchase weapons, armor, vehicles and the like. In retrospect, it wasn't unique enough for me to continue trying to do better. I just went back to TF2 shortly after with my Genuine Hachimaki.\n\nI could only recommend this at a steep discount or as a video playthrough. Aside from that, you didn't miss much.","June 5","false","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Homefront wasn't actually terrible. It wasn't very good either though.\n\nLets start with the flaws. For starters, the campaign is notably short and can be beaten in about 4 hours, which includes dying a number of times. The plot is basically Call of Duty: Red Dawn, but a lot less military based and a bit more guerilla warfare based. Basically, it's not very unique.\n\nThe context is that in 2013, after the Supreme Leader of North Korea dies, his son unites the North and South to form the Greater Korean Republic. This should be the biggest clue that Homefront is purely speculative fiction and not to be taken seriously as that will never happen. The South (South Korea) had seperated from North Korea just as the Korean war started because of the atrocities that were going on. Anyway, fast forward to 2025, the GKP is a world power and has already taken over four other countries and begins their invasion of the USA. Another two years later, it's 2027 and you are Robert Jacobs, a former Marine combat pilot who is awakes in his beat apartment in Montrose, Colorado. The Koreans have seized the town and are sending you to Alaska for "re-education". Well, as you can assume, you're rescued by the resistance and recruited to help fight the good fight. That's pretty much it. There's little development in character or tone, it's just very one sided. At least Call of Duty (everything since Modern Warfare)  gave the villains a sort of character to help build up their wrongdoings. You don't even get to know the Koreans, they're just targets for all of you.\n\nSPOILERS: There is one level where there might be some shift in tone, but it ends up being a massive firefight anyway. American survivalists; those nut jobs who like to keep their guns close in case something like this would ever happen, which won't. It won't ever happen. But people like the people in this game do exist. In one of the missions, these survivalists have a helicopter you need and basically you end up killing them all.\n\nWell, at least the audio design and graphics were nice. The campaign was still fun to play, but it's nothing special. More of thing where you play it just to pass the time and you only own it because it was in a THQ Humble Bundle or it was on sale for like 3 bucks.\n\n7/10","August 9, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're bored and it's on sale and you just wanna mindlessly destroy enemies, go for it.\nIf you're going for something for story content, innovative gameplay or a new experience I'd suggest running away as fast as you can.\n\nI bought this title on sale for five dollars US, for five bucks I'd say it was worth it, I enjoyed it *JUST* enough to warrant it. For full price? I'd probably be pretty mad I bought it.\n\nMy take on things:\n\nThe Story:\nThe story's background is so impossible you'd be more likely to encounter Santa astride a Unicorn than the scenario depicted in this game.\nThe characters are tired stereotypes and overacted, sometimes hilarious so.\nThe writers seemed to really want me to have an emotional response to this game and the events in it. If their goal was annoying me, they succeeded. If the intent was making me feel something for their poorly written characters they utterly failed.\nIt was also extremely predictable, so many moments meant to be surprising weren't in the slightest.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nIt's a retextured Call of Duty, and it somehow managed to actually be worse than call of duty. This includes the "shocking" moments and first-person moments of your character being tossed about and blown around.\nIt works off the exact same mechanics as Call of Duty, enemies endlessly spawn until the player advances to a certain point.\nAll engagements play out almost exactly the same and get exceptionally boring.\nThere's a complete lack of bullet penetration, shooting at an enemy behind plywood or a plastic traffic pylon results in absolutely nothing.\nI can recall years ago when this game was coming out a trailer touting that "this game will be different" and something close to "we won't have you killing hordes of enemies, we want to avoid kill-fatigue in games like Call of Duty where you just kill people on automatic and don't even think about it after a certain point". It was a blatant lie, I'd be hard pressed to point out a game with more generic enemies packed into small areas than this one.\n\nAt the end of the day I've played worse, but not many.\nIf you want a game wherein America is the one getting invaded and you don't mind an RTS I'd highly suggest World in Conflict as a viable and fun alternative.

Homefront exceeded every expectation I had and then some. So glad I bought it on a whim when it randomly went on sale.\n\nThis is the game I can imagine would be born if Half-Life 2 and Spec Ops: The Line had a baby together. If you've played both of those and then you play this I think you'll instantly be able to tell why.\n\nMechanically, it's pretty much the same as every other shooter. The guns and enemies are pretty standard. The guns themselves have a lot of variety but most of the rifles feel so similar that it doesn't really matter. I found myself choosing which to use more based on which scope was attached than any other attribute. The enemies could have used some more variety and better AI, but in the end the game didn't hinge on either of these things.\n\nWhat matters is the story and the world they created. It's a distopian future where you sometimes fight alongside a squad of NPCs and a robot companion against a foreign occupying force (that's the Half-Life 2 part). But they did such a good job presenting this world I'm in awe. There are tiny touches everywhere: things happening in the background, banter that's easy to miss, all these really human moments that make the game come alive. Because of that it felt a lot like The Last of Us during the early levels.\n\nStylistically it's a bit dated even for 2011 game - honestly it looks a lot like Half-Life 2. The models and textures have a pretty flat look to them, and none of the shininess that a lot of games from the era seem to have everywhere. The lighting and depth of field effects are amazing at points though, even if the game were made today. They're subtle but effective. The backgrounds are often pure works of art.\n\nThe sound system is crisp and includes great voice acting. The score is epic and memorable and features some hilarious yet appropriate tracks from real life bands.\n\nOverall I loved playing through it twice (once on the highest difficulty and once for collectibles and achievements). I only wish that there were bots for the multiplayer so that I could try it out, as there are literally zero people online nowadays.\n\nI'm psyched that there's a sequel in development. Seriously can't wait to get back into this world.

Good thing too as the campaign was probably only 3-4 hours long. I guess if you're still stuck in the 00's and enjoy a good direct2DVD or Mockbuster experience then this is your game. Honestly I felt like I could play Modern Warfare 2 and have a more polished experience.\n\nOne story, breaching a garage I headshotted every dude inside except two standing by a wall full of explosive barrels. Guess what, even when you flank around them and shoot them the barrels explode. A lot of it was like 'The Best of: FPS scenes' and felt incredibly corperate and marketable. The only comment I had afterwards was how triple A gaming needs to die, like now.\n\nMultiplayer was pretty good though, but since it's so long after release at this point it's just a bunch of guys who got too good and are now circle jerking in their clan servers. Not a bad thing but I don't have the kind of time investment to join up at their skill level.","February 19, 2015","false","3.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I think that Kaos put the focus on multi-player and it shows in a brilliant execution.The maps offer something different on every change up, which will entice you to want to change weapon classes as the scenery changes. i.e shotgun in the supermarket aisles or sitting on top of the hoover damn with a sniper rifle. The battlepoint system is a great switch from the popular "killstreak system" and offers even mediocre players a chance to take out the big vehicles and airstrikes etc at least once a match if they save the points. The drones add a totally new dimension to the standard FPS format (having to watch the skies as well as the horizon), and the overall feel to game play is absolutely unique .The weapon balancing is perfect (not on all servers) and the vehicle physhics are well done. (again not on all servers weapon balance and expert vehicle control are admin options) Overall this is the best military FPS I've played yet.","September 5, 2011","true","48.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

I do agree that the story was a bit too short at only about five hours long. I still enjoyed the story based on its premise. With the USA being so high and mighty recently it is nice to see it being a hollow broken shell of itself. The look and feel of the game's atmosphere was very Red Dawn (the original 1980s movie) to me. Most of the characters where one dimensional and shallow but they do their jobs well. The game play is well complaint and works but parts of the game are very hand holding and scripted.  With a sequel on the horizon it will be interesting to see what happens with this well thought out but not quite well executed world.","February 10, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

People say campaign too short or not as good as Modern Warfare game.  I don't see problem.  The game has good direction as you move through occupied America watching Korean kick ♥♥♥ before big battle on red bridge.\n\nAs well as killing many Korean I also like that you can do some parts where you also kill Americans.  Without this I would not like game as much.  Campaign not hard but good to see story and horror of war, such as Americans thrown into ditch.  Maybe a new Homefront could be made where Jalalabad control America.  This would be true epic and big seller in my country.  More so that pirated copies of Windows XP.\n\nMultiplayer is really really good.  You run, kill, die, respawn... over and over repeat process.  More kills and objective points give you bonuses like unlock vehicles and air strike.  Within few minutes of game you see people bring chopper and tank.  No spawn killing as spawn keep moving away from enemy.\n\nAnother thing about online that make me hard is knifing.  You can spam knife running through building to make new Kill Bill 3 movie.  Watching bodies pile up then dropping payload on reinforcements is better than stale bread.  Once I do cartwheel after getting 10 kill streak with knife only.

This game is much more personal than many other FPS' out there. It's got the best opening to a game I have seen since Resident Evil 2. You should Google it if you'd like to see what I mean, it won't spoil anything at all. There is just something great about a resistance, underdog type fight instead of the world's greatest military in other games. Although the campaign is short there are tons of hidden newspapers that are interesting to read and if you're into the story adds a lot building up to the events in the game. They're a lot of fun to read but you they aren't stored anywhere to read later so if you want to read them you have to do it then and there. To be honest I didn't get that drawn in to the world to read the newspaper however I always have to read documents.

Reason? (TL;DR at bottom, also ignore time played steam didn't even record down anything)\n\nWell to put it frankly the single player is boring, like really boring. It's your normal mordern FPS on the rail shooter. The game is slowed down by how many time you have to stop and wait for your NPC teammates to come and help you kick down a door.\n\nIf you're not American the game becomes really really stale listening to American patrioism over and over again in the cutscene and how "we" must free ourselves how america is great and so on. It gets boring, and yes we know war is bad, the enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and so on and so forth.\n\nBUT what really prompted me to write this review was how bad the gameplay was, in the starting it was smooth and quite alright. Then you see these heavily armour enemies go down in a few shots (First bad point) I mean ok fine throw more guys at me.\n\nThen you have your "Allies" being not very helpful, pushing you out of cover shooting you if you ever walk to the left a bit, listening to them repeat the same 3 sentences again and again when there's nothing you can do but slowly clear them while they're being obstructive (Second bad point, if you didn't know).\n\nThe thing that got to me most was not the very linear gameplay, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, or how most of the enemy AI is weak AF. What got to me was (WARNING A LITTLE SPOILER) one part of the game where you fight this lightly equppied enemies, they wear tee shirts and baggy pants with NO armour whatsoever, and you take half your magazine to kill one.... HEAVILY ARMOURED TROOPS go down in 3-6 bullets but UNARMOURED THUGS go down after you're almost out of rounds. YAY LOGIC.\n\nAnd that was the final straw for me, i'm still gonna complete it though (Last mission after all) but i really can't in good conscience recommend this garbage to anyone.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGameplay is bland, AI is ♥♥♥♥, Story makes me want to kill myself, Voice acting is bad, and people are giving this a good review because MURICA","June 4, 2015","false","0.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Sometimes it felt like a shooting gallery game, but it is pretty gorgeous looking and the settings are excellent. Be warned that it is also rather graphic at times - mass graves, families being killed and other horrors of war. The game doesn't pull its punches. No save on demand is annoying, but I'm getting used to the trend and there are enough checkpoints that it's not too annoying except that sometimes the game will change weapons on you when you die. Map design is fairly linear, but the avenues are wide enough to approach situations from various angles and your NPCs will back you up along the way. You may be annoyed occasionally when stuff that it looks like you should be able to climb/jump onto is ... not. That said, these really are minor shortcomings and they should not discourage you from this otherwise excellent FPS war game. I really enjoyed it and it captured my attention enough that I played it to the exclusion of other games until completed. There's definitely potential for a great FPS series here.","February 22, 2015","true","19.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The mechanics are okay at best, they're essentially the same as Call of Duty but there's a few gimmicks that hardly last more than one mission before the devs said "Oh, well that's enough actual fun for this game." Secondly, the story is pretty decent, it's an interesting concept but it's way too short. 3 hours of gameplay is hardly worth it but people still insist about the multiplayer aspect. I really didn't buy this game with the intention of playing it online because I wanted to experience the story, not listen to the 12 year old fanbase complain about everything. Lastly, The characters are flat, they're boring and they don't have any sort of depth to them. In fact, their interaction with each other is laughable. It's rigid and lifeless, and the npcs just look like they're bored with being in such a bad game. Basically the same people are working on the sequel so clearly they're going to be making a mediocre sequel.

If you are a fan of Red Dawn than you will be extremely dissapointed as this game has a pretty decent premise but terrible execution. The story is terrible with shallow characters that will leave you with no emotional attatchment at all. Homefront tries to be a serious game but it ultimately fails . Even in its most "emotional" moments you really wont feel sorry for anyone. The graphics are extremely dated. Textures look terrible especially on bigger levels and the same 4 North Korean enemies are recycled throughout the game. Your allies also look extremely bad and are usually blank faced or have some ridiculous stare that was meant to show the intensity of the battle but ends up just making the player laugh. The guns are also pretty bad looking and their sounds are god awful. The voice acting is sub par as well. One of the bigger faults of this game is that it is extremely boring. The game basically boils down to killing a mass of enemies before going and pushing a switch or blowing something up. After the task is complete you run around for a bit more and to it again. Homefront is also extremely easy. The game offers no challenge on medium difficulty. I died about 3-4 times during my run of the whole campaign and that was only because I tried to "rambo" it a couple of times. The only ridiculous mechanic that offers even the slightest challenge is the fact that enemies are ♥♥♥♥ing sharpshooters that can hit you from across the map when they see just a sliver of your shoulder. But even with this just proning behind cover every once in a while will do the trick. This game is also extremely short. I finished the 7 chapters of the campaign in a mere 3.4 hours. That is ridiculous and should not be acceptable by any means even if the game has a good story.  Those 3,4 hours were extremel tedious and painfull. By the end of the game you are just relieved that the nightmare is almost over then Homefront decides to give you one last ♥♥♥♥♥slap across the face by sequel baiting and leaving a cliffhanger. ♥♥♥♥ off at least we deserved a proper ending but nooooo. Dont go near this ♥♥♥♥ing awful game.\n\nTLDR: Everything about homefront is terrible and you would get more enjoyment out of a cup of coffee than this game. Its not worth $19.99 and its not even worth $4.99 when its on sale. Dont touch it. Forget about it. Burn it with fire.

You are some indiscriminate character drafted into the resistance, after some event happens. I honestly don't remember what it was, as it was that forgetable. And seriously, the North Koreans as an enemy? Could they not find a smaller army?\n\nHomefront suffers from horrible AI, both enemy and friendly. Enemies will stand out in the open, laying down massive and accurate rounds of fire on you. Fire one shot, and they all train their sights on you instantly. Friendlies will get in the way at every single chance. Also, you are forced to be the last person through any entry point. Meaning; have to climb up a ladder? Have fun watching your three squad mates climb up it frirst before you get a prompt to climb. Wanna crawl under that fence? Nope, have to wait till everyone goes before you.\n\nNone of the characters are memorable, including the one you play. In fact, there were plenty of times where commands were issued and I had to question if I was the one being commanded to do them.\n\nThe story is disjointed at best. A game about the occupation of the US? Cool, I'm in, but this was poorly done and felt rushed. Great potential with the idea, making US citizens insurgents, but more time could have been spent fleshing it out. After 4.5 hours I had the game beat, and that was after I died, a lot.\n\nSpeaking of which, the ending, talk about the most lack luster ending ever. Granted I didn't stay past the first couple of credits (I exited quickly to write this review) but there was no gratification, no bad guy to defeat, no nemisis to duel. Just a quick battle for a landmark and roll credits. This could have easily been a trilogy if the time was taken to create a proper story.\n\nAt 75% off it's still not worth it. Although I should note that I have not played the multiplayer (And won't) so I can't comment on its value there.\n\nThis is a great idea for a game, but horribly executed, painfully short and terribly forgetable.","December 28, 2015","false","4.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

The story is alright. But has quite a few plotholes in it. The first couple minutes though, really shows you some of the depressing things in the world of Homefront and they are actually pretty well done.\n\nThe enemy AI is alright but your teammate AI is honestly pretty bad at least from my experience. Graphics are gritty looking and ugly, but the gun models, people other than important characters and dead bodies are weirdly good looking compared to the rest of the game. Especially the guns, seriously, they look REALLY good. Non of the characters are really all that likable and you play as a silent character (Which is a gripe that some people have with certain games. I for one don't mind silent characters if they are properly done, however, in Homefront it adds plotholes. Looking through iron sights is a toggle rather than a hold (You can't change it in settings). There are A LOT of invisible walls. This game is extremely linear. There are invisible walls in places where you would think it makes sense to go. When you're in calm areas where you can interact with people you move at a snails pace. Like, REALLY slow. For the most part the game is boring but it kinda ramps up when you're halfway through the campaign, especially with the last level which in my opinion is the best part of the campaign. When you're in areas with team AI, you have to wait for them to reach the end of the level for you to proceed to another area (It's probably a way that the devs made to load the next level). Also it's really easy for you to die, at least for me (Difficulty is a preference but even on easy the enemy AI were pretty unforgiving).\n\nOh and the campaign is 4 hours long. Shorter, depending on how you play (I died a lot).\n\nOverall, I don't recommend this game. There are too many cons with this game and not enough pros. I thought almost the entire game was really boring other than the last hour or so. If you want to dive into the world of Homefront you might as well wait for the sequel, Homefront: The Revolution which is an open world game that fixes all the problems I have it this game. But if you want to, get this game when it's on sale.","November 16, 2014","false","3.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Koreans invading not only USA but many other countries? C'mon!\n-Campaign playtime is VERY short (3-5 hours top, depending of difficulty level)\n-Scripted like hell. Lots of enemies running at you until you kill that specific RPG soldier so they stop spawning!\n-Lots of "invisible walls"... and door blocking lockers until lifted up by NPC.\n-Your running speed is like my grandpa walking speed.\n-Collectibles are annoying to search as your prompted from NPC's to carry on and move on to next objective.\n\nOVERALL:\nThat is about all that come's to mind for now and if you are slightly interested in Homefront, buy it only at a decent deal. Besides, there are plenty of wargames alternatives.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nI only recommend this game for wargames purists, that always want some more wargame and can't seem to fill their shooting needs.\n\nRATING:\n5.0 / 10","January 20, 2013","false","4.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourtipoftheday/recommended/55100/","yourtipoftheday","MadeUnderground","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourtipoftheday/","127 products in account","Wow. Where do I start with this one?\n\nAfter reading some of the other positive reviews it seems that most people enjoy this game for its multiplayer. I am not really that into multiplayer games and even if I wanted to play multiplayer on this game I doubt there would be very many open servers (I could be wrong).\n\nThat aside my review is based solely on the single player campaign and it is for those of you who are considering getting this game for the campaign.\nIt's not worth it. It's not worth 19.99. Luckily I was able to get my copy from Amazon which was much cheaper but if you were to purchase this on steam I would wait for a sale.\nThe combat is okay, nothing special, typical FPS really. The enemies and allies alike make the same sounds when being shot, the guy Connor barks at you constantly as if his testicles have been punched into his stomach, and the game gets a little buggy when the NPC's are waiting/expecting you to follow them - when in fact I would be in front of them. Also barking orders after I've already done what they told me to do, just simple sort of bugs like that.\n\nThe story.. er.. plot, there isn't really much of one. Which is disappointing because I applaud this FPS unique choice to have a guerilla warfare shooter take place in the USA, but they really dropped the ball with this one. I couldn't care less about any of the characters, in fact I wanted Connor to die. He annoyed the crap out of me.\nThe story/plot felt so mediocre that they even managed to fulfill the stereotypical Asian engineer/computer technical guy and the black guy that dies halfway through the game. Shocker.\n\nNah, I'm kind of kidding about that part, I mean yeah, I noticed it was kind of a stereotypical thing but that's not really a big deal to me. It's just it was the cherry on top of an already lackluster sundae.\n\nIn a few months I'll probably not even remember a single thing about this game because none of it was memorable. I should have listened to the reviews that said not to get the game if you were just interested in the campaign. Well, reviewers that said that - You were right.\nAlso the game is kind of short. I know that 8-12 hours is a standard length for a FPS, but I played the game on hard and beat it within 5ish hours. (The almost 10 hours thats recorded on Steam was because I left for several hours with the game paused a couple of times).\nIf I played the game on easy or normal, I'd imagine one could finish this within 4 or less easily.\n\nAnyway guys, I don't recommend getting this game. It's not worth the price they are asking for it. It would be worth a consider if they were asking maybe 4.99-7.99, but definitely not 19.99","July 19, 2015","false","9.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apostkhan/recommended/55100/","apostkhan","Apost Khan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apostkhan/","1281 products in account","This game felt unfinished. For starters, the campaign is all of 3 hours long. And a large chunk of that 3 hours is you twiddling your thumbs waiting for the next highly scripted segment of gameplay to trigger because you as the player can't do much of anything alone. Despite supposedly being an important key figure in the rebellion (which never gets explained, not that much does), you are led by the hand the entire time and trusted to do nothing on your own. You are treated like an incompetent child. You have zero player agency. You can't even climb a ladder until the game gives you a button prompt. The game literally thinks that you are too stupid to perform even the most basic functions without instruction. I don't mind linear games, but this game is so linear that it makes the Call Of Duty franchise look like a series of expansive open world games with great player freedom. The game also suffers from horrific collision detection problems as well as physX issues, leading to many silly deaths and flat out broken sections of gameplay. The story also makes no sense, has terrible pacing, as you would expect from a 3 hour campaign, and is tonally all over the place. It has it's moments of fun, it isn't all bad, but the good moments are rare and aren’t nearly good enough to compensate for how dull and infuriating the experience is for the other 75% of the time. In all honesty, I wouldn't recommend this game at any price.\n\nHere is my full in-depth review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hHzJm1gfPI","February 13","false","4.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The story wants to be as poignant as Spec Ops: The Line. The gameplay wants to be as solid as the Call of Duty series. The visuals want to be like Battlefield 3. Unfortunately, all of those aspects fall incredible short of their ideals.\n\nThe voice acting is surprisingly strong, but it completely undermined by the utterly dumb AI. Friendly NPCs block you from cover, exposing you to enemy fire. Enemies are very predictable. Difficulty is only ramped up by adding more enemies to the screen. There are a few shining moments of cinematic brilliance, like when you are first escorted as a prisoner through a typical American suburb taken over by the brutal Korean forces, but all of that great storytelling is destroyed by blocky NPC models and outdated textures.\n\nI can't speak for the multiplayer as I only played the single-player.\n\nI give this game a 4/10. It's not worth the $20 price tag, but if you pick it up from a Humble Bundle or on sale, it might be worth the measly ~4 hours it takes to complete the single-player campaign.\n\nPros:\nSuperb Voice Acting\nGreat Cinematic Moments and Storytelling\n\nCons:\nOutdated Graphics\nClunky Gameplay\nFrustrating NPCs\nDumb Enemies\n","October 28, 2014","false","4.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You don't need to worry about that though, since if it's not exactly what the game just told you to do, it's not going to allow you to do it.

It took me five hours to complete the game and I tend to take my time.  Not that you really get a chance to do that in this game.  It is basically non-stop action while it lasts.  If you like that you will like the game.  The story and characters do not leave any impression.  Just there to move the action along.\n\nOverall, I would say do not buy unless you get it for a couple bucks or in a bundle for cheap.  The game is short.  There is zero replay value.  It is on rails which is slightly noticable in say COD but very noticible in this title.  There are a bunch of irratating things I would blame on poor programming.  Such as getting entangled with your AI support, not moving because their is some object you can not see but is seemingly too high for you to walk over, AI enemies fire and explosions affecting  only you, etc.  At one point I was waiting for my AI team to open a door so we could move forward but we were stuck for some reason.  I spent a few minutes running around trying to see if there was something needed that I missed.  It turns out, the AI engineer guy was stuck on something outside and I had to walk into him a few times to free him and then he joined us at the door inside and we moved forward.\n\nSo, not the worst but no where near the best.","February 26","false","5.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

Everything about this game had the makings to compete with the COD series, but it continually fell just short or was consistent throughout the game. A great example of that consistency is the story. When the story first starts and it hits the fan, the story is powerful and driving you on. You feel compelled to take back your country. That get's lost not even half-way through and then you are left doing the standard shoot-em-up gig which leaves a very hollow feeling after having seen what should have been.\n\nThe game really isn't bad, and is definitely worth a few bucks if on sale, but I cannot honestly recommend this game with so many other and better qualified games out there.","February 17, 2015","false","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But if you, like me, just like to experience a good single player campaign, don't bother. Even if you are a John Milius fan (this is not the expected "Call of Duty meets Red Dawn").\n\nOn the pro side (which is more of a "not completely distgusting" side) you get some distinctive characters (well, you'll be able to distinguish between the philosophical positions of Rianna and Connor. And you'll recognize Hopper because he's the Korean kid. Let's not overdo it with character depth), you get a "Go Wolverines" banner, the story is kinda sorta engaging, the 4 hours needed to complete it are kinda sorta acceptable and the cliffhanger ending qualifies as "it was probably pretty cool when Milius described it to the designers".\n\nWhat really kills it is the implementation in the game: The flow is generally interrupted by barriers of the invisible (ah, okay, I am not supposed to go explore a bit, yes?) and visible kind (it is annoying to see the NPCs hurdle them and not being able to oneself), the events are badly timed (ah, to get rid of the enemy Goliath, I need to press this button exactly now?) and the mix of required interaction and watching pre-scripted scenes is badly balanced. All of that ruins the immersion feeling.\n\nSo: No reason to play this for single player fans. Go watch any version of Red Dawn instead, at least these movies won't bother you with bad interaction design. And while you are at it, check out Tomorrow When The War Began.\n\nP.S.: Does anyone know what Primary Weapons System paid to get their Diablo into that game? I like long-stroke piston guns like the next guy, but seeing this rather obscure thing as a standard weapon in the game was kinda distracting.","January 13, 2015","false","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/h0lyheretic/recommended/55100/","h0lyheretic","HolyHeretic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/h0lyheretic/","209 products in account","tl;dr: A bunch of great ideas with poor execution: the game. This game isn't really worth the $20 asking price. Campaign is three hours long on a good day, and the mulitplayer is a bland, unpopulated experience. For the same price you can buy battlefield 3 or 4 on Origin, which outclass this game in just about every aspect. Don't waste your time here.\n\nWhat it does right: I was hyped as hell when this first showed up, and the amount of advertisement and weird ♥♥♥♥ they did at E3 that year really made me want to buy it. The setting is a great idea. I wish more shooters would stray away from the modern military shooter that we're so used to by now and do things like this. However, when the reviews started coming out I'd figure I'd try it once it dropped in price... four years later.\n\nThe mechanics work, I guess. It's nothing special, other than maybe getting to use the Goliath to shoot rockets at enemies that are giving you a hard time. None of the guns feel bad to use, and they have a good amount of punch on enemies, but at the same time they do feel kinda flimsy. For a shooter that came out in 2011, it works. It's nothing special but it's not like the mechanics of the game are terrible.\n\nA few of the set pieces were pretty cool, but those were a mix between laughable and alright. None of it felt particularly epic, but again, it served its purpose.\n\nWhat it does wrong: Oh boy where to start. I guess we can start with the singleplayer. It's overly linear. I don't mean the good kind of linear like Metro 2033 or Killzone. I mean straight out of call of duty corridoor nose-leading. If you go in any direction other than which one the game wants you to go, you'll run face first into an invisible wall. It doesn't matter if you just passed through that open door ten seconds ago, you go one way and one way only. And you can tell the designating fighting zones from the talking corridors by the random stacks of chest-high cover littered around. It's painfully obvious that this game doesn't really want you to go out on your own or do anything other than move from cover to cover shooting bad guys. There is no variety to any of it.\n\nThe graphics also haven't aged well. I don't think they were even that great at the time. I think Half Life 2 looks better and it came out seven years before. The color scheme is bland and uninteresting, and you can't interact with anything other than picking up guns. Even your teammates have to open doors for you like this was a ps2 ww2 shooter.\n\nThe campaign is, in its entirety, maybe three hours long if you stop to look at the scenery once in a while. I beat it in two and a half. It isn't even a good three hours either. I was actually kinda thankful it wasn't longer, otherwise I might not have gotten through it. None of your npc companions are even remotely interesting and they don't bother to characterize any of them beyond very basic traits. You have no reason to be invested in any of it, as they just sling you into the action three minutes into it with barely any explanation. This doesn't change the further you get into it, either. Only after following these rebels for an hour and a half or so do they finally tell me in the form of an off-hand comment that they needed me to fly a helicopter for them. You think they would have taken the time to brief the pilot on that important detail, or at least asked if he could fly a helicopter and wasn't just a jet pilot or something.\n\nThe most motivation you get is the objective marker. No overall reason behind it, or important motive, just follow the arrow. Sure, I want to liberate the home of the free just as much as anyone, but blindly following the first couple of idiots that almost kill me in a car crash doesn't seem like it's the most solid of motivations.\n\nAnd another thing, I'm getting really tired of silent protagonists. It worked in games like Dead Space because Isaac was completely alone, and didn't need to talk to anyone most of the time, but here? There are usually three other people that need to be interacted with in combat situations. Games like Far Cry 3 and Spec Ops: The Line have completely destroyed the notion that video game protagonists are better silent. I have no interest in Jacobs like I did Jason. Being invested in your character as a person goes a long way into being better invested in the game overall. This game did nothing towards this and ended up being bland and forgettable.\n\nOne last little rant before I get to the multiplayer: North Korea? Really? The only reason anyone ever gives them any respect is because they're allies with China. Never would a tiny, economically weak nation like North Korea ever be able to hold as much land as we are led to believe, or be able to invade and occupy the nation with the world's strongest military, even while under economic collapse.  The logistics of such things are simply impossible for North Korea, even if they did have the military size they say they do, which is most likely a lie. As much as I give battlefield 4's singleplayer ♥♥♥♥, it at least had a believable scenario. Plus North Korean soldiers using Colt, Bushmaster, and Kriss USA firearms (All American-based firearm companies if you didn't know)? Did they even bother to do any research into this matter?\n\nNow for the Multiplayer: They tried to add some unique features like battlepoints to build up like killstreaks, using this money to spawn into vehicles and use special weapons. I like this better than cod's killstreak system, since it allows you to buy things even if you're not doing that well, but I still don't like it that much. First, just about every class gets a rocket launcher, and you can buy it after one kill. This is not good game design. Vehicles are pretty much useless beyond a quick kill or two if you find a group of enemies that knows what they're doing. Vehicles are pretty much instant kills on infantry too, so that's annoying, and you can't even use environmental ques to tell where they are like you might in battlefield, where you might hear it coming or see it firing on the minimap. I think it did show up on the minimap, but I never saw it before one killed me.\n\nIt's got the standard setup for multiplayer unlocking systems. Get kills and unlock guns. I didn't play enough to unlock anything, but I never felt like using anything other than the first class was really necessary. I didn't see much variety in the enemies either, but then again the killcam gives you absolutely no information other than where the person who killed you was at. Since just about every class gets a rocket launcher, and sniping is pretty pointless on smaller maps imo, there didn't seem to be much variety to be had. I played a few games and there wasn't much exciting going on. The maps are too big for there to be large chunks of action, and I doubt that's ever going to change with the player counts as they are. Other games do everything so much better.\n\nOverall, this game is nothing but all of the stereotypical elements of first person shooters from 2011. It seems like a lazy attempt to pull away customers from cod's fanbase, and even then, it doesn't do anything better than call of duty, it just imitates it in a different setting. If this game had come out on the ps2 seven years before, then I think it might have been a lot better received. As it is now, that's kinda what it feels like: a generic ww2 shooter from the ps2 made for a later generation. There's nothing special about it other than its setting. The multiplayer is bland, the singleplayer is forgettable, and the entire thing is nothing but a cynical attempt at checkboxing fps elements to try to bring in the cod crowd.\n\nIf you read this far and are still thinking about buying the game, please don't.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/h0lyheretic/recommended/55100/","h0lyheretic","HolyHeretic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/h0lyheretic/","209 products in account","tl;dr: A bunch of great ideas with poor execution: the game. This game isn't really worth the $20 asking price. Campaign is three hours long on a good day, and the mulitplayer is a bland, unpopulated experience. For the same price you can buy battlefield 3 or 4 on Origin, which outclass this game in just about every aspect. Don't waste your time here.\n\nWhat it does right: I was hyped as hell when this first showed up, and the amount of advertisement and weird ♥♥♥♥ they did at E3 that year really made me want to buy it. The setting is a great idea. I wish more shooters would stray away from the modern military shooter that we're so used to by now and do things like this. However, when the reviews started coming out I'd figure I'd try it once it dropped in price... four years later.\n\nThe mechanics work, I guess. It's nothing special, other than maybe getting to use the Goliath to shoot rockets at enemies that are giving you a hard time. None of the guns feel bad to use, and they have a good amount of punch on enemies, but at the same time they do feel kinda flimsy. For a shooter that came out in 2011, it works. It's nothing special but it's not like the mechanics of the game are terrible.\n\nA few of the set pieces were pretty cool, but those were a mix between laughable and alright. None of it felt particularly epic, but again, it served its purpose.\n\nWhat it does wrong: Oh boy where to start. I guess we can start with the singleplayer. It's overly linear. I don't mean the good kind of linear like Metro 2033 or Killzone. I mean straight out of call of duty corridoor nose-leading. If you go in any direction other than which one the game wants you to go, you'll run face first into an invisible wall. It doesn't matter if you just passed through that open door ten seconds ago, you go one way and one way only. And you can tell the designating fighting zones from the talking corridors by the random stacks of chest-high cover littered around. It's painfully obvious that this game doesn't really want you to go out on your own or do anything other than move from cover to cover shooting bad guys. There is no variety to any of it.\n\nThe graphics also haven't aged well. I don't think they were even that great at the time. I think Half Life 2 looks better and it came out seven years before. The color scheme is bland and uninteresting, and you can't interact with anything other than picking up guns. Even your teammates have to open doors for you like this was a ps2 ww2 shooter.\n\nThe campaign is, in its entirety, maybe three hours long if you stop to look at the scenery once in a while. I beat it in two and a half. It isn't even a good three hours either. I was actually kinda thankful it wasn't longer, otherwise I might not have gotten through it. None of your npc companions are even remotely interesting and they don't bother to characterize any of them beyond very basic traits. You have no reason to be invested in any of it, as they just sling you into the action three minutes into it with barely any explanation. This doesn't change the further you get into it, either. Only after following these rebels for an hour and a half or so do they finally tell me in the form of an off-hand comment that they needed me to fly a helicopter for them. You think they would have taken the time to brief the pilot on that important detail, or at least asked if he could fly a helicopter and wasn't just a jet pilot or something.\n\nThe most motivation you get is the objective marker. No overall reason behind it, or important motive, just follow the arrow. Sure, I want to liberate the home of the free just as much as anyone, but blindly following the first couple of idiots that almost kill me in a car crash doesn't seem like it's the most solid of motivations.\n\nAnd another thing, I'm getting really tired of silent protagonists. It worked in games like Dead Space because Isaac was completely alone, and didn't need to talk to anyone most of the time, but here? There are usually three other people that need to be interacted with in combat situations. Games like Far Cry 3 and Spec Ops: The Line have completely destroyed the notion that video game protagonists are better silent. I have no interest in Jacobs like I did Jason. Being invested in your character as a person goes a long way into being better invested in the game overall. This game did nothing towards this and ended up being bland and forgettable.\n\nOne last little rant before I get to the multiplayer: North Korea? Really? The only reason anyone ever gives them any respect is because they're allies with China. Never would a tiny, economically weak nation like North Korea ever be able to hold as much land as we are led to believe, or be able to invade and occupy the nation with the world's strongest military, even while under economic collapse.  The logistics of such things are simply impossible for North Korea, even if they did have the military size they say they do, which is most likely a lie. As much as I give battlefield 4's singleplayer ♥♥♥♥, it at least had a believable scenario. Plus North Korean soldiers using Colt, Bushmaster, and Kriss USA firearms (All American-based firearm companies if you didn't know)? Did they even bother to do any research into this matter?\n\nNow for the Multiplayer: They tried to add some unique features like battlepoints to build up like killstreaks, using this money to spawn into vehicles and use special weapons. I like this better than cod's killstreak system, since it allows you to buy things even if you're not doing that well, but I still don't like it that much. First, just about every class gets a rocket launcher, and you can buy it after one kill. This is not good game design. Vehicles are pretty much useless beyond a quick kill or two if you find a group of enemies that knows what they're doing. Vehicles are pretty much instant kills on infantry too, so that's annoying, and you can't even use environmental ques to tell where they are like you might in battlefield, where you might hear it coming or see it firing on the minimap. I think it did show up on the minimap, but I never saw it before one killed me.\n\nIt's got the standard setup for multiplayer unlocking systems. Get kills and unlock guns. I didn't play enough to unlock anything, but I never felt like using anything other than the first class was really necessary. I didn't see much variety in the enemies either, but then again the killcam gives you absolutely no information other than where the person who killed you was at. Since just about every class gets a rocket launcher, and sniping is pretty pointless on smaller maps imo, there didn't seem to be much variety to be had. I played a few games and there wasn't much exciting going on. The maps are too big for there to be large chunks of action, and I doubt that's ever going to change with the player counts as they are. Other games do everything so much better.\n\nOverall, this game is nothing but all of the stereotypical elements of first person shooters from 2011. It seems like a lazy attempt to pull away customers from cod's fanbase, and even then, it doesn't do anything better than call of duty, it just imitates it in a different setting. If this game had come out on the ps2 seven years before, then I think it might have been a lot better received. As it is now, that's kinda what it feels like: a generic ww2 shooter from the ps2 made for a later generation. There's nothing special about it other than its setting. The multiplayer is bland, the singleplayer is forgettable, and the entire thing is nothing but a cynical attempt at checkboxing fps elements to try to bring in the cod crowd.\n\nIf you read this far and are still thinking about buying the game, please don't. I can not in good conscience recommend this game to anyone when battlefield 4, an infinitely better experience, is the exact same price. Buy that game for a much better fps experience.","April 10, 2015","false","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

But if you, like me, just like to experience a good single player campaign, don't bother. Even if you are a John Milius fan (this is not the expected "Call of Duty meets Red Dawn").\n\nOn the pro side (which is more of a "not completely distgusting" side) you get some distinctive characters (well, you'll be able to distinguish between the philosophical positions of Rianna and Connor. And you'll recognize Hopper because he's the Korean kid. Let's not overdo it with character depth), you get a "Go Wolverines" banner, the story is kinda sorta engaging, the 4 hours needed to complete it are kinda sorta acceptable and the cliffhanger ending qualifies as "it was probably pretty cool when Milius described it to the designers".\n\nWhat really kills it is the implementation in the game: The flow is generally interrupted by barriers of the invisible (ah, okay, I am not supposed to go explore a bit, yes?) and visible kind (it is annoying to see the NPCs hurdle them and not being able to oneself), the events are badly timed (ah, to get rid of the enemy Goliath, I need to press this button exactly now?) and the mix of required interaction and watching pre-scripted scenes is badly balanced. All of that ruins the immersion feeling.\n\nSo: No reason to play this for single player fans. Go watch any version of Red Dawn instead, at least these movies won't bother you with bad interaction design. And while you are at it, check out Tomorrow When The War Began.\n\nP.S.: Does anyone know what Primary Weapons System paid to get their Diablo into that game? I like long-stroke piston guns like the next guy, but seeing this rather obscure thing as a standard weapon in the game was kinda distracting.","January 13, 2015","false","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But, again, I wouldn't pay just shy of $20 for it.  As for why, read on.\n\nThe graphics are...eh, fine.  I'm not really a graphics snob, so that's not a big deal to me.  They ran fine at max settings on my 6-year-old computer, which makes sense, considering the game came out...5 years ago.  The visuals themseles aren't up to snuff for a AAA title, but then I don't think this game could claim to be a AAA title.\n\nGameplay attempts to be similar to your basic Call of Duty game, with you as one of 4-5 resistance fighters in a United States under occupation by North Korea.  The game tries to make this ludicrous scenario seem reasonably plausible.  It doesn't really matter who they are, though.  They're the bad guys who've taken over the good ol' US of A, and it's up to you to shoot them in the face and do...pretty much everything else.  Your character, I think, is named Jackson or something, but he might as well be Ramirez from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.  ("Ramirez!  Do [task]!")\n\nMovement is kind of clunky, and the gunplay isn't all that satisfying.  Sound design for the guns is passable, but they tend to have this sort of "clanky" quality to them.  There's probably, like, 10 different common firearms you can pick up, with 2-3 rocket launchers and such, but they all felt mostly the same to me.\n\nThere are some missions where you control this or that vehicle or assign this or that target to some mobile bringer-of-death (e.g. calling in a fire mission), but the bulk of the game is what you'd expect it to be: you running around shooting dudes.\n\nVoice acting is nothing special, and you don't end up really caring about the characters.  No surprise there.\n\nThere aren't any real cutscenes to speak of, other than the occasional mission interlude where your characters talk a bit before you can equip your gun and shoot stuff.  You get loading screens with the "Voice of America" providing a bit of context for the next mission.\n\nBasically, if you want to play "Red Dawn: The Game" this is about as close as you'll get.  And for that, it's kinda fun, but it's not particularly polished.","January 7","false","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ive tried playing this but it dosent run very well on my system for some reason. i easily have enough spec on my pc to play this game but no matter even if i put every detail down to low quality i still only max out at 30 fps. it runs no better on very low options than at high quality. Im getting killed far too many times because of the crazy lag trying to play it. its really frustrating in the middle of a chapter having to go back to the main menu several times trying options to get it to run smoother. ive tried replaying every chapter a few times but its running no better!\nIts a shame because the actual game would not be that bad, not a classic but definitley would not be bad.  its a far fetched story but entertaining enough. As graphics go its quite very good in my opinion, very athmospheric at dusk running through abandoned destroyed american towns and seeing the snow capped rockies in the distant. Gun play would be ok too only im struggling because of the low fps going from 30 fps one minute to 10 fps the next.\nIts also far too linear and sometimes your teammates get in your way and you cannot move leaving a north korean to pump you with bullets.\nGood points.\nGraphics\nEntertaining enough story\n\nBad Points.\nruns poorly on my system\nStory far too short\ntoo linear\nPure awkward to move sometimes, teammates getting in way, clumsy.\n\nAll in All i couldnt really recommend this game, because it just wont run for me. I have Battlefield 4, which is a game that demands far more on a system than homefront and it still runs better for me!\n","January 22","false","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is kinda an odd game to speak, I mean it's not a very good game but nor is it bad. Originally as many recall this game was developed by THQ before they went bankrupt, after which they sold the rights to the developers of Crysis and the game was back on steam (after the companus bankrupcy it was removed from steam for some odd reason)\n\nSo, Homefront takes place in the far future where the leader of North Korea is dead, his son took over and somehow managed to unify the North and South Korea (wishful thinking much?), then they somehow take over Japan and China. While this is going on the US is being kicked around like a Juarez ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, going bankrupt and losing it's major wars in the middle east (Oh hey, George Bushes worst dream came true, America no longer having a big ♥♥♥♥), being hit by a deadly bird flu an etc. All this leaves America crippled and North Korea rolls in an takes ground, an it's up to the glorious resistance to save America an all it's Apple pie/Burger king eating citizens from the evil Korean cooking.\n\nNow, if you read trough this synopsis and haven't blown your brains out, then congrats you're the small part of us squishy humans that likes using their brain thingies.\n\nYes, this script reads like something a basement dwelling paranoid whackjob would write and then put on youtube, because it is. The script for this game was writen by John Millius, the same clown who wrote Red Dawn -frankly, you'd think after THAT stink burger someone would take away his writing pen-, and he pretty much brings the same jingoism here as he did in Red Dawn. To make it short, in Miliuse's eyes anyone who isn't American is apperantly a equivilent of a Nazi, because as in Red Dawn, the Koreans in this game do everything except twirlling moustache's or having swastikas. It's clear they are trying to make you hate these guys with every cheap way possible, which just comes off as juvenile and laughable (or maybe I really don't care 'cause I'm not American an the plot to this game is seven layer cakes of stupid)\n\nAnyway, let's forget the stupid plot and speak about the gameplay itself. Aaaan...there isn't much to say really, the game is your standart Modern Military shooter, if you played enough CoD you pretty much got this in the bag. The game can be clocked out in four hours tops (if you don't die that often) and after that there's an abrupt end for the upcoming sequel (which I honestly wanna see, it kinda seems more promising than this game.) The weapons are standart, the characters are all bland as hell, you are silent and actually don't have the ability to open doors for some unknow reason.\n\nHonestly, I'd say the real best part of this game is the multiplayer itself. It has 32 players limit, it def feels more like a Bad Company 2 or something Battlefield esque, rather than CoD arena/twitch reflexes shooting. There's some fun maps and mods, and it really feels like you're on a battle.\n\nNow, can I recommend this game?  Well, I'd say you should only buy it on sales and just for the multiplayer itself, because the single player isn't really worth it.","February 19, 2015","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And you know how in regular FPS's you start off with meager equipment and get more and stronger toys throughout the game? Homefront bizarrely does the reverse. It gradually strips away your best guns and gimmicks and mission by mission turns the game more from a semi-interesting FPS to a run-to-the-mill shootmans. Thankfully you won't have to suffer long because the campaign is super short. You can easily blitz through it in five or so hours on normal difficulty.\n\nMultiplayer is dead to no-one's surprise.\n\nSkip this game and look forward to Homefront 2: Revolution instead.

The story and tight narrative really hold the action together almost like the quality FPS's from developer valve. Kaos Studios has done something that the choked sea of call of duty clones has sorely needed in the FPS market, originality. This game is dripping with atmosphere thanks to its well thought out and executed graphical design and the games excellent pacing. You never feel ovewhelmed, but you are always on your toes. This game is a winner for me, the downside is its short, but honestly what game is not now adays? Its about 5 hours long which may ♥♥♥♥ people off but the story is so well done and the game play is paced and designed so well that I can't believe people would turn this one down.\n\nThe multiplayer is excellent, and the single player is a very well crafted story to which I look forward to returning to in the next game of the series {hopefully}\n\nThis game deserves your dollars, its only 50 dollars.

Ive tried playing this but it dosent run very well on my system for some reason. i easily have enough spec on my pc to play this game but no matter even if i put every detail down to low quality i still only max out at 30 fps. it runs no better on very low options than at high quality. Im getting killed far too many times because of the crazy lag trying to play it. its really frustrating in the middle of a chapter having to go back to the main menu several times trying options to get it to run smoother. ive tried replaying every chapter a few times but its running no better!\nIts a shame because the actual game would not be that bad, not a classic but definitley would not be bad.  its a far fetched story but entertaining enough. As graphics go its quite very good in my opinion, very athmospheric at dusk running through abandoned destroyed american towns and seeing the snow capped rockies in the distant. Gun play would be ok too only im struggling because of the low fps going from 30 fps one minute to 10 fps the next.\nIts also far too linear and sometimes your teammates get in your way and you cannot move leaving a north korean to pump you with bullets.\nGood points.\nGraphics\nEntertaining enough story\n\nBad Points.\nruns poorly on my system\nStory far too short\ntoo linear\nPure awkward to move sometimes, teammates getting in way, clumsy.\n\nAll in All i couldnt really recommend this game, because it just wont run for me.

I gather there isn't much of a multiplayer community to speak of, so I just didn't bother.\n\nMy "thumbs down" rating is based largely on the $19.99 standard price, which is NOT what I paid for the game, fortunately.  This game is in no way, shape, or form worth $19.99.  Instead, I paid about $5, which is what I'd say is a fair price for the game in terms of the quality of gameplay and amount of entertainment you get, compared to other games out there.  I went into this game, having paid my $5, looking for basically a diverting shooting gallery, and I got exactly that, so I'm perfectly satisfied with my purchase.  But, again, I wouldn't pay just shy of $20 for it.  As for why, read on.\n\nThe graphics are...eh, fine.  I'm not really a graphics snob, so that's not a big deal to me.  They ran fine at max settings on my 6-year-old computer, which makes sense, considering the game came out...5 years ago.  The visuals themseles aren't up to snuff for a AAA title, but then I don't think this game could claim to be a AAA title.\n\nGameplay attempts to be similar to your basic Call of Duty game, with you as one of 4-5 resistance fighters in a United States under occupation by North Korea.  The game tries to make this ludicrous scenario seem reasonably plausible.  It doesn't really matter who they are, though.  They're the bad guys who've taken over the good ol' US of A, and it's up to you to shoot them in the face and do...pretty much everything else.  Your character, I think, is named Jackson or something, but he might as well be Ramirez from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.  ("Ramirez!  Do [task]!")\n\nMovement is kind of clunky, and the gunplay isn't all that satisfying.  Sound design for the guns is passable, but they tend to have this sort of "clanky" quality to them.  There's probably, like, 10 different common firearms you can pick up, with 2-3 rocket launchers and such, but they all felt mostly the same to me.\n\nThere are some missions where you control this or that vehicle or assign this or that target to some mobile bringer-of-death (e.g. calling in a fire mission), but the bulk of the game is what you'd expect it to be: you running around shooting dudes.\n\nVoice acting is nothing special, and you don't end up really caring about the characters.  No surprise there.\n\nThere aren't any real cutscenes to speak of, other than the occasional mission interlude where your characters talk a bit before you can equip your gun and shoot stuff.  You get loading screens with the "Voice of America" providing a bit of context for the next mission.\n\nBasically, if you want to play "Red Dawn: The Game" this is about as close as you'll get.  And for that, it's kinda fun, but it's not particularly polished.","January 7","false","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The explanation is deep and intricate, and in many ways almost feasible, but even there isn't where this game truly shines.\n\nThe game juxtapositions the ideals of two of your partners, emotional vs mechanical, against each other in a way that makes the player question his actions. It also forces him to experience the backlash of "heroic actions" as negative effects most games leave out. Consequences for actions is a recurrant theme, and is artfully displayed within.","October 22, 2011","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The plot is at least an interesting take on the same old America-vs.-commies plot we've all grown used to and the voice acting is actually quite good, but the gameplay doesn't really do enough to supplement it. Your character feels like he moves too slow, the enemies are far too numerous, the levels aren't very variable and even the guns feel weirdly... soggy. They don't have the "oomph" that the weapons of games like Call of Duty do. It reallyt is a shame, sine this game really could have done something good with the story it has - but the gameplay honestly wastes it all.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Interesting plot\n+ Pretty good voice acting\n\nCons:\n\n- Movement feels sluggish\n- Guns aren't fun to use\n- Unremarkable level design.","April 11","false","2.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Sometimes being completely dumb, and other times having the precision of a super computer.\n- Bland story, with a rather anti-climactic ending.\n- Dialogue hardly makes sense in some cases, making the characters appear incredibly unintelligent.\n- Very short singleplayer campaign, though in the case of this game, it's probably a plus.\n\nHomefront probably could have been a decent game, had it been given the proper attention and resources during development, as there were some points that showed a bit of potential. However, unfortunately this was nowhere near enough to redeem how glitchy and poorly put together the final product ended up being.","September 11, 2014","false","5.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

It's only on a few levels, but it's noticeable, and it's annoying.\n- Friendly AI is annoying, constantly vocalizing the same crap order repeatedly. Furthermore, there were times where I would try to reach cover or navigate around an object to gain a tactical advantage in battle, only to be blocked by the AI. Best example? Trying to get through a door so that I didn't get blown up by a grenade, and then getting locked out by my "ally's" buttocks.\n- Music isn't memorable.\n- The plot is severely lacking. You're a pilot, but you wind up sniping and gunning the entire game (there's one part where you fly a helicopter, but it's the shortest and easiest level in the game). It's also kind of unsatisfying. The entire first half of the game is dedicated to putting tracker bugs on something. Then you get to the end, fight in a battle that's easier than most of the battles up to that point, don't really do anything too fancy, and then are treated to a fifteen second audio clip about the event that you just played through. Also it's basically just Red Dawn except with grown-ups.\n- Gunplay is a mess. If you're not ADS, you're not hitting anything. This is fine for most of the game, but there are a couple of times where you just really need to spray and pray because you're that close, and yet you can't, because the bullets are going to miss.\n\n+ Graphics are pretty good.\n+ You get to kill people.\n+ They did put a lot of time and effort into making the story. There's 61 "pieces of lore" to find that help reveal how the world got to be so cwazy. I still think they could have chosen a better country than North Korea to be the aggressor, though (maybe China by the time the game takes place, but North Korea? ... yeah, right).\n+ It's short.","July 22, 2014","false","7.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

People who thought the latest Call Of Duties were short, prepare for a new contender. That's right, even with a small pause inbetween, I finished it in 4 hours. It's ridiculous for a full priced game. For the first time I really feel like I've wasted my money. Now, don't get me wrong; it's a good game, but you jump from one scenario to another one way too soon. There should've been more (or longer anyway) missions. And I don't think the multiplayer added something new to the genre. It's dull and from the start there were too many campers sitting around. Say what you want, but Call Of Duty is still king of (over the top) FPS storytelling and, in my opinion, the multiplayer experience just can't be beat.

But straight to the point\nWhat is so good about this game?\nThis game will make your chills run through your body, nearly everytime, with the great voice acting and really violent scenes, you can feel the real pain of some of the victims of the war. This game will change the way you think about wars. It is completely different than any other shooter. With a great shooting engine, it is a joy to shoot. It might be short, which some people would think its good because it is not repetetive at all, every mission is different and it has different objectives, you will not get bored of this game.\n\nTrust me, this is not just a game. Some gamers will wipe their tears off while playing this game. In my oppinion, worth every single dollar.\n\nMultiplayer, you ask?\nIt is still running, there is just one server full everyday(not in night) and the best way to describe it, it is like COD but with big maps like Battlefield and added some great tech features which you can use, remote control helis with rockets, rc cars with machine gun on it, and many other.","December 25, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not very tactical.\n- Linear story: Singleplayer is the same, no exploration, and suffers from the "you do as you're told" syndrome, much in the same was as Call of Duty.\n- Overscripted A.I: Trying to go through a door or down a ladder to early and the game will block you, forcing your teammates to go first. Very annoying and common.\n- Control: 90% of the time you are being told what to do / following someone\n- Random deaths: You may kill over 100 enemies in a battle, and then die from instantly from something???\n- Enemies: 90% cannon fodder infantry, the occasional tank / heli that is killed by an auto targeting ally.\n- Audio: Weapons sound fake, battle music is bland, this is not the game's strong point.\n- Sprinting: My grandmother could run faster\n- Ammo: Hardly any can be carried, ammo is not shared between similar weapons.\n\nThis title was a dissapointment. THQ suffered from the poor sales and performance of this game. The singleplayer is linear, boring, predictable and frustraiting.\nAfter only 2 hours, I had enough. This game played so badly, with repeating objectives, poor copy+paste enemies and audio, I uninstalled the game.\nI did not play the multiplayer, but it looks like a bland mix of CoD and Frontlines. Hopefully crytek does a better job with the upcoming Homefront 2.\n\nScore: 3/10 (Bad)","July 8, 2013","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, after letting the game sit for a while and going back to play it once more I have decided that this game is an underappreciated, if somewhat rough gem.\n\nThere are many aspects of the game that I simply adore, the attention to the detail in the collectable news reports is one of them; the absolute immersion into the politics of the time is simply brilliant, not to mention accurate. Along with this, I think that the story, which is the background story of the US being occupied, is fascinating. Usually in games the US is at the zenith of power and you have to save it from complete disaster, however here, in Homefront, the US has indeed fallen and it is the role of the resistance to attempt to rebuild. The preface for this game is wonderful and I simply love it, however there are many problems with the game mechanics, graphics and AI which let the game down. Unfortunately no matter how good the story is, playability is just as important.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with the game is the AI's seemingly scripted movements, lack of intelligence and spawning locations, making a few play-throughs rather predictable. It is a real pain to re-start at a check point, kill the very same enemies in the very same way, get killed, then do it all over again a few more times. The AI, for a realistic and enjoyable shooter needs to be a little unpredictable.\nContinuing on from this theme of realism within the game brings me to another issue, the ballistics. I found a few times that I was being pinned down by an enemy but when returning fire it appears that I am out of range, which is strange because the longest distance you fire in the game is no more than 200 meters. For a good shooter the ballistics must be accurate; both the trajectory of the bullets and recoil need to be taken into account. The lack of recoil was not only unrealistic but frustrating\nAnother, and in a way a very disappointing problem is that I didn’t feel as though I was part of the resistance. The story, the concept and all the potential for a game to truly give you a resistance, grungy, underworld experience felt very much like every other shooter there is. As I said prior, I love the concept and the preface to the game, I think it is fantastic. The execution however was somewhat poorly done. You are dropped in the middle of the action without enough time to become attached to the correctors or the community. In a resistance situation, every single loss would be heartbreaking; I didn’t find that to be the case at all.\nThere are other issues along the same lines, such as a lack of interaction with the Oasis community; it would have been great if you spent some time gathering for supplies, cutting your teeth on a few raids and what not before embarking on the main story. The game was also far too short; I think that there could have been a few more missions that would have made the game more enjoyable.\n\nI’ve probably given more criticism than praise, but that is because I wanted so desperately for this game to be good, but what stands out are the failings. This game has the potential to be great. After the release of the sequel I recommend the developers go back and re-do the original, fix it up and re-release it. I really do recommend the game if you’re able to look past the flaws, the concept is great and you’ll see just how good this game could have been.\n\nAll in all, 5.5/10\n","November 14, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When reading about the game I thought this story line should have a lot of possibilites for great FPS action.\n\nThis game frequently uses the can't-retreat-tons-of-enemies scenario.  This forces a panicked death-match type of play at some point in most of the levels.  Additionally the game forces even more death-match style of kamakaze engagement by sometimes having a timed element.\n\nFor example, at one point you are trapped in a fairly small area with limited cover and have to protect a wheeled-drone type of tank from RPGs, while being shot at by the entire Korean army.  Unless you kill enough of  the RPG-shooters the tank is destroyed, forcing a restart of the level.  There is no option but to run-and-gun, suffering a lot of damage from  the Korean army, while trying to get enough of the RPGs to pass the level.\n\nIf you like the deathmatch style of playing against tons of bots, then you may like Homefront.  For me, frequently being forced into this style of play is one of the elements that end up being frustrating, rather than fun.  To make it worse, during these frantic engagements, one of your team-mates continues to repeat some instruction, maybe as a "hint"?  For example in the RPG scenario, he will repeat, over and over, "get the RPG in the third floor window", or "...on the rooftop".  This extremely loud repetition becomes so irritating, that I played the last couple of tries with the sound muted.\n\nFollowing are some other game-play related issues:\n\nThe character control seems very sluggish, compared to other shooters-- almost like playing in slightly slow motion, while the rest of the game is normal speed.\n\nJumping up from a crouch is about half the speed of the enemies who jump from  behind cover to shoot.  This is especially frustrating, as there is no leaning implemented in the game.  So you have to jump up from behind cover in slow motion, getting shot a couple of times before you are even up.\n\nYou can only jump the equivalent of about a foot off the ground. Even low obstacles force going around.\n\nSprinting is a lot slower than the AI team-mates-- they always pull ahead, even though you are supposed to follow them.\n\nThis character motion problem is a little subtle, but very noticible after just playing other shooters with much better character control.  At first I thought maybe something was wrong on my machine, until I watched a playthrough of a level I just completed on YouTube.  Same thing-- slightly slow-motion, compared with the rest of the game, ememies, team-mates, and etc.\n\nNot enough ammo, forcing switching guns frequentore ly with fallen enemies.  This is also very "death-match'ish" and lessens the realism, as the last thing a real soldier wants on the battlefield is to pick up and use an unfamiliar weapon.  To make it worse, the guns of fallen enemies dissappear pretty quickly.\n\nI finally gave up on the game during a follow-me type of sequence.  You are supposed to "sneak" through this survivalist camp in broad daylight while "insane survivalists" are walking all around.  The game hint says to follow this team-mate and stay low.  After about four times of literally following so close we were touching, I gave up.\n\nThe scenario is so-- well, dumb.  Broad daylight? no cover? enemies all around? Even touching the "leader" still resulted in being seen in a couple of minutes.  This was just too arbitrary, and anti-immersive. It pulled me right out of the game.\n\nOver all the experience for me was more frustration than fun.  With so many other games to try, I'm done with this one for now .\n\nI'm just really glad I got Homefront on a weekend sale.\n","November 27, 2014","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campain was ok, but could be better. I did not like that they pretty much threw you in the world with no backstory on your character or what was going on. Also, the campain itself was short as hell (only 4 hours on normal difficuly, and that includes dying a bunch of times). That being said, the best part about the game in my opinion is the multiplayer which is a mix of both call of duty and battlefield. Its like call of duty in the way that you can go duck around shooting and killing and its very faced paced, and it is like battlefield in the sense that there are multiple game modes, vehicules, big map sizes, and tactic opportunities. I paid 4,99$ for the game, and at that price, it is a MUST buy for shooter fans or casual gamers. Even tough the game is from 2011, it looks beutifull on Ultra settings even with today's standarts. I'd rate it a 9 out of 10. It would have been a 10 if the campain was a little bit better. So what are you waiting for? Get this game now.","February 18, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't a great game by any stretch, though for a straight up shooter it does its job well. Its entertaining if all you want to do is gun down a lot of North Koreans and LOL at the cringeworthy patriotic nonsense it has going on. Put it this way, it sets out what it aimed to do a lot beter than any of the recent Call of Duty titles, though it does lack the polish of those titles. The story is typical pro-'murica patriotic garbage, but is written by the same guy that wrote Red Dawn so that much is to be expected.\n\nThe multiplayer is very entertaining also.

The graphics and sound in the game are very good but the game has a few bad traits that tarnished the single player experience for me. The controls are the typical FPS controls but the movement feels sluggish combined with a kind of snagged or hooked on door frames or stairs when trying to move around.  One of the most annying points of the game is the AI that you are supposed to follow, will sometimes sit there forever because the games dialogue trigger didnt register so you have back pedal 10 yards and rejoin the dude. There were some parts of the game that were straight up unbelievable due to the explosions and devestation yet you somehow survive.

It really was a lot of fun when I played it, and I'm sad to see it go.  I really can't recommend the game on the singleplayer alone.\n\nThe PC version is done right, with more options than I've ever seen in a game before, including options for toggle controls and every graphics option you could ever want.  It's really too bad that all the effort that was put into doing this right is wasted on the now-crippled game.\n\nThe single player is short and full of lazy invisible wall level design, but the gameplay is solid.

But over all the Campaign was to short and was easily completed within a 4 hour time frame.\n\nI noticed various script bugs that didn't break the game but made it annoying enough to swear at the computer; example: sudden voice script dropping durring a non combat period and for no reason at all, Issues were the AI would push you out of cover because that is "their" scripted place, and finaly issues were no matter what you do you must "complete" the level like a old school side scrolling shooting and kill all the enemys in the same spot so its a game of memory not skill.\n\nOn a scale from 1-10 10 being the best I give this game a 4 and that is only because of the graphics, and the multiple vehicle gun fights.

The weapons sound great, but the voices can be really quite then crazily loud for a little bit.

What sets this apart from the Calls of Duty is it's visceral depiction of a failed America and the possible future that could conceivably come to pass.  The mechanics are solid and the graphics are nice -the story is decent but seems to stop abruptly.  An aspect in which this game shines is the sound of the guns.  Each report is a heavy, metallic blow that makes you feel like you may actually be listening to a battle rather than hail on a tin roof.  There are some scenes in the story that were so intensly that it made my blood boil and my stomach wrench -I have never felt so much anger at an artificial enemy as I did for these North Koreans -kudos Kaos Studios.

You did get the feeling of David & Goliath - being hopelessly outnumbered, but fighting on for a true cause, regardless.\n\nThe game itself is only short - it took me a mere 4hrs to complete the SP campaign and I hardly raced through it.

I would have to say it didn't end up being the best of quality at all. But it is something different. It is something to try out besides the usual Call of Duty and Battlefield series. Now, don't buy this game thinking it is going to be epic, because it isn't. But it sure can be fun if you decide to overlook the imperfections of the game.\n\nFor your info the devs of this game "THQ" Went out of business and sold there title to Crytek. A sequel is currently being made and I sure hope that the quality will be much better in which I do believe it will, as Crytek has a lot more resources to put into it. But if you plan on getting it in 2015, then I for sure suggest that you purchase this installment to get the storyline.\n\nYou can get immersed into the singleplayer storyline if you want to have a good time. Just don't be too critical of like oh that episode is missing things and such.\nAnd Multiplayer is still active that I know of. I played it and it can be quite a bit of fun. Maps are fairly open like Battlefield with a little bit more of a COD gameplay. It is a decent mix and a good change to have. So add the game to your collection and have fun.\n","July 18, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kyrthira/recommended/55100/","Kyrthira","Clint Barton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kyrthira/","134 products in account","tl;dr - An amazing story that suffered from a critically short campaign and a crappy tacked-on multiplayer. Worth it for $20.\n\nHomefront has an amazingly rich backstory and a wonderful premise based on speculation of current world events.  I was incredibly excited to get this game immediately when it came out and dove straight into the campaign.  The story was good, if a bit linear.  There wasn't a lot of room for exploration and invention, though the non-interactive elements of the environment looked fantastic.  I let myself get drawn into the the story and setting.\n\nI noticed a few critical flaws.  First, the controls were not always intuitive.  When new weapons or situations arose later in the game, there was little to no explanation on how to take advantage of this.  (I had to go into the keybinds to figure out how to pilot the helicopter, for example.)  Some weapons were very under-utilized, appearing useful once or twice but otherwise pointless.\n\nThe end of the campaign was amazing from a story perspective -- and then simply ended.  That was it.  That's the game, thanks for playing.  I had five hours of gameplay and I'd completed the campaign.  It felt like a solid 'Act One' that had absolutely nothing else to it.\n\nThat's not entirely true ... there was a multiplayer component that was bland and wholly uninteresting, feeling like something they slopped into the game to claim 'Hey, we have multiplayer!' that flopped horribly.\n\nAt its current price of $20 I would say this is an entertaining single-player game you can enjoy for five or six hours.  Don't bother with the multiplayer aspect and try not to lose your mind over the sometimes awkward controls.","July 19, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Comments below are based on the single-player campaign.\n\nIt's short, ranging over 7 missions (it took me 5 1/2 hours), but at least these are action-packed and keep you 'entertained'. The missions offer a diversity of challenges, from sneak& sniper to vehicle missions. The weapons are standard fare, nothing out of the ordinary, but they work well with plenty of choice for everyone. Interesting is the Goliath automated vehicle.\n\nThe setting is interesting, the story is Ok, the characters are ... shallow and contradict themselves often - which ruins the setting and the story quite a bit.\n\nNow to the biggest problem with the game: It is self-righteous, hypocritical and takes itself more seriously than it deserves. Accusing the enemy of dehumanizing the people you fight for (mass graves) within the game, but as a game dehumanizing the enemies by turning them into soul-less and voice-less pop-up targets ... And hence it ruins the moral discussion it tries to create from the onset.","August 14, 2011","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gun fights were brief and intense yet confusingly episodic with what I can only describe as toilet breaks between them; like ads breaking up hour-long serials on the "idiot box". The gameplay is directed by an obnoxious NPC called "Conner", a despisable machismo pro-militarist gun freak, and his mild-mannered yet dramatic team-mates, sheparding you, a speechless gun-totting 'pilot', through broken suburban dreams full of North Korean soldiers, idyllic rural pastureland full of territorial rednecks and strategic civil infrastructure full of U.S. military personnel, stealthing a bit but shooting most of the way. From battling through a burning supermarket to jumping into and hiding in a mass grave to being betrayed by some arrogant creep, the usual cliches of militaristic wet dreams pumped by american media abound so unfortunately on most occassions, I felt like I had been here before. Being forced into using the remote-controlled "gun on truck" felt like I was somehow cheating and piloting the Huey was suspiciously easy but the weapons felt good and the gameplay, though banal and contrived, was easy to follow. I can see why the game was canned by critics and I agree with them but an easy afternoon of play is always a positive.\nP.S. I would've felt so ripped off if I had've paid release price for this and now that THQ have died and the assets sold, the likelihood of an improved (read worthwhile) Homefront 2 is fading, disgruntled punters can feel reassured that the cliches here will, like a pheonix with rabies, arise in some future mindless game franchise","March 23, 2013","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the narrative inbetween the loading of chapters, and the collectible newspaper articles provide a much more entertaining value than the game itself\nHomefront briefly explored the same themes uncovered in Spec Ops (granted, the latter was released a year afterwards, possibly influenced by the former), but it falls short and taken a more traditional approach, leaving the characters under developed, and at times, we just don't really care about what's happening.\nAdditionally, one cannot help themselves but to compare Homefront, and another title from 3 years early named Turning Point: Fall of Liberty (if unfortunate enough to have had played the latter). Of course, Homefront is better than Turning Point, but that's not saying a lot. At the very least, the gameplay is more refined.","January 9, 2013","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got a fairly memorable campaign with quick fighting and some challenging moments.  The graphics are great, the shooting is tight.\nAs for the story, I'm a little torn.  On one hand, the concept of an occupied America makes the environment engrossing, so the story pulls you in more than, say, most Call of Duty games.  On the other hand the action in some areas is too ridiculous to be taken seriously, counteracting the attempt at an emotional campaign.  And considering you play a freedom fighter with supposed limited resources, guns are f***ing everywhere!  I don't think I ever had less than half ammo in any gun before I was able to grab another and everywhere I stepped I was picking up more grenades.

The trailers alone were enough to convince a lot of people, including myself, to buy it. After completing it, I can't help but agree with the common criticism that the game is far too short. It'd be one thing if the ending brought some closure to the story, but it ends just as the action in the game gets really good, and in an obvious [failed] attempt to lure customers into eagerly anticipating the sequel. Given the alarmingly short campaign and the overestimated graphics, this game falls short of being worth its $49.99 price tag. The campaign is fun however, and the multiplayer, despite its relatively gutted graphics, has some potential for addictive and competitive gaming (especially for snipers), but it doesn't compete well with some other multiplayer FPS games available.

I really liked the story, especially since I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area where some of the story takes place, but that's where my positive thoughts for Homefront stops. How companies get away with only providing 4 hours of content now is beyond my understanding. The controls are clunky and you have to repeatedly press buttons to crouch and prone instead of holding them like I am used to. The mechanics are extremely unrefined - you can blast enemies in the head repeatedly and they won't die. You can barely peak out from a corner and an enemy far away can pick you off. The game feels too rushed and unpolished, and if they had taken the time to iron out everything and make the campaign longer, Homefront could have been a really good game.\n\nBut I do feel like the potential is there especially with it's great concept of a story - perhaps if Homefront 2 ever see's light, it will be refined and polished and provide us with more substance to allow us to really get into the game.","January 11, 2013","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A mere 4 hours for a crappy player like me is kind of pathetic. I died a few times, sure, but 4 hours of single-player isn't that great, despite the incredible story.\nBecause that's the main appeal; the main storyline is very gritty and harsh, loved it.\n\nMultiplayer is a tad on the weak side, too. No co-op that I could find, which is a real shame. Playing this 2 players would be quite awesome. 4 would be even more incredible. It has a huge potential for great co-op gameplay, which is a shame it wasn't included.\nAs for the online multiplayer, it's somewhat of a slightly dumbed-down version of the Battlefield series.  It feels more like a giant free-for-all than an actual team-oriented multiplayer game. However, playing as a team will yield a much better experience overall.","June 25, 2011","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I had three words to sum up this game, it would be those three words. Homefront is a game about fighting a guerrilla war against the North Korean Army, which has "liberated" the United States. Now, to this end, the mission was accomplished. North Korean soldiers were killed, and it was in a guerrilla fashion. However, that's not to say I didn't have a few issues with the game. First off, I beat this game in one afternoon. One afternoon. It's more like a DLC, and nowhere near the full-length size most games are nowadays. On that note, if you're bored one afternoon, and want to give a a whirl, hey, go ahead; you'll be done before dinner's on the table. Also, I enjoyed the variety of guns, but combat was not exactly varied. I was more going through the motions, and how I engaged my target depended largely on what weapon I was using at the time. Also, I enjoyed the moments when I got to use the Resistance's robot thingy that launched many rockets (kind of like Black Ops 2's CLAW unit). Overall, like I said, if you have an afternoon to kill, I would say why not? It doesn't bring anything really new to the table, but sometimes, you just need to shoot some bad guys. And Homefront has no shortage of bad guys, let me tell you.\nOverall Score: 7.8/10","November 29, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one thing that annoyed me most, not being able to replenish assault rifle ammo with another type of assault rifle!\n\nEnemies only seem to target you, they are surprisingly accurate too... hitting you 90% of the time, also, every time you pop your head up you will get splashed, and even when behind cover you will get hit - when crouched even if you can't see enemies over cover, they will often be able to hit you -  probably your forehead up sticks out over cover :(\nEnemies drop grenades beside you with pin point accuracy too, meaning you have to run out of cover into the hail of bullets aimed directly at you\n\nObstacles nearly always come in the form of fridges or wardrobes, everytime you go to the next phase of a mission, it will be the main guy Connor (who orders you about the whole way) that pushes the fridge over, and you can continue your adventure. Clipping is also pretty annoying, before you hook up with the military, you have at least 2 people with you throughout, often 3, they will push you out of the way between firefights when you need to climb a ladder, go through a revolving door, etc, you are always last and it is annoying beyond belief! You don't actually get the option to go up/through until they have all passed.\n\nAll that aside, I enjoyed playing through the Campaign, although it was pretty short, and ended abruptly, I don't think at the end you have really accomplished anything at all. Steam says my time played was 3 hours, I'm pretty sure the multiplayer is permanently offline too. So definitely not worth paying full price for.\n\nSummary: you run out of ammo quickly, seems like you are the only target for enemies, poor ending, multiplayer nonexistant","August 31, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Goliath system could be called one, but I personally found it annoying to have to switch back to it every time I wanted to fire (this was because once you fire with it you automatically put the targeter away). Some levels, especially the early missions, had portions where there was either too much cover, which essentially forced close quarters combat with long range rifles, and areas with too little cover, which stopped me from progressing as I had to find a place to go prone, get up, fire a few rounds, take enough rounds to almost die from enemies I couldn't see, and then go prone for my health to regenerate.\n\nThe controls also left a bit to be wanted as well. I was suprised to see that aim-down-sight is locked to toggle only, and can't be changed to hold to aim-down-sight. The helicopter controls were extremely dumbed down (even on the highest difficulty control level) and there were so many controls for the helicopter that were just completely un-realistic (i.e. you can pitch straight down or straight up and not gain/lose velocity and rolling the helicopter didn't actually give sideways velocity).\n\nThe weapons in the game also were a bit of a bad point for me because, other than a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher, they all felt the same. The shotgun was completely useless for the CQC areas that you get it for because the enemies are always too far away to hit without getting gunned down. The assault rifles and the LMG all felt the same and none had a specific scenario where it would be better than the other (I generally found myself using either the LMG or the Scar LMG since it had the most ammo and biggest clip), with the only diference being some rifles were full-auto, some were burst fire, and some were semi-auto. I also found the movement speed reduction while aiming was a bit annoying, and only really see it making sense with the LMG or the RPG.\n\nThe AI is also kind of strange. Hostile AI can sometimes hit you even if you are behind cover, and they really only target you, the player, with your AI allies taking fire rarely. Speaking of the AI allies, they are all but useless. When they aren't sitting crouched behind cover for entire firefights, they will randomly fire, sometimes in the direction of hostiles. I found that the allies worked best as spotters since they had a habit of firing at walls that hostiles were taking cover behind, and they don't stop firing at the one specific enemy they are targeting until it is killed, usually by the player.\n\nThe game's story was a great one though, and I really enjoyed the dark turns the game took in the labor camp levels, I just wish the game would have spent more time showing the Korean oppression. The story alone is the main reason I recommend this game, with its gameplay only being on par with other first person shooters of its time.","February 22, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign is only four hours long and the multiplayer is a poor man's Battlefield clone. I did find myself moved at certain points in the campaign, but that seems to have been the idea- the man behind Red Dawn wanted to scare the pants off of people by making them think an invasion by North Korea was not only possible, but a very credible threat, and depict what would happen as a result. It's an engaging story, but it kind of falls apart when you stop and think about it long enough. Plus, heart-wrenching though some scenes were, they feel like cheap attempts to elicit tears in the end. Maybe that's the real horror of it, and this game is just about shock value. I dunno.

I picked it up on a Steam sale a couple summers ago. Havent played Multiplayer, I dont know if mp still exists, meaning if people still play it. As for single player, its story is very reminiscent of the Red Dawn movies (even has references in game towards those movies, specifically the original).\n\nStory wise was good overall and cliche at times.\n\nCombat and Manuverability was mostly good. There were a few instances where I personally thought it was a pain in the rear shooting at enemies while you have artillery canons firing next to you. You get screen shocks and your character aiming bouncing around because of it. Its realistic i guess so its not a huge problem. My big issue I noticed with combat, specifically when shoot at enemies is noticably you tend to shoot blanks from time to time. I know sounds liek a personal problem, it may as well be.\n\nThe save system or lack there of is kind of annoying a certain points of the game, its a check-point save system.\n\nOh the Single Player Campaign is VERY LINEAR. Not an issue if you like your classic FPS titles.\n\nLastly I played it on Guerilla (Hardest Difficulty) on first play through. It is at most a 5 hour game. I cant imagine how Easy would be. *shank... Shank... SHANK SHANK SHANK*","February 19, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just start playing Homefront while you think about it.  By the time you decide, the game will be over.  I beat it in 5 hours but I also took some time to look for some of the extras, so yeah, it's that short.\nThis doesn't necessarily mean it's all bad.  It's got a fairly memorable campaign with quick fighting and some challenging moments.  The graphics are great, the shooting is tight.\nAs for the story, I'm a little torn.  On one hand, the concept of an occupied America makes the environment engrossing, so the story pulls you in more than, say, most Call of Duty games.  On the other hand the action in some areas is too ridiculous to be taken seriously, counteracting the attempt at an emotional campaign.  And considering you play a freedom fighter with supposed limited resources, guns are f***ing everywhere!  I don't think I ever had less than half ammo in any gun before I was able to grab another and everywhere I stepped I was picking up more grenades.  With all the sh** the Koreans leave lying around, how is it the Americans haven't wiped them out ages ago?\nAnyways, I got it for like a 1.25, so I can't complain.  Fun, short little romp.

The campaign is easy, boring and you will find more controversial scenes in every Call of Duty game if you are looking for something like that. The story has some decent approaches but fails in realizing them. Also it can be beaten in 3-4 hours and the multiplayer is pretty much dead. It had major flaws in the beginning and now that it's okay nobody plays it any more.\n\nIn fact, you want to purchase either Call of Duty for fast-paced run-and-gun gameplay or Battlefield for Vehicle Warfare. The combination of these two playstyles just doesn't work and nobody plays Homefront anyway.","February 1, 2012","false","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are Robert Jacobs. The so called Greater Korean Republic has taken over the western part of America. Robert Jacobs is a former Marine helicopter pilot. Somehow, a link must be made between saving the world and being a pilot, but no. You use a car which you actually control remotely, like a little boy. Your mission is to bring fuel to a military base in San Francisco, and because of this America gets saved. The irony of this is that only hippies live there who drive electric cars that they are put up with by environmentalism people. You have to do this with a team, consisting of a black person, a woman, a feeble-minded rambo and a technician who is a half Korean, meaning your team is composed of nothing but imbeciles.\n\nNote: The only Black Person in the game dies before the halfway point.\n\nThe single player starts off as a pilot in the year 2027. You are sitting in your room staring at a wall for some strange reason when suddenly a few commies knock on your door. They take you outside after they punched you in the face and throw you in what was used to be a school bus.\nAt this moment the player ought to see all the lulzy things that happen outside, children getting ♥♥♥♥♥, people dying, Korean variants of Razzia's and all other sorts of fun things, which makes them Nazi copyists. Unfortunately, your execution will be postponed because some members of the Resistance Movement blow up your bus to save you, which is dumb as ♥♥♥♥ because they could've killed you too, making them a bunch of sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nTake a ride in this beautiful bus so you can end your miserable life.\nThis is the point where the game gets gradually worse, because they actually manage to save you. You don't want this. You want do die, your life sucks. But they force you to join their Resistance, which makes hem even bigger sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\n\nThe game won't last much longer from now on, considering that the single player will take you about five hours. From this point on, you will not notice difference between most levels as every level is the same apathic, miserable and dying mess like in the bus at the beginning. In every level you will kill Koreans, blow stuff up, kill Koreans, use some kind of vehicle that blows stuff up, kill Koreans, save your ♥♥♥ and finally kill Koreans. Strikingly enough, you will actually fly a helicopter once. ORLY, you're a pilot!","February 19, 2013","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

In a word BREATHAKING. The suspence fills the air with a thickness u could cut with a knife. Just the way they played the storyline out if i mght channal my inner gamer "AWSOME".  Just the whole idea of the Korea's army uniting and taking over America is gripping. it is a very in your face game. Literatly u neer stop moving. you also have the power to take to the skyes in a range of helecopters.\nover all it is a truly great game totaly worth buying. *Be warned it is filled with multiplayer hackers though i believe that the "Dev's" patched most of that there is still a few raindrops tthat slip through* But dont get ur hopes up its lie that with eery game but eventaly it stops. i have experianced fewer hackers","August 11, 2012","true","50.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
