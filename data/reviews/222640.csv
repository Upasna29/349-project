I give it 8/10.\n\nPros:\n\n-Puzzles to unlock goodies on about every level\n-Awesome puzzles to complete storyline\n-Good storyline\n-Combat is intriguing and makes you think--must be very strategic.\n-The number of companions that you can control and deck out with gear\n-Pausing the game to plan out strategies\n-Talent trees to cutomize for each companion; it adds a deeper level of gameplay\n-Decent graphics\n\nCons:\n\n-Game has some bugs--sometimes the abilities for a companion will not show up. Or, when you click on a companion, another companion's abilities show up. When this happens, you have to restart the game to fix.\n...So, because of this, you need to remember to save the game after every battle!!\n-Gear is simplistic--it doesn't seem to have gear specific to any one character, it doesnt change the look of your character, and it does not change or add abilities to any character. Basically. gear just adds passive stats.\n-No end game. When you beat it, that's it. No unlocking of ubber mode, or anything, to find better gear for your characters. So, you can't really do anything else with the characters you have leveled up and decked out...not even restart and play the game again with your decked out characters.\n\nPro or Con?\n\n-Easy to cheat to get gear. Just stand in front of a treasure box before you open it and save. If you don't like what you get, just load that save point and try again. You can do this when creating loot, too.\n-Right before you beat the game, the storyline takes a drastic turn and ends, leaving you hanging.\n\nWhat I would like to see in DLC or part 2 if they choose to make it, which devs should:\n\n-Instead of still pausing, make it to where everything is in slowmo when you hit what is now the pause key.\n-better gear\n-some end game\n-more challenges and hidden treasure\n-more bosses\n\nTips if you decide to buy:\n\n-Save Frequently\n-Wendaroo is freaking awesome, so learn how to use her.\n-Save before opening chests so you can reload last save if you don't like what you get.\n-When creating loot, the last item is the item you will create.. it could've been my imagination, though, but it usually also had the last attribute of that item put into it too.\n-Go for one target at first--usually the squishy magic type, like priests or mages. If you can't demolish it in 5 seconds,  split your damage amongst other targets.\n..usually I tried demolishing one fast. But when that didn't work, I usually split dmg across two targets  in two seperate areas until one or the other was very low hp and then switched to full focus dmg on that one. This also helped me metigate inc damage better because I could see everything that was going on better so I knew who to heal and dispel and such.","February 17, 2014","true","38.7"," 72 of 80 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","72","80","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobnowhere/recommended/222640/","bobnowhere","bobnowhere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobnowhere/","3430 products in account","Aarklash Legacy is a highly tactical RPG set in the world of Aarklash and based on the desktop miniature game Confrontation.  While not a direct sequel by any means, it is set in the same world as the handily named Confrontation, a far inferior game,  also from Cyanide Studios.\n\nYou play as a group of Wheelswords, the debt collectors of the Gold Mongers guild, the group that funds the armies of the ever warring races in Aarklash.  Your initial 4 person group is quite the motley lot, a part mechanical lizard with self confidence issues, a dog-monster, a tiny rat-like man and the standard fantasy trope of a sorceress in skin tight revealing clothing.  While the player doesn't have a customisable avatar of their own, it becomes clearer as the story goes that one of the starting four serves as the POV character.  Over the course of the game you'll meet 4 more characters that can be swapped in at any time for a maximum of 4 in the party.  All the characters are interesting and frequently talk among themselves and the game itself is fully voice acted very well.\n\nWhere the game really shines is the isometric real-time with pause combat.  The standard MMO trinity applies here, with a tank to hold and collect as many mobs up as possible and hopefully orient them away from the squishier party members and 3 support or damage dealers.  Each character is limited to only four abilities and an auto-attack.  While this might seem limiting at first all the abilities can be significantly changed as you level up and with the ability to respec at will you can tailor your group to each individual fight.  Positioning is vitally important here, many of your parties abilities are line of sight.  There is nothing more annoying than firing off a healing disk and having an enemy walk in between and get healed instead!\n\nAll enemies and bosses have there own set of abilities that can be viewed at any time and you should ignore these at your peril.  Enemies come in many types, tanks who self-heal and can resurrect themselves, healers, debuffers, melee, ranges, summoners and many more.  While bosses come with own set of difficulties, many have insta-kill abilities like stay too close and you die, stay too far away and you die or don't stand here and you die.  You'll die a lot but all these abilities are telegraphed well!   Buffing and debuffing also plays a vital role in the game.  A favourite trick of enemy casters is to immediately turn off your group members most vital abilities but luckily some of your other characters are able to strip debuffs off one member and apply them to themselves.  Enemies will also constantly control your characters and many fights do degenerate into battling a series of buffs and debuffs with the first few seconds of any fight being the most important.  Though one criticism might be once you break the back of an enemy group, it can become a bit of a grind to finish a group off with no real threat.\n\nAs opposed to the combat this is not a gear heavy game though, each character only has 4 slots, relic, ring, necklace and earring and you can't change armor or weapons or make any visual change to the characters.  There are also no merchants in the game, just a recycling mechanic where once you put in enough items in you'll get a high quality item back.\n\nThe game also contains a heavy puzzle element outside of the combat.   From the standard lights out puzzles, though on a grand scale, to match the floaty magic symbol with various parts made up from lever pulls to guide the light through a maze.  At times the number of puzzles in a row can overwhelm, you can bypass some of them, but you might miss out on some of the best loot!\n\nThis game is very demanding of the player, asking of exact positioning, use of all your various abilities and strategies and punishing of mistakes.  The difficulty is also set very high, it's not easy, medium, hard, it's more on the Super Hexagon Scale, hard, harder and harderest!  Though I think the latest patch may have toned the difficulty down a little bit.  But, don't let that scare you off as you'll miss one of the best tactical RPGs in years!\n\n9.5/10","June 9, 2014","true","19.5"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","56","61","0","0"

Puzzles are kind of annoying in this game. Loot does not reflect on your characters looks, and loot is basically just stat upgrades.\n\nHOWEVER, Gameplay is SOLID. Very fun. Very tactical. Has a tactical pause system and making a wrong decision in battle wether that be your positioning or focusing the wrong guy first or missing an ability timing... can kill you. The cons mentioned up above are annoying yeah, but overall in a game like this , the gameplay is the most important part to me. I bought it at full price and was pleased with my experience. If you're not sure, wait for a sale and then DEFINITELY pick it up.\n\nEach character has 4 main abilities. As you level up characters in the game, you can allocate stat points into these abilities. Each ability has a tree that branches out into different paths. You can basically max two of any of the eight branches on each character, thus customizing their playstyle. You can have a mage healer, or they can be a damage dealer or a mix. You can implant a seed that will explode if you kill the enemy within x number of seconds, and the explosion can do a heal AOE to teammates caught within range of said explosion, or you can max a completely different ability.\n\nThere end up being eight playable characters, and you make a party of four. You choose the four. Seriously, the gameplay styles are really left in your hands with how you want to play the game. Very wise on the devs part. These are the reasons the gameplay is so satisfying. When all the abilities in your party go off just right and you completely wreck a mob... it feels pretty good.","October 27, 2014","true","17.8"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","49","52","0","0"

Challenging, engaging, beautiful and a little retro. And the best part.. cheap.\n\nAarklash isn't very deep in terms of RPG elements (though they are there, in a skill tree/limited inventory kind of way) but it is extremely deep in terms of gameplay. This is the first game in a long time where I relished the rematch after I was utterly destroyed.  Battles take place in real time, but you can pause at any time to chain orders. You can also remap your skill tree before a battle at no cost, so if at first you don't obiliterate - recalibrate, recalibrate again.\n\nThe downside, and the reason I stopped playing in the end game, are the puzzles. At first the game reminded me of "The Summoning" where battles were intermixed with puzzles. But in the second act I was starting to get annoyed, and by the third act I had had enough. It just grinds the pace down to fight, puzzle, puzzle, fight, puzzle. And the puzzles aren't even interesting! They are rehashes of the earlier ones, with stupid terms and well...\n\nThe upside is the fist half of the game, the pacing is spot-on, the graphics are sweet and like i said, the battles are the kind of thing that you walk away from a loss intrigued and not frustrated. You can constantly employ different teams and different skill sets, which leads to a depth not really seen in many games. I just wish they had spent more time developing the puzzles, instead of copy-pasting them at greater frequency.\n\nAll scores out of 10, with 7 the highest:\n\nGraphics: 7\nSound: 7\nDepth: 7\nRetro: 7\nPuzzles: 1\nEnd game: 4\nRPG: 5\nStrategy: 7","September 16, 2013","true","39.0"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","52","59","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/222640/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Aarklash: Legacy is a squad based strategy game developed by Cyanide, releasing in September 2013 as a PC exclusive.\n\nGame play focuses primarily on a group of four characters, each of the characters have their own designated role within a group, such as tanking, healing and damage dealing. You will unlock more characters by progressing through the story mode however you can only have four characters in your group at any one time, meaning squad management plays a key role in success. Whilst each of the characters have their own primary role, there is some overlap with a few abilities, such as damage dealers may also have a healing spell to help out if needed, and healers will also have damage dealing spells. All characters have an “auto attack” which means your healers are still important when it comes down to burning enemies quickly.\n\nWhilst the gameplay is mostly played in real time, the pause mechanic allows you to break from the mayhem in the fight to plan out your next wave of attacks and precisely move your group members around the battlefield. Whilst this is a nice addition, I didn’t find that much use for it, as I was able to do a lot of my commands in real time. What I did like however was how the game automatically pauses for you the moment you enter a battle, meaning you can get your initial abilities queued up to take a big advantage over your foes.  Looting in Aarklash is pretty neat too; there are only four item slots per character, necklace, rings, pendants and trinkets. Most enemies will drop loot, as well as finding it in treasure chests across the world too. Any loot which you have no use for, you can disenchant to create an epic quality item; this was a really nice way of dealing with unwanted or old equipment rather than just selling it to a vendor. It helped keep inventory space clear and your characters always had access to better equipment even if you weren’t lucky on the loot drops.\n\nThe talent system through levelling up the characters is quite in-depth. Each character has four abilities as well as their auto attack. You are able to enhance the four abilities through a talent tree, which manipulates how the ability works, adding an additional effect, or just straight up increasing the amount of damage, healing or stats the abilities does. As with other talent systems in games, this allows you to mould your characters exactly how you want to fit in with the rest of your groups’ dynamics, allowing for some interesting hybrid characters to be built.\n\nOne of my biggest negatives with Aarklash is the lack of any real checkpoint system. The game does offer unlimited quick saves, but if you are like me, you will often forget to save after large portions of game play and when you die, well…you are smack bang at the start of the level again, leaving you deflated and disillusioned at the thought of having to replay the past half an hours’ worth of battles.  Yes this issue can easily be fixed by the player and remembering to save, but there are enough cut scenes in the game that could easily act as a saving point for the level which would solve the games biggest flaw.\n\nGraphically, Aarklash is gorgeous.  This game could quite easily pass as a recently released title due to the high graphical fidelity on show.  All the main character models are all extremely high quality, and enemy models are slightly lower in quality but still look decent enough given the rest of the games high quality textures.  The game’s UI is OK to navigate, however a scaling of the UI also gets effected dramatically with the resolution you are playing in, meaning I was playing in 4K, so my UI was extremely small and I had to resort to getting uncomfortably close to my screen to even be able to read the text.\n\nI played Aarklash on the medium difficulty, and was happy with the challenges presented to me. A lot of people have commented on the community forums that they are finding even easy mode hard, but I feel as long as you take your time to build your characters properly, and equip them with the correct loot, then you shouldn’t have any problems, and even if you still do run into issues then you can just make full use of the in game pause mechanic to plan out your every attack since well…that’s what the feature is there for.  Upon completing the game, you will unlock the Rag’Narok difficulty level which you can probably guess, ramps up the difficulty to deathly levels and only should be taken on by hard core players.\n\nEach of the game’s chapters is split into a handful of smaller levels; some of the levels will merely be a case of working your way around the map and killing any of the foes you come across in order to find the exit. Others will include some quite interesting puzzles for you to master. None of the puzzles are mindboggling difficult to figure out, some require a little bit of thought, whilst others rely on your reaction times by moving characters across the map avoiding obstacles.  I thought the addition of the puzzles broke up the fighting sections of the game quite nicely and gave you a chance to experience something different.\n\nI finished Aarklash: Legacy in just under 7 hours. I do feel there is a good portion of replay ability on offer though; given the fact you can either ramp up the difficulty for a second play through, or even just using different characters throughout the story mode to give you a different game play experience.\n\nApart from the UI scaling issue when it comes to higher resolutions, the other technical problem I encountered was very long loading times; almost to the point of me thinking the game had crashed. I was playing the game being installed on a regular HDD rather than an SSD but I have no loading problems on much more demanding games on a regular HDD, so there is clearly an optimization problem here. Thankfully there aren’t too many loading screens to deal with so this issue can be easily overlooked.\n\nAarklash: Legacy was a sparkling gem in the rough for me. I didn’t expect much going into it, but was pleasantly surprised with the quality of game play and impressive graphics on show. It felt very much like a top down version of World of Warcraft with the different class roles, talent system and looting mechanics on offer.  The medium length campaign mode could be classed as being on the short side, but given the high production values on show, I would highly recommend people not take that into too much consideration. The price of £14,99 may be a little on the steep side for people on the fence about this game, but I would definitely recommend tactical minded people to pick up Aarklash: Legacy.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

A lot of people compare it with Baldur's Gate but it has more in common with Freedom Force and other tactical games with "less RPG" and more "tactics" due a heavy emphasis on micromanagement and less so on itemization and characterization.  Character customization is fun but fairly linear and you can respec your characters outside of combat at any time.  Battles can be fun and difficulty is somewhat high by today's standards.  Graphics are pretty good.\n\nSome may enjoy the puzzles in this game and range from condescendingly easy to slightly annoying but solvable.  I feel that they are a detriment because they're too easy for fans of puzzle solving and annoying to fans of pure micromanagement.  The story is largely ignorable and the voice acting is mostly very bad.  There's a lot of poor grammar within the tooltips and the dialogue.\n\nThe item system is one of the worst I've seen in a game.  You can outfit your characters with various trinkets and jewelery for small stat increases, but progression is mostly very flat.  It's fun in games like Baldur's Gate to find various weapons with neat mods but in this game it begins to feel like a chore to make sure your healer upgrades his "+5% healing done" trinket to "7% healing done."  There's certainly no meaningful customization to be done with the items either because the mods are so linear, so they would have been better off not having items in the first place a la Freedom Force.\n\nThe game is pretty short, but if it were any longer it would get repetitive.  I wouldn't pay full price for it.\n\nIn short:\n\nTHE GOOD:\n-Challenging tactical "RPG" that demeands significant micromanagement\n-Simple, but effective customization of character trees allows for a decent variety of gameplay options\n-The game knows its audience and doesn't cram storyline down your throat\n\nTHE BAD:\n-Tooltips and dialogue lack polish\n-Poor storyline, weak voice acting\n-Itemization is weak\n-Relatively short game\n-Puzzles often feel more annoying than thought provoking\n\nOverall, it's a decent game for the right gamer, but I wouldn't pay full price for it.\n","November 1, 2014","true","23.7"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

With Aarklash Legacy they manage to provide an amazing tactical rpg experience at pretty much the cost of all other areas of the game. Real Time w/ Pause (RTwP) combat is where it shines and it is certainly the best isometric rtwp we've had recently.\n\nI have read some stuff about people not liking the puzzles in the game, I found them fine. I enjoyed most of them and it was a nice change of flow to the endless barrage of fights.\n\nThe characters have lots of interesting attributes, E.G. the healer not able to regen mana, she has to feast on allies' hp to gain mana back. This skill can be upgraded so that the ally has buffs when feasted upon and even regenerates more than was feasted. Lots of tactical combat, having to carefully position your characters to avoid friendly fire and it manages it well. Rarely did I have an ally running into friendly fire unintentionally.\n\nWhat it sacrifices is pretty much everything else, lackluster story, mediocre progression, (You max out your chars about halfway through the game,) sub-par to average voice acting, An item system that just seems tagged on, and very little immersion.\n\nThe game itself is pretty much a series of combats, you know that around every corner will be assorted bad guys and the plot comes up with a decent explanation for having skeletons fighting alongside humans, demons, angels, elementals, etc. If you enjoy RTwP tactical rpgs, then this shouldn't be a drag considering how well done it is. I was totally fine with it until about 3/4ths through the game, when there was no more character progression, all chars maxed out in levels, pretty much nowhere to go there.

Increasingly rare for me to say this these days, but this was a hidden gem that many will sleep on. Most will probably try to compare it to something like Balder's Gate/Dragon Age but it's more like Diablo where you control 4 people and can control then entire party. You can pause it and q up a whole string of commands and you will have to. This game is about combat and puzzles, more than NPC blah blah and that was a welcome mat for me, though the story wasn't terrible and the ending wasn't half bad. Only gripe is the game started out hard as nails and around the middle of the second Act it seemed impossible at times, then Act3 got steamrolled and I one shot the final boss... still though for 20 bucks or even waiting for a sale, is a steal for something like this. Was a really high quality game despite one crash, and a few niggles with pathfinding here and there. Given there's just not enough games like this, very easy to overlook.

Yeah, I've completed it and it ain't really that bad. But there are too many things wrong with the game for me to recommend it.\n\nThe bad:\n- The puzzles are stupid and unnecessary. I like puzzle games, but not the way Aarklash did it.\n- The final fight is boring, easy, uninspiring and unfinished. It just ends without explaining anything. Maybe a buildup for a sequel?\n- The path finding is abysmal. A personal annoyance...

It's sort of like Diablo and a turn-based squad game had a baby -- Active pause lets you give orders to your squad of adventurers, and then things unfold in real time.\nPros: 1. GREAT atmosphere and novel setting. The STORY itself could be a bit more polished, but the characters have personality and variety. I thought not being able to create your own character (you choose from pregens) would be an obstacle but it's NOT, the players are likable and learning their story is interesting.\n2. Novel random look system -- there are no weapons and armor to gather but instead a variety of jewelry you choose for each character. Not the deepest loot system, but I enjoyed it and found it sufficient.\n3. Game is challenging and requires REAL strategy. The key to the game is developing your characters abilities to complement each other. You both need things like tanks, healers, and glass cannons AS WELL as characters who's abilities interact in different, and sometimes surprising ways.\n4. OPTIONS with your characters. There are eight different characters and they all play differently and synergize with each other in different ways. There is a combination that will be a favorite for anybody, from the most conventional hack and slasher to the most devious min-maxer.\n5. Combat is fun, challenging, and interesting. you have to leverage your own abilities as well as deal with the abilities of your opponents - either locking down their skills, stealing them, or dodging them. Likewise you must counter the enemies attempts to do the same.\n6. Game is hard enough on normal difficulty but upper difficulties should be challenging to the best strat-rpg'er... and if you like the game enough for a second play-through it promises to remain a challenge.\n7. There is plenty of game here. Although quite linear, I've put much time into it and only now have gotten to the third act -- which may or may not be the final one.\n8. You can enjoy it in small installments. do a couple of combats in 15-30 minutes, play something else, or slog through it. I've done a bit of both and it's good to have a game that doesn't require a big time commitment to enjoy.\n\nCons:\n1. As I said, it's quite linear. Nothing resembling an open world here, and not much fork in the road either. Still, the ride is scenic and pleasurable, even if it is on rails.\n2. Loot could use more variety, though it IS interesting enough to require you to make choices and move things around.\n3. As I said, the SETTING is great, but the story is not as great as the characters and world are. I have gone quite far and I know a lot more about the factions in the world than anything meaningful going on between them. And the main bad guy is bad. To nobody's surprise.\n\nAll told, I recommend this game -- and can honestly say I'd already be up for a sequel if it ever came out. It does the trick.","November 22, 2014","true","50.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smitelight/recommended/222640/","Smitelight","Smite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smitelight/","2134 products in account","Aarklash is a combination of contemporary gameplay concepts packaged in a thoroughly enjoyable original game world.  The real-time tactical gameplay may be paused for strategy and intelligent action queuing at any time, akin to Bioware's Mass Effect or Dragon Age series.  This does a fine job of straddling the line between overwhelmingly reactionary (hardcore RTS) and drudgingly micromanagey (omg stahp, Sid Meier) to land in a comfortable sweet spot.\n\nCore character roles are all familiar and easy to spot, ie DPS, Tank, Support, and perhaps overly so.  While you can re-spec skill points any time you aren't in combat and sans penalty, nothing will change the pigeonholed duties of any single character.  Different characters do, however, provide equally different approaches to those roles.  Your high-armor taunty starting tank feels utterly different from the high-HP drainy tank introduced later.  Your AoE stun battlefield mage DPS is wholly unique from the fear kiting AoE burst damage lich DPS.  Skill points can dramatically change the implementation of a skill.  One skill tree path alters a targeted taunt into an aggro-stacking aura, as an example.  Balance is maintained well enough that I never found myself forced into a specific team for pure efficacy, and I appreciated that, too.\n\nAarklash's (Aardvarks?) visuals and style are also quite original.  The graphics avoid eye bleedingly generic, but never so artsy or stylized that anything becomes abstract.  The audio always feels appropriate and organic, managing to be pleasant without standing out in most cases.  I never had any "just walked into Gestahl's Magitech facility" moments, here.\n\nMost characters deserve genuine emotional investment.  Dialog (with decent voice acting) and individual foibles are believable as well as interesting.  The giant, ruthless, kangaroo/lizard-booty'd, test-tube grown, magical cyborg miner-slave-become-indentured-bounty-hunter, armored tank girl just happens to also be everyone's sweet, caring, occasionally naive, gentle voiced, younger "sister" stand-in and I never questioned it once.  The people on both sides of the over-arching power struggle had no clear moral high ground.  Your heros and their guildmates are emphatically not "good" people but neither are they evil.  Their motives are usually easily understood but subjective morality is a significant factor for precisely nobody.  Both protagonists and antagonists are driven by a combination of geas'd contracts, pseudofamilial loyalties, and outright selfishness.\n\nThe story was quirky, unless the last paragraph didn't make that obvious, but ultimately disposable.  The developer did a great deal of world building and complex background development... then slapped a generic "run from the crooked law and find the macguffin" Hollywood plot on top.  There was not a great deal of character growth either, which I felt was a real shame.\n\nI had a lot of fun playing the game and would cheerfully play it again were an iota of reason to do so present.  The downside from the flexibility of free skill respecs lies in there being no real point to starting over to see how a totally different build would handle the game's events.  Equipment is just random stacks of minor stat boosts, rarer items simply having more picks from the general pool of boosts and higher levels providing slightly less minor boosts.  There's no real grinding, collecting, or optimization to be had here by the hardcore gamer.\n\nAarklash: Legacy seems to have suffered from a lot of player butt-hurt stemming from a steep difficulty curve.  The game is challenging in the classic sense.  That said, nearly every party wipe I experienced was perfectly preventable without any foreknowledge if I'd more closely observed enemy stat boxes and spell countdowns.  The gameplay tutorial even stresses that the player must be attentive to these resources.  I felt combat was entirely fair with reasonable demands on my decidedly average skill level.  The game is first and foremost a squad-based strategy RPG.  If you go into it expecting a pick-up-and-master casual or arcade game you're going to be brutallized, and deserve it.  I felt it was slightly more forgiving than Final Fantasy Tictacs (PSX), if simply for the fact that the most devastating boss actions are interruptable or redirectable while mid-cast.\n\nOverall, I'd have to give the game a 7.5 out of 10.  The minimal replay value and disappointing story were the only serious downsides.  The musical score, while inoffensive, was also inconsequential.  Where Aarklash really shines is in the moment; during a dicy moment in combat or affectionate banter between morally ambiguous guildmates, the time just flies by.","June 11, 2014","true","8.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The game mechanics are solid, the skill tree is pretty cool for each character, and you are not locked into the tree, can reset it for free.   The combat is very much position based, adding a lot of possibilities to each fight, especially when you add in the skill trees.  Want a healer that also damages units the heal passes through, well then choose that path down the skill tree.  Pretty neat combinations and possibilities.  The characters are interesting, and so far the story is pretty good, and somewhat original.  The character Bio for each character is interesting, and hopefully the full story unlocks as the game is played.\n\nIt has a few rough edges.  I don't like the map overview, it seems unfinished, static, and dead.  Finished a map, and really had no idea where to go, or for that matter what i was supposed to be doing, as I have not found a quest log either (don't think it exists?).  After beating the boss, and looking at the map a while, I finally chose to wander back towards the start of the map.  After a short time it did finally trigger a cut scene, and spared me the long walk back, but it just seemed a little rough around the edges.  It also hates the steam overlay on my computer, everytime I hit tab it pops open the overlay.  While chatting with friends, the text lags horribly.  So might want to turn it off.\n\nNone of this really detracts from the game in anyway.   Having a lot of fun with this so far.

A few puzzle sections break up combat, but for the most part, you quickly move from fight to fight, with small story cutscenes interspersed between.\n\nSome of the story concepts were interesting in their own right, and the characters, while sort of one dimensional, have interesting backgrounds and show pieces of deeper characterization that might come to the fore if the game were more story intensive. You catch bits and peices of story that are clearly meant to be travelled to and elaborated mor eon, in sequels that will never come, which i a real shame because the game is genuinely fun.\n\nParty set up is 4 characters out of 8, each character fitting into a particular role: Tank, physical damage, magical/CC, and Healer. You get 2 of each character and are forced to use every charatcer at leats once in the game due to a party split. The characters are all competent in their roles, but at the highest difficulty, there definitely seems like there would be a push to only use the most optimal party. The two tanks are divided between a more defensive and buff oriented tank, and a more offense and steroid oriented tank. The physical attackers are a ranged gun-dwarf that debuffs physical attacks, and a sly rogue goblin that inflicts massive critical damage, and blind and silences foes. The magical attackers are a classical sorceress, and a lich who debuffs, charms and controls enemies with hexes. The healers feel the most imbalanced in their abilities: One is a powerhouse healer that can eventually turn the entire part immune to damage for 5 seconds, and the other is an orc shaman who can invert his abilities for use on enemies, or buffs on allies. It's a neat idea, but in a combat game, very little trumps simply being able to be invincible for 5 seconds, on  a7 second cooldown.\n\nYou can mix and match party members as you like, but the setup of the game very strongly encourages selecting one character from each role.\n\nLoot is passable ARPG fare and entirely random - items you don't want ca be junked into ameter that eventually spits out a "Epic" tier item, so recycling old items for new ones gives you new and better gear. None of it is super interesting - it's all just bigger number buffs on your stats, but it does the job.\n\nWould definitely recommend the game to anyone feeling that isometric combat game itch - it scratches it wonderfully, and while the story leaves you wanting more, the combat is fun enough to where you could eaisly pull 2 or 3 plays, if you wanted to beat higher difficulty levels, or experiment with other party configurations.","March 27","true","31.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

If I could, I'd put this game into a neutral category. This is the kind of game that will polarize people into love or hate. I feel that a month or two of refinement, additional assets and play testing, could have elevated this game into something much greater than 7/10.\n\nThe negatives, in order of what was most noticeable:\n\n- Each character has 4 skills to choose from. You only gain 1 skill point per level and most of the time, you will put the point into an existing skill. Therefore, for the first 10 levels, the skills don't tend to vary combat that much. This is boring. I never felt a sense of elation, that comes with leveling in MMO RPGs or single player RPGs.\n\nAlthough I like the branching nature of the skill tree ( which modifies the effect, of the skill slightly ), the lack of skills feels RPG-light compared to a conventional RPG where clerics and mages might have 6-9 different spells.\n\nBoth your hero and skill points cap at level 20, which means that of the 4 skills, one was designed to be a dead end skill by the developers, since mathematically you will only have 1 default point in that particular skill. I'll give you a hint and say that some of the buffs and debuffs are a waste of casting time and mana, considering that the game focuses on DPS, stunlocking and healing.\n\nIt costs 3 skill points to respec your skill tree, which is too expensive.\n\nAlthough I liked the strange, unique and avant-garde mechanics of the tank having to spend hit points, to perform skill actions, it does not work work very well for the first 5 levels, since she doesn't have a large enough health pool, to perform many actions. Similarly, the cleric does not regenerate mana and has to steal health from her companions, in order to generate magic points. She has to almost kill her companions, in order to heal them, which is amusing but likewise, doesn't really work for the first 5 levels or so ( this is a balance issue ). The amusing irony is that the mage ends up being the best, most versatile healer in the game.\n\n\n- The tactical combat side of the game is, for the most part, tedious. There are probably only around 20 different monsters to fight which is simply not enough for an action RPG game. This game would need, at a bare minimum 50 different monsters. Something on the scale of 100 different monsters, would drastically elevate this game. Compared to the Dungeons and Dragons monster manual, this game is sorely lacking!\n\nCombat consists of figuring out which opposing control wizard to stunlock, taking out the cleric and DPSing the enemy. Then you have to cross your fingers and hope that the RNG ( random number generator ) Gods are in your favour. Battles are usually a landslide, there are very few, close battles. You either efficiently dispatch the enemies or you unfortunately lose an ally, who ends up face down in the dirt and then you have to try and struggle to get a team-mate to revive him. The character doing the reviving will come under fire, which will delay the reviving, each time he takes a hit. I usually play games on the hardest difficulty levels but I had to set the difficulty to medium. The only difference is that on the harder difficulty levels, your allies will end up face down in the dirt, which increases the chances of a party wipe, then the game automatically ends and you have to reload the game and fight out the same battle. The harder difficulty levels are extraordinarily tedious and resemble the kind of grind in an MMO. Medium ( the default difficulty ) was too easy for me, so I never managed to find a happy equilibrium.\n\n\n- The environments for Act 1 and 2 were bland. Act 1, the wilderness was the worst and gave the false impression of open world exploration. Realistically, for the first 5-10 levels, there is a set path to follow, in terms of finding treasure chests and being able to fight monsters at the level you are at. The only way to figure out the path, is to take the wrong turn, wipe and reload. This is tedious. The game environment becomes almost completely linear in Act 2 and 3, which is the way that Act 1 should have been. I did like the art direction for Act 3.\n\n\nThe positives:\n\n+ I immediately liked the characters, plot, voice acting and dialogue.

PUZZLE GAME!\n\nYou run into puzzles everywhere (They aren't too hard for me thankfully) and even some battles are small puzzles in which you have to read enemies abilities and then deduct the best order to kill them. Often it's something like raiser-healer-debuffer-bufffer-warriors and if you kill enemies in the wrong order they're raised or healed.\n\nAlso, putting major spoilers in the load screen just before you reach that point in the story is not apprechiated by me. Not at all. Seriously. That's one of the silliest things I ever saw in a game so far.\n\nOtherwise the game is quite decent, skills are adequate, battles are fairly fast and furious, the game looks nice and runs smooth. No errors but I wouldn't expect those in a game released more then 2 years ago.\n\nThere are some downsides to the game as well, equipment for one is abysmal with everyone being able to equip earrings, a ring, a relic and a necklace. All of those are randomly generated. Weapons and armor? Nah. Potions? Nuh uh.  Anything but the four afore mentioned items? Nup.\n\nWould I recommand the game?\n\nYep. The game could have been better but it's quite a lot fun to play and that's what counts and makes me forgiving of little loot vareity, sillyness and even of PUZZLES.\n\nP.s. I wonder why this game has the rpg tag. I haven't been able to make a single choice in 8 hours that affected anything storywise.

The story, setting and characters aren't developed extremely well, but it's still interesting, despite the many typos, translation mistakes and predictability. The game offers you a good choice of character to use, and the battle system is centered around the 4 skills each characters can use. The key to mastering the battle system lies in the synergy between characters, your ability to time your skill usage properly and controlling the battlefield. It's fast paced, the challenge is generally high but fair and the game has no downtime. It's not fantastic, it doesn't offer a huge amount of depth, but it's still a really enjoyable game that is worth playing.

Thats basically it.  After a while the game just gets dull and monotonous, it because more annoying than fun.  You don't get to customize your characters (though the character designs are pretty cool), and there are only earings, artifacts, and rings, which just improve stats, the models don't change at all.  So with this, (and some really meh voice acting) you don't really get attached to the characters.\n\nOther things that don't change: character abilities.  You like having four of the same abilities for each character for the entire game?  I don't.  On level up you can spend a point to make the ability cost less mana, or do more damage, or heal more, but at the end of the day they are the same.  Yawn.\n\nAlso, some of the mechanics are just, well, kinda stupid.  You have a tank character that has to spend health to use abilities.  Your healer cannot regenerate mana and so has to steal it from your two other allies, a rogue and a mage, and they can get busted up really badly.  So all you are doing is just constantly healing your tank, juggling the health of your two other characters, and trying to keep the healer with enough mana.  At first this kind of sounds interesting, but after a while, and a lot of fighting, it just gets really, really annoying.\n\nOther people may have fun playing this, and it does have a good strategy game at it's core, its just too bland and boring for me, and annoying.  3/10","October 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 39 of 73 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","39","73","0","2"

The battle system is reminiscent of those of Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights, using a pausable real-time system that allows you to plan without ever getting bogged down.  The character roster seems somewhat limited (you can have four active characters, each with four abilities), but the number of ways to customize each character, and the ways in which you can combine them, give you a surprisingly huge number of options.  And if a character isn't pulling his weight, you can respec him whenever you want.\n\nWhere the game really shines, however, is the tactical nature of its battles.  Simply standing around and hitting enemies with regular attacks is a good way to lose battles quickly.  Enemies have multiple abilities and will use them to full effect, and you need to do the same.  Heal injured characters, draw foes away from the more fragile members of your team, and pull your characters out of range when foes start charging up their big attacks - or just knock them down to disrupt their ability.\n\nAarklash: Legacy isn't quite like any other game I've played, in a good way.

There is a lot of interesting potential character/party builds and since you can respec and change the party any time you aren't in combat you are free to try them all.\n\nAnother feature I really like is that you can pull up the enemies stats and skills.

It has all of the strategy of a TBS but none of the slow boring mop up.\n\nThe characters are all unique, with interesting back stories and relationships that are written like an actual adult human being wrote it. (a rarity these days) The voice acting is done well imo though that's subjective and the story is a well-trodden plot device but the whole backstory of the Goldmongers and the Quorr and the idea of a "Wheel-Sword" (one warrior at each wheel of a caravan wagon?) is pretty original.

(really easy to move all your characters instead of just one when you are learning the game, learning that you have to be constantly paying attention to projectiles and you have to actually read some of the enemy descriptions to figure out how to beat them)\n\nI don't know what else to say, great job guys, sorry this isn't getting more press. If you keep the content coming I'll keep buying. This is an awesome enginge you guys have please keep using it, it'll catch on.\n\nI've played Cyanide games before and I can see how the gameplay in this is an iteration of the combat in Game of Thrones and Of Orks and Men but if the combat in those games turned you off trust me, it's much more responsive, fast paced, and gamer friendly than those other titles.\n\nThis is by far the best Cyanide game yet and a must-play if you're a fan of the old Infinity Engine games.","February 27, 2014","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will list my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n+Good Graphics\n+Good Combat\n+Ability to reset skills at no cost\n+Synergy between party members\n\nCons:\n-Short game with little to no replay value\n-Poor character voice acting and timing\n-Puzzles are very easy\n-Gear is not so great, randomized.\n-Leveling is not balanced right, you will max out your characters abilities halfway through game and there will be no further development on them the rest of game aside from random gear you find.\n\nI enjoyed playing the game, but the ending left me wanting more from it. It is a decent game, just don't expect it to be perfect or well polished. If you can look past the faults it is actually a fun play.","January 26","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The dialogue is a bit childish but a lot of RPG's seem that way. But the focus of this game is combat, and it is almost constant fighting. It reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics, in that there is some story and occasional chats amongst the party, but it is mostly about battle after battle, and they are finely tuned to be really challenging. It is real time with pause so plays sort of like Dragon Age only with deeper and more interesting combat. There are also quite a few puzzles.\n\nOverall it is kind of like a lower budget Dragon Age Origins. There are no cutscenes and no questing, but there is the combat and they put more effort into that than Bioware ever did. Each class has a skill tree which gives 2 options for each skill/spell, so you can customise the characters to play how you need them to play, and in such a challenging game, you need to make sure you make smart decisions. You can respec any time for free, and some fights you will want to respec just for that one fight. I don't think casual gamers would last long in this game, but fans of games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, FFT, etc, will love this.\n\nI hope more people buy it so maybe we can get a sequel with a bit more fleshed out story and stuff.

But otherwise, it's a great addition to any library, especially tactical RPG fans.\n\nIf you like anything like the Baldur's Gate series, XCom, and FF Tactics, you'll love this game.\n\nThe 8 characters play very differently, and even more so depending on the build.  The skill trees branch off in each skill, and there are even 2 variations on the ending of each branch.  There are SO many viable options, it's great!  There is no "this is the only way to build character X or you'll suck", and that has become a huge problem IMO with games like this.\n\nThe enemies are varied, and challenging, and often enough brutally difficult.  There are a number of fights that had be throwing my hands up and /headdesk'ing.  The key to this game is TACTICS.  Varying how you engage each group to take on the different roles and setups that each INDIVIDUAL encounter brings.  Some are the "same" kind of fight, but the skills will change from race to race and so a unit that may be a melee bruiser for race A, you'll engage entirely differently for race B.\n\nThe characters are fun and engaging, and the conversations are well done.  They're by no means stellar, and no one has any particular lines that are incredibly memorable, but they're done well enough that you don't lose interest, or better yet, want to pull your hair out.  The story is even good, but nothing wildly new or exciting.  In fact, it's rather cliche, minus the fact that your team isn't really the "good guys".\n\nEven with all the lack-luster parts of the game, this is still superbly done.  I really cannot recommend this enough.","April 20","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The hassle-free respeccing between fights lets you really get experimental with ways to counter your opponents.\n\nThere are some alright non-combat puzzle elements there, and the story/voice acting is surprisingly enjoyable too, but the combat is the real gem of this game.\n\nAs for downsides: The RPG elements are pretty basic, but it wears that on its sleve.

By the time your starting party memebers reach level 4 and have all their base skills unlocked you might feel like you've reached the end of their variability, and you would be wrong.\n\nThe talent trees look sparse because, simply put, there is no fluff to be ignored, like so many other *cough* world of warcraft *cough wheeze* games. Every point in every tree is meaningful. Yes, even the ones that "merely" reduce a spells mana cost by 10% or increase a spells damage by 20%. Those small numbers matter in this game.\n\nThen there are the truly game changing options, like a curse that makes an enemy's incoming heals cause damage to them instead. It sounds like a parlor trick or a gimmick at first, until you encounter enemies that heal themselves for large amounts every time they attack you, or sub-bosses that can heal an ally to full in a split second.\n\nThe best part about the talent trees? You can reset them on a per-character basis for free as many times as you want (outside of combat only, of course), to A) check out whether that cool-sounding change to the warlock's nuke attack that turns it into a channeled health drain is as good as it sounds/fits your preferred playstyle, and B) change the tools available to you in combat based on what kinds of enemies you are facing. Find yourself in a new area where none of the above-mentioned self-healing enemies are present? Go ahead and respec your shaman for increased potency on his heals, or even swap him out for a dedicated damage dealer.\n\nAs for the combat itself, well, it's a bit like trying to play a relatively simplistic version of some other kind of game *cough* world of warcraft *ahem*, sorry about that. Except your party of 4 is controlled entirely by you. The active-combat-but-with-pause tag applies well, but unlike other entries in the genre (mass effect 2 sort of? KOTOR 1/2, dragon age.. um.. anyone other than bioware making games in this genre?), the combat system feels like it was built around the pausing element specifically, rather than adding the pause option in as a last second adjustment to a game that was too bulky to be practical without it.\n\nCoping with powerful enemies in this game has much more to do with positioning and actively responding to enemy actions, via commands issued during pauses. Where most RPG games expect you to survive a powerful spell by simply having accrued enough experience points from grinding to boost your health and durability stats to the point where enemy attacks are negligible, Aarklash offers you no such opportunity. Dodge or die. (sorry to have to make a pop-culture reference, but it's kind of like Team Four Star's DBZ Abridged Piccolo is watching over your shoulder as you play! You don't want to let Piccolo down, do you?.. he's probably going to hit you in the face if you do)\n\nThere are also several steam achievements in the game that are actually difficult to achieve, such as two particularly nasty challenges based on completing certain portions of the game without ever using the pause feature. It is hard. It is also fun, and satisfying to finally succeed. That is all I feel compelled to say about it.\n\n---\nThere are a few downsides to the game I would like to address for the sake of being fair and balanced. The equipment and looting leaves much to be desired, and the ending of the game is one of those "Hey, you guys like sequels right?!" endings. Needless to say, if there is a sequel, I will be first in line with a fistful of dollars to throw unapologetically at the developers.\n\n---\nDid I mention that Wenzil is awesome?\n\n---\nWenzil is awesome.","October 28, 2014","true","32.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

However, its claims of "Tactical combat at its best!" seem to ring a little hollow, and I find the game to not offer enough tactical choices to really make any one battle different from another.\n\nYou have extremely limited options for customization, here.  You get four abilities to each character, with that character basically pre-defined by these abilities and some passives.  The "skill tree" is really just an upgrade tree for the skills each character has to have.  Each skill splits into two different branches, where they basically do something like one branch inflicts silence, and another does blindness.  Your only real choice is in which four of the eight characters you take.  The game trailer says something about "skills working together", but basically, all I see is bog-standard tank, DPS, heals, and control.  The game basically plays like a stripped-down version of a MMO's or DotA's combat, but with pausing, rather than the more tactical combat in Dragon Age.  In fact, there's an achievement for specifically NOT pausing, which makes me wonder why they advertised it as a pausable real-time like Baldur's Gate when it lacks the depth of such a game, and encourages you not to pause?  Smells slightly of false advertising.\n\nSkills are also either extremely expensive, or have extremely long cooldown times, so you basically only get to use them once per normal fight, and maybe 2-3 times in a boss fight... if they're useful at all, since several of them are rather situationally useful.  You recover full everything after a fight, anyway, so you might as well just throw the skills out there just because it's use it or lose it, but there isn't any real feel of that being tactically challenging.  Even playing hard mode, I didn't feel like I needed to do much but let my guys throw punches at whatever they target first, and just slap off all my skills one by one.  When you level up, your choice is mostly around which skill to pump up, but since you basically only get to use them one per fight, it's really more about just trying to pump enough points into a skill to either reduce its cooldown or mitigate it's situationalism so it's actually useful.  You can make one skill fully upgraded early, while leaving others the basic level, and one useful skill you can kind of use frequently can generally be better than a bunch of useless skills, but it's really dicey, and doesn't feel very rewarding as a gameplay mechanic.\n\nBoss fights are "more challenging", but I found the trick to them was generally more to just give them the Benny Hill/Yakkity Sax treatment, and just run circles around them while the rest of my party killed the minions, and while my skills cooldown timed out, rather than having to find some sort of interesting combo of skills that doesn't seem to exist.\n\nYou fight two swordsmen.  Then you fight a swordsman and an archer.  Then you fight a swordsman and TWO archers.  Then you fight two swordsmen and a mage that casts easily-dodged magic bolts.  All the while you get maybe a powerup that gives you a slightly different move every 12th fight.

However, its claims of "Tactical combat at its best!" seem to ring a little hollow, and I find the game to not offer enough tactical choices to really make any one battle different from another.\n\nYou have extremely limited options for customization, here.  You get four abilities to each character, with that character basically pre-defined by these abilities and some passives.  The "skill tree" is really just an upgrade tree for the skills each character has to have.  Each skill splits into two different branches, where they basically do something like one branch inflicts silence, and another does blindness.  Your only real choice is in which four of the eight characters you take.  The game trailer says something about "skills working together", but basically, all I see is bog-standard tank, DPS, heals, and control.  The game basically plays like a stripped-down version of a MMO's or DotA's combat, but with pausing, rather than the more tactical combat in Dragon Age.  In fact, there's an achievement for specifically NOT pausing, which makes me wonder why they advertised it as a pausable real-time like Baldur's Gate when it lacks the depth of such a game, and encourages you not to pause?  Smells slightly of false advertising.\n\nSkills are also either extremely expensive, or have extremely long cooldown times, so you basically only get to use them once per normal fight, and maybe 2-3 times in a boss fight... if they're useful at all, since several of them are rather situationally useful.  You recover full everything after a fight, anyway, so you might as well just throw the skills out there just because it's use it or lose it, but there isn't any real feel of that being tactically challenging.  Even playing hard mode, I didn't feel like I needed to do much but let my guys throw punches at whatever they target first, and just slap off all my skills one by one.  When you level up, your choice is mostly around which skill to pump up, but since you basically only get to use them one per fight, it's really more about just trying to pump enough points into a skill to either reduce its cooldown or mitigate it's situationalism so it's actually useful.  You can make one skill fully upgraded early, while leaving others the basic level, and one useful skill you can kind of use frequently can generally be better than a bunch of useless skills, but it's really dicey, and doesn't feel very rewarding as a gameplay mechanic.\n\nBoss fights are "more challenging", but I found the trick to them was generally more to just give them the Benny Hill/Yakkity Sax treatment, and just run circles around them while the rest of my party killed the minions, and while my skills cooldown timed out, rather than having to find some sort of interesting combo of skills that doesn't seem to exist.\n\nYou fight two swordsmen.  Then you fight a swordsman and an archer.  Then you fight a swordsman and TWO archers.  Then you fight two swordsmen and a mage that casts easily-dodged magic bolts.  All the while you get maybe a powerup that gives you a slightly different move every 12th fight.  Basically, every fight is exactly the same except for the boss fights, and then I tended to rely more upon giving them the Yakkity Sax than any more clever strategy.\n\nI also can't recommend this game for its story or characters.  Dialogue with the first four characters basically goes like this:\nDog-headed cleric woman: "Grr! I want to kill them all!"\nGolem tanker woman: "Heehee!

Its combat system is one of the best I saw on time. Complex skills that needs timing to unlock all its power, other skills that counters enemy tactics (convert enemy healing in damage, or taunt a chaneling protection shield from the enemy support to your tank), interruptions, blinds, silences, order queue which makes controling the WheelSwords smooth.\n\nThe loot system is kind of anecdotic. Sometimes the enemies drop stuff. Is worth it? I guess so, it helps to further customize your units, but getting the right combination of stats may be a problem, basically because every character is played diferently. One sacrifices hp every time it uses a skill, other don't have mana regeneration, etc. It may get difficult at first to learn the skills and checking all its skill tree branches, but once done, you may be swaping between them.\n\nAnother great thing is that you can rearrange the skill tree points whenever you want (out of combat), so you dont need to make a second run to try diferent tactics.\n\nThe puzzles are kind of easy, but entertaining until you realize how to do them (maybe a couple of them may give you problems until you realize how the mechanic is).\n\nThe maps are beautiful and the sound is ok.\n\nThe only con I see to the game is that you can never use all the characters at once :(\n\nI think I would recommend this game to the players that like tactical games (arma tactics, final fantasy tactis, dawn of war 2, xcom).","August 12, 2014","true","15.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The puzzles are also repetitive and this caused me to want the game to end quickly after chapter 2.\n\nI would only reccomened you buy this game on sale if you are after a challenging experience .","September 5, 2015","false","14.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

It doesn't help as well that the story slows in pace the further you progress with the ending being a cliffhanger that doesn't really resolve any of the questions that the game sets up from the beginning. It almost feels like the game started with a particular narrative in mind and about half way through they turned it into a generic bad-guy wanting to destroy the world.\n\nI'm definitely interested to see if they devs/IP release a sequel because there really is so much potential/originality in the content however the game/battles need a lot of polish before it becomes an RPG worth sinking time into.","March 27","false","13.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The things I like about this game is that it is really well done in the game play. The animation of the characters are smooth and it is challenging to play. The background graphics are stunning and very beautifully rendered and, though it does have it's quirks, the UI is pretty decent.\n\nBut, now for the bad. At first, when I started the game after downloading and installing it, there were no command choices at the start up screen! So, I used Win 10's compatability program and it fixed that problem. But another one now exists. The game crashes every minute of play or so. This is frustrating. I go so far against an enemy, and the game would crash with a pop-up pannel telling me that the game had crashed. I got outside the building and went against 2 other enemies and as soon as I defeted them, the game crashed again. And it crashed when one of the characters got an item. It crashed again when one of the characters went up a level. Then, I went to one more Boss villian of this section of the game and it crashed again! This does not make a  playable game. And it doesn't matter the settings, it will still crash.\n\nAlso, it would have been nice if it would let you choose or create your own characters, but that's not in the game. Also, when your character powers up, you have no choice where the power up points will go. But, I can set that aside if the above is somehow dealt with.\nI'll still play the game, but right now, I'm giving it a thumbs down with the buggy crashings.","February 21","false","2.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But certainly not worth $20.00!  If, like me, you can get it on sale, its worth a shot..I like pause n play tactics.. The heros dont reflect any gear you may obtain, to there appearance, but they only allow for jewlry slots (5 i think)..  But there is forking upgrade paths for each heroes 4 abilities.. 1 path at first, then after 2-3 upgrades, you choose 1 of 2 directions, effectively altering how the ability works, or strengthening it... It does look ok, but nothing thats gonna turn heads.. It does have some CTD issues occasionally..Its extremely linear, and enemies do not respawn, so theres no famring, and i havent felt "OP" at any point.. Granted i havent finished it.. There are certainly better titles out there, but i think i only payed a few bucks for it, so.. it was worth it for 5-10 dollars..\n\nSome of the battles dont allow for many ways to tackle them, until later on, when you start getting multiple teammates.. You can have up to 4 in you party.. Youve got your tanks, healers, ranged, and melee dps, Controllers (improtant), etc.. Much of the combat is absolutely necessary to utilize the pause-n-play feature...

BTW, ability design looks nice but reveals its annoyingly stupid and usinergic after giving it a try.

TY.\n\nProgression:\nthere is very little character progression in the game, it basicly comes down to get a skillpoint when you lvl, equep new gear.\nwhile i think it could have given a bit more here it actually doesnt take away from the gameplay, since there is 8 characters focused in each their area you never feel like you would have liked to build a char differently then it is by default.\nso this is ok for the game it is :)\n\nPuzzle's:\nall puzzle's tool between 2-10min to do, which is nice, it's not a puzzle game and therefore puzzle's should NEVER leave the player frustrated or truly wondering what he could do to get through it.\nthey where challenging enough to make me brain go "hmm" but not so challenging it went "FFS grrr" which is exactly how hard puzzle's should be in an RPG (if you want truly hard puzzle's go play an advanture game where the focus is puzzle's)\non top of that the puzzle's where well spread out through the game and never used more then 2-3 times (same type of puzzle).\nso very nicely done.\n\nFLOW:\ngameplay flow, properly the most importent in a game, and the one where RPG's normally truly fails.\nthis game did it perfectly: i never felt bored while going through the game, i never felt it took too long between combat or puzzle's dragged on for too long or that i needed to break up my advanture to do some silly timesink thing.\nthe flow was close to perfect and i was very engaged the entire time. so VERY well done.\n\nStory:\ni loved how the story doesn’t start with “you are the chosen one above all else, now go do your stuff of destiny blablabla” seriously RPG makers evolve beyond this already..\nso it was VERY nice that the story felt real and as something that from a fantasy pov was relatable, while not saying “you are the chosen one” they are not going “ow hell if you should know wth is going on or why you need to do stuff, just go randomly do stuff” which is the other extreme and again feels really forced and but.\nthis is something that almost all rpg fcks up -.- including AAA title’s which are truly horrible at this (sigh looking at the new Dragon age game and almost all other aaa title’s the last 10 years).\nSo as said it was nice that they did it in a way which felt “real”, now without spoiling too much they do move towards a “destiny” plot (although it isn’t destiny as such, but still I am a bit disappointed with the ending/last 2hours of gameplay story)\n\nCharacters:\nI LOVED this, how long time is it since, no wait I don’t remember a single RPG where you got this much diversity in characters to choose from, seriously :D\nAnd I don’t remember when I last got the chance to play a “bad” guy type thing..\nSo we got:\nOrc, goblings, ogra’s (which actually look their part not just stupid reskins of humans), we got 2 legged machine centure thing, we got a human sorc(only human so it is nice to have), we got a LICH!! You can play as a lich I mean how awesome is that :D\nA “chaos dwarf” thing, and we got at the end a hyena humanoid though :P\nAnyway the playable cast and personality difference is HUGE for such a little game\nAnd the playstyle is very different for each character which is really nice.\nI can’t remember a single RPG before this one where I was thinking “damn I wish I could use more companions at one time” my normal though is “damn I wish I could remove these annoying companions they do nothing for the gameplay or story, just in the damn way”, but here I truly felt like I wanted to be able to use more of them all the time, and it was great.\n\nVoiced:\nThe game is fully voiced and while it’s not the best voicing it is a decent+ job and it adds a TON to the gameplay, I am really happy it is there, the only character I felt was a bit out of character was the lich. But personal pref I guess :)\nBut it is a big plus too the game, and they had some cool ref and things they said while they stood around, one ref that sprang into mind was the gobbling saying “gobbling: well if we are just gonna stand here lets play some bloodbowl” just awesome :P hehe\n\nMaps/lvls:\nThe lvl and map design was very well done, big enough for me to explore with rewards for doing so, small hidden stuff as well worth getting.\nAnd never did they show me something then go “nanana if you cant figure it out you ain’t getting it” which is annoying as hell in every game they do that.. if I didn’t find it I don’t wanna know it exist! I wanna go through the game feeling that I found every treasure and got the maximum out of my playthrough:\nThis game does that perfectly.\nOn top of that I didn’t once feel that the map design hindered my combat gameplay. So very good job on this as well.\n\nNow there is a ton of good stuff and there is of cause a bit bad as well, not much though:\n\nhmm not enough space to write the cons so will do it fast :) (stupid steam)\nso ending left a lot to be desired.\nautosave wasn't very good.\nif you have a party member die you lose the game if you dont ress him fast enough (19h only an issue 4 times)\nits very liniar but it is fine because it holds you engaged by the story and awesome characters.\n\nI do hope they will make more like this even though I doubt it, I had never heard of it before and it was by pure luck I bought it and I am VERY happy I did so.\nWELL WORTH both the time and money :)","November 28, 2014","true","20.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

On medium / normal every fight is a struggle and the damage and healing is just not good enough, plus the controls are gammy and the character do not always do as you tell them to.  They have a mind of their own.\n\nIf you put it on easy then there is no challenge as you just walk into a huge group of enemies and they do not even damage your team, it is like God mode.  I fear the devs have tried pleasing everyone and made a really hard game for the people who get a giant e-peen for cheesing their way through impossible fights and then made a faceroll mode for people who can barely use a mouse.  There is no middle ground.\n\nThen there are the out of place puzzles you would normally find in a budget hidden object/puzzle style flash game on facebook.  Look it I wanted to do level puzzles I would play on my wifes laptop.\n\nThink I will stick to stuff like Baulders Gate and Pillars of Eternity.

Usually the pause feature is just there to cover up for the fact that the game is a clickfest with too much information and too many commands poorly presented or hidden in menus.\n\nAarklash has created the perfect pause-based gameplay.  The streamlined controls, interface, and action queue system present all the information you need without overloading your senses and all the control you want without forcing you to micromanage every single attack.\n\nThe enemies are billiantly created, with complementary abilities and ingenius passives that force you to examine each enemy group, develope new strategies to counter their abilities, and constantly watch for them to start casting so you can pause, check what spell they're using, and decide how/whether to interrupt or dodge.  You WILL get that feeling of "oh my god I just pulled through that by the hair of my teeth" that you get when you take an intimidating clusker-f**k and turn it around through skilled reactions and battle control.  It's pretty rewarding, not to mention fun.\n\nThe player's abilities are fairly well done as well, though I wish there are been a bit more depth.  You only get 21 points, which is enough to max out 2 of the 8 lines and almost one of the others.  In some cases this forces you to make tough choices and can lead to different gameplay, but often there seems (to me) to be a clear winner.\n\nItems appear to all be procedurally generated with three levels of rarity and the ability to recycle ones you don't want for  new highest quality items.  On the one hand, it gives you some of the constant upgrades you get from a rng gear game, but on the other hand you get so much gear it doesn't really matter.  That's all good, except the game also has no gear you might consider "special", so you never really get the feeling of having found anything cool or worth keeping.  Also, many of the stat mechanics are unknown as well (such as armor), which means it's hard to even decide what to use.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles in the game, and they are generally fun and at least semi-challenging (difficulty varies widely).\n\nThe story isn't bad, but lacks depth.  The characters are well flushed out, especially given how limited the dialogue is.  However, several of them are pretty much useless (Bo Lahm, for example is a crappy hybrid horrible at both tanking and damage).  You'll have to use each of them for a little while, but for most of the game you'll use only the same 4 characters.\n\nOverall, it's a OK game on top of a fantastic combat system.  They could definitely have made it great with a bit more work, but I definitely recommend the game to any tactical RPG players.","January 7, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I always loved this style of combat for its tactical nature but in aarklash you can and must look at your enemies info panel to see exactly what abilities they have to know what to interupt, what effects to steal, if you need to spread out, if you need to block skillshots with your party members, if you need to flee after they die because they explode, if they heal, reduce your healing, etc.  The fights can be complex and do feel kind of like puzzles to solve because all the info is avail but you must figure out how to use it and what you have to win.\n\nI've not seen any towns, shops or anything but you do level up, find loot, spend points in a skill tree of sorts and find more party members to swap between with radically differnet play styles.  It seems to be a very linear experience solely based around its fantastic combat system and thats actually fine.","July 21, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played that this is a deeper and improved game in the same vein. If you haven't played Confrontation, Aarklash is a combat (and puzzle) heavy game with limited exploration and a story that won't win any awards. If you're looking for a Baldur's Gate type game, this isn't it. This is more along the lines of Icewind Dale but much shorter (I'd expect 12ish hours or more depending on difficulty with puzzles and combat).\n\nThis game does tactical combat very well. Combat is real time with pause using a group of 4 (out of a possible 8 starting in Act 2). All the potential heroes have 4 unique abilities with 2 possible trees for each move that can totally change the base move. Movement is required to dodge enemy abilities and some bosses have instant kill moves so positioning is key. HP and Mana refill quickly after battles so there's not much downtime between engagements either.\n\nI'm not very familiar with the background and lore of Aarklash but the taste of the world given in this game makes me wish someone would make a big "proper" RPG in this setting as it seems full of potential. The story quality is average though the subject is unique.  It really starts to seem cliché going into Act 3 but they throw a very nice twist in during the last couple of seconds so make sure you're listening as it'd be easy to miss if you're distracted.\n\nMaps are very linear with a handful of small detours for chests or the occasional optional puzzle protecting chests. The inventory is very limited too as each hero has 4 equipment slots and there are only 4 types of items in the entire game. There's some limited but random crafting too. After turning in enough items to fill a bar you get an epic item of the same type of item that finished filling the bar.\n\nOverall if you like tactical combat heavy games and aren't expecting a sprawling epic story spanning several dozen hours Aarklash is worth a look.","July 24, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this changes quick and after a while you might scream at the game for being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But don't let that take your fun away, because as challenging as it might get, it never gets unfair. You just need more knowledge about your enemies skills, your`own skills, your tactics and some decent decision making to overcome ANY situation. Of course, once in a while a little luck does not hurt.\n\nThe Game mechanics are well done and your skills are well thought. Sometimes a skill might be bad in the beginning, but once you've skilled it once or twice, it changes into something completely different and that might change your whole strategy.\n\nThe characters are quite interessting, at least they were for me. I find it disappointing that I have seen so "little" of them. Especially the Rogue you start of with, became one of my favorite characters through the game and I would love to see another game with the same characters just after this or before this happened. That would be great.\n\nOf course, not every aspect of the game is great. For example, the riddles. The aren't hard and most of them can be solved in about 1-2 Minutes, but its annoying because so many of them pop up. Especially in the end. Just a little less of them and it would be okay.\n\nOr the Story. It turned out weak and the end wasn't that unexpected, though its not the worst either.\n\nOn my own score list, this game has 8/10 and I can only advise you to play it.","November 9, 2014","true","30.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I always loved this style of combat for its tactical nature but in aarklash you can and must look at your enemies info panel to see exactly what abilities they have to know what to interupt, what effects to steal, if you need to spread out, if you need to block skillshots with your party members, if you need to flee after they die because they explode, if they heal, reduce your healing, etc.  The fights can be complex and do feel kind of like puzzles to solve because all the info is avail but you must figure out how to use it and what you have to win.\n\nI've not seen any towns, shops or anything but you do level up, find loot, spend points in a skill tree of sorts and find more party members to swap between with radically differnet play styles.  It seems to be a very linear experience solely based around its fantastic combat system and thats actually fine.","July 21, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played that this is a deeper and improved game in the same vein. If you haven't played Confrontation, Aarklash is a combat (and puzzle) heavy game with limited exploration and a story that won't win any awards. If you're looking for a Baldur's Gate type game, this isn't it. This is more along the lines of Icewind Dale but much shorter (I'd expect 12ish hours or more depending on difficulty with puzzles and combat).\n\nThis game does tactical combat very well. Combat is real time with pause using a group of 4 (out of a possible 8 starting in Act 2). All the potential heroes have 4 unique abilities with 2 possible trees for each move that can totally change the base move. Movement is required to dodge enemy abilities and some bosses have instant kill moves so positioning is key. HP and Mana refill quickly after battles so there's not much downtime between engagements either.\n\nI'm not very familiar with the background and lore of Aarklash but the taste of the world given in this game makes me wish someone would make a big "proper" RPG in this setting as it seems full of potential. The story quality is average though the subject is unique.  It really starts to seem cliché going into Act 3 but they throw a very nice twist in during the last couple of seconds so make sure you're listening as it'd be easy to miss if you're distracted.\n\nMaps are very linear with a handful of small detours for chests or the occasional optional puzzle protecting chests. The inventory is very limited too as each hero has 4 equipment slots and there are only 4 types of items in the entire game. There's some limited but random crafting too. After turning in enough items to fill a bar you get an epic item of the same type of item that finished filling the bar.\n\nOverall if you like tactical combat heavy games and aren't expecting a sprawling epic story spanning several dozen hours Aarklash is worth a look.","July 24, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can respec at any time though, so no worries about putting points in the wrong area. I love that this game has fair combat. No cheating PC baddies. You enemies may have different abilities but you can view what all their abilities are at any time in combat, with the exception of two bosses i believe who were listed as having some secret abilities. You know what your party and the enemy party are capable of, so it's a matter of using your abilities best to crowd control, counter, and kill the enemy.

Nearly all encounters you have with the enemy you need to plan and manage your resources and cooldowns in order to win. The combat plays out in real time but you can pause the game at anytime and give your party members new orders.\n\nThere are eight characters in the game that you can use to form your party of four. Each character has four unique skills that can be modified in different ways as you go up in levels with that character. The characters themselves are interesting and have unique personalities and are well voice acted.\n\nThrough the game you will come across various puzzles that you need to solve to progress or to get some extra loot. So examples of puzzles are: Stepping on plates in the right order, Turing lights on or off on a board until all are lit.\n\nThe areas you travel through look nice but the paths you have to take are preset with very few places to break off from to get some extra loot. On most maps you are literally zigzagging from one end to the other.\n\nAfter you have completed the game it offers little to no real replay value unless you wish to play at a different difficulty or if you missed an achievement that you like to get.\n\n(Thanks to ChiefDan7 and MidnightWarrior for helping to make this review)","May 3, 2014","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You control a band of units, each with its unique skills and abilities. You can usually swap them in and out of the squad freely (when not in combat) so you can experiment with different ability combinations (the plot assumes that all the characters are travelling together at all times so you're not missing out on any dialogue by sticking with one team, by the way). The fights are generally quite challenging, and boss fights sometimes feel like puzzles instead of actual fights. The equipment system is pretty bad - personally, I think the game would benefit more from an equipment unlock system instead of the random jewellery drops. The writing is nothing special but not particularly bad either, and some of the characters really grow on to you. The ability skill trees are pretty barebones as well - while some upgrades change the ways abilities behave, only four per unit seems a bit low. A huge plus is the ability to reset the skill trees when not in combat. The game seems a bit short, but the encounters are not repetitive. The game has an absolutely gorgeous art style and character design.\n\nOverall, I would not buy this game at the full price.

Bought while it was on sale, if memory serves, under ten dollars, I had limited expectations about this game when i first saw it was not but a rather delightful discovery.\n\nTo those looking over for a quick recap. Yes, Aarklash Legacy is worth your purchase and time. It is a solid rpg with engaging mechanics, it seems perfectly optimized.\n\nAnd now, on to expand on the good...\nThe game has a good mechanic, basically, it is an over the head rpg in which one has the choice to pause and assign actions per each of the members of your four man team. I suppose that, in this aspect one could draw a parallel with the Dragon Age gameplay, but whereas the other characters could be controlled by AIs, this one expects you to micromanage each of the four character's actions, which i suppose makes the combat tighter and more demanding. The fights are a house of cards. One mistake, one character taken down because a buff is not applied or removed in the right time and the battle could turn into a loss, demanding your attention. Positioning plays a much bigger role in the game as some enemies have directional spells that must be dodging as they are casting them. Bosses have attacks that instakills those who are standing in the wrong place. And buffs play a bigger role here, affecting the combat from adding armor to reducing healing and potentially killing oneself, more than once a character died because there is a buff that "converts all heals into damage". So saving after each battle is highly recomended\n\nYou have a list of four skills per character, that can be upgradeable several times, and each tier has variations of the same skill, adding lettle details like damage, range, and status effects. All skills also have a branching path that alters the nature of the skill in different ways. The good thing is that there isn't actually a penalty for refunding the points you invest and putting them in the skills as you want.\n\nThe game looks great, with decent if not great quality in graphics and special level design. The ambience is said fairly nicely most of the time. Puzzles turn out inventive and amusing, nothing overly complicated but fun. And the game is decently optimized. Game loads fast and reloads are almost instant.\n\nYou will have up to eight playable characters to use (and this isn't a spoiler as it is announced in the trailer). Each of them with their special advantage and disadvantage, their unique set of skills, their own personality and backstory. They are just too good. The chemistry between characters is hinted through little lines and eventually you get to root for them in the short time they game lasts ...\n\nSadly, that leads me to the bad...\n\nThe criticism is that, the game 'feels' too short. And no, it isn't short, the first playthough took me 16 hours, minus one hour which i suppose condenses the time i was afk. But it does feel small because all the things that transpire, is but a small odyssey. I am trying not to spoil anything but i feel like the potential buyer should be warned about this. Basically characters are in trouble, gather up and go to solve the problem. It doesnt really help that the game split itself into just 3 acts.\n\nMy complain there is that it does feel like a wasted opportunity. There are 8 characters and u only travel in groups of 4. It is also convenient that there are 2 tanks, 2 healers, 2 spellcasters and 2 offensive characters. The idea of splitting them into groups was there but sadly it was barely used. The could've been more puzzles that required to use more than one character to complete (not that there aren't of those in the game, but could've been more)\n\nI also wished to know more about the other characters. Each of them had their own motivations and reasons to be mercenaries as well as their unfinished businesses for that matter, i half hoped they would deal with them (of course, given that the story here is only a trip it makes sense those sidestories arent touched)\n\nBut then again, hopefully there will be a sequel and that it will continue the story. So far, this is a good game, and has a lot of replay value for those who want a bigger challenge.","March 11, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While you can change their function by realocating skill points (yay skill trees!), it's not what I would strictly call character customization.

It's pretty cool! If you like tactical RPG combat then you should check it out. The best way I can think to describe it is playing a party in an MMO where you control every character. If you've ever played and MMO wished you could control everything then this is perfect for you. Just the way the set up works (Tank+Healer+DPS) is very MMO-like, but with old school CRPG-style control. It's different enough from the old Infinity Engine games (less focus on a complex ruleset and dice rolls), so I'm hesitant to compare it to those.\n\nEach combat encounter is unique and challenging, boss fights even more so. Lots of reactive play is needed, like getting out of the way of AOE attacks, interrupting spellcasting, and removing/stealing buffs. Prepare to die if you're not paying attention. Quicksave often.\n\nGraphics are surprisingly sharp. Looks great, runs well, and loads fast. Not much in terms of customization but it's not really needed.\n\nNegatives include horrible story and some cringe-worthy dialog. Voice actors are fine but the things they're made to say are just bad.\n\nAnyway it's from a small studio with pretty much no marketing so I felt like reporting back after buying.","September 16, 2013","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this changes quick and after a while you might scream at the game for being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But don't let that take your fun away, because as challenging as it might get, it never gets unfair. You just need more knowledge about your enemies skills, your`own skills, your tactics and some decent decision making to overcome ANY situation. Of course, once in a while a little luck does not hurt.\n\nThe Game mechanics are well done and your skills are well thought. Sometimes a skill might be bad in the beginning, but once you've skilled it once or twice, it changes into something completely different and that might change your whole strategy.\n\nThe characters are quite interessting, at least they were for me. I find it disappointing that I have seen so "little" of them. Especially the Rogue you start of with, became one of my favorite characters through the game and I would love to see another game with the same characters just after this or before this happened. That would be great.\n\nOf course, not every aspect of the game is great. For example, the riddles. The aren't hard and most of them can be solved in about 1-2 Minutes, but its annoying because so many of them pop up. Especially in the end. Just a little less of them and it would be okay.\n\nOr the Story.

The game revolves around a serious of tactical battles with a modifiable squad and an engaging, but linear, story.  But best be clear the battles are at the heart of the game.  This is not an RPG, its a tactical battler.\n\n- The battles themselves consist of a squad of four team members, with each of those members have four different skills.  The skills themselves feel like something drawn from a MOBA skillset - yet with the skill-shot difficulty ramped up so much that you've got to pause every few seconds to position you squad correctly.\n\n- Meaning that the type of player who will enjoy this game is much more likely to be you Panzer General type grognard.  This is a game of careful positioning, skill selctions and matchups, not speed-clicking.\n\n- The comparisons to Balder's Gate etc are misleading - except in graphical style.  Don't go in expecting dialogue options.  There is enough of the Baldur's Gate fun and flavour to keep the story ticking along and the characters interesting.\n\nHighly recommended - so long as you understand what type of game you are getting.","November 14, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only downside to this is that the loot system does seem to be very RNG and it seems that you can get literally any stat. Rather than increasing abilities the loot system aims instead to make you consider passive stats like mana regeneration.I appreciate that sounds boring but the more mana you have the more spells you can cast and there it is a direct DPS increase.\n\nThere are 8 different Heroes to play with and each has it's own unique passives and abilities, building a team with good synergy is just half the battle. As your Heroes progress through the game they will level up and gain ability points to spend in their chosen skill trees. One of the greatest things about this game is that you aren't punished for re-speccing. Respec is free and immediate so there is no punishment if you wanted to try that move that has more %Bleed damage than a Heal you think you should have taken.\n\nThe story in this game is very linear and started off very intersting but it quickly became subpar to the combat system.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that this game is carried heavily by it's combat mechanics. But for such a cheap price tag, it's a welcome break from the crap that is forced down our throats currently. I recommend this game to everyone who is a fan of Strategy/Fantasy and heavy micro-manage games like Starcraft.","July 18, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can just load the game, run one battle, get owned, ragequit. ;-)\n\nIt's linear, and doesn't really have much character development (you do, however, level up skills (easy and free to respec) and find some items that just give you some basic stats), but the battles are pretty fun.

Artwork is unique within the fantasy universe of orcs, goblin, dwarves and elves (between burlesque and gothic) and remain coherent all the way (although I haven't finished the game yet at all, shame on me).\n\nThe gameplay is a succession of missions, unlocking more of the playable characters and story line. Missions are tactical combat in real time (with active pause) and you have to time your actions wisely as your characters powers have cooldowns (micromanagement is made easy with the pause). After the missions you get some loot which comes in different flavors (with or without cherry on top), enhancing some strengths of your characters depending on your playstyle with them (as most characters can take multiple roles - usually two directions - which you can enhance or not) and is always rewarding as even trash loot can be recycled and this is important as gear comes from the RNG gods which you may or may not be fully acquainted with.\n\nThe RPG element of character building are not so in-depth, yet the simplicity of the skill tree (or spiral) is a pretty good thing there. Although this work in synergy with gear customisation and you have to plan what items to keep or recycle. While you can freely respec the skills, you can't respawn specialised gear in your inventory, so beware.\n\nAll in all, this is a very well done game in all regards.

The artstyle is gorgeous and colors are vibrant. The story is really not that complicated but well written and has a nice flair to it with the medium-level voice acting.\n\nMy complaints on the game are the comstant frame skips when a lot of enemies appear due to lack of optimization for the graphics and the simple options menu.\n\nTo reiterate, if you are a big fan of Action RPGs and don't mind playing games on a mid-level of quality, then you'll consider Aarklash a gem, otherwise, you'll probably be complaining about the graphics quality, voice acting, strategic combat system, and whatever else you don't find appealing unless you're playing AAA titles.","November 7, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What you see is what you get.\n-Uncompelling storyline, you just don't care about it.\n-Gets very stale about halfway through...you just want it to be over.\n-Character levels cap out quickly, limiting development.\n-No currency and a weak item system that doesn't encourage much experimentation. By the end of the game you have an inventory full of junk and you don't know what to do with it.\n\nI feel like there is a lot of potential here that they could improve on in a sequel but this just felt stale and unfinished. At first it was good but got old very quick, if you are looking for a good tactical RPG I have heard Pillars of Eternity is great and might be worth your time.","December 16, 2015","false","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, I was intrigued, but after a few fights, when the first bosses or subbosses came, I got frustrated, as there was not enough info on what to do, and if you can actually beat them already, or if you should first detour an fight some normal mobs... I really needed to get to the drawing board, after a day of pause, to give it one last chance... then however, I understood the fight, with a little help of the internet, and since then, I managed to play the game alone, and really enjoyed the tactical fights and quite unique skills... Healers almost never can also heal themselves, and the 1st tank availableneeded to spend HP to use its skills... also, there are a lot of nice puzzles inbetween the fights, so its actually strong on both ends, the tactival battles, and the puzzles. For me, it plays like the boss battles of MMPRGs, but even the normal mobs are very dangerous, and require watching what they do, which skills they have, what effect zones do what and moving you quad of heroes out of harms way.\nThe story is also quite dark and unusal, so in the end, I am hoping for a sequal, highly recommended for the stress resistant!","December 19, 2015","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game revolves around a serious of tactical battles with a modifiable squad and an engaging, but linear, story.  But best be clear the battles are at the heart of the game.  This is not an RPG, its a tactical battler.\n\n- The battles themselves consist of a squad of four team members, with each of those members have four different skills.  The skills themselves feel like something drawn from a MOBA skillset - yet with the skill-shot difficulty ramped up so much that you've got to pause every few seconds to position you squad correctly.\n\n- Meaning that the type of player who will enjoy this game is much more likely to be you Panzer General type grognard.  This is a game of careful positioning, skill selctions and matchups, not speed-clicking.\n\n- The comparisons to Balder's Gate etc are misleading - except in graphical style.  Don't go in expecting dialogue options.  There is enough of the Baldur's Gate fun and flavour to keep the story ticking along and the characters interesting.\n\nHighly recommended - so long as you understand what type of game you are getting.","November 14, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like tactical RPGs that is. For full price however, I'd pass, unless really craving for some strategy.\n\nGame is hard enough on higher difficulty, complex enough stat/skill and tactics build around tank/dps/healing with sprinkle of control and positional movement. Graphics has its style, quite few voiced cutscenes, decent although cliche story. Love drawn art. Combat is almost flawless, solid, polished, almost doesn't fit for such otherwise mediocre title Aarklash is.\n\nThen again Aarklash seems like it had ambitions to be really awesome tactical RPG, much like Icewind Dale series, but failed somewhere. Not enough depth, not enough skills, items, ways to influence stats. Enemies and puzzles feel like artificially put in rooms, just to waste your time on your way, like in C class action movie, where something needs to die to make main hero waddle trough on his way to big bad boss.\n\nOn interesting note this is how MMORPG raids would look like if it was single player.","November 13, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
