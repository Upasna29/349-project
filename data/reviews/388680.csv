You play as an unfinished drawing who wants to be complete.\nThe game serves as an effective metaphor for the creative process in general: everyone who has tried to create something, be it art, writing, a game, or whatever, can recognise the story this game tries to tell.\n\nThe art style is great. All hand-drawn, and it stays this throughout. The art is accompanied by soothing music.\nThe narrative is told through voice over -- sadly no subtitles -- that is clear, if at a little low volume compared to the music.\n\nGameplay wise, you walk through white, empty environments to find body parts (different legs, different bodies, different heads), all of which give you enhanced abilities. As you progress the levels become more... drawn.\n\nUnfortunately Unfinished is hard to get in to. I was stuck at the first real puzzle for far too long, since the game didn't make it clear at all that I could swap abilities in mid-air, and I only found this by chance.\nIt is also short. Too short perhaps for Steam refunds. If I hadn't gotten stuck at the  beginning I could've finished it within 30 minutes.\n\nWhile a bit rough the game is mechanically sound and the story resonates with me, as a fellow (want to be?) creator.\n\nAs for the price point, €5 is perhaps steep for such a short game, and (disclaimer) I didn't buy it for that price: I had a 50% off coupon. At that price level (€2,50 or less) I can recommend it to everyone.\n\nJust don't be a ♥♥♥♥ and refund it after you've finished your speed run, okay?","August 24, 2015","true","2.6"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","0"

One of man's most greatest abilities is to create, rather that be life, tools, or art. Sometimes though, creation isn't easy, sometimes things are left undone, inspiration is a valuable commodity that doesn't come easy. You will explore these concepts and more in this interesting and entertaining puzzle game. You play an unfinished doodle, who seeks identity in a world of art and chaos. The story is shared between Artist and Doodle as they both go through a journey of discovering themselves and purpose. While Unfinished - An Artist's Lament is a rather short game, what it does have to offer is extremely enjoyable aesthetically and gameplay follows suit. Finding unfinished drawings, you add abilities to your own drawing, such as spring boots, helicopter hat and other whimsical powers. The puzzles in Unfinsihed are rather simple, the game never draws focus away from what matters, the story. This leads the game to feeling like its full of good ideas but ends rather suddenly. While this was obviously intended, a part of me couldn't help but wonder what else could've been had the ideas and powers/levels been expanded upon. Nevertheless Unfinished - An Artist's Lament is a journey of self actualization that is fun, pleasant, and makes you ponder your own creations and goals that you never quite completed. This game is a fine example of Gamer Art and should be treated and enjoyed as such.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/MPM95T3SuEc\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","November 8, 2015","true","1.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Sadly as an actual game Unfinished really falls flat as the bland levels and barebones gameplay take their toll on the player: I just didn't have much fun using the awkward controls to switch powers at the right time or to try and aim my jumps correctly to move through a few platforms.\n\nThe gameplay simply isn't refined enough to be engaging and there's not enough to do to make up for its problems: most levels look and feel the same and the new powers you'll unlock don't do much to mix things up, you'll just be moving forward, jump and/or float a bit until you reach a new zone, rinse and repeat.\n\nIt's a real shame as the game can be quite enjoyable when it drops the dull platforming and leaves you to explore a bit while giving some narration, the fact it does so while introducing some vibrant colours into a mostly black and white world also helps tremendously in making these moments shine. Sadly this happens basically only once and it simply isn't enough to make up for the rest of the game.","December 12, 2015","false","1.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

It is not really even a game.  It is a walking (and bouncing) simulator where you hear an artist complain that he is out of ideas and that people do not like his work, all while you try to wander over to a pencil.  That's it.  There is no story, there are no enemies, and there are just a couple of puzzles (if you count stacking blocks as puzzles).  You do get a few power-ups, but they are difficult and clunky at best.\n\nI will say this though: I did enjoy the music.","October 18, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's *very short*, overbearing in its delivery, initially obtuse, yet there are a few moments when this game shines.  Here is a gif of my favorite moment in the game:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ot0R1js.gifv\n\nThere is this moment and a few others where everything the game is trying to do succeeds.  Other times, the purpose of explaining an Artist's anxieties can become overbearing.  And I'm honestly not sure if I'm supposed to be critiquing that as a fault of the game or if that is the purpose of the game's design.\n\nI like the game.  I like that it was attempted.  There are parts that were inspiring and there were parts that were annoying.  The very beginning of the game is the definition of obtuse.  Is it obtuse on purpose?  Is that frustration I'm feeling *supposed* to happen?\n\nIf it was, well then job well done!  If it wasn't, well then, that part could have been done better.\n\nStill, I like short games and Unfinished, with all of it's faults, still left a positive impression on me.","August 4, 2015","true","2.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

You play as a simple, unfinished sketch.  While chasing the pencil of the person who designed you, you hear the story of your creator, and the trouble he's going through.  It's got a good message, and while it can get a little laggy, most of it runs pretty smoothly.  I've played it twice, and truly enjoyed each time.  It didn't take long to get attached to the cute sketch you play as.

You play as a sketched out sort of stick figure who's chasing down the pencil that drew him, in an attempt to become "complete". It must be understood that this is not an action packed game and if you try to play it as such, you will not enjoy yourself. You're tasked with solving puzzles to make your way through each level while chasing down the aforementioned pencil by using tools that you find along you way. Each tool is applied to your stick figure's head, torso, or feet with some puzzles requiring you to use a combination of your different pieces of attire. The puzzle solving, while simple, is unique and entertaining, but not enough to keep someone captivated. However, the game makes up for its simplicity with its story. The narrator, and evidently the man who drew the stick figure in the first place, can be heard dictating different key moments in his life as an artist. The artist, struggling to look for work, faces the same struggles his stick figure creation does in the sense that neither of them are complete. As someone with experience in the field of art, the story struck a very emotional chord with me and was that much more meaningful. If you are looking for solid gameplay and replayability, this is not the game for you. But if you're looking for some quick and cheap fun, with what I think is a rather amazing story, then I would definitely suggest Unfinished for you. To enjoy this, you have to be able to appreciate the game for what it is: the story of the struggles of an artist, plagued by how he could never finish his work, only to feel lost and never truly complete himself. Unfinished is a unique and fun experince, perfect for the average puzzle solver, and relates to everyone in one way or another. On the other hand, if you think this is the kind of game you'd rather watch someone play, then you can check out my walkthrough on my channel (shameless self promotion): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwLyqMS5caU","August 8, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The concept and art sold me. However, I couldn't stomach the incredibly slow walking speed of the character. You're forced to walk incredibly slow, and it doesn't seem like any consideration was given to the physics of the character- how it moves, specifically. Just flat, boring, WASD walking through miles of endless white. And you don't really jump either- you select a "bouncing" power up and bounce constantly to get over obstacles. I did not find this mechanic fun or intuitive- just annoying and slow like the walking.\n\nGreat concept and art, frustratingly slow and plain controls. I didn't want to force myself through the boring process of moving my character around to getting the final message or metaphor of the experience- I just wanted it to end.","November 14, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is a lot of stress and efforts to put into one creative work.\nSome people don't value artists and just want them to finish their work early for their own good.\nLong ago I supported cracked games, but since I learned about all the hardworks from the game developers, like now, I buy the games instead of downloading a cracked game. Luckily, I found steam. Steam sales a lot of games at reasonable prices.\n\nRemember, if you support a creative work, don't copy paste or reupload the work to somewhere else.\nYou can see people reupload someone else's videos and images illegally.

(Cannot hit 1-3 while moving to select a different item, must ONLY be pressing 1-3 at that time)\n- Game forces player to admire artwork or listen to storytelling at some points, which can be a positive, but given the context that this game is a platformer it was done in such a way that it became more annoying rather than adding value to the story.\n\nOverall I think there are a lot of improvements that can be made to the game. The length of the game is perfect. It just needs some more polish.
