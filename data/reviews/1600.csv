The fine folks at Sonalysts really did their homework when they were creating this game, since nearly every aspect of it oozes a level of realism that you're hard-pressed to find in most other games these days. I truly believe that the gameplay you experience in Dangerous Waters is a very accurate portrayal of actual naval operations and procedures in practice today; every vessel and weapon you will encounter has been meticulously reproduced according to real-life records. Hell, I could probably operate my own Los Angeles or Seawolf-class sub singlehandedly thanks to what I've learned from this game regarding their operation. Let it never be said that videogames don't teach you anything.\n\nThis tremendous level of immersion comes at a cost, however. Dangerous Waters is not so much a "game" as it is a genuine training siumlator, and as such has an extraordinarily steep learning curve that simply can't be overcome without first reading the manual and running a few practice missions as tutorials. However, even that won't fully prepare you for what you'll have to deal with once you finally take to the open seas, where even a single torpedo is usually fatal, and a compromise in stealth can ruin an entire mission. Dangerous Waters demands patience, dilligence, and a certain enthusiasm for submarines from its players if they hope to develop any real skill for it.\n\nDangerous Waters is not for the faint of heart, but it can be a very rewarding experience if you take the time to learn the finer points of its gameplay. You may have to lose a boat or two or a dozen before that finally happens, but that's merely half the fun!","November 25, 2013","true","46.9"," 105 of 111 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","105","111","0","0"

This game is not for most people, because it is pretty hardcore realistic. The playable submarines are: Akula and Akula Improved, 688(i) Los Angeles Class, Kilo and Kilo Improved.  (They also make a MH-60 Seahawk, P-3c patrol plane, and Oliver-Hazard Perry frigate playable, but those aren't nearly as fun or polished) The level of depth they went through to make this as realistic as they could is breathtaking. Going through Sonar to find and classify vessels feels very rewarding. Once classified, you determine the speed through the Demon waterfall. After that, you go to the TMA (Target Motion Analysis) station to put in all the info to fire a weapon at it. All this takes time and a lot of effort, as you have to remain silent yourself because the AI is doing the same thing. If you feel overwhelmed by all this, you can put on auto crew on almost every station, so you don't need to do everything yourself, especially if you're bad at it. (Like me at TMA.) The campaign is very hard, at least for me. But you can train up on quick missions which involve you sinking 1-3 vessels depending on the difficulty you choose. And there is a ten-digit seed generator which makes quick missions infinitely re-playable.  Overall, I would give this game a great thumbs up and 10/10 rating.

If you own Jane's Fleet Command, C:MANO or NW:AC and have always wanted to have more direct control over your units, this game is for you. It may not be the best looking game now, 8 years post release, but it allows the player to fully appreciate the dificulties of Anti-Submarine Warfare. It will make you sweat, your brain hurt, and it will be exceptionally frustrating at times. It is very rewarding to finally put weapons on a target. Ant-Air and Anti-Surface warfare is also modeled beyond most other games, but neither of them feel as nuanced as ASW.\n\nThere are several great mods available improving the fidelity of various areas, or adding many platforms. There's even a user made campaign to recreate Red Storm Rising!\n\nThe learning curve is likely to be exceptionally steep for newcomers, mostly because the tutorial that was present for 688i Hunter-Killer seems to have been removed. Sometimes there are annoying UI and AI glitches, and the lack of a global map is a bit of an annoyance sometimes. However, given that DW does what no other game does, I'm more than willing to look past these issues.","October 24, 2014","true","119.6"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redzing/recommended/1600/","redzing","Redzing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redzing/","40 products in account","Despite having developped several videogames, Sonalysts is originaly a provider of professionnal softwares and simulators, aimed at training US Navy officers. This is clearly visible, as the gaming experience in Dangerous Waters feels a bit outdated, even for its time of release (2006). The graphics, sound effects, and gameplay possibilities are quite limited, at least compared to Silent Hunter 3, which was released a year before. On these aspects, the game is closer to Silent Hunter 2 (released 6 years prior to Dangerous Waters !), and we feel like commanding a submarine from a distance, rather than fill the shoes of a real navy officer.\nThat being said, the simulation part is meticulous, and has a great level of depth. We are able to command submarines (and a few other vehicles) with a high degree of realism. The game gives access to many weaponry, instrumentation (namely sonars), and takes into account a lot of physical parameters (force instance, thermal layers in the ocean having an effect on sound speed).\nIt takes a bit of time to fully master the operating of ships/planes/submarines, but the gaming experience is worth the effort.\n\nNota : apparently, DW is NOT Windows 8 compatible, and Sonalysts have stopped supporting the game. Therefore no official compatibility patch will be provided. Yet, some unoffical patches found on the subsim website may help resolve theses issue.","December 20, 2014","true","24.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

There are a lot of tutorial. It's not hard but it can take some time doing it.

It's an easy job but make sure that the name of this folder is as short as possible. like "VD" for Virtual Disk. Don't forget that XP Oracle will serve  you to play a bunch of other games that you cannot run with Win 8 so the job worth it.\n4: Install Dangerous waters from your CD or ISO file or even Steam again.\n5: Patch it if it's from a CD or .ISO et voila.\n\nThanks to my friend FPSchazly.

The game's complexity arises not from navigating within your submarine or from having to press a million buttons -- indeed, these mechanics don't even exist. Instead, the game's interface is surprisingly simple for the most part as you move instantly from one screen to the next, and the graphics are rather bland, even on the highest settings, which is a bit understandable considering the game came out about a decade ago (as of this review year). Instead, the difficulties for the new player will be conceptual, and the learning curve for that will probably feel rather high at first.\n\nFor those who master the basic concepts behind Dangerous Waters, this game largely tests your ability to be a decent submarine captain. The primary concepts to master in this game are probably those that have to do with sonar. Once a player knows how to utilize his sonar station, he is in a very good position to begin serious consideration of tactics.\n\nAt this point, the player should see Dangerous Waters open up into a very serious cat-and-mouse game of war in which the superior tactician can often seize an advantage. Imagine a scenario in which a a submarine captain notices that he's stumbled onto an enemy submarine. Through Narrowband sonar, he determines that the submarine is a Russian Kilo. The captain knows that the Kilo doesn't have a towed sonar array, making it deaf to anything directly behind it. Accordingly, the captain orders a course change and swings in behind the Kilo. This Kilo's hunt for surface ships will be over soon.\n\nNothing quite matches the anticipation of watching one's own torpedoes travel at the enemy, or the anxiety caused by listening to the constant pinging of enemy torpedoes as they get closer and closer while actively searching for their target. For those who can put up with the game's graphical shortcomings and high learning curve, this game is definitely an awesome submarine simulator.\n\nCAVEAT: This game does NOT run natively on Windows 8. It will, however, run in a virtual machine. It also reportedly works through WINE on Linux.\n\nUpdate: There is a 3rd party fix for the issues with Window 8. It is essentially a DirectX wrapper.","September 22, 2014","true","38.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Still, it's a great sim and one I will return to for many more years to come.\n\nOh, and if you, like me, have Windows 8.1, and can't run the game, check this out: http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showpost.php?p=2255333&postcount=22. Working great for me, even though the options menu is a bit... weird.","June 4, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get the d3d8.dll fix and you'll be good to go. It's been out for a while, but I just found it :)\nA great game, and highly recommended by this 68-year-old gamer who's played just about every sub game ever made.\n","June 5, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
