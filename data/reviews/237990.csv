It runs well, I encountered no major bugs, and the story starts very intense and engrossing.\nNow, after nearing the end of my first (and, most likely, only) playthrough I can sum up my personal experience with a single sentence: I learned to *thoroughly* hate this game.\nI'm terribly sorry, I desperately wanted to like this, but with every tedious, frustrating and boring hour of gameplay I had to concede, that just about *every* design choice made by Stoic seems to go diametrically against my personal preferences.\nTrying to cast an objective vote, I'd rate it about 5 out of 10, because there are undoubtedly many things good about the game, but the essence of what it's about - having fun, being motivated and enjoying the time spent playing - simply doesn't happen.\nTBS is the very definition of a railroaded game. More than that, it actually *feels* like more than half of the time I'm actually watching pointless, endlessly repeating nice backgrounds scrolling past, while nothing happens. Events are scarce, and when they happen, they kill my motivation and the RPG aspect. Because, frankly, I'm NOT making decisions. I'm playing a random guessing game, in most cases with absolutely *no* clue on what the consequences of the 4 "choose your answer" alternatives *might* even be. I hate playing a game where I don't even know the rules, and I hate winning every battle and then losing my heroes (and the associated investment!) to random dialogue events.\nThe world map is like a bad joke on my expense, as it serves absolutely *no* function in the game but as a "choose your flavour text" library. It feels like there's an entire aspect of the game simply never implemented here...\nSame goes for character development and resource management. Both are oversimplified, shallow and simply feel completely unfinished. Each character has one single item slot, and the items available are nothing special. Abilities are pretty much predetermined, and dividing 10 points you *might* receive during 5 ranks isn't that big a deal towards diverity or individualization.\nThere is one single resource for everything (renown) and one single sure way to acquire it (by killing enemies in combat). Sometimes you might draw a lucky card during the random dialogue guessing game and acquire some extra, but that's it. As the resource is used to buy supplies, items *and* for leveling up your heroes, it comes down to either have your caravan starve or run around with level 1 heroes, despite them having earned several promotions on the battlefield. That kills motivation on such an epic scale, and can't even begin to describe it.\nThere are no side quests, no method to forage for food, trade, to gain extra renown or anything - remember, you are on one long, single track railway and never look left or right. You will *never* feel in control of *anything* in this game. For me, however, that is what gaming should be about.\nEven the combat system, one of the best parts otherwise, has several unnerving flaws that started bothering me in the long run:\n- You are forced to choose your team *and* the sequence in which they act *before* you know anything about the enemies you will face. Why is there even a deployment phase at the begin of combat if all you do there is arrange the predetermined team on the board? That placement will be void after one round of movement, a wrong party mix or suboptimal sequence will stay, however.\n- the way the two sides take turns is beyond silly. If you face a single, strong opponent, that one will act 6 times for every ONCE your heroes do something, as it's always the *sides* that take turns.\n- one stat for hitpoints AND combat effectiveness basically means, that the battles are decided in the first round. The side that starts taking hits is the side that will lose. Always. Without a way to regain strength, a single hit can de facto disable a hero. The whole system is too simplistic, counter-intuitive and artificial. Simple to understand, but never becomes fun for me.\nAnd another main grief is the complete absense of a save game feature. Not because of technical problems, but simply because the designers want to forbid me to play the game any other way than to live with the random outcome of their nonsensical guessing games. Sorry, folks, I'm 45 years old, have been playing games for 30 years and don't need *anyone* to tell me how to. This arrogant patronizing annoys me to kingdom come!\nSo, again, sorry Stoic for being so negative, but this game is so totally NOT my piece of cake. Terrific art, great lore, good music and a stable game do NOT equal fun, I'm afraid. Lots of bad design choices for me equal de-motivation, tedium, boredom and frustration. Others might love this game, probably the majority. But it's definitely 100% not for me - and the files were deleted after that completely silly, unfair and annoying final battle.","January 19, 2014","false","10.7"," 2,055 of 2,659 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","055","2","0","92"

Despite the fact that they've created this vast and gorgeous world, steeped in lore and history, you can't even choose where to go. You're firmly 'on-the-rails' for the entire game. Occasionally, you get text based encounters where you get to make a decision, but having played Banner Saga a couple of times, I can tell you that most of these change nothing. Sometimes one character or another dies, but it's trivial since they aren't really necessary anyway.\n\nAt the very beginning we are treated to a beautiful animated cut-scene complete with voice acted dialogue, so you'd figure those would come up at key points in the game at least, right? THEY DON'T. Not even at the end.\n\nAs the story develops, more and more layers are revealed: The gods are dead; the sun has stopped in the sky; there's a prophecy; there's tension and intrigue between characters and races, etc, etc. NONE OF IT GOES ANYWHERE. In a nut shell, the story is: survive until you get to the end boss - who has practically nothing to do with anything.\n\nThe artwork is gorgeous, the concept (Viking Oregon Trail + Turn Based Strategy + Some RPG elements) is simple but it works. But instead of using that simplicity to really open up the world, we're instead treated to a vast tableaux of untapped potential.\n\nMaybe they're planning a sequel - and heck, I've put this many hours in already, I might even pick it up - but honestly, if a game leaves you feeling, "What, that's it?" It failed to deliver.\n\n\nEDIT: I DO NOT care that Banner Saga is part of a planned trilogy. I WILL NOT base a review of a game on the potential of its sequel. I think that would be a huge disservice to those choosing whether or not to spend money on THIS game.","November 22, 2014","false","32.9"," 1,524 of 1,972 people (77%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","77","524","1","28","57"

Not a full, formal review.\n\nThe Banner Saga is a Kickstarter game and it's exactly what Kickstarter should be about: visionaries with bold ideas that probably wouldn't get funded through traditional means.  And that's exactly how TBS feels; it's a game designed by visionaries who love every bit of their craft but that leads to some issues of its own I'll address later.\n\nFirst off, this is a gorgeous game.  The art style combines the clear-line character art of Ivan Bilibin with the iconic backdrops of Eyvind Earle.  Every piece of art from the intricately detailed world map to the rotoscoped animations is beautifully rendered.  The world of TBS draws heavy inspiration from Norse mythology but there's quite a bit of detail and world building when I was expecting it to be very straightforward.  While it is still a strategy game through and through, fans of RPGs will find plenty to like with the well defined characters and detailed world.\n\nBeing a strategy game, combat is at the forefront but has some niggling issues.  It's a very clean move-action system where character order is more important than arbitrary stats like speed.  Being wholly turn based, action economy is the name of the game as you're forced to dominate the battlefield through superior placement of your units.  Combat could be a bit more robust but normal difficulty is a decent challenge so far and there's "hard" for people wanting more of a challenge.  Thankfully, battles are evenly spaced between story scenes so every individual battle feels special.\n\nUnfortunately, my biggest complaint of an otherwise fine system is the speed.  Combat moves at a lethargic pace.  There's no option to skip animations or speed combat and in a game where battles with as few as 4 enemies can take 10-15 minutes average, having a speed-up option is sorely missed.\n\nTBS is immensely pleasurable so far and I can only hope it remains consistent to the end.  I'll update my thoughts as I go along.","January 14, 2014","true","12.9"," 298 of 377 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","298","377","0","4"

The sun never leaves the horizon, shining on boundless wastes of tundra. The land is torn between men, giants known as varl and armored creatures known as dredge, neither carry any reason to trust each other. A new day dawns, and the world is at the brink of turmoil, weary of old wars, always anticipating new wars; nearly void of hope. In such a time, you take the role of leading a caravan across frozen wastes to its destiny.\n\nYou play the parts of many characters, make their choices and endure the consequences while discovering the beautifully weaved tale of the realm. Each and every character that you lead tell a story of their own in this Nordic, war-thorn saga. Each choice that you make affects your chances of survival, and makes you approach one step closer to your destination. The setting is incredibly rich, expected from any proper RPG game. Every road, landmark, settlement, mountain or forest; every region depicted on the map contains its own local history. The lore is complete and refreshing.\n\nTo begin with, the game contains a diverse gameplay, bringing together elements of adventure, role-playing and strategy games. The adventure elements are directly affecting the story, and the outcome of your choices twist and turn to present you alternative destinies. Combats are turn-based in isometric maps, and gameplay is fairly easy to grasp. Yet 'fairly easy to grasp' quickly turns into 'hard to master'. You are able to level up your characters with renown, a kind of currency that you may gain through heroism either in adventure choices or by slaying your adversaries in battle field. Alongside leveling, you are capable of gathering minor and major items to enhance your heroes furthermore.\n\nThe Banner Saga presents a direct example for my reason to become a gamer: a story to be told. The game satisfied all my expectations thoroughly. I do not wish to present any spoilers, but it is safe to declare that the story of the realm is not finished in this game. Good news is that The Banner Saga 2 is in development.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/237990/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","I have mixed opinions about The Banner Saga, but I'm still very happy to have played it. Most of the time, when I find games to be surprisingly brief, it's generally to their benefit. However, this is one title where I felt like it ended before it could really shine. I'm appreciative that it didn't drag itself out, but at the same time it's always a bit jarring when the end credits sneak up on you.\n\nThe Banner saga is some weird mesh of grid based strategy rpg (Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre, FFT/A) and...the Oregon trail. And Vikings (or something resembling Vikings). However, only the first part of that hybrid combination does the game feel polished, gameplay wise. The game's most notable feature when it comes to the primary battle engagements is the Armor/Strength duality, as well as Willpower and Exertion mechanics. In order to deal a lot of damage to most enemies, especially Dredge, you first have to spend time working down their armor instead of trying to outright lower their health to zero. This is only a small wrinkle to the normal rpg standby, but it is implemented well enough to have two interesting results. One, it creates some very real consequential moments where you've got a unit able to do decent armor or strength damage and you can't be certain whether you should really strip the armor down further or if you should take a chunk out of the enemy health so that they might be finished off sooner. Secondly, it creates much needed class specialization where certain units are much more adept at stripping armor while others are better set finishing weakened foes. The game then allows you to use some basic accessory-equipment to either further specialize (giving an armor-break boosting equipment to someone already well equiped to break armor) or to make certain units more versatile. One thing that I suppose I wasn't used to is that the class-roles are specified and listed on the heroes pages, but they still don't seem as iron-clad or strict as those in games such as the Japanese srpgs I listed earlier (where the class given to a unit is much more defining). I couldn't tell you which units were which class off of the top of my head, only what each given unit was good at performing in battle. I suppose it feels a bit more organic this way.\n\nI feel like the willpower-exertion mechanics are the most important (and unique) mechanics of the battles. Exertion allows you to add damage points to your strength hits, break down armor faster, and move further than normal. Morale allows you to add willpower to units as you need it, and replenishes as you defeat enemies. Since exertion determines how much willpower you can add to any action, it was the first thing I upgraded on any unit promotion.\n\nThe battle animations and sound work is expecially great, and I generally love the look of this game. The battle environments are a bit bland but that's not a real dealbreaker. One thing that I never did gel with was the out-of-battle dialogues, usually set as continously reversing camera shots of the front facing portraits of the various characters. The continuously changing perspective and lack of multiple emotive artworks for each character really made clicking through these dialogues to be a chore at times, and it was sometimes more difficult than it needed to be to determine who was entering and leaving the scene, and even who is all present at any given time.\n\nThe in-between battle treks with the caravan were not super enjoyable. I was given a unit count of clansmen, fighters, and varl but I didn't really know what this represented and only tried to keep the numbers high because that's what you're expected to do, right? A handful of times the game would tell me that the enemy force was so large and my force was compartively large but I couldn't really tell what numbers the game was crunching underneath. While other moments of open-ended choice and consecquence within these sections was enjoyable (do you help the random caravan you come accross, do you punish the drunk, do you demand goods from the traders if your supplies are low, etc), the various off-screen battle tactician moments (do you charge in, do you pull back, you have x forces against their y forces) seemed to be more random and less consequential. In the last two chapters of the game, I had made a dumb mistake and lost most of my unit count but it didn't seem to matter at all.\n\nThat said, in general I enjoyed the challenge of the game. I played through on Normal mode, and I even lost two battles (one of which I am sure you are supposed to lose :p ) but the game ended up allowing the journey to progress with those loses, which makes the prospect of a replay to see if I could either avoid or overcome though encounters to be somewhat appealing. The last battle of the game took a few tries, but at the same time, I didn't realize it was the last battle. It didn't really seem appropriately grandiose when considering some of the things introduced before that point that I thought I would be tackling. I'm unsure how much the ending can change depending on your choices, so I might have to do some reading.\n\nI just wish the game was a little longer. Some of the units in the game I felt like only saw 3-4 battles, and with the number of units you get in total (quite a few) and the frequency in which the become available and unavailable, and the low-map limit of who all you can bring into any given battle, I just felt like there were a few things I was unable to ever get to try. While I had some units level up many times, but the end of the game I had some units only often enough to have promoted once. But again, I suppose that allows for some variety in re-plays.\n\nGreat art, but I wish there was more to the dialogue sections, retweaked caravan between battle-mechanics, some larger more interesting maps would be neat, and more chances to be able to bring units into battle which a lower frequency of units becoming unavailable. Though not to any extreme extent, having some limitations on those sorts of things is a great way to force yourself to try out different strategies rather than just bringing your strongest units every time.\n\nLastly, the overarching story and narrative were interesting enough, but sometimes it felt messy and cluttered. You find yourself moving from one outpost to the next, each with exotics names, and never in one place for too long. Yes, there's a fairly nice in game map that helps to try to put things into place mentally, but when the purpose of most encampments is to simply upgrade your units and merch and be on your way, there wasn't a lot of incentive to really keep track of much. A large part of the game boils down to someone declaring that you need to leave place x and head to place y for reason z, and that's really all of the motivation I needed or wanted.","August 8, 2014","true","32.9"," 108 of 126 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","108","126","0","0"

I'll rather praise what in my opinion makes this game a good one worthwhile both your money and time.\n- Art & style: Beautifully crafted (rather drawn) environments and characters and map; it may not be everyone's taste but the devs put much dedication into creating a world you care about.\n- Music: The soundtrack alone is a masterpiece - the classical compositions fit seamlessly into the game's medieval fantasy theme. It really helps the immersion, for example if your caravan moves across the lands.\n- Writing: It's based on Nordic mythology but neither does it copy known works nor does it feel clichéd. Each character and each location has its own history and meaning. You can read all about it if you care but you don't have to. The story unfolds in a great way and at good pace.

It offers enough opportunities to upgrade your characters and to make the impression that your choices matter without getting overwhelming at any time.\n\nThese points above are the core of why I recommend this game to others to whom those impressions appeal.\nPS: As this is a saga the devs currently work on a sequel - TBS 2 (first trailer already out)...\nI hope this was of any help for your,\n\nYours,\nBethlemos","December 29, 2014","true","17.1"," 93 of 108 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","93","108","4","1"

Incredible art and animation, and a fabulous turn-based strategy game with RPG elements in general. I couldn't stop thinking about this game for days after I finished it and I normally don't even like turn-based strategy games (or it has to be something like Advance Wars).\n\nThis game is deep, as far as the story is concerned at least. You'll be losing plenty of people over the course of the game, and it's not necessarily because you made the wrong choice. It's because the choices *are* tough and there usually isn't a right answer to begin with. The game autosaves so you can't go back and try it again, and you can't save manually.\n\nThe artstyle and animations are just beautiful. I appreciated it, and enjoyed it, for the entire length of the game. There's just so many detail. The characters and the environments, especially when you're fighting. Normally all you see is empty looking environments with a tree or something, but here you have dead bodies lying around and destroyed villages. Nothing looks the same (as far as I can see). They put *a lot* of love in this game.\n\nIt also feels, and is, incredibly polished. It's simply amazing. The UI is small, clear and unobtrusive, but some things could've been explained a bit better. Some things are a bit unclear if you go to the character management screen, for example. It could benefit from more and better explanation. Still, no biggie.\n\nOne other thing that stuck with me are the difficulty spikes. These are random but annoying. However, you can change the difficulty on-the-fly so it's usually just a matter of pressing a button.\nThe game itself can take about 9-12 hours to complete, so it's a pretty big game. I personally never got bored of it.\n\nNow I'm anxiously awaiting the sequels, because man, this one set the bar pretty high for me. If they can maintain the same quality and polish it will be awesome, even if they decide to never add any new features.\n\nAbsolutely recommended !\n\n[Rating: 93/100]","April 28, 2014","true","11.3"," 106 of 131 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","106","131","0","2"

Its major strengths are its fantastic art, reminiscent of classic Disney or Don Bluth animated films, good soundtrack, and relatively challenging and compelling battles. My primary complaint with the game is that its story is told in a bit of an exhausting way with a ton of dialogue that's not easy to care about, and I was really ready for the game to end a few hours before it actually did. Also, the game feels episodic and I'd imagine more content is on the horizon. If that's the case, I really feel like the experience didn't need to be as padded out with so many seemingly same-y towns and encounters.

You'll be playing this game from the perspective of two different caravans.\n\nWhat an amazing game for its value, The art in this game is fantastic, the story is also very well done and the music is phenominal you'll enjoy this game if you enjoy turn table tatic with great art, story, and music with a viking theme to the entire game. only cutscenes had voice acting and that was pretty good. The only things I thought was meh in the game was is how a unit must kill off a unit to level up otherwise he'll stay level 1 forever so you'll have to really decide who you want to level up, the limited special moves  that each of the units had (which is 1) for each char, and  the lack of voice acting during the events scenes but this is understandable due to the fact that its an indie title and the focus of the budget was on everything else. So hopeful for future sequels to be even better.\n\nThe game itself is really hard due to the fact that you cannot heal your units in this game so you have to make your turn wisely,  Your units only levels up if they get the last kill which I was meh about, but the choices you make to either level up your army, buy some items, or supplies for the travel is gutwrenching making the game really challenging, especially since choices you make can effect your entire party and army and your currency (renown) is so limited.\n\nThere is many heroes to gather during your travel which you'll get to interact with at camp as you travel to learn about them. The travel itself which reminds me of oregon trail a bit,  is enjoyable to watch as your little army travel the lands and the events with decisions unfold for you to decide on how your battle will be or what the outcomes will be.  The map itself presents a sizeable amount of lore about the land itself and there are more to read as you travel.\n\n\n\n+Good story with good amount of lore and character interactions.\n+Great Art.\n+Music is fantastic.\n+much replayability due to choices you make in the game, also there is interaction with the heroes at camp.\n+its a 20 dollar game and have a good amount of hour in it, 10+\n\n-wish there was voice acting during the traveling event, lots of reading and text\n-each char only has one skill, not everyone has a buncha skills to utilize and the leveling is really straightforward since you can only level chars up to level 5 max, would love to see expansion of this\n-No multiplayer of any sort in this one, singleplayer only you'll have to play THE BANNER SAGA FACTIONS for this.","January 15, 2014","true","28.0"," 193 of 267 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","193","267","0","1"

And while watching the overworld slowly crumble under the pressure of enemies, there are many fun choices you'll make.\n\nThe story itself did have problems. The transitions between parties as well as the beginnng felt clunky, as if it was trying too hard to force too much information onto the users at once, especially in the beginning where you don't understand the concept of renown. Without giving away spoilers, some companions seemed to be set up to have arcs of conversations that never happened, as well as characters that were just thrown in with no personality at all.\n\nTo quote Narushima, whos review I found sad but true:\n\n"Oh look at that, you just lost two of your best characters forever because you clicked the wrong choices in a conversation that seemed trivial. Have fun trying to play with those lvl 1 or 2 characters that you were never interested in in the first place and who will never be able to do the same job! :)"\n\n"Oh no, you have no way of knowing how many days your journey will last, and therefore how much supplies you need, because you're never told, and half the time it's not even clear where you're going."\n\n"What's that, you thought you could explore more than one reply option in that dialog, because that's how they pretty much all work? Nope, not this time, and now you're stuck with a dumb decision you would have never chosen. You're welcome!"\n\nThe above statements are witty insults to the story, but honestly I still managed to enjoy it.\n\nThe art and animations were fantastic. Exceptionally well done. Reminds me of old Disney animations.\n\n\n\nBut there are parts of this game that are simply awful.\n\nYou have the option of choosing your banner in the main menu, they created over 800 of them though you'll probably not bother skimming them once and just go with the default banner, its a cosmetic choice so I ave no clue why they'd invest so much of their time into that and not enough into the gameplay.\n\nI LOVE srpgs (trpgs if you like) but I detested this game's awful mechanics.\n\nI'm sure many srpg fans have played several other games of the genre: fire emblem, xcom, etc.\n\nSo let's talk about XCOM. In XCOM, you have a unit of soldiers you command, different classes, all of which use different strategies on the field. Because I can't see through fog, I can cautiously walk through from cover to cover keeping my squad sade and update my map as I go or rush. In the expansion, I now have the incentive to rush so I don't miss out on lootable meld. Two possible strategies for exploring and advancing through the level with rewarding outcomes.\n\nXCOM has another strategy for combat: I move each of my units 1 time a turn and there are 3 enemies in front of me. I could attempt to have one of my soldiers walk behind enemy lines and flank the enemy, though if I brought him to cover its possible he'll be found out by another group of enemy soldiers, so I might want to risk just having him walk in front of them and attacking quickly and killing them before a counter attack (although this would put said solier at huge risk if i dont finish them off). I could also use one of my soldiers grenades, though he'd be out one for the whole mission, it'd destroy our enemies cover allowing us low risk execution. There are all kinds of tactical approaches I can use because this game has cover, height, destructible environments, each with different risks and rewards. That is EXACTLY the kind of thought process a srpg should have. Different strategies with different possible outcomes.\n\n\nSo does THIS game meet up to having all sorts of tactical strategies with different risks and outcomes? No. Absolutely not. Disgustingly bad.\n\nThere are three reasons.\n-Chess style gameplay. You have a turn to move a unit based on initiative. Your opponent moves a unit. This does not change until there is 1 unit on either side. As a result 2 units will move as fast as the combined speed of 10 units.\n-No cover, no terrain advantages, no heights, only minor cases of walls/objects you can't walkthrough.\n-The literal worst part of this design choice that led to the biggest problem of this game: injured/weakened foes do signifigantly less damage than healthy ones.\n\n\nIf you read those three balance decisions, you can probably figure out the single strategy to use for virtually all battles.\n\nMAIM, DON'T KILL.\n\nYes, that's right. You can essentially waste your opponents turn by savagely weakening his units, but absolutely never kill any unit until they've all been beaten. This way you mitigate the majority of damage your units take, waste your opponents turn, while retaining the benefits of your own turn. If a unit is weakened, you're best off using him as cannon fodder and letting him die asap so he's not a waste of turns.\n\nThis strategy... it would be one thing if it were only a cheap exploit, but its not. It's an ENFORCED strategy.\n\nIf you DON'T play by this strategy, the game punishes you, there is no superior strategy to this, and the game becomes difficult if you're trying to use any other strategy. With absolutely no cover or terrain advantages or heights it's just a math battle where u run your units over and see how much armor you'd be best off breaking before targeting the enemy hp without killing him. It's one of the single worst design ideas an srpg can have.\n\nIt is the literal worst srpg I have ever played in terms of gameplay. The genre is sorely lacking in games and I had the best wishes for this one. I've heard they were planning to bring that same battle mechanic back in its sequel. I'd recommend passing on this one.","January 12","false","34.0"," 171 of 239 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","171","239","4","18"

The Banner Saga boasts great visuals and beautiful soundtrack, character design is spot-on, reminiscent of older cartoons, while still being true to the nordic theme and as historically accurate as a fantasy saga can be.\n\nThe flaws lie in the gameplay, particularly in the fact the game concentrates too much value on Renown. It's the currency with which you buy food, amulets and level up heroes. It's also not that easy to come by, since it's mostly rewarded from killing things and winning battles (although you, very rarely, gain some for a choice).\n\nThe game alternates between frequent combat sections, where you and the enemy alternate in turns, regardless of numerical advantage. Combined with the fact strength is both HP and how much damage you can deal, this system encourages the player to not kill oponnents, but, instead, harm them until they all have low HP, only then should the player start the killing.\n\nThe fact renown is used for everything also limits character choices and story decisions. You'll be encouraged to be a psycopath, partaking as many battles as possible to gain extra renown. To make matters worse, there are no real consequences for such choices.\n\nMorale is almost meaningless, only awarding a few extra willpower points at the start of the battle. Supplies are also meaningless, seeing as fighters aside heroes have no effect on war outcome, as long as you win your battle (usually a charge, since it puts you against more enemies, which equals more renown), a team of 5 heroes could win a war against thousands of dredge.\n\nDowned heroes come back with injury whoose duration and severity depend on game difficulty setting. Ironically, these same immortal heroes can die arbitraly during text-based events while travelling.\n\nWhile I haven't been able to finish the game yet (always get bored by the game before being able to do so), I've seen users complain the story actually ends abruptely, leaving space for an obvious non-advertised sequel. The Banner Saga is actually just a first episode, despite not being advertised as such.\n\nEDIT: I have finished the game on a new playthrough, and the ending is indeed abrupt, with a short (non animated) cutscene right after a rather easy boss fight (just ignore every dredge and focus on the boss). Even if it's part of a trilogy, a game must feature a relatively complete story (compare it to a movie such as "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" and you can see how this kind of ending is unsatisfying). A bit more recently, the store page was updated to reveal banner saga as the first of a trilogy, despite that not being the case on release date.\n\nTo summarize: The Banner Saga has great visuals, soundtrack and (linear and relatively unfinished) story, but it's held short by bad gameplay which ranges from silly to frustrating, removing almost all immersion or tension the well written story can create.\n\nIf things don't get better in the sequel, I think stoic should give up on making games and start writting novels or animated short films.","June 4, 2015","false","30.4"," 124 of 171 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","124","171","3","7"

I supported you on Kickstarter, and I wanted so much to love you.  Your visuals are gorgeous, your music excellent, and your writing sublime.  But your gameplay!  Ah, your gameplay leaves much to be desired.\n\nDrama aside, The Banner Saga is a game that should have been excellent, but is marred by its actual gameplay.  The tactical combat is the sort that some will love and some will hate, but either way the initiative system is completely nonsensical, with units in each army getting to act more often as they become outnumbered.  Damage and health are also based on the same number, so as a character takes damage, he becomes increasingly ueless in battle - which is a serious problem if you outnumber your enemies.\n\nBut where the game really fails is the decisions it presents.  On the surface, it looks like the system used in many games: be presented with a situation, and react.  The problem is that it falls into the trap of frequently making the consequences of your choices arbitrary.  Sometimes you can reasonably predict what result each choice will produce, but most of the time the results come from nowhere, making the decisions effectively meaningless.  If the player can't reasonably exert control, why give him choices at all?\n\nThe game has been getting a lot of good reviews, so clearly my opinion is in the minority.  But I can't recommend it.

Anything more would be a mockery of the Viking apocalypse suffered by its characters. The atmosphere of Stoic Studios' first title is so evocative of desolation and despair that succeeding too grandly feels like a betrayal of the twilight sagas. With the gods dead and the sun stalled in the sky, humans and giants work together to eke out a shattered existence. The arrival of an ancient enemy throws the tenuous balance into question and sends desperate warrior caravans across the hostile landscape. The displaced and hopeful follow in their wake, scraping together what lives they can. The leaders of these caravans are forced to make difficult decisions, by which their followers live and die.\n\nThe point of view shifts several times throughout The Banner Saga, demonstrating the dire straits in which both humans and giants find themselves. However, in spite of the multiple views, so much about what's really happening remains unknown. Each caravan meets many people, most of whom have an angle for survival. Figuring out who can be trusted is one of the great challenges of the game, and also one of its greatest pleasures. It's easy to be trustworthy when supplies are high and no one's laid low by crippling wounds. Righteousness is more difficult to come by when the gods are dead, the horizon is alight with burning villages, and taking on new allies means condemning others to slow starvation.\n\nDespite the pervasive apocalypse, not all is lost. Stoic has done admirably at focusing on the personal stories at the epic's core. The key characters' motivations are well-explained, and their mysteries reveal themselves at an appropriate pace. Even when all seems lost, moments of heroism, compassion, and courage keep the narrative of doom from becoming crushing. The ending, such that it is, is powerful. Unfortunately, it is abrupt. Future chapters of the saga have already burdened themselves with the hype from the first installment's unanswered questions.\n\nEverything looks and sounds amazing. Character designs are rich and colorful, and their animation is like something from out of a lost 80s classic. The visuals scale impressively, handling great crumbling monuments and fierce monsters as well as delicate human gestures. The deliberate staging extends to travel scenes where no actions are allowed. Watching the caravan struggle through the landscape to deep chants and mournful horn movements offers counterpoint to moments of blood and steel. These contrasts demonstrate relatable smallness against the enormity of the end. Occasionally animations look uncanny against their backgrounds, but the characters are nuanced enough that the strangeness almost feels like a stylistic choice. The music is professionally orchestrated, and would stand out as a compliment to the mood no matter what medium it accompanied.\n\nWhereas The Banner Saga's story and sensory appeals are difficult to critique without gushing, its mechanics are more controversial. Combat has many quirks that may seem counter-intuitive to SRPG players. However, learning the ins and outs of the system can be an enjoyable puzzle. Battle takes place on a flat grid. Up to six plot-relevant allies, drawn from a frequently shifting pool, face off against a potentially frightening number of enemies. Battle proceeds in alternative rounds, with one member of the enemy force getting a turn for every allied turn. As a result, keeping weakened enemies alive is often an effective tactic. Hit points double as a character's damage capacity, so getting the enemy to waste a turn commanding a shattered unit can delay a stronger unit's attack.\n\nManaging each character's reserve of willpower and exertion - the amount of willpower that can be spent in a turn - draws the resource conservation elements from the rest of the game into battle. Every enemy killed provides bonus willpower that can be distributed to any character, allowing momentum to build from a victorious thrust. Racking up death willpower isn't always a strong enough incentive to overcome the strangeness of alternating combat rounds, but it helps. If the battle quirks get too unmanageable, it's possible to dial the difficulty down from hard or normal to easy.\n\nDespite its enjoyable features, not every desperately calculated moment of battle is joyous. Many battles begin with a large-scale conflict, which pits the caravan's rank-and-file soldiers against enemy hordes. The formation options in this system don't feel as strongly tied as they could be to the skirmishes that follow. Most battlefields are devoid of terrain, and facing doesn't matter. As a result, character placement, willpower expenditure, and party composition become the major tactical elements.\n\nThe sole currency for preparing for battle is renown. When all is lost, only a man's observed actions are important. Renown is used on stat-boosting treasure, character advancement, and purchasing supplies for the caravan. Focusing on any of these areas limits growth in the others, and doing everything is impossible. Keeping a trailing column of peasants fed is an admirable goal, but it becomes difficult to justify when contrasted with clicking the button that increases an ally's armor break ability. The choice is further complicated by the knowledge many more could die if the warriors aren't kept strong.\n\nPlaying The Banner Saga as a standard game of optimization and the greatest possible success may lead to disappointment. Trusting the crazy - eyed wanderer who smells of stale mead could be the best decision you make all week, or it could lead to a knife in your back. Rolling with the punches and accepting the permanent death of a favored all adds texture to the banner of a doomed people. Some choices are mechanically better than others, causing the more damaging answers to become less interesting during multiple replays. Certain tricks will only be novel the first time around, while others allow more strategic calculation.\n\nAll saves are autosaves, and are made at predetermined checkpoints. There's no indication when these saves occur, except manually checking the Load menu. Attempting the old Choose Your Own Adventure trick of sticking a bookmark in at a difficult decision point isn't so easy here. Loading a save to choose a new answer may require fighting several battles again. On the plus side, the game is short enough to invite multiple replays. Although the central narrative is the same every time, choices made along the way lead to different side paths and party composition. Simple, split-second decisions can lead to significant consequences.\n\nStoic Studios have set themselves up with a difficult act to follow. The Banner Saga is a rare game that forces its player to think and feel, often in delightful opposition. Its subsystems combine to support the narrative of desperate heroism, hard choices, and survival. Like the doomed giants who fight its battles, The Banner Saga is powerful, thoughtful, and worthwhile. Recapturing this winning combination is going to be risky. When a game is so precariously excellent, a wiggle either way in the sequel could spoil the formula that made the first so magical. Regardless of whether future installments stand or fall, The Banner Saga has done its duty. It may not always give gamers what they want, but it gives them what they need: challenging questions, tactical gameplay, and a strong, fully realized atmosphere.","December 2, 2014","true","146.3"," 74 of 96 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","74","96","0","3"

It's probably one of the more challenging games within the genre. I personally had to play it a little over 2 times through just to get a better foothold on the combat system.\n\nHere are a few observations I can make after playing over 30 hours of the game:\n\nPro:\n- The game is VERY challenging. The jump in difficulty between easy to hard is extremely high and there is a very small room for error in most battles.\n- Great visuals. The characters (from the animation to actual design) are amazing. The landscapes are gorgeous and you get to experience them in full as you travel to the final destination.\n- Numerous tactical possibilities! When you finish the game for the first time on Normal, you'll be able to decide how you want to invest your resources and who you want to invest them on. This opens up a lot of possibilities when it comes to character placement/formations. Even though there's little room for error when playing on hard, there's a ton of ways to overcome each challenge based on decisions you've made from prior experience.\n\nCon:\n- The camera controls are limited. I would have liked to see keys binded to auto-move to each of your characters. You have a max of 6 so f1-f6 or 1-6 would have been nice.\n- No key binding. I know there's not a lot of use for the keyboard in this game.. but a skip function to automatically rest for willpower would have been very helpful.\n\n\nAll in all, it's a really good game. There's a lot of things to appreciate in this game and you can tell that a lot of effort was poured into polishing the experience. I hope that this game continues with further installments because I would gladly pay full price for more of this masterpiece!","March 19, 2014","true","31.7"," 64 of 82 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","64","82","0","0"

It has a unique feel even if everything is stolen from Norse mythology. The story was captivating, so much to the point that I yelled in fury when I happened to loose a member of my party. Combat is perhaps less than groundbreaking with originality but it was certainly solid and very rewarding when it came to leveling up characters.\n\nI got a couple of the giants mixed up for a while, but aside from that, most characters have a unique backstory that fleshes out as things progress. It is certainly worth it to read into everybody's capabilities, for the most subtle traits  they posses play out very importantly once you realixe their potential. Every battle should be played with the intent of keeping as many of your fighters intact, lest you be forced to send in your benchwarmers in for the next fight.\n\nThe artwork was impressive, captivating, and downright epic, however.......... the first cutscenes really got me stoaked for kickass cartoon "Heavy Metal-esq" laden story line. The artwork let my hopes fall gracefully rather than total disapointment.\n\nDespite the fact that I have 1 and a half playthroughs under my belt I do not see an increible amount of playability, although it seems as though a few play throughs could be rewarding due to the amount of different options/results offered throughout the game.\n\nNow, here's where I'm not totally sure how I feel about the game: Choices. Some choices totally blindside you with how determental/beneficail they can be. They game has a habit of throwing scores of petty situtions in your face just so that you'll be unaware of the severity of a certain choice and suffer because you did not treat it with appropiate reverment. I mentioned earlier that I have one and a half playthroughs; this is because I utter screwed myself in the first game so I went back to ammend my "mistakes". If you've ever layed D&D, this game has the feel of a ruthless yet rewarding DM that often sets you up to hang yourself with your own noose once you get things going.\n\nAll in all, I loved playing this game, yet I do not see myself playing it in the immediate future.","November 6, 2014","true","23.3"," 62 of 81 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","62","81","2","0"

Well, the world and the background story are pretty good, plus the game doesnt feel too short nor too long... I actually was positively surprised by it, I thought the story would draw to an end earlier.\n\nHere's a collection of random thoughts I have about the game:\n\n1) you spend almost half of your time staring at a long string of tiny characters plodding at unnatural speed through snowy landscapes.\n2) the map is not integrated at all in the game. You dont have any saying in which direction your caravan is going, everything is decided. You can access the map only when you camp or stop the caravan, and at that point I've already forgotten where I am supposed to go... why isnt the map shown when the route to be taken is presented to the player? there's a huge map full of Norse-sounding names, and you can click on most of them to get additional info... but why would you? I got bored after a while, like with the planets' descriptions in Mass Effect. You dont just dump a huge map to the players to satisfy their thirst of knowledge, you introduce the world little by little with bits and pieces that are relevant to the story.  In TBS only a handful of locations on the map matter for the story and they are all non-descriptive... one town or the other, they feel all the same (except the Varl capital).\n3) I heard some people saying "The dialogues are really good"... well I dont know what kind of games these people have been playing but the dialogues in TBS range from average to bad, with a couple bordering to nonsensical (e.g. the one of the mead house stands out for making little to no sense). I grew more and more irritated.\n4) Another little irritating thing: the lines in dialogues only proceed forward. If you press accidentally the mouse key (in my case the trackpad) you will skip to the next line without possibility to go back. it happened to me a bunch of times, I play with the finger resting on the Macbook's trackpad and a little twitch sends the dialogue forward\n5) the story feels really average, many questions are left completely unanswered... I can only guess they might be doing a sequel to expand on the story. I'm not gonna mention anything to avoid spoilers but seriously there's stuff that happens that you feel it's major and could definitely steer the story some way or the other, but instead nothing happens and the event/story element is not mentioned anymore afterwards.\n6) the fighting system is super clunky, doesnt feel fluid at all. You are often pitted against more numerous / stronger enemies and your characters never seem to level up fast enough for the fight to feel equal. Moreover they are equipped with abilities which are often difficult to use (this ability? Only works with enemies which are positioned EXACTLY diagonally in respect to the original target. Oh you think it's hard to use? How about we make it so that it can inflict damage also to your allies?), or semi-useless (each time my Raidmaster used Stone Wall he's never been targeted afterwards; Rain of Arrows, Mend, and others are so nerfed they suck). In the end it pretty much resolved in "I start chipping down the armor first, then I go for the health" with basic attacks, hoping the bad guys would go down before mine. Sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt. Lost maybe 1/3 of the battles, without chance to replay them.\n7) the big-scale clashes are just ridiculous... you can chose one of the strategies like "Hold them" or "charge" or "tighten your ranks", and how the battle will resolve feels totally random. If it is not, than there is no way to understand the logic behind it.\n8)  I felt no attachment whatsoever for the characters nor the caravan members (i.e. people who depended on me for protection and leadership). Especially the caravan members, they are just a stat, when they starve you see the numbers going down and the morale plunging and you're like "yeah so what? the game continues anyway.". This is a major drawback, you dont feel you have anything to lose, you can lose all the battles and starve out almost everyone in the caravan, you will still go on. At a certain point I started playing like a di*k, thinking "well let's see how much I can f-up before I get a game over screen"... it never came. Ok for the story-driven playability, but this is still a game. If the game plays itself what's the point?\n9) you are forced to make totally random choices. E.g. how many ratios to buy before setting on a leg of the journey... you have no idea how many days it will last... how about informing the player?? Renown is always scarce, because it is mainly used to evolve characters, so it would be good to have some planning before spending some hard-gained renown.\n10) The banner itself plays NO role at all in the story, it is mentioned in one line of dialogue and that's it. For the whole game. So much for a whole "saga"....\n11) Hardly any tutorial in the game, just a basic one about combat. How about explaining how the different abilities work? I had to quit the game and resume from last checkpoint when I realised my assumptions about a certain ability were off and I lost the little tactical advantage I had because I screwed up\n12) I dunno what was the reason, not enough money to put in the artistic production or time constraints, but I got so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when I realised (and i realised it pretty soon in the game) that there is only one image for each character. All the dialogues, during the whole story, the same expression. Zero emotion response. Oddleif is stuck with the same scornful expression for the whole game, Eyvind with a sorry-♥♥♥♥♥ smile, and Ubin goes around holding his quill even in the middle of a battle.","December 20, 2014","false","27.6"," 87 of 124 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","87","124","11","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/237990/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The Banner Saga’s awe inspiring scope is both its biggest strength and weakness.\n\nIt paints a picture so lavish and compelling that its almost irritatingly compelling with each new thread it introduces, so rich that you want to spend time learning about every character and piece of lore but haven’t the time to do so. In a medium so oversaturated with derivative fantasy, the distinctiveness of the world Banner Saga creates pulled me in eagerly awaiting even the most trivial of pieces of exposition. It wrapped me up so tightly in its intrigue that even when its problems surfaced they could do little to take me out of the experience, the only real issue then being that said experience unfortunately only has enough time to tell part of its story.\n\nThe Banner Saga is quite simply the telling of the end of days. The Sun has stopped moving, the gods are dead, and the return of an enemy thought extent threaten to annihilate those few who still survive. It’s bleak and unrelenting in its showcasing of how dire a place the world has become, as you embark on a caravan fleeing to anywhere not already destroyed, many not living to see the journey’s end.\n\nThe tension of the narrative - the abundant despair and sacrifice every step of the way - rejects the overly cautious writing far too often substituted in for more disruptive outcomes, and makes the characters you travel with people you care and worry about. With how constant the possibility of death becomes, I was invested not only in each character’s narrative but also in fighting to keep them alive as best I could. The choices presented before you become agonizing decisions that often decides who lives and dies, leaving me paralyzed as I hoped I’d made the right call. It’s stressful, but crucial to the story Banner Saga wants to tell and the emotion it intends to make you feel, and it succeeds at this almost perfectly.\n\nThe lack of voice acting or animated cutscenes for most of the game definitely at times hinders the impact of events, but by the time these begin to arrive I was already so caught up in who my characters were that dialogue alone was enough to humanize them. The bigger “problem” is that Banner Saga’s narrative and world are on a scale far larger than a single game can contain, and as a result many of the story’s plotlines both overt and secondary are left dangling, with a statement that they will be expanded upon with the next two games in a planned trilogy, but for the time being left me frustrated that I was so quickly cut off. Of course I say this only because of how enthralling the narrative is already, but it was a tad disappointing to see so much setup but only partially executed, leaving me with more questions than answers and praying this adventure gets finished.\n\nWith how seamlessly the experience flows together, it might be easy to forget that under all the plot and jaw-dropping artwork exists a polished and inspired turn-based strategy game. The Banner Saga works as a game of small, important numbers and mechanical simplification so as to make every fight immediately understandable. There are very few numbers to be concerned about, and every one that is here matters and is imperative to make the absolute most of if you want your party to survive. Fights are designed not as giant encounters or grand boss fights, but small battles that often come down to the last fighter standing. This raw, streamlined approach was refreshing, not only in that it cut down on the number of throwaway encounters but also made me far more conscious of every tool at my disposal.\n\nParty creation and leveling were more meaningful to me as each character played a distinct role in combat, and raising their skills was a rare and extremely important event. The low numbers tied to everything kept things from ever becoming overwhelming, and made positioning of fighters just as if not more important than the blunt force they could inflict. With each battle intimately tied to the narrative, I also became conscious of who it was I was sending into battle, a decision that could potentially result in them never coming back.\n\nThe areas where combat breaks slightly are mostly related to a handful of oversights as to what information you’re given. Though you might have been given hints via a preceding narrative bit, you’re never allowed to see who or what you’re fighting before the fight has already begun. This makes selecting the right fighters almost a game of luck or forcing you to develop a standardized strategy and only focus on characters that work within it (which of course is compromised if one of those characters dies or is injured). It prohibits experimentation and seems kind of silly, as surely you could see the battle you were going into before you walked into it. This extends even into letting you see character stats, level up, or change items on the party select screen, which can have a huge effect on your outcome if you haven’t recently looked at and adjusted these earlier.\n\nWhat’s surprising though, is that The Banner Saga’s flaws for as irritating as they often are feel less like problems and more potential. There’s so much here that’s inspired, engaging, and full of promise that anything that doesn’t work perfectly doesn’t bring the game down but show areas where it could be made even more amazing. This doesn’t make it a flawless game, but it does make it one that’s worth playing despite any mistakes it makes. Developer Stoic’s ambition is intoxicating and left me not unsatisfied by what The Banner Saga isn’t, but excited to see just how much more it becomes.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 3, 2014","true","11.1"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","36","41","0","5"

I failed, even though the story looks interesting enough and the visuals are beautiful.\nI have read from others how they dislike that choices give little hint to as what the outcome could be. Even worse is how the story swaps between protagonists and thus those outcomes are arbitrarily moved into the future.\nStill, I'd try to play it if it wasn't for the gameplay. The combat must be the worst turn based combat I have experienced. Units can move past enemies, in and out of melee without any fear of turning their backs on enemies. While attacks of opportunity have become a staple for many games, they are non-existent in the Banner Saga. Coupled with how units can burn Willpower for extra moves and then burn Willpower to boost their attack, means that even if you try to tie up an enemy in melee, they can still stroll past your fighters and get to your back row. After all, archery range is within charge distance. And since movement is always the same, there is no chance to get out of melee range once an opponent has gotten close.\nEven worse is the initiative system. Both sides take turns moving units, meaning that the side with less units gets to move those more often. If those are more powerfull, having twice the stats of the player's units, then those powerfull enemies hit multiple times before you have the time to even try to save your hero.\nYes, you can learn to beat these fights. But it seems less like adapting tactics than learning to play a broken system.\n\nI had heard combat was bad, but I had not expected it to be this bad. At least I bought it very cheap on the Humble Store for a good cause.","December 23, 2014","false","8.5"," 167 of 256 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","167","256","7","9"

TL;DR: This game is too short, the story left wholly unfinished, and your choices matter much less than the game leads you to believe. Purchase only on a good sale.\n\nAt first blush, this game is evocative and intriguing; the artwork is beautiful and the characters well-wrought. It's sort of an Oregon Trail meets turn-based RPG, and the story appears vast and your choices deeply important.\n\nUnfortunately this game fails to deliver in three key areas: choice, story, and length.\n\nAt the beginning you feel like your choices matter. Make a wrong decision and you run out of food, or an important character dies. Later, you realize that you're pretty firmly on the rails; you might save people here or there, but in the end, it doesn't really matter much who lives and who dies. I was deeply disappointed to discover this, as the game felt like it offered really gritty options in the beginning.\n\nThe story and length problems go hand-in-hand--this feels like a book you slam shut in the middle and never pick up again. There are so many loose threads that doesn't have answers, so many stories left untold. The ending felt so abrupt that I had to do some internet searches to see if I'd somehow screwed up and ruined my game, or if the credits just happened to roll in the middle. It didn't end, it just dropped off into oblivion. I got roughly six hours of gameplay out of this, so the $10 sale price tag wasn't too bad. If there's a sequel released, I'll pick it up for roughly the same price...but for now I feel cheated. Not in price, but in story. There's so much left unfinished that I feel unsettled, and the realization that my choices matter not is rather disappointing as well.","December 26, 2014","true","7.5"," 49 of 63 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","49","63","3","1"

It is a beautiful, emotionally involving and utterly unique experience, but sadly I found this first installment to be marred by a host of frustrating design problems.\n\n\nThe artistic vision of The Banner Saga is without peer. Its world, characters and story are depicted with rare clarity and conviction, without compromise. The visual style is bleak yet gorgeous and can be mistaken for no other game. The music (by the talented Austin Wintory of 'Journey' fame) powerfully evokes a forlorn, dying world. The writing too is excellent throughout, defining tragic characters with sombre nuance.\n\nThe combat in the game is also novel and interesting, with great tactical depth. Battles are tense and strategic, and the developers succeeded admirably at weaving it into the storyline - battles affect choices and choices affect battles, each adding meaning to the other. That a turn-based combat game kept me so enthralled with its story (an unremittingly bleak one, at that) is a testament to the talent and passion of the studio.\n\n\nThat said, at the same time everything feels somehow underproduced; voice acting and animation are conspicuously absent in all but a few scattered scenes, and each character has one fixed expression - which can sometimes be incredibly inappropriate to the dialogue. While it is true that the art design of the game is deliberately spare, my impression was that some things had been over-simplified, as if the game had been rushed to completion.\n\nMinor cosmetic issues aside, the game felt unfinished in other more problematic ways. It crashed several times for me, and on each occasion I suffered from poorly placed autosaves. The combat interface also frequently proved vague or incomplete, in many cases failing to explain critical rules. One consistent frustration was the inability to undo or preview character movement, in cases where the (often severe) consequences of a particular move could not be determined beforehand - this did not seem like a deliberate choice, but as with the incomplete UI more likely due to a lack of playtesting.\n\n\nThe most frustrating aspect of the game, for me, was the handling of player narrative choices. This story is one of loss and hopelessness, so as such I accept that there are no happy endings to be found, but rather a series of tragedies to be survived. And as in combat, the player is asked to make difficult decisions, with no clear right answer - but unlike in combat, the consequences are utterly random. In combat, the player is asked to make careful choices and is rewarded with various bonuses on success. These bonuses usually relate to specific characters, as do the combat choices, so this feedback cycle works well, strengthening engagement with the characters and story in a satisfyingly consistent way.\n\nNarrative choices on the other hand, often reward the player with an unforeseeable slap in the face, throwing away much of their prior hard work - for example by stealing away a character in whom the player had already invested a lot of time and emotional energy. I question why player choice is involved at all, if it does not involve skill. If the intended purpose was to make the player identify with the hopelessness of the characters' situation, then this would have worked better if the choices embodied clear tradeoffs: in a bad situation, allow the player to pick which sacrifice to make, based on what is more important to them or to the character. But by consistently leaving me feeling cheated and powerless, by the end of the game it merely served to reduce my engagement with the characters and plot.\n\n\nYears from now I feel sure that I will remember The Banner Saga more for its strengths than for its weaknesses. The beauty of the experience implies a great deal of talent, and the various flaws are all fixable - as such I still highly recommend the game, and have high hopes for its sequels!","February 10, 2014","true","29.7"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","38","45","0","3"

The ideas are certainly there, the story is interesting, the music is excellent, but gameplay-wise, it has some pretty egregious design problems.\n\nConsider that players replaying the game regularly consult a guide to check when certain characters might die, in order to not waste resources levelling before that point. Then consider that on your first run, you don't have that - you have the option to choose from an assortment of characters, spending your points (renown) on whoever you please. But while they can die from your negligence, they generally don't: they die from purely unpredictable events instead.\n\nWell that's how surviving in a viking wasteland is, yes? That's how it should be!\n\nThe trouble is that this is not FTL - a run is not 1-2 hours, it's 10, and it isn't replayable if you find yourself trapped with a now-useless team after luck decides to screw you. It's harsh, and adds to the tone of the game, but it's also ruinous. Save-scum, save-scum.\n\nDouble-edged sword that may be, I can see the justification for it. What I can't justify, at all, is that the game essentially does nothing with it's random encounter system. Events pop up and you're faced with options. Based on my runthrough of the game, I'd say you get positive outcomes maybe a fifth of the time. Further adding to the harsh climate of the game, etc, etc... the trouble is, your options tend to lie in shades of grey between the -right- thing and the -wrong- thing to do in any given case... and THERE IS ZERO DIFFERENCE. They're all dice rolls, and that I started at a point of angelic service to my fellow survivors and slowly arced towards commiting horrible deeds for my tribe caused not one change. It was dice rolls all the way through; you get nothing in exchange for that guilt, and seeing what emotional impact it has on the player to decide, I'll murder this person in front of my (character's) daughter, when you take the plunge and hit that button ----> dice roll. The same dice roll. 80% of the time, it goes bad, and you feel worse.\n\n(On a lesser note, a gripe: this game totally does not have good animation, as nearly everyone is excited to share. It has a very cool art style, but central story beats aren't illustrated; they're all just text... including the climax.)\n\nI leave off with one thing. The final boss is very very poorly designed, requiring a combat style the rest of the game would punish (rushing in a straight line forward), and I didn't/couldn't finish with the team I had, and I now have no intention of continuing with this franchise.\n\nCross your fingers. You might find the telepathy to make the right decisions, and the game might be fun!\n\nFor me it was a lesson in negative reinforcement.","May 9, 2015","false","10.6"," 217 of 341 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","217","341","6","7"

The animation and soundtrack are phenomenal. The combat is satisfying.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe story is slow to start but by the time it gets interesting the game ends. The story is presented almost entirely through text and that text reads like a "choose your own adventure novel". This would be fine but the quality of writing is lacking and the way the text jumps between third person perspective and second person narrative is annoying. It's especially annoying because there are multiple points of view for a majority of the game.\n\nI'm an avid reader so I don't mind reading in my RPGs but I at least want some consistency.\n\nAs for the main game mechanics it's a lot like a 2D Oregon Trail. The campaign consists of two stories following two player controlled caravans as they cross a map. Most of the choices given the player consist of:\n\nDo the smart but heartless thing\nDo the dumb but moral thing\nDo nothing\nThere will be other options but they either return you to previous "options" or are just variations on the same.\n\nThe main game mechanics  consist of making dialogue choices and trying to keep your caravan of refugees alive by making the correct choices.The entire game is on rails so you don't actually change the story or make meaningful decisions (outside of combat), you just get rewarded or punished for the choices you make.\n\nSummary\n\nAll in all the lack of real game content and lackluster story heavily detract from a beautiful game that could have been brilliant but just overall feels lacking. There's also nothing to do after the main story has concluded but play the game again. I would be okay with that if they story had been well written and the other game mechanics had been fun.\n\nIf you're looking for a finished tactical RPG keep looking. This is apparently the first of three chapters but it's up in the air if those will be made, and as it is this is not a finished game. It ends abruptly just as the story becomes interesting, and no matter what you do, the ending is the same. The store page should be more reflective of the fact that this is not a single player version of Banner Saga Factions, but is in fact more like Oregon Trail, with some tactical combat tacked on. Or maybe it's the other way around, but either way it doesn't work.\n\nUpdated Review on 1/16","January 15, 2014","false","17.9"," 184 of 290 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","184","290","0","0"

I played through the game twice. The first time I played was about a year ago. I'm trying to find some quick snippet I can use to surmise the game but nothing comes forth. So I guess I'll provide some exposition.\n\nIts a turn based, tile based, highly narratively driven up to 5 person party adventure. You make decisions as the leader of a large group of traveling humans and a race-- Well, more of a species called the Varl; which more or less are giants.\n\nYou are constantly having to manage resources. Battles earn you renown, which is used as a currency and XP. Renown can buy you items for your characters to wear to increase stats, supplies for travel as well as allow ready candidates to level up. Resources are needed on the road for your traveling companions to survive. As well as keep morale up. Poor morale can effect the abilities of your fighters in the from of losing willpower.\n\nOn the road you will run into events that you will have to make decisions about. Including dealing with everything from fights in the caravan to deciding to trust outsiders or not. I never quite pinned down if they are all scripted or procedurally generated. Some but not all seem very timely.\n\nCOMBAT\nThe battle system takes a little time to get used to as its slightly obtuse at first. Each characters health is their strength, what this means is as someone gets hurt they progressively become weaker and their strength is directly blocked by the enemies armor. So you must choose to either attack their health or armor. There are some other variables such as willpower, which allow you to move farther or do extra damage in one turn. Killing enemies earn you a notch on the horn which equates to an extra willpower lying in wait when needed. Some other stats that effect the two main ones are exertion and armor break. Exertion limits how much willpower one can use even if they have more. Armor break allows one to do more damage to armor regardless of other variables. There are of course classes for all the characters which have specific abilities such and Tempest, a sort of whirlwind attack and others like Forge ahead that allow you to choose someone to move up in the turn order. If a character falls in battle they will become injured and need to rest, usually for multiple days. The character can still be used in other battles while injured at the cost of lowered stats typically.\n\nThe game does have multiple endings. I am interested to see what happens in the sequel regarding them. I will also say the game does sort of end abruptly. It does come to a climax but to be honest, a lot it seems a bit unresolved.\n\nThe game is also, from what I can tell, hand drawn. Characters have very fluid animations when attacking and the overall aesthetic is very pleasing.\n\nTHE GIST\nThis is maybe one of my favorite games in the last.. decade? One of the most gripping, memorable and emotional games I've played in my life. Definitely in the top 20 ever. Difficult decisions abound. Stuck in between a rock and a hard place? Can't move the rock? Don't have a drill? People are relying on you ya know. Better think about your actions.","March 26","true","19.0"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","37","46","0","1"

Just look, if you haven't. What you can't actually "experience", unless you actually play the game, is the excellent bonding of the music with the visuals and the atmosphere it creates. That's also unique and powerful, worth another thumbs up. Now, lets get to the main course, the combat system. If you've played Factions, the free-to-play offspring release in March 2013, you know what I'm talking about. The combat mechanics are very sharp and allow for great simplicity and remarkable strategy depth, at the same time! It's the paragon of the "easy to learn but hard to master" type of game. Finally, the last merit I'm gonna give to the game is the marvelous lore and deeply detailed world they have created. It takes a lot off of the viking/Norse history, but it also blends-in many fantasy themes in a very successful way.\n\nThe BadOK, enough with the good stuff. Lets see the bad ones. Actually, what hurts most about this game is its own extremely high potential. I mean, it offers so much potential that seeing it come short of that is enough to let you down. For me, the biggest problem about the game is that the final product feels a little rushed, kinda unfinished in the sense of consistency and balancing. There aren't big flaws in the core mechanics of the game, but it could use a lot more polishing. I'm gonna bring up some specific issues so that you understand what I mean:\n\n-- No subtitles : VO is really scarce (not a problem for me), so why aren't there any subtitles? EDIT: This was fixed with the first patch.\n\n-- Caravan/Survival balancing issues : Sometimes the game feels too hard for its own sake. I mean, it's supposed to be hard, about survival and all, but at some points it just feels wrong and falls out of perspective. EDIT: This was addressed, to some extent, by the first patch. Chapter 6 is now kinda easier, but there's still no incentive to try to keep your clansmen alive, or have more join you...\n\n-- Language & typos : In my opinion, the language used is often too "casual American" styled, something that hits bad with respect to the viking theme of the world. Also, there's quite some typos and syntax errors. The game's text is a lot (compared to other games) but not so much, really... EDIT: A lot of the typos were fixed with the first patch. Some more remain. Translations/localizations in 7 more languages were added with subsequent patches. The quality of some localizations was sub-standard, according to native speakers.\n\n-- Inconsistencies and awkward "story delivery" : The game is all about a branching story line, where each choice you make has consequences. That's fine. Problem is that it feels like some story parts don't quite glue together, or the pacing of the story changes from Chapter to Chapter sometimes putting you off. That's more noticeable near the end of the game, where the pace dramatically picks up, and you are bombarded by a lot events all at once, that you barely have time to digest. Also, I could argue that the ending sequence is a little wanting in view of the climax that precedes it. Finally, it's quite evident that the game is just the first part of the proclaimed trilogy, so it leaves a lot of unanswered questions. It's not a cliffhanger per se, but close enough.\n\nMy opinionTo conclude, I'm giving it the thumbs up because it's a beauty to behold and has four very strong components (visuals, music, battle system, theme/lore). Also, I believe that most of the problems I found can be easily addressed with patches without meaning that the game is "bad" in its release state. I'll say it once more -- The only thing that is not perfect about the game, is that it has the potential to be more than perfect!","January 18, 2014","true","214.9"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","37","47","0","2"

The backdrop was visually stunning, and this was easily the games strongest feature. It really did a great job of not only creating a game setting, but also adding an air of mystery and intrigue and foreboding to the game.\n\nThe combat itself was fairly simplistic as far as hex based battle systems go. The RNG aspect can create some frustrating moments, but can also conversely make you so stoked that you took a low percentage chance and succeeded.\nThe RPG upgrading system likewise was fairly simple.\n\nAs far as the writing goes, the story itself well complemented the artistic design of the game, or vice versa, lol, and the characters were pretty interesting in my opinion, overall. They weren't fully fleshed out, but I didnt feel they needed to be, and for what the game was presenting, I thought the whole thing worked quite well.\n\nSo, based on all that, with the excellent story writing, the cool characters, the amazing set piece, and the decent combat, this game should really be one of the best. However, it had some very real issues that knock it down some.\n\nFor one, as good as the writing was, realistically, none of your choices leading up to the finale really mattered, EXCEPT who you leveled up. Speaking of which, party members only level up through use, which I feel, based on the type of game it is, is something of a failure. I feel party members should level together in games like this, or at least, the unused ones should get some sort of experience. Otherwise, you end up woefully unprepared later when you are FORCED to use certain characters, arguably the ones that held the least appeal through the rest of the story as far as using them in battle went.\n\nSo, like I say, your choices didnt really matter. You have to fight starvation and loss through battle based on your actions, which for the bulk of your group (the common soldiers, scouts, and peasants), basically affected the amount of survivors left when you get to the final city WHERE they all die anyway, lol. However, your party decisions definitely matter, and because you are forced to use certain characters later in the game, and one specifically for the final battle sequence (the daughter), you would be encouraged to use them EXCEPT, the game really doesn't hint at that. They are mostly the characters you will find least useful overall, and that coupled with a distinct lack of anything suggesting they might be important later, virtually guarantees that most players will face the same complications later in the game.\n\nSo, this matters because the final battle is two stages and relies solely on the daughters archery skills to win. However, there was no real reason to level her up through the game, and I know that most players enter that final battle with an under leveled primary use character, which generally spells defeat.\n\nNow, it is my understanding that the developers listened to these same complaints from a large percentage of the people who played this just after release and made some adjustments, but I haven't played it since those patches were released, so I cant speak to whether they really helped out with these issues or not. My understanding was the patch release focused on the final battle, so that aspect might be better now.\n\nAnyway, I think overall, I want to give this game an 8 out of 10, but all the issues with it make me drop my rating down to about a 6.5 out of 10.\n\nI do intend to revisit this game and see how the patches impacted things, so I will revise this review if necessary after I do so. Regardless, it is a game worth experiencing, so I do in fact recommend it.","March 5, 2015","true","19.5"," 51 of 72 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","51","72","4","4"

Three reasons stand out:\n\nFirst, the writing is superb. I recently finished Divinity: Original Sin, and have played all kinds of RPGs from the old Baldur's Gate titles to Morrowind to System Shock 2 and a lot in between. This game manages what few others do: create believable, interesting characters without walls of text. I like reading, but I don't like huge amounts of text that do little to further the story, character development or immersion. Even though I liked D:OS a lot, and the game had some great writing, a lot of the dialogue was just doing nothing to these ends. The density of little clues and nuances in the Banner Saga is astonishing, coupled with some humor and great attention to setting-appropriate terminology.\n\nSecond, this might be the first game ever that managed to make me feel pressed. Generally, games I've played fall in two categories when it comes to time-crucial missions: either they don't enforce it at all mechanically, meaning that while the princess is being eaten by the bad guy I still have all the time I need to loot chests, talk to strangers and tend to my weapons. Or they implement some kind of timer - an option I hate with a passion because it feels so out-of-setting and forced. In the Banner Saga the whole setting screams 'hurry up' - and you do, by weighing the alternatives and choosing how much time to allocate to them. At least to me, it never feels artificial, or unfair, or like a difficulty-thing, it's just part of the story.\n\nThird, and fans of A Song of Ice and Fire will likely agree, the fact that beloved characters can die on a whim makes the whole cast and your decisions infinitely more interesting. I'm generally someone aiming for the best possible outcome in RPGs, including loading a save game when something turned out to be a bad decision. In the Banner Saga, for the first time ever perhaps, I did not feel annoyed by bad things happening to me. It's just 'damn... guess the next few hours just got a lot harder'.\n\nAll in all a very, very good game, including the ending. Fights can get a bit repetitive since you only have one special ability per character, and some of those are frankly useless, but that's a minor gripe since the system is still well executed and challenging while staying fair. Maybe we should combine D:OS's combat system with the story and writing of the Banner Saga to create the perfect RPG.","October 4, 2014","true","8.8"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

I started playing Banner Saga a few days ago however - I wasn't sure what to expect from it, the screenshots looked more like a point and click adventure, a genre which I normally don't enjoy as much - thankfully I was wrong.\n\nThe Banner Saga is heavy role playing game where you face numerous scenarios throughout the story, each decision you make will impact the outcome and general feel of the game.\n\nThe story goes extremely deep into Viking saga and history, which if you are interested in that sort of thing, this will already be a winner for you. The devs have done a very good job at making you feel you are part of the caravan and are right there in the midst of it all.\n\nThe game does start out quite slow, but as you get past the first chapter, it picks up pace and you keep wanting more.\n\nThe actual game play is a turn-based strategy basis. Again strategy is not normally one of my favorite genres but The Banner Saga does a very good job at introducing all the elements and features of the game at a slow but reasonable pace for you to get used to them.  By the end of the game you'll be able to blast through your turns without thinking at all, very simple (which is a good thing in my eyes).\n\nGraphic wise, the 2D art is beautiful. It looks as if every scene has been hand drawn. Length of the game is just right - a full playthrough for me took about seven and a half hours, and this was with picking up quite a few achievements along the way.\n\nI highly recommend The Banner Sage as it will be a welcome addition to your library if you give it a chance.\n\nMore reviews at - http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/","August 23, 2014","true","7.6"," 81 of 124 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","81","124","3","1"

Why? Simply based on the artwork, turnbased combat and the setting of the game. And mostly, your decisions affect your journey! I played The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among us and I like to have some choice in the direction a story is heading.\nBasically it's Vikings on the Run (would have been a good title as well, but not nearly as cool as The Banner Saga). You're fleeing from a "robotic" army called the Dredge. On your journey you meet people, villages and enemies. You meet a lot of those so you have to make a lot of decisions on how to approach each situation.\nFor example: A Village you pass is under attack by Dredge. Will you help the villagers (chance of casualties or other surprises and possibly a cool reward), wil you sneak past (no casualties if you aren't discovered) or will you watch the fight (and later check out the village and maybe kill the remaining Dredge)?\nAll decisions lead to a different situation, and they can not be taken back. Luckily there is no time limit on your decision so you can take your time to think it through. Whatever you choose, you never know what's going to happen. You might even lose main characters by "bad" decisions, and believe me, you WILL make bad decisions ;)\n\nSo you're on the run with a rather large crew of Vikings: Warriors, women, old people, giants, kids... a whole community.\nLot of people means a lot of problems. You're not only fighting the Dredge, there's a lot more happening. Intrigue, jealousy, betrayel, you name it. And they need food too, so you have to keep that in mind as well.\n\nNow the fighting part. You fight a lot in this game so don't underestimate it.\nIt's turnbased and actually imo it's the worst part of the game. Once you find a tactic that works you can stick to that most of the game. There isnt much variation in fighters: you have your tanks, archers, warriors and a rare magician. All characters have different special skills, but you can finish most battles without thinking too hard which characters to use (simply those who have the highest skills). Oh, and each character can equip 1 special item to boost some stats. These special items can be found on your journey or bought at a town market.\nYour enemies are of the same type: big ones, small ones, magic ones and those that can do ranged attacks. Sounds basic? Yes it is. At this moment I've seen a lot of battles and they bore me.\n\nConclusion:\nIf youre looking for a Viking version of a good turnbased combat game this isnt for you. If youre looking for a RPG look further. If you want a fast game, tough luck.\n\n"That's a lot of bad stuff you wrote, why did you give it a thumbs up?"\nYes it has some major flaws but the story keeps me going, even though it's not even the best I've ever seen in a game. The graphics are beautiful. The amount of decisions you have to make is impressive. The soundtrack is good, nothing fancy.\nIt's a game that makes me want more, which is impressive. I consider myself a bit spoiled and I'm not easily impressed by a game anymore. I play 1h -1.5h sessions almost every day (my gaming time is limited and my backlog is huge). I'm sure I'll finish this soon and I'm looking forward to the next part(s).","January 30, 2014","true","11.0"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","37","49","0","1"

However, I feel like this game spawns really ugly  atritional environments. The out of combat gameplay revolves almost entirely around making choices. This kind of decision making is interesting and compelling in games like FTL or King of Dragon Pass. This is because the risks apparent in your choices are relatively apparent, and make a lot of sense. And the consequences are also appropriately weighted.\n\nBut In Banner Saga, there's a disjoint between what choices you make and the consequences. You choose an option, and are greeted with a largely unknowble outcome, which is almost always overwhelmingly bad. Random, roadside events can easily kill off characters, or rob you of supplies. More often than not it feels like my reward is simply not dying. If that's what the developers were aiming for, I understand, and it matches the theme of the game, but its not fun.\n\nIn combat there's a similar feeling. Character's damage output scales directly with their remaining health. A character who is still alive but with low health might aswell be dead. He'll do 1 damage, or miss alltogether. This means that characters who want to deal damage cant afford to take any damage, and character who tank do almost no damage. Its an interesting mechanic, but its not fun. It slows combat to a crawl since it takes relatively little effort to reduce the damage of your units to negligible amounts. Considering you are literally always facing more enemies than you have champions, this is crippling, and boring.\n\nGood Story, feels very game of thronesy. Beautiful Art, it looks like classic, rich disney animation. Crappy gameplay.","January 14, 2014","false","4.6"," 171 of 279 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","171","279","0","7"

I beat The Banner Saga in one sitting--which is no mean feat, as it took me nine hours to complete. It's a profoundly beautiful game, not simply from a graphical perspective (though it is one of the best-looking games I've ever played), but from a narrative perspective. I don't think I came across anything that I ever completely expected. The friends I lost and gained were unexpected. Some people lived when I thought they would have died. My losses were many, my victories few, but I soldiered on.\n\nOh, yes, underneath it all, there's the tactical gameplay that's pretty interesting. I feel like it's lacking in something, though I couldn't tell you exactly what that is. And, y'know what? It locked up on me multiple times; I had to exit, restart, and load from the last save. It might be nice if I could manually save the game as well, but, hey, that's not really a big complaint, as the autosaving is fairly generous. The game's got a few grammatical errors in the dialog, mostly punctuation, but I think I spotted a few spelling problems as well.\n\nAs an RPG, I'm not really sure how deep it is. I'm not sure if many of my choices had consequences. One choice led to fighting, but fighting is how you get renown, and renown lets you buy supplies for your people, as well as upgrade your units, so it's kinda\n\nBut y'know what?\n\nIt's a beautiful game. I feel really... really different after having played it. It's an emotionally impactful experience. I'm a little bummed that it was only nine hours long, sure, but I also know this: I'll be replaying this game more than once, which is another feat I'm not prone to do. I'm not really a fan of turn-based games, but gameplay proved enjoyably compelling. The Banner Saga is a game I think everyone should play. It's a sad and heavy game in a wonderfully original take on the Viking mythos. I almost shed a tear at the end.\n\nThis is a game worth buying.","January 19, 2014","true","9.3"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","0"

The characters are interesting, the plot is easy to follow and enjoyable.  The music is unique, not my favorite personally but if you like old school chanting, this is definitely up your alley.\n\nAll that comes with some caveats though.  Firstly the game ran potato quality on my computer, which is a little embarrassing, my computer is getting fairly old but the graphics were also at 64bit levels so I have no idea why the framerate was so bad.  Secondly, this game will kick your ♥♥♥ a little bit because the difficulty does ramp up after about 10 hours but also because it feels like a long slog to try and get through.  This problem is magnified by the end which is even more depressing.  Thirdly, the combat because pretty stagnant pretty quickly without much difference in units and with you using the same strategies over and over.  I'm still not sold on the armor/strength system but is was at least unique as far as I know and did make you think a little differently than most other Turn Based Strategy games.  I won't lie to you though, I hated the turn order system they used which made me use strategies that would be stupid in any other TBS game.\n\nThat got pretty negative pretty quickly so let me re-iterate, this is a good game, but it could have greatly improved from just a bit more polish.","November 9, 2014","true","18.7"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","0"

As you can see from screenshots and trailers, it is clearly inspired by Walt Disney's works, and indeed it's absolutely gorgeous. Animation quality is great, too.\n\nThe gameplay is really enjoyable. I'm not the biggest fan of turn-based combat, but The Banner Saga presents some interesting mechanics that make encounters with enemies feel like more complex chess matches.\n\nWhere the game really shines, though, is in the "caravan-management" sections. You lead families and warriors for leagues across a beautiful land torn by war, making sure mouths are fed and morale stays high, facing dilemmas almost every step of the way. Every decision you make feels meaningful and impacts the world and characters around you.\n\nAs the story approaches its climax, the atmosphere grows dire. At one point, I genuinely felt like I had painted myself into a corner, bad call after bad call. I despaired.

The artwork is astonishingly great. The colors, the details... all is just right and very pleasant to the eye. The overall quality of the game is surprisingly great (in our year and age of rushed releases).\n\nThe combat system is also quite unique. Your units can attack armor or strength. If you're attacking strength, you deal damage to health and to enemy's ability to fight at the same time, but this attack will be mitigated by armor. If you're attacking armor, you're not doing any harm to unit's health or his ability to fight, but instead open it for a much stronger attack in the future. There's also an unique characteristic called Willpower. Units can use it to deliver stronger blows or to run further than normal. But it's a limited resource which can be replenished by resting (skipping turns).

I would love to recommend the game on the basis of the beautiful drawings and epic music, but it's been really disappointing to see that this game isn't what they marketed it to be.\n\nThe game promises that every decision will have a "meaningful effect on the outcome as your story unfolds" and that "the journey is as important as battle", but players aren't even given the option to choose where to go and the micro-management of the caravan doesn't really affect how the story ends. Although there's a possibility of gaining, keeping or losing supplies and units during random encounters on your journey, the only thing that really matters is keeping your main team alive. Losing units doesn't mean anything.\n\nThe game isn't too long but has players going in between different caravans with different characters in each one of them. This isn't too great because after spending time with one caravan and just starting to become emotionally invested in their plight, they abruptly shift you over to another where you have to familiarize yourself with a whole new set of names and faces. It might have been nice if they stuck to one caravan throughout this first episode of the trilogy, so we could've seen more character development and become more attached to the world.\n\nBattle mechanics are interesting but the fights can be tedious and repetitive because of the limited diversity of foes. Some battles can be challenging in a good way but most of the time, it felt like a "rinse and repeat" kind of affair. There are also weird spikes in difficulty from time to time, and the final fight arrived quite abruptly in a "that's it?" kind of way.\n\nIf you're interested in looking at the beautifully detailed drawings and can appreciate epic music, the game would be worth getting when it's on sale. However, as the game stands currently, If you're expecting more from the gameplay and story, then this is hard to recommend. I hope the next part will fair better.","January 20, 2015","false","12.8"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","32","46","2","2"

However, as I'm near the end of what I'm guessing is chapter 1 I'm finding my feelings of discontent to not be fleeting agitation due strictly to losing a battle.\n\nI kickstarted this game on the premise of creating an RPG with tactical elements similar to those presented in Final Fantasy Tactics. Furthermore, the creators promised a rich and immersive story. For the most part, I feel robbed.\n\nStory\nI can't describe the story as anything other than incredibly boring. Perhaps I find myself easily disassociated because of the extensive use of the game's in-game terminology to which there is no real primer on. I am aware that this game has a wiki and fan base which has been following along throughout the entire design process, so it may be that none of the language is foreign to most folks.\n\nThe story leaves much to be desired with regards to its presentation. Characters are presented and disappear without word for long stretches at a time. On the rare occasions you are able to talk with other heros, you don't learn much (if anything) about them. This issue is further aggravated by the notion that it seems that none of your selections in conversations seem to have any bearing whatsoever with regards to those you talk with. I get the impression that the designers read about games with character discussion choices like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, but never actually stopped to play them and figure out the appeal.\n\nFurthermore, the game lacks a practical method for the player to learn about the world or truly take upon the mantle of the main character. I felt so consistently detached from the main character that for a good 2 hours after starting the game, I was not at all clear who the hell 'I' was (apparently I was Hakon).\n\nThese issues are further reinforced by virtue of the main character having no real control over the events happening around them. As your caravan progresses through the game, multiple story events will occur wherein you have to make choices with regards to what you'll do, who you'll help, etc. However, I never feel like I am making decisions, rather I'm just making guesses and not even educated ones at that. This matter is further frustrated by the game's autosave system, so there is no way to go back should I not like the results of my guess.\n\nGameplay\nMore and more games have taken it upon themselves to dispense with any sort of instruction manual and just rely upon teaching you how to play in-game. Banner Saga has also done this, however, they have only bothered to do so with regards to combat; which is really only half the game.\n\nI state this, because it was not really clear to me how scarce food and supplies might be until I was well into a situation where I lacked any. The in game currency/experience system is renown and as best I can tell you earn it by either guessing correctly for story events or killing enemies within the combat system. Overall, I cannot stress the lack of any explanation regarding the importance of balancing the need to train up warriors with the need to purchase supplies.\n\nWith that in mind, the other aspect of gameplay I found extremely frustrating was the utter lack of a means for your party to forage for food. As a sort of larger scale Oregon Trail game, the notion that you cannot hunt or forage the lands you roam for food borders on a little hard to believe. The forced suspension of disbelief is only worsened by the fact that everyday I have warriors and clansmen dying from starvation as a trained woodsman leads these people through hills, forests, and dales all of which are apparently completely devoid of anything to sustain ourselves on. Apparently my people would rather starve to death than eat anything short of steak.\n\nI cannot help but demerit the game for this exclusion, doubly so when it lends itself so much towards having a hardline, realistic tone. Decisions (guesses) have permanent consequences where someone usually dies and you have no means to stop it at all. With that in mind, I can't believe the designers missed the opportunity to punish you for slowing your travel by having frequent attacks on your caravan and thus force you to choose between making continued forced marches and slow starvation or slow down to gather food and risk attack.\n\nThe last thing which irks the crap out of me is betrayal by heros you have picked up. Not necessarily that it occurs (usually because I didn't guess what they want), but that after I put down said betrayal the items they had equipped are gone forever from my inventory. I'm guessing (because I'll be damned if I'm going to be allowed to know anything at all ever) we've all assumed the incredibly useful trinket strapped to Stabby McBackstab's wrist must be cursed as that's the only sensible reason for him to attack a group effectively three times his size.\n\nCombat\nCombat in the Banner Saga falls somewhere between interesting and boring. Your primary health stat is broken into a unit's armor and their strength. The former provides the opportunity to deflect attacks while the latter measures both your ability to deal damage as well your health. It makes a certain kind of sense, the more injured you are the harder it will be for you to hit harder.\n\nAs combat systems go, it's interesting because of its focus upon realism. That said, it's still rather boring in its execution. There is minimal variability between attacks which succeed and those which fail. Characters require an item to be equipped in order to manage a critical hit or just get lucky and have an attack miss them. Perhaps for some folks this general lack of chance isn't an issue, but I found it rather infuriating especially because many battles included multiple enemies whose strength was well above my most heavily armored characters.\n\nFurthermore, the combat system is deficient in many other ways. There is no bonus for flanking, no bonus for having superior numbers (in several situations your greater numbers can put you at a notable disadvantage), no means to delay a character's turn until the situation is more conducive to their abilities, and I'm sure I'm missing at least one more. Again, the exclusion of these standard tropes for tactical combat are a pretty glaring oversight; much of the combat system feels like a good idea that was only halfway thought through.\n\nOne last complaint for the combat system is the fact that you cannot rotate the map to get a better view. The map has one isometric angle to look at things with, hope it shows what you need to see because that's all you're getting.\n\nSummary\nI initially thought I was just being a whiny little ♥♥♥♥♥ about a game that was hard, but I think it's much more than that. The Stoic crew had an interesting idea for a game. Unfortunately, what they made was a game, not a good game nor a great one.\n\nMultiple game site reviews have lauded the Banner Saga with plenty of accolades citing its originality; but I feel where this game succeeeded in originality it fell far short on completing its thought.","January 19, 2014","false","60.4"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","32","46","0","0"

When the game was released on iOS, I suddenly realized I didn't even start my pc game yet. That evening I sat down and played for several hours straight. Now, 18 hours along the way I just finished The Banner Saga on Normal difficulty for the very first time,\n\nI'm not the type of gamer to play a game again in order to get all achievements, but I did check which ones I earned and which ones I did not get. As it turns out, there are many story branches based on the choices one makes. Characters can survive through out to story or die during battle.\n\nI love the background of this game. Vikings are cool. By adding some kind of Super Viking (Varl) the studio has created a big divirsity in the characters one can use during the game. I will not spoil anything, but don't get too attached to your characters... they might die.\n\nThe combat is tactical. Take your time is make a move, look at the movement range of your enemies and make sure you double check for example the reach of your archers. It happened to me more than once that my archers was one block short to reach its target... That's just waste of a turn and might result in you losing the battle. During a battle characters can die. But you can't know in advance whether they are just "passed out" or they will be actually removed from the game and story.\n\nBetween the turn based battles there are lots of conversations in which you get to make choices. It's not always clear what the results of your choices will be. The most confusing thing in The Banner Saga is that you can be travelling without food and still thieves can steal food or Varls can drink beer because we passed some religious statue.\n\nOverall The Banner Saga is one of the highlights in my recent gaming years. It left me wanting for more. I've got the same feeling I got when I played The Walking Dead by Telltale for the very first time. Game studio Stoic has developed a very nice and enjoyable game with a touching story. No tears, but in the end you can't help but wonder whether the ending is just the ending of the story or the result of your actions.\n\nI've decided I'm not going to find out. This is it. My story is over and now I'm waiting for the second chapter.","October 14, 2014","true","12.0"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_game_eater/recommended/237990/","the_game_eater","The Game Eater","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_game_eater/","144 products in account","The Banner Saga is a strategy RPG with a viking fantasy setting developed by Stoic and published by Versus Evil.\n\nNarrative:\n\nThe Good - The Banner Saga has an amazingly well detailed and rich universe. There is a whole map created for the game that gives an insane amount of lore about the world. The story itself is much better than most fantasy stories. Rather than going for the clichè "save the princess" or "find the sword", The Banner Saga instead is about the journey of clans across their continent in search of safety and it is very well done. The main characters are incredibly vibrant and interesting from the stoic (ha ha), grim, and stern Iver to the innocent and forgiving Alette. I became heavily invested with many of the characters and actually cared about what happened to most of them. The Banner Saga also has branching paths. I looked back over the course of my journey and wondered how I could have changed things. The dialogue is also quite heartfelt and believable so that certainly helps add to the immersion.\n\nThe Bad - Let's get the big one out of the way. The game does not pace itself well at points. There are points where it completely rushes through areas that could have been expanded on considerably. The ending is also one of the most rushed I've seen in quite awhile. The final moments are just sped through with absolutely no slowing down to emphasize the impact of the results. Also, many characters that seem like they could have been focused on more get little to no screen time and some that seem incredibly important just up and screw off. The game also doesn't wrap everything up and leaves some loose ends. The game has so much potential and would've hit every note if it had slowed down and taken awhile to let the story's outcomes settle in and open up more about characters and areas.\n\nScore - 8/10\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe Good - This game is gorgeous. Every area of the game is brimming with little details that make it just a little bit more immersive. The hand drawn art style is perfectly done and should be applauded. The game runs smoothly for most of the time and has a beautful color palette that fits very well. One of my favourite art styles.\n\nThe Bad - While travelling across the continent there is occasional hitching. Nothing horrible but certainly noticable.\n\nScore - 9.5/10\n\nSound:\n\nThe Good - The music is beautiful. This game has one of the most fitting soundtracks I've heard in a long time. It's incredibly somber during heartfelt scenes and tense and fast-paced in battles. The voice acting is done extremely well and the sound effects are crisp and perfect.\n\nThe Bad - I feel like there could've been more narration and it would've added to the experience. There was barely any.\n\nScore - 9/10\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe Good - The game follows some of the basic SRPG mechanics and discards others while adding in some new ones that I feel mostly benefit the game. To start, the rock-paper-scissors style combat that usually shows up has been completely removed and replaced with Willpower, Armor, and Strength. These three mechanics work VERY well together and help give the game its own gameplay style. Strength is your health, however it is also your damage so when your health goes down, so does your damage. This might seem frustrating but actually works quite well and results in a lot more thought being put into moves as placing your party in a vulnerable position may result in future losses. The Armor affects how much damage can be done to someone. High armor means it is very hard to get a meaningful hit in and so it also has to be taken into consideration adding even more complications. The game, however, never becomes overly complicated and manages to still be easy to understand, yet incredibly hard to master. As for Willpower, this is probably one of the best features. Willpower allows you to do more than you can normally do. It allows people to move further, hit harder, or use their special attacks. This is great as you can use it as a way to get out of a place you don't want to be in or take that last bit of health out of an enemy. The party management is also interesting. If a party falls in battle, rather than dying, they are injured and have a Strength penalty until they rest enough. This means you'll have to rest and waste supplies, causing your clan's morale to drop, causing a loss of Willpower in battle. It puts some extra pressure on during non-combat segments. Wars also happen throughout the game and allow for several different options for handling battles giving a sense of freedom. The difficulty is also perfect. The game never becomes too overwhelming, yet always offers a challenge. Tactical, patient players will be rewarded while people who rush to kill someone will usually be shut down. Finally, Renown. Renown is the in-game currency and is used to purchase supplies and combat items. Renown is also used to upgrade characters so it becomes quite a problem for youself when you don't have enough to both get a crucial upgrade for a charcter and that really enticing piece of equipment. Overall, the gameplay has some amazing mechanics at work and can certainly hold a candle to other SRPGs.\n\nThe Bad - First, the game does not explain the consequences of clan deaths at all and there doesn't seem to be any so that mechanic is dead in the water. As for combat, the game becomes repetitive sometimes. Not many different enemies are thrown at you and so it may become a bit tedious at points. The final battle was also obnoxious as my characters were randomly getting stunned at random times and there was nothing I could do about it, prolonging the battle and irritating me. There is also almost no customization for characters. There aren't many different ways to build characters and usually your party is already decided due to low character counts at points. You can't choose their weapon and upgrading usually is quite straight forward. On top of this, many of the special attacks were (in my opinion) very underwhelming and ignorable.\n\nScore - 8/10\n\nLongevity and Replayability:\n\nThe Good - My first playthrough lasted around 11-12 hours. I still feel like there is a lot I could've changed and seems like enough incentive to go back and try again. There are also a considerable number of acheivements if that's what you're in to.\n\nThe Bad - Again, the game rushes through its story quite a bit.\n\nScore - 8.5/10\n\nFinal Score:\n\nThe Banner Saga is flawed. Greatly. But there is so much good here that I really do have to commend it for its efforts. It certainly isn't perfect, but it has enough good in it that I can recommend it at full price, easily. If you enjoy SRPGs, fantasy settings, or beautiful looking games, then look no further than the Banner Saga.\n\n8.6/10 = Very Good","January 4","true","11.3"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","21","27","3","0"

There is no finality to this game, and you're ultimately left with an extremely shallow version of Final Fantasy Tactics with units who max at level five and some beautiful locations / characters who are left hopelessly vague.\n\nI bought this game when it went down to $15 after being released from like $30, and it was by far the worst decision I had made during any Steam Sale. I can say that as somebody who hasn't bought into too many Early Access titles. Download a background or two, watch a video on YouTube, just don't make the same mistake I did.\n\nEDIT: Some nice brony just pointed out my review is bull and they have a sequel coming later in the year.

The story was interesting and the characters compelling.  Unfortunately the turn based combat is uninspired and dare I say outright bad design.  This is a game I should have loved from top to bottom.  I love turn based games.  But the movement, lack of terrain and outright poor combat design principles just kill it dead.  Having your attack strenght directly tied to your hitpoints is one of the worst design ideas I have ever seen.  It completely eliminates any kind of come from behind strategy.  If you get behind in damage output you might as well restart the match because mathmatically you can't win.  Which brings me to the worst point.  Without any kind of cover or terrain the matches feel like math equations.  You put damage A+B against enemy C and your outcome is X.\n\nMid to late game you realize that spending renoun on anything other than upgrading your warriors is a complete waste of time.  Your people and troops are completely irrelevant and the later game enemies completely outclass your best warriors.  You will also extremely favor some warriors over other less useful characters to the point of completely ignoring them.  Since levelling is directly tied to defeating enemies there is no incentive to take less useful characters.\n\nBottom line, I bought this game for $5 and Card Hunter for $0.  Other than the story, I get way more enjoyment out of playing Card Hunters during the turn based battles.  I find this game to be highly over rated.  Maybe because its an indi game a lot of people give it a pass.  I wont be getting the sequels.","November 12, 2015","false","8.5"," 89 of 150 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","89","150","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/recommended/237990/","Cantisque","Canti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/","2676 products in account","The Banner Saga tells the story of a band of warriors, leading a caravan of soldiers and refugees over the countryside to escape the encroaching hordes of monsters known as Dredge.\n\nThe game is a cross between a point and click adventure and a tactical RPG. There is a text-heavy story, with frequent choices to make that can have drastic effects on your progress. The choices you make during the events that unfold on the journey determine everything from loss/gain of supplies, to the deaths of certain characters.\n\nYour caravan will consume supplies and lose morale as it travels. The "currency" of the game, "renown" is gained from successful battles and from choices that have great impact. Renown can be spent on supplies or items at town markets, or on boosting the stats of your characters. You will likely find balacing your purchases extremely difficult, as renown is not so abundant.\n\nThe main attraction to the game is the combat. You choose 6 warriors to take to battle, each with their own unique abilities. They can also be customised by choosing skill points for their stats when the gain a level, as well as equip them with items that provide buffs and other effects.\n\nThe warriors move around on a tile grid. Moving a melee attacker adjacent to an enemy will allow you to attack. You can choose to do direct damage to their health (which also doubles as their strength stat), or deal damage to their armor which makes it easier to do more damage to their health. Your strength - their armor = damage done.\nThere are two races in the game, Humans and giants called Varl. On the battle grid, the humans take the space of a single tile while Varl take up 4. This means you have to think carefully about positions, as units cannot pass through each other and grouping them close together may mean a character is simply stuck and wastes a turn. Additionally, you will also want to make sure your weaker units, specifically those with ranged attacks, are kept safe by placing them behind tougher characters such as the Varl Shieldbanger.\n\nCombat is satisfying, yet tough. You may find you become too weak to win battles while they keep getting harder throughout the game, it would be likely you need to replay the game so you know better what to expect. It is also a shame that units have no strengths or weaknesses against specific types of enemy units, and also that the unique abilities of each character are very situational and won't get used very often.\n\nThe presentation of that game is fantastic, it is a visual marvel with finely animated characters, gorgeous scenery and a pleasing artistic aesthetic. There isn't much music to be found, but what little there is usually fits the scenario perfectly and adds to the atmosphere and scale of the world you traverse.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the storyline is a little on the weak side. None of the characters are particularly memorable. One of them had actually died off earlier in the game and I hadn't noticed until much later. Too much of the dialog is filler and a lot of the interesting parts don't lead anywhere and are never mentioned again.\n\nAs a complete package, this is a gorgeous looking title with a lengthy campaign and addictive turn-based strategy gameplay. Veterans of this genre will find enough content to chew on and newcomers will appreciate the easy-to-understand mechanics and hands-on tutorials.\n","January 19, 2014","true","29.1"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","2"

The dread that your characters feel gets to you.\n\nSadly, its too much. After being blindsided by some terrible consequences (some from decisions made 45 minutes into the game; others product of a lot of walking around without being able to judge distances/food), you start to feel the game is a chore. For me it was a chore to get to the finish line. Once again, some of that is intentional, but if the game doesn't leave you with a good taste in your mouth, its because it went too far.\n\nObviously that is a very personal issue with the game; a more general issue will be its combat system. I love turn-based games, but some decisions made here opened the combat to be way too exploitable.\n\nThe rest of The Banner Saga goes from average (the lore "borrows" from new places, but is not unique enough) to very good (the ilustrations are amazing, although way too stiff during dialogues).\n\nThis has been an enjoyable experience for many (rating "very positive" no?), supporting the developers decisions for some of the choices made here.

Don't get me wrong, It's good stuff you will play. Yet, there are some issues I need to tell.\n\n1. The game is largely story driven:\nThe wonderful game map may give you a misconception, that you can travel to any area. Sadly, your route is predefined.\n\n2. Most of the character abilities are useless and some items are over powered:\nFor instance, give Alette the +3 Armor breaking item and you will see it's much better than her special ability. Somewhat broken if you ask me. The spearmaster's impale ability is mostly useless except of the projectile enemies that flee after each damage they take. Another item gives you a knockback ability with 4+ strength damage. LIKE A BOSS!!!\n\n3. This game has a main character:\nThe way that the game was presented, you may assume that Rook is just a kindle of the events and you will be very flexible on each decision making process or character addition. It gave me an idea that if other people play the same game, we might have entire different outcomes. (Someone, who decides to go on with the lead of Ekkill, Eirik, Hakon etc. find entirely different paths in the story was what I have expected.) Characters like Ubin and Ludin have rarely a weight at the story.\n\n4.

You can go through the game without caring about supplies at all or by carefully managing the size of your group, and it doesn't matter; the only thing that matters is that you have leveled up enough for the final boss.\n\nThe 'decisions' you make seem to have little impact on the actual gameplay other than what characters you have at the end, and zero impact on the end of the game.

The Banner Saga finds a ragged group of humans and giants fleeing from a world-consuming scourge. As the leader of this caravan, you are presented with choices that will determine your people's survival. You get to decide the course of action, from when to fight to how to adjudicate petty squabbles.\nAnd here is where the one of the game's major flaws comes sharply into focus: You're routinely asked to make these decisions without enough information, and some of the choices you are presented are not choices at all. For instance, in one portion of the game, I was asked whether I wanted to take my caravan the longer, safer route or try to make it through a dangerous shortcut. Realizing we were low on supplies, I knew we would run out of food if we went the longer way, so we drew our swords and attempted to fight our way though. After some combat and attempts by the game to dissuade me from taking the shortcut, it eventually just perma-deathed a party member I'd been leveling and told me I could not go that way because it was too dangerous. I didn't lose the battles; I was just forced to take the other option. It reminded me of the old choose-your-own-adventure books, where the choice presented might be to go left or right down a path, and the next thing you know you're killed by aliens that came out of nowhere. The player is deprived of any way to gauge risk and reward, and left to just picking something and hoping for the best.\nOn the positive side, the artists have done a beautiful job, creating intricate visuals and animation that evoke the frozen Viking -inspired world in which the game takes place. The sense of immersion is further heightened by Austin Wintory's music, which serves as a perfect accompaniment as your lost group treks across the bleak, snow-covered plains and jagged mountains (go check it out on Spotify).\nBut then there's the writing. Oh, the writing. It completely shatters the world the game struggled so hard to create. Watching hardened Norsemen saying modern phrases like "We got screwed in the great wars," "What's the deal with him?" and "You have to put up with my crap a little longer" serves as a constant reminder, that no, you are not the leader of a group wandering refugees in the frozen north, you're sitting at your computer playing a game.\nIf you're looking for a similar experience that includes turn-based combat, RPG elements and decision-making, while immersing you in the game's world, "Expeditions: Conquistador" is a far better game.","August 2, 2014","false","13.5"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

If you like playing visual novels - this game is not for you also, the story is really poor. Get some time of your own and read a book.\n\nTo start with. I have had great hopes for this very game. The videos and screenshots looked impressive. The graphics and music definitely made my decision on the purchase.\n\nOnce I hit the 10 hours mark of being in game it come clear that this is nothing of what I was hoping for.\nI will just quote some of the description given.\n\n>Live through an epic role-playing Viking saga\n\nThere is nothing epic except the plot. Interesting game universe, poor storytelling, poor characters.\nThere is nothing of role paying considering the 'role playing' as interaction with the world and making decisions important for the outcome of an event. You are given a set number of characters that will act as they have been set to, no more. You are being told the story, so sit up and listen - that's how it goes.\n\n>...where your strategic choices directly affect your personal journey.\n\nLet's be clear on this one. That's bull... . The choices you are going to make through the story are nothing, the choices are illogical and have little to do with the common sense and are anything but strategic. Basically, probable outcome is:\n1) You get renown (ingame currency also used to lvl up);\n2) You get nothing/one of your characters dies;\n3) You get nothing;\n4) You get nothing.\n*Moral boosts along with several fighters for your army are not even worth mentioning*\nTo emphasise: YOU CANNOT GUESS THE OUTCOME OF YOUR CHOICE, neither logically thinking, nor by any common sense. The results of your choices are defined by the developers.

It's set in an idealized Viking-ish world, where humans and varl (read: giants) coexist, more or less, and occasionally unite to fight off the dredge - a race of poorly-motivated Bad Guys. The game excels at its aesthetic - the setting, the characters (though not the writing), and the art and music are all quite good. Those elements serve to create a feel for the game and, while I may be critical of some of the actual gameplay elements, it's important to note that those gameplay elements are ultimately servants of the general aesthetic the game is going for, and in that capacity, they serve it well. The game does a really good job of creating an interesting, well-put-together setting and aesthetic, and of arranging game components (of which there are a few) to support that goal. The game components are:\n\nCombat. It takes place on orthogonal tiles where you control different characters (up to six) and try to beat up your opposition. Characters have strength, which counts as both hit points and damage dealt. When you get hurt, you also do less damage, as your strength goes down. Characters also have armour, which is directly subtracted from any damage taken. Armour can be difficult to remove and is often high enough that you have to spend a little time getting rid of the stuff before you can really lay into your opponent. Characters have a special ability, and they have some extra (limited) 'willpower' points they can add to specific actions to move faster and hit harder. Also, the combat has this weird thing where, as long as there's more than one person per side, each side alternates taking actions. So even if you have three people and the computer has nine (or vice versa), you still get to act as often as your opponent - with the result that if you have fewer people, they will get to act more often overall. Consequently, contrary to most games of its type, I felt the best strategy was to weaken without killing my opponents in order to make them useless, thereby wasting my opponent's turns. It seems better, in some respects, to have a few good characters than a bunch of crappy ones. The game makes when to kill vs. when to wound an interesting tactical decision.\n\nThe combat's good enough for what it is. Generally, I enjoyed it. I felt to really excel at it (rather than just win on normal), a player would have to math it out a little to be able to optimize special abilities (some of which are just crazy if used right) and to avoid damage at key moments. That's not me. I like to run intuitively on my tactical RPGs, so while I had no real problems, I also recognize I'm not playing the game on hard any time soon.\n\nResource management and strategic decision making. You spend a lot of time watching your caravan move across frozen tundra being chased by the dredge, and running out of food. Running out of food is bad, as members of your caravan leave (or die off, I guess) and your moral drops, making tactical combat harder. Tactical combat gains you renown, which you can use to level up your characters to make them better fighters, or to buy food (or to buy artifacts, but that's the worst use of it, I think). Your caravan contains fighters, varl, and clansmen, and occasionally you'll use the fighters and varl to conduct a large-scale combat that is handled off-screen while you handle a typical tactical combat using your heroes. If people starve, you'll run out of fighters and varl, which I guess would be bad? I don't know. Never seen it happen. The whole large-scale 'strategic' game doesn't really seem to do much.\n\nInteractive story events. You are given a situation, you make choices, and then things happen. It's not always clear why the things that happen happen, and sometimes those things are really bad, but not something you could've anticipated. I had to reload a couple times because I'd made a choice that saw me lose a few key heroes, and I didn't know that would happen. Good (/lucky) choices can gain you renown, same as in battle. Choices that gain renown are, I found, much easier to anticipate than other choices, and don't seem as arbitrary. It's better than it sounds - while the choices you make are annoyingly opaque, I think they're supposed to be so. Bad things are supposed to happen, and you're supposed to pick up the pieces. In all cases, that's much of the game - the characters you control are people who are watching things go south awfully quickly. Making choices where you don't know what's going to happen, and often what happens is bad, is pretty consistent with the game as a whole.\n\nGenerally, the game was quite good. It won't be for everyone. But I think those who appreciate it will really enjoy it.\n","September 22, 2014","true","15.4"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

It has a very deep, involved plot from multiple perspectives and is filled with surprising revelations and heart-wrenching endings.\n\nThe graphics are a refreshing departure from the norm. The conversation scenes are reminiscent of Fire Emblem's static conversation scenes, while the travel and cut scenes are truly beautiful. The animations during battle are enjoyable to watch, as your character pulls off such a powerful hit and damages nearby enemies as well, or when your archer nails an enemy from across the map after their careful aiming.\n\nThe music in this game is just beyond words. Austin Wintory does an exceptional job on the soundtrack. The audio cues seem to hit at just the right moment to strike a chord of fear into you, or even to set the mood for celebration or sorrow. It's not often that the audio of a game ends up being my favorite part, but The Banner Saga really delivered.\n\nThe story is very involved and changes based on the decisions you make as you go along. This means that I'll be completing several more playthroughs before I'm done with the game. The choices can really reward you, or even end up in a death if you're not careful. I haven't gotten more involved in the wellbeing of a game's characters in quite some time, though in this game I find myself desperately trying to make the best choices so they can be happy, or even survive!\n\nThe combat, though it lacks variation, reminds me a bit of chess. It would benefit greatly from anything that could introduce deviation from the repetitive battles (though some specific battles can be exciting and different). My favorite point of the difficulties though, is that if you choose to play on Easy mode, you can play through the entire story without having to worry about battles, as some can be even skipped! If you choose to play on Hard mode, it is ACTUALLY a challenge. This is a nice change from "hard" modes on games lately not actually challenging their users.\n\nThis game is worth the full price, and more. I look forward to any sequels that come out from Stoic.","January 14, 2014","true","7.5"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","1"

Supposedly it's meant to be part of a trilogy, but what is available here for purchase is far from a finished product.  After a mere 14 hours of gameplay I have finished the game.  There is some minor replayability due to the nature of the branching story paths, but really only two ultimate outcomes.  If you can find it available for a few dollars it may be worthwhile, but anything over $5 is too much and the actual retail price is absolutely absurd.\n\nThe story is interesting, but the characters are not fleshed out enough.  As an incomplete game, much of the story is never resolved or even explained.  I enjoyed the art and fact that most of my choices seemed to have repercussions.  However, the ending really came out of nowhere, as it felt more like I beat a mini boss, rather than an end boss.  Indeed, the game's supposed "end boss" isn't even introduced until near the end of the game, and the game spends very little time building the boss up to something substantial.  In fact, the end boss' actions are never espoused upon at all, it simply exists to move the plot forward, like some broken macguffin.\n\nWorse than the broken story and ending of the game is the fact that the actual battles feel very unfinished too.  The fights you encounter are rather simple, which made the game easy to pick up.  On the other hand, as you play through the game the fights never really get any more difficult, and hardly change at all.  In fact, there are only a handful of enemy types you encounter, and their type hardly makes an impact upon the combat system at all.  I can literally count on two hands the different types of enemies one encounters in this game, and even then some are simply the same type, but with a different skin.  That is, there are human archers and monster projectile throwers, human swordsman and monster swordsman, etc.  Having the same encounters again and again just feels incredibly stale after about 1 hour.\n\nIf there were a greater amount of variety of enemies in The Banner Saga, a more interesting combat system, and all three chapters had been released as one, complete game, than I would give this a very positive review.  As it stands the game is boring and unfinished, so I can't possibly recommend it.","June 18, 2015","false","25.6"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","29","45","0","0"

The art and music are very well done and bring a sure charm to the game that seems to have bedazzled a lot of reviewers.  My issues with the game didn't become aparent until well into it (more than a few hours).  The only important resource in the game is "renown", which you use to either level up your characters or to buy supplies so your "caravan" can eat.  There is so little renown in the game you generally have to choose to do either/or of these activities.  As a result you can either feed your people as a kind leader would and end up losing a lot of battles with a stagnant squad of low level guys or you can ignore your people, allow them to starve and die off, and level your squad of fighters to win battles.  Despite the fact that one of your two leaders you control has the occupation of "master hunter" there is no hunting in the game.  No way to procure food except for the occassional scripted even with a "King of Dragon Pass" choose your own adventure chance to get precious supplies.\n\nIt makes for a frustrating experience.  Perhaps the point is the force the player into being cold and heartless much the same way Fable 3 did.  That experience ended up being sub optimal as well.\n\nFor $30+ I wish there was more of a game here to go with the fantasy story.  It just as easily could have been an excellent interactive novel on an iPad.  Instead of playing to the strengths, the game is shackled like a mewing beast to lame "Oregon Trail" gameplay and a somewhat counter intuitive basic turn based tactical combat system.  There are D&D Goldbox games available online that were made twenty years ago with far more tactical depth than what this 2014 game offers.\n\nOn the upside, the game looks great (even on a Mac without a dedicated graphics card).  The music is decent if not a bit overly dramatic.  The characters are mostly interesting.\n\nI haven't finished it.  I'm probably a little more than halfway.  Sadly, there are too many worms for me to finish this deceptive looking fruit.","January 19, 2014","false","9.8"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","24","36","0","0"

However, all the characters felt flat and uninteresting, and with a few exceptions they were just variations on the 'generically ok person' template. The visual design was not very interesting -- everything looks like a 70s cartoon and all the characters basically wear the same outfits.\n\nAlso, the game occasionally ambushes you with choices the ramifications of which are not really possible to understand at the time. This is a big narrative mistake; it's not really clever writing to "trick" the player into making a bad choice when there's no way to understand what the choice actually is. Actually gripping choices in a game come from making a hard choice between two equally good (or bad) outcomes, not from simply trying to pull a gotcha on players.\n\nThere are lots of VERY good RPGs out there.

It is not your typical role-playing game, nor strictly a turn-based strategy; it is more of a choose your own adventure story. And you have distinct honour of having to pick your own poison. No one is holding your hand throughout the story, and the friends you meet along the way may become your enemy in due time. This game is not meant for everyone. It does not aim to please everyone. On the contrary, you will be cursing the Gods for the cruel fate that destiny has entwined for your past deeds and decisions. But no one is listening.

With that said, you should know that it is the first chapter in a three-chapter story.\n\nThe negatives: The entire story you are met with problem after problem, and at the end (which was abrupt and unexpected) you feel like you haven't solved any of them at all, leaving the player with more questions than answers. The problem is that this story doesnt stand on its own feet, since it is one part of a planned trilogy. Although it does a good job of introducing the characters, world and the problems they face, it does not do much past that. I am sure the game will stand better alongside its other two counterparts, but I cannot recommend this to anyone looking for a self-contained story, since this is just the first chapter; it feels more like an introduction to the world of Varl, dredge and men. You will want to get the second and third chapter to get the full experience of the Banner Saga, but this is a series that will be well worth the investment. The first chapter is one piece of what looks to be a great pie, but you are not given a vertical slice; you are given a horizontal one, and tasting only the crust of the entire story you are left wanting more.\n\nAfter all is said and done, I am sure it is going to be a masterpiece of a trilogy.

There is little enemy variety too.\n- Caravan management layer is completely broken. Losing all clansemen makes no impact on the game, it does not even change random events, which still refer to your caravan as if it was full or people.\n- No manual save option means you might end up forced to repeat certain parts after coming back, if you happened to play through a longer section not containing autosave points.\n- CYOA dialogue options are rarely clear as to what they will cause, meaning you might choose an option and end up causing something you were actually trying to avoid.

The art and animation are stunning; it was very clearly made by a team of visual design veterans.  I applaud Stoic's attempt at breathing new life into tactical RPG battles by making it more akin to chess than say, FF Tactics.  Unfortunately, the system they came up with is easily exploited once you understand how it works.  Weaken (but don't kill!) lesser mobs so that they can't deal damage and continue to eat up turns for the enemy team, then focus on the heavy hitters.  After a while I started to dread fights because of how formulaic and boring they become.  No variation/advantages in terrain; just the same tired grid, battle after battle after battle.  The lore is excellent and well-formed, yet the story itself is unfocused and difficult to follow.  Even the score by Austin Wintory (whose soundtrack for indie darling Journey is amongst the greatest of all time) is forgettable.\n\nI feel like there's a great game somewhere in here, but the pieces just haven't come together yet.  With any luck Stoic will raise enough funds to continue the saga and I'll give it another go to see if they resolve some of these issues.  Until then I can't bring myself to finish this first installment.  Too bad.\n\nUPDATE: Ended up beating the game anyway since I was at the final boss.

I don't mind the I get 1 move then the opponent gets 1 move. But this system is seriously flawed when either you or the AI are outnumbered by the other, allowing your 3 units to move 2 times for ever 1 time their 6 units more.\nIt would be alot better if it had some turn order based on speed like Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced does, or if it was a simple 1 character move per 1 round like a lot of table top miniature games are.\nYou don't seem to be able to heal your health in battle and this is only annoying because you might have 3 health points left but still have 20 armor points. But because you can choose to attack health or armor, health weakens their life and their attack and attacking armor sometimes lets your next attack on that unit do more damage, there is no point in attacking armor. Enemies almost never attack armor and can hit you unit with a max health of 15 for 7 damage and then because you have 5 unit’s to their 2 that same enemy can get an extra turn to get your unit to 1 health and attack before he gets a move thus making him a wasted turn when he does come around.\nIn my eyes the whole point of an armor stat is either that it decreased the amount of damage you take, or they have to get through your armor to get to your health. However there is no point in enemies attacking your armor because they already do such massive damage while you have to hit their armor down to half if you want to do more than 3 damage to their health/strength stat a hit.\n","January 17, 2014","false","6.9"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","23","36","0","0"

Very frustrating.\n\nI seriously don't understand the renown purchasing thing, why do I have to choose between leveling up my characters and buying supplies? When characters start getting very high level it costs so much renown to actually level them that you're effectively starving your caravan of supplies.\n\nI was not impressed that the description of this game put so much emphasis on choices, the result of said choices are almost entirely + supplies or - supplies, occasionally randomly killing off a character who has been with you a long time with just a a sentance, it just doesn't feel part of the story.\n\nThe last gripe I have is the characters in your caravan, I completed the game after 2 days but I don't think I skipped anything so it's a short game anyway but in my entire play through apart from the scenes where you recruit new characters there is only ever 1 other conversation with them throughout the game (unless of course it's one of the main characters) this annoyed me a bit I was looking forward to seeing how my new companions would get on with each other in the stresses of my starving caravan but they apparently go silent once they join me.\n\nAfter this I really can't recommend this game, it just doesn't deliver on what the game description said.","January 18, 2014","false","9.0"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

They aren't great either, but they're not bad. Nothing to write home about either way.\n\nThe problem is with the turn-based tactical combat, which is bland and repetitive.  For starters, there is no terrain of any sort. You just get a blank grid with you and your enemies, with every square of the grid created equal. That means there's no choke points, no cover, no high ground, and so on.\n\nThis is made worse by the bizarre way that turn order is handled. First one of your units moves, then one of the enemies, then back to one of yours, and so on. This applies even when one side outnumbers the other, so if you have 6 people and there are only 2 enemies left, each enemy gets to move three times as often as each of your units. This disparity just further eliminates any possibilities for actual tactics, and turns combat into a mosh pit of repeatedly hitting each other until everyone on one side has fallen over.\n\nFortunately for the player, the enemy units and AI are sufficiently weak (at least on the default difficulty setting) that this is seldom a problem, especially as the game has no permadeath. You just keep on hitting the enemies until none of them are standing, and if a few of your side fall down in the process then it's no big deal.\n\nWhich brings me to another problem: there are no other mission types. Every single combat is a straight last team standing. There's no "control the point" or "survive for x turns" or "rescue the non-combat units" or anything else. Just your units, their units, and yet another identical fight to the death.","January 21, 2014","false","4.5"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

The combat system is fun, sensible, and deep; the artwork is beyond beautiful; the music is fantastic; and the story is enthralling.\n\nBut there's just way too damn much railroading. I don't mean in terms of not having much choice as to where you're going (that part's fine with me). I mean in terms of what happens to people.\n\nThe bottom line is that characters don't live or die based on the foreseeable outcomes of your choices. They die based on what whoever wrote the story thought should happen. "If you do X, this person will die five hours later in your game. Period. No, you will not see it coming. No, you will not get to react to it or have any\nsort of impact on what happens; you will get a bunch of text that tells you what I have decided will happen." You're left completely powerless and turned into a passive observer.\n\nThe loss of control kills the story; it completely ruins your immersion in this rich, deep world, and slams you back on the tracks. Whenever someone's died, I've felt cheated in a way no other game has made me feel. My reaction hasn't been "well, I was hoping for a better outcome than that, but fair's fair. I took some risks, and I can see how that would make sense." Nope. The overwhelming feeling I'm left with is "How the heck was I supposed to know that was going to happen?" I feel like I have to constantly second-guess the game by trying to figure out how the various choices are trying to screw me over, instead of getting into the mindset of the characters and thinking "what makes sense here?"\n\nThis is the second time I've tried to play this game through, and I'm genuinely sad that I suspect it'll be the last. With such a linear storyline, it's only got so many playthroughs in it. Which is a shame, because apart from that it really is a terrific game.

I've played through twice, in about 15 hours altogether.\n\nBasically, this game is "Viking Oregon Trail", with level ups. Very narrow level ups (stat selection for pre-made characters).\n\nThere's no character creation (though you do have access to several different character's POV during the game -- but you don't have control over switching between those). Events in the game (for example agreeing to let certain characters join or not join your caravan) don't really impact the game other than to provide a bit of flavor to your next play through.\n\nThe world is interesting enough, and some of the characters are intriguing, but by and large there's no pay off on that, because it's half a game. The game just stops, at about what I thought was the half way mark. So while there's hints at things that it might be interesting to learn about the characters, that's as far as it gets.\n\nFurthermore, the characterisation is not that sophisticated, despite the praise heaped on the game. It's not terrible, but it's by no means outstanding. The characters are very trope-y: "Concerned Dad" "Teen Girl" "Lady Archer" "Rude Prince" "Pyscho Pyro" "Proud Warrior Race Guy" etc.\n\nA final pet peeve: the dialogue in this game was very iffy in places. It's supposed to be reminiscent of a Viking Saga, but the characters are constantly going around using contemporary slang. I'm not expecting Shakespeare -- but it would be nice if the characters didn't use things like "ok". It's just -- not in keeping with the milieu.\n\nSo, I've told you my reservations for recommending. If you're reading this and thinking, "wow that's very picky", then maybe this game is for you! But if you're thinking "no, that would bother me too", maybe skip it or wait for a good sale.\n\nAs I said, I've played through twice. I doubt I will again -- fifteen hours and I feel like I've seen everything the game has to offer. I got the game on sale, which I'm really glad about.

It's beautiful, no doubt, and the storyline is interesting. The gameplay, however, leaves me wanting. Most of the gameplay is split between making decisions while you attempt to move your caravan somewhere safe and controlling a small party in turn based combat.\n\nThere really aren't many options with the turn based combat. Most of the strategy will come down to picking your team, but once you're in the fight, there isn't always a lot to do. Each player has a specific talent they can use at the cost of a limited supply of points. Otherwise you can attack or skip/rest. I really wish the depth of options was greater. While the choice to break armor or attack strength adds a potential element of strategy, it becomes pretty obvious once you realize the enemies don't change much: break armor on the big guys, attack strength on the smaller guys, hope you can arrange the enemy in a way to link armor breaks...and that's about it.\n\nI was also let down by many of the special attacks. Some are highly situational, and require too much luck getting enemies arranged properly on the board to really take advantage of them. The ranged attackers tend to be super limited, and the support roles just don't offer a viable option to use effectively in battle.\n\nThe caravan aspect of gameplay has you making text based choices when confronted with an option, like adding a stranger to your party or not. I enjoy the opportunity to roleplay, but it often seemed any choice was bound to be bad. Rarely did a choice end up being positive (though I don't know the results of alternative choices). While I can appreciate the idea that the caravan is supposed to be very difficult and force you to make difficult decisions where you know something bad is going to happen, it would be nice to have some variety. The worst of these, however, is when it leads to one of your characters being killed through text. No one dies on the battlefield, but they can during roleplay. Since resources are so limited and improving your fighters takes up the same resources that you use to buy food, losing a character you've invested in to a choice in dialog was almost enough to get me to stop playing.\n\nI've reached the end of the game, but I didn't have too much fun along the way. Some of the issues are just balancing. But ultimately the balance is off too much for me to recommend the game. I really wanted to like this one, but the only thing I came away impressed by is the artwork.","July 23, 2014","false","12.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The artwork, the music, the storyline, the battles - everything was mostly great. The game basically reads like an interactive book with lots of awesomely drawn static ilustrations and turn battles inbetween. The influence of Norse mythology is  very obvious here and gives a very good vibe to the experience. There are plenty of choices in the game, but their biggest consequence (as far as I can tell) is who of the heroes will join you and survive the perils. Otherwise the storyline seems fairly linear, although still very captivating and well-written. You will also not experience leading huge armies as you are always in control of no more than half a dozen characters. I personally was  left a bit dissatisfied with the ending (this includes both the final battle, the final plot twist and the final cutscene) and it DOES seem to me personally there might be a room for a sequel.

Graphically the game is astonishingly beautiful, with one of the best art styles I’ve ever seen and the way the animations were made, slow but nailing the right spot. The graphics and the soundtrack are, for me, a masterpiece on their own.\n\nQuite possibly one of the most intense soundtracks I’ve heard over the last years. Gameplay wise The Banner Saga could be described as a turn based strategy game with a party/hero management system, which include leveling up using “Renown” and distributing skill points to each separate stat, it also features something which can be compared to something like Oregon Trail in which you need to micro manage your supplies as you travel across the land and each time you visit a town you can trade your “Renown” at the market for supplies or items which can be equipped by your characters.\n\nRenown is what you could call the in game currency, you get Renown for killing enemies and winning battles and you can use that earned Renown to trade in a town market for supplies, which will be consumed as each day passes depending on how many people you have on your caravan (Varl, Clansmen and fighters) or you can use that Renown to promote your characters.\n\nBy promoting your characters you get 2 – 3 points which can be assigned to various different stats, such as strengh which determines how much health you have and the damage you deal to your enemies, willpower which can be used to increase your movement or the power of your attack on a turn but it’s a limited resource in each battle, along with many other stats such as Armor break which determines how much damage you deal to the enemy armor etc.\n\nThe battle system is pretty simple to learn, yet, hard to master. Before each battle you get to choose your party from your pool of characters and then you will proceed to the battlefield where you can deploy your troops along the starting line. Basically, units have armor, represented by a blue banner, and strength represented by a red banner, if you focus on dealing damage to an enemy armor you’ll be able to deal more damage on a later turn, the more armor an unit has the less damage that unit will receive and the more strength an unit has the more health it has and the more damage that unit will deal to enemies, sometimes you’ll have to focus on dealing strength damage to an enemy in order to lower their damage and sometimes you’ll have to focus on their armor in order to deal damage to them later on the battle, this is the key to mastering The Banner Saga combat system. Each character also has an unique ability which they can use in battle by using willpower, that same willpower can be used to increase damage dealt to enemies or travel distance during your turn.\n\nBesides all this you have a fairly standard dialogue system, with some pretty neat writing, albeit with a lack of voice acting, something that works like the dialogue system from Dragon Age or Mass Effect in which each dialogue option will have a different outcome on each situation and sometimes those choices will lead to severe consequences such as someone abandoning your party or your caravan or taking away your supplies so choose carefully.\n\nIn my opinion this is what makes The Banner Saga a somewhat highly replayable game because if you choose a different dialogue option everytime you play a new game you’ll have tons of different outcomes. Story wise the game did an amazing job in creating a world in which you care about the characters, people you meet along the way and even strangers, while it still forces you to keep your eye open for trouble along the road.\n\nBesides the “normal random events” there’s also something else which comes up when you are travelling through the land with your caravan and these are called “Wars”. As you might expect these happen when your army meets another army, in this case a Dredge army. First a screen will pop up showing how many troops the enemy army has and how many troops you have, including varl and men, and after that you’ll be presented with a series of different choices such as “hold the line”, “formations”, “charge” etc.\n\nEach one of these tactical approaches will have a very different outcome depending on the battle, the number of troops on each army and depending on your army morale. Morale basically increases and decreases depending on your dialogue choices and if you win or loose battles and wars, lower morale will result in a decrease of the amount of willpower that your characters will start each battle with. When travelling through the land you can also set up camp, on your camp you can arrange your party, you can chat with your party members, check the game map which will provide a description for each region and town on the game world and you can also rest. Resting is fairly important because it can trigger certain events and it’s by resting that your characters heal from injuries and you should always make sure your characters are healed, but, keep in mind that everytime you rest a day passes by and thus your supplies decrease.\n\nHowever, there’s one more thing I’d like to say about The Banner Saga, even though I absolutely loved the game the final boss fight was just way too frustrating and very hard to beat, it took me over 5 hours to beat it on Normal mode so I can only imagine how long it must take on hardcore. It mainly took me that long because by the end, the game forces you to take two specific characters, two characetrs which I barely used during the rest of the game and so they were low level, to battle and by the time the final boss triggers you can’t rest and I had several characters injured which really hurted me thus taking several tries, I don’t think that this was actually my fault but also something on the design side, when you get there, if you get there, you’ll understand what I mean.\n\nIn the end, despite the frustration I went through to beat the game I can’t recommend The Banner Saga enough, it’s such a great game! In my honest opinion it excels in all key aspects of a game like this, story, graphics, soundtrack and gameplay, it’s certainly a good investment of both your time and your money and I’m sure you’ll have plenty of good moments with it.\n\nStill, it needs to be said that The Banner Saga is divided in three parts and this is the first part and buying this game will not grant you access to the other parts when they come out. You can also try Banner Saga Factions which is multiplayer only and it’s available on Steam for free and by playing it you’ll be able to see how the battles play on the single player game.\n\nIf you're looking for good reviews, consider joining Good Games Giveaways & Reviews group.

It's oppressive and depressing, and helps you become part of your party as they desperately seek solace in a world that is slowly ending - being consumed by an ancient darkness.\n\nGameplay is split between turn-based strategy with an interesting Armor/Strength dynamic that will effect your approach and strategy to every situation, and overworld politics and diplomacy as you try to lead your party, maintain provisions, determine the speed at which you travel, and help (or abandon) passersby.\n\nThe Banner Saga is a slowly paced game, and I mean that in the best possible way. It gives you time to absorb the world, and hammers in the weight of the decisions you have to make for the caravan and your allies. And these decisions matter. Critical characters can live and die based on the decisions you make, and there is no auto-saving to get them back. Choices are gray at best, and it's solely up to you, the player, to decide what you feel will best serve the caravan.\n\nVisually, it is beautiful, with smooth gradients of color behind swathes of silhouetted foreground, and a fitting soundtrack for you slow trek through the end of the world.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a story-driven game or a different take on turn-based strategy.

I liked the HP=attack strength part, but the "turns always alternates between sides, one character at a time" rule means that if you kill weaker enemies you essentially give the stronger ones extra turns. Therefore, to win, you must weaken as many enemies as possible without killing them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pmasterflynn/recommended/237990/","pmasterflynn","simplypflynnah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pmasterflynn/","105 products in account","Near the start of the game there's a fully animated cut scene setting the early stage of the game. It's well done, it looks amazing and gives background to where you are, and the setting you are in. I looked forward seeing a few more cut scenes like this- but to my surprise it was the only one of it's type in the game. No second act cut scene, no ending cut scene- just a couple still pictures. They set the bar for themselves very high whit this opening cartoon story telling bit- get your hopes up high, then let you down by not following through in the rest of the game.\n\nThe combat lends itself to one tactic- cripple enemies so they don't hurt you, then let them run around and eat up the enemies turn order so the tough guys don't act as quick/as often. It makes very little sense- in video game or real world logic. "Attack! But don't kill them, maim them, so like, the other guys won't attack as much." In most tactic games killing a bad guy would mean there is less of a threat- slowly gain an advantage until it's a big advantage, then win. Not here, the metagame tactic of maiming is unfun.\n\nThe health/armor system is interesting, and may have been fun if the rest of the combat helped with a more cohesive vision. Too often I would feel like a battle would be uninteresting simply because a huge dude just happened to start combat near a weak dude, and smashed his face in- either on my side or the enemy side. There are some 'tactics' to this game, such as positioning people for small bonuses here and there- but on a whole its a pebble in a shallow pond.\n\nThe decision making process outside of combat is more frustrating than anything. Too often you would look at your list of options, and see the logic behind one of the answers. "This looks like a reasonable option" you might say to one of them. So you pick that option, only to find that the vague wording has lead you astray, or unforeseen logic throws you for a loop and you end up frustrated. "Post gauds to guard supplies!" You might say. "Ok!" The game will tell you. "But robbers stole half your stuff anyway, wah wah." So why did I bother with the guards at all! Another example; an option might say “I trust you.” So you selected that. But then the scene plays out like “I trust you. Dead men don’t lie!” Then you stab him dead. Didn’t see the flow of logic there? Too bad, the game autosaved, live with it.\n\nAt one point in the game you need to use an item to win a battle. This fight is annoying for a few reasons.\nFirst- there's an NPC giving stupid hints that too vague to be helpful, and the speech bubble is right over half your characters. So you have to wait a few moments before selecting where to move, because you can't see anything.\n(Also you can not adjust the camera in combat, and it can get messy/clucnky/and visually clustered quickly. When things get heated in combat you'll be fighting the menu more than enemies.)\nNext, the storyline item used in the fight is not explained. Maybe this my bad, but I didn't realize that it became a special ability of a character during that fight. There was no indication that it was there, and I never used that characters abilities anyway, so why would I look? I thought at certain conditions where met the item would be used in a cutsence or something- but nooope you just have to know. Great, wasted 2 hours before I realized that.\n\nI want to like this game. It does some things really well.\nThe story feels like it's a real fleshed out fantasy novel. The one single cut scene is really good. The use of fire emblem style dialogue deliver (nonmoving portraits of characters) look nice.\nBut overall this game doesn’t need more polish, it needs better design.\nI want to like it, but can't. I also can't recommend this unless it's on sale for half off or more.","July 18, 2014","false","15.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

A story driven, episodic, tactical game like this would have had no chance of making it into the public's eye just a few short years ago, and because of this, gamers should be thrilled. Standing on its own, The Banner Saga is a very decent game that just narrowly gets a recommendation from me. The art style is simply stunning, and will undoubtedly land The Banner Saga on many "Best Looking Games of 2014" lists. The story itself is also fascinating with its "Choose Your Own Adventure" style of narrative, although your mileage may vary when it comes to becoming emotionally involved with the plights of the game's multiple protagonists.\n\nThe Banner Saga's biggest missed opportunity, in my opinion, is with the combat system. It's a very bare-bones system that adds nothing significant to the genre, and begins to feel quite repititive as you progress through the game and often repeat battles due to the game's high difficulty. It's functional and all, but overall just feels competent at best, and ultimately disappoints, as a stronger combat system could really have propelled The Banner Saga into the realms of the greats. But overall, it's a solid debut effort from Stoic, and if you're a fan of this genre, is worth checking out once the price drops a bit.","February 13, 2014","true","9.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

There is no point in really trying to choose what to do with your reknown (the games currency); if you use it to level up a character, that character may die or leave and you have absolutely no control on whether or not this happens, if you use reknown to buy supplies, those supplies will be destroyed or stolen regardless of the choices you make.

I guess I shouldnt have gone in with such lofty expectations.\n\nThis is no Final Fantasy Tactics or Agarest War if that's what your looking for, those games are way deeper in terms of combat and story. The Banner Saga is very bare bones when it comes to being a turn based strategy-RPG game.\n\nNow I know that the Stoic team is mostly made up of a few ex-Bioware guys but the story similarities between The Banner Saga and Dragon Age are eerily similar, if you've played both games then you can probably see the parrallels.\n\nThe Banner Saga is supposedly going to be an episodic or trilogy style series, very lame considering nowhere on the steam store page does it say anything about this being an espisodic/trilogy half-baked half-made un-finished game... but this is an indie kickstarter game so why am I surprised. If you were like me and expected to have a full complete epic journey to sink into from start to finish then you are in for a very rude awakening, we got fleeced.\n\nThe first part which is available on Steam, is extremely short and when the credits roll there is literally no forward progress made in the story and your left with a giant TO BE CONTINUED....\n\nI cannot reccommend this game in its current state unless your a hardcode turn based-RPG fan, and even then this will be a bit of a stretch because the campaign is so woefully short. This game is un-finished and not worth its current price of $25.00\n\nPersonal Pet Peeve: This game has nothing to do or in common with "true" viking/nordic mythology at all. I honestly dont even see how the developers can make such a claim on the store page, sure this game might be "inspired" by viking/nordic mythology but I would use that term extremely loosely in this case. There is nothing even remotely viking'esq about this game, only a perversion of what some developer who has probably never read an Edda thinks a viking might be like, for shame.\n\nThanks for reading.","January 20, 2014","false","17.7"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","24","41","0","1"

Not The Banner Saga, though. This game looks like a lof ot talent, effort and hard work had been poured into it, and that alone, in my book, means a lot.\n\nThe Banner Saga is a tactical Strategy RPG with a deep, intense story. The graphics and soundtrack are great, but what I like the most here, is the story. The atmosphere of the game is really dark, as the story is about a violent and bloody war. There's a lot of death, injuries, bloodshed and grief. Some people might consider such a setting to be problematic or even inappropriate for such a game, but I kind of like it. It's a refreshing look on things, at the very least. Just don't expect too many rainbows and unicorns. :)\n\nAnother good aspect of the game, in my opinion, is the choices. Some people complain they don't have enough influence on the game. While I agree that it would be great if the choices had more weight, I think they do offer enough replayability value. Going through the game just once hardly feels like all there is to it, as I know if left me quite curious to play again, make different decisions and see where it leads me.\n\nAs for the strategy part of the game, it's certainly one of the better parts of the game for me. The battle system is simple to learn (should be almost intuitive for anyone who's ever played such games before), but seems to have enough depth and balance to be appealing and interesting. It kind of reminds me of the battle system in Expeditions: Conquistador (another great tactical RPG, btw).\n\nAs of now I haven't beaten the game, but I did get to the final battle. I ended up losing quite a few times, after which I simply got frustrated and gave up. I restarted the game, got kind of half-way before losing a mid-game battle and getting a 'Game Over'. The reason I'm describing all this, is to point out what I consider to be the only two real problems I have (or used to have) with the game:\n\n1) At the time, the difficulty level of the final battle was much higher than anything else you encountered during the game, and I don't mean "slightly" or "moderately" higher (which would make sense, considering it's the final battle), I mean it was REALLY much more difficult. I know many people have been complaining about this, enough to have the developers address and fix this issue, which probably means it should be okay now.\n\n2) The game is somewhat vague regarding the consequence of losing a battle. In most cases, if you lose a battle you can still continue playing, but you suffer some negative consequences. In a few specific battles, though, losing means getting  a "Game Over". It means you can get back to your last save and try again, but you don't get to continue playing despite the loss, as you would after losing a normal battle. This wouldn't be a problem for me, btw, if the game was clear about the rules. I'd expect to get at least a clue, that I'm facing a critical battle that I must win in order to survive. Well, the game doesn't give you anything to indicate there's a difference.\n\nDespite those two problems, I really like the game. It's one of the better games I encountered during the last few years. I'm kind of disappointed I didn't get to beat the game yet, but I did really enjoy playing it, regardless.\n\nEDIT (March/31/2016): By now I've managed to win the final battle and beat the game on 'normal' (the medium difficulty level). While I'm happy to have finally succeeded, I still feel the spike in the difficulty level was too much.","June 2, 2014","true","43.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","8"

This is not the cheap thrills and quick kills sort of game. This will not provide you with the 30min of immediate satisfaction that you crave before having to go out and do real things. A quick rush of points, colours and sparkly lights with no challenge this is not.\n\nThis game is slow, deep, and full. And it is most incredible in all the ways that matter. The art style, inspired by artist and illustrator Eyvind Earle, sets this story that sings of a rich norse heritage into a truly magical setting. You command a caravan on two perspectives of this catycalismic event that is shaking the world; one, a ever-growing group of hungry refugees fleeing the oncoming horde of stone automatons, and two, the taskforce of horned giants that are marching to fight it. The characters fill this world with their own histories and personalities, they are fleshed out and become important to more than simple stats and combat ability. There are moments in the progression of the game that the player is required to make choices that will affect the caravan you have been tasked with managing and the direction of the playthrough. As a result of some of these choices, there were points that I cursed the screen in frustration as I tried to re-load a previous save point to try and save one or more characters from their inevitable demise, but fully knowing that it had been my leadership that had put them there.\n\nThe combat can be at times frustrating, but there is always a way around - rethinking your strategy, utlizing different tactics or simply equiping various items on your characters. It is a thinking game, characters occupy tiles on the board that move, fight, or rest to regain ever-precious 'willpower' per turn. The larger and evidently more powerful pieces - as it effectively rounds down to a chess-like experience - take up more tiles, thus can be hit from more sides and rendered almost useless when kept out of range by being inadvertantly boxed in by allies.\n\nHowever, any foibles or griefs that I have with the combat and the brick wall that the final boss turns out to be are quickly dispelled by the compelling tale that is being woven in front of your eyes. Like any good story, I could not put it down - and after almost 17 straight hours, I am starving for more.\nI want to see where the people have gone as a result of me - what new adventures and tragedies await them, and how my people will fare with the prospect of doom in the coming darkness that is creeping ever forth, as told by a monstrous mountain splitting serpent.\n\nI love this game, and cannot reccomend it highly enough. If there are any talks of expansion or even a sequel, I will be there, waving my banner all the way.","May 14, 2014","true","17.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It's a mixture of turn-based battles similar to X-com Enemy Unknown, management of caravan's morale and supplies, and text quests where you choose your answers trying to guess the consequences. The choice is usually between bad and worse which makes it even harder.\n\nThe whole atmosphere in the game reminded of Game of Thrones universe. Your friends and you can die any minute, being in battle or because of hunger.\n\nGraphically the game is charming. It doesn't have CGI cutscenes, and it doesn't support DX11. But it all isn't necessary. The Banner saga has fantastic backgrounds which were drawn by hand, and all characters have their own peculiar features and details.\n\nAt some point of your journey you make crucial decisions that shape your further trip, so the game has high replayability value.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/STINGER_LP/recommended/237990/","STINGER_LP","STINGER_LP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/STINGER_LP/","148 products in account","This game is the most impressive, intriguing, challenging, entertaining, eye an ear pleasing that I ever played in last few years. It's like I’ve read an exciting book, watched a beautiful cartoon with awesome soundtrack and obviously played interesting challenging game. I rarely get impression this high from a game lastly, but this one is the massive exception. Actually, The Banner Saga: Factions initially got me in this awesome universe and gameplay style. I was not really into turn-based games or games with turn-based strategic combat style in particular until I met Factions. And I was blown away by what an awesome, challenging and entertaining gameplay guys from Stoic have created! After that The Banner Saga became the TOP 1 in my wish list. And eventually it surpassed all my expectations.\n\nGAMEPLAYThis game offers a mix of turn-based combats, text-based quests, interactive dialogs and management of caravan under your leadership. Battles are very challenging and entertaining. Using different types of units — Varl (unique race of horned giants) and humans of different classes — and combat formation you can build your own unique strategy for the upcoming battle. You can take up to six fighters and place them in a specific turn order. Since combats are turn-based, this part of preparation can be crucial. As well as combat formation, because battlefield split in cells and every unit in battle have its own range of movement and attack. Most units can attack foes standing only at nearby cells. So you probably would like to place your archers and other weak units behind your Varl and other strong fighters.\n\nScreenshot #1\n\nAbility to upgrade warriors' characteristics and unique special abilities for willpower (local currency, earned in battles) or increase with artifacts adds more variety to gameplay and tactics in battles. Upgrade points are limited and can be split between 5 characteristics and since you won’t be able to max all out you better use them wisely thinking of how you want to use this particular unit on the battlefield.\n\nFight mechanic is mostly about unit's armor and strength. Strength is also a health and it makes the WHOLE DIFFERENCE! Once you lowered the enemy’s strength below your armor he gets less than 100% chance to hit you for strength! But he still can damage your armor. So your damage to the enemy is your strength minus enemy’s armor. Using willpower to add additional damage points or unit’s special ability adds some spice to the battle. And more often than not it’s crucial to use them. Ability to hit without a chance to miss or hit multiple adjacent enemies at once or command to specific ally to move on next turn etc. can help a lot, especially if you play on hard, like I did (except first 2 battles). There are A LOT more nuances and things to learn about this very thoughtful combat system. And the more you upgrade your warriors the more tactic opportunities you get. But two biggest advices are: 1) lower enemy’s armor and 2) don’t get hit first. If you like challenge and turn-based combats you’ll love this one.\n\nIn "text mode" you talking with other persons, more often than not choosing what to say next, which will affect the following events. The most awesome thing in this part is that all of the choses are so not black and white – you can’t tell right away which of the options is right and which is wrong. It’s all about making hard decisions and facing its consequences later. Some consequences will appear almost a half game after, striking you hard and unexpectedly. But mostly through text (descriptions of events and conversations) you get a deep story of this world and characters you play, meet or interact with.\n\nTHE STORYIt’s really hard to tell you how awesome the story is and avoid spoilers. Throughout the game you play as leaders of caravans of Varl and human who faced a new threat, bigger than ever before, and trying to save their lives. Most epic thing in this part is the originality of each character you play or get to know with through the whole journey. They all are very thoughtfully developed, each has its own temper and you know it already after a few lines of dialogs.\n\nThe story progresses without any breaks and the lack of twists. Don’t expect that all your lead characters are untouchable. You’ll constantly face some events and situations where you need to make a choice. And almost every time it’ll be hard to determine the right way especially when there is no such thing. Sometimes you’ll need to make a choice that would be less painful than others, or you'll lose your men. And the game manages to involve you so deeply in its world and events that you sincerely regret about every number of lost men in your caravan! About lifeless numbers! And when this happen to the character whom you already know (but for like an hour or few at most) you really sympathize for him. But there are a lot of fun moments too. It has it all: hard moments and moments of peace and fun in between, the love, betrayal, conflicts inside groups and families, and some crazy things.\n\nThe story is deep, entertaining and beautiful. I really think about it like a book inside the game. You definitely should experience it yourself!\n\nScreenshot #2\n\nVISUALS AND MUSICVisual part of the game is stunning! I won’t talk much about it, I’ll just say that sometimes I just couldn’t move my hand from PrintScreen key. I’ve captured 450+ screenshots! Almost each frame can be taken for wallpapers. The art is really beautiful and along with awesome stylish soundtrack it makes a great atmosphere in the game. The music is very original, stand out and fits the game naturally.\n\nTHE VERDICT10 out of 10 and totally "must have" for everyone who loves challenging tactical turn-based gameplay, the deep, mature and interesting story alongside with stunning art and music. Do yourself a favor — buy this masterpiece!\n\nP.S. Stoic, thank you guys! Can’t wait for the next part!","June 25, 2014","true","45.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

You spent a lot of renown for a couple of heroes, take them into battle, got them the last hits to gain levels, but then you make one conversational choice, unfortunately they don't agree with you, and they just left. That's it, they just LEFT your caravan and in one case one of them even killed 2 of your main heroes from the start, yes TWO heroes.\nThere goes your Renown (main resource in this game) and time in battle.\n\nAnd now with your high level heroes gone, all you have is low level heroes to fight higher level enemies.\nBrilliant.... Just brilliant.\n\nAnother cons :\n-Too much loading screen.\n-You can't equip or change items on your heroes if they are on the Promote status and you don't have enough Renown to Promote them.\n-You can't go to your heroes screen freely. You must Rest or you can gain access when you're about to enter a battle.\n-Maintaining high Morale is too hard because you must Rest for a couple of days, Rest consumes Supplies, and Supplies bought with Renown which is limited (especially when you took control of Rook).\n-The end battle is just silly. This game encourages you to be tactical from the beginning, but when it comes to the final battle, the game force you to engage the boss as fast as possible or you'll get overwhelmed.\n-Last one : the ending.

The combat plays out in turns with one or your characters getting a turn and then one of the enemy characters. When you're evenly matched or even slightly out-numbered, this isn't noticable. It becomes noticable when you have 6 characters, the enemy has 3, and the enemy characters are getting 2 turns to your 1. This can actually be a huge advantage for the enemy.\n\nThe way turns are taken, forces you to employ a tactic to maim the enemy but not kill them until almost all of them are maimed. The reason maiming is effective is because enemies with low health don't hit as hard. By leaving maimed enemies on the field, you're often ensuring the enemy turn is ineffective.\n\nThe impact of low health on combat effectiveness is great. It brings a very interesting mechanic to the game. Unfortunately, you're forced to use it every single time you're in combat. The lack of choice in combat tactics is what makes the combat feel so repetetive, which is a same because the game is, otherwise, very enjoyable.","November 20, 2014","true","22.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This mass combat system, however bare bones, feels like it belongs, although it could use some improving, because as far as I can tell there are only four commands.\n\nThe story is great, and more then earns it's title as a saga. Despite being a dying world,  as the gods are all dead and the sun has stopped in the center of the sky , its people are alive and vibrant, struggling to survive on this barren world. It reminds me of the D&D setting Dark Sun, except there is still some hope left in the world, however flimsy. You grow attached to characters, mourning their failures and deaths and cheering when they do something cool. At least twice I have figuratively shot myself in the foot to save a character I cared about.\n\nThe art is beautiful, and I'm honestly not sure it would work in any other style. The art is realistic enough to portray the humans as human, but stylized enough to make the varl, who are awesome horned giants, and the enemy Dredge, who appear to be some form of automaton, seem right at home in the world.\n\nAnd the lore, don't even get me started. I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons (and other role-playing games), and normally play the role of the GM, which means I do a lot of world building. As such, I apprieciate it when a game puts effort into building an interesting world, and I can often kill hours just reading lore and pouring over in-game maps. Stoic has created an excellent world for this, and I have been specifically avoiding the map in The Banner Saga because I know if I don't, I will read every entry and spend two hours doing nothing important.\n\nHowever, this game is not without it's faults (although some of these "faults" may just be personal preference). First off, the game feels hard. It isn't, at least not on the difficulty I'm playing on, but it feels as if I'm doing everything wrong. Second, it is a very dense game. As much as I love it, I can only play for maybe an hour before my head starts to hurt and I have to shut it off. This is only a complaint in that I have to shut off the game, and it's a fantastic game.\n\nIn short, if you want a game with a deep story, deep combat, and deeper lore, play the Banner Saga. If you want a game where you make decisions, play the Banner Saga. If you want a game where the entire world is putty in your hands, play something else, because the Banner Saga is harsh and unforgiving.","May 27, 2014","true","7.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

It might be the entracing music, the Disney quality hand-drawn art, or perhaps it's the fact that everytime I play this game it's always 30 minutes later than I expected it to be.\n\nThe combat is simple, for the uninitiated. As you begin to dive into the character types, their respective special attacks, and equipable items, you'll soon realize that there is a depth to the combat that will keep you coming back. When the odds are seemingly against you, and you do in fact manage to reduce your foe to a single unit vs. one or more of your own, you will feel like a champion. A real champion.\n\nWhat has surprised me the most about The Banner Saga is the number of choices and chances the game allows. Every combat decision, every discussion, every step on the map brings consequences.\n\nI can't tell you whether or not you should buy The Banner Saga, but I can tell you that you would almost be a fool not to.","January 18, 2014","true","11.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I was a Kickstarter backer at one of the mid tiers.\n\nIt just isn't very good. The combat system is terrible and actually penalizes you for killing your enemies. Optimal strategy is to whittle enemies down to low str (because of the dumb hp=attack strength system) and make the weaker enemies waste enemy turns. It's unintuitive and unsatisfying.\n\nThe battles all feel the same because the terain is all flat and boring. The game consists of terrible battles, boring watching your people walk animations, and cutscenes where you have to make decisions with no idea what the result will be. These are probably the worst and I quit the game after one of these random decision events killed off my most powerful character. That just isn't fun. This game just isn't fun.

The art is beautiful, the combat is interesting when you first play with it, and the story feels epic.  But about 10 hours in (at the end of the game) there are so many flaws you had to endure that you will be yelling at the computer.  You are given really sparadoic choices in an Oregon trail like traveling sequence,  which can kill off main characters that you love. So you try to reload realizing that the game only saves at the beginning of major battles. Meaning if you ever want to redo a choice, you just wasted 30 minutes because you have to do it all over again.  It made me so jaded that I just moved through the game without caring what happened.  (I got the achievement for forced march without even trying.)  The story is very vague and frustrating.  No one knows what's happening, that is what you will hear for 90% of the game.  No battles are a challenge, except the final boss battle, which because manipulating turn order is such a slog, is ridiculously frustrating. Not difficult, just frustrating as you try to kill a boss that keeps regenerating it's life while killing your men.\nIf you still want to buy this game even though the gameplay is so weak: Here's a spoiler free tip for combat: don't kill anyone.  Just weaken them to 1 str and then kill them all. You're welcome.","November 18, 2014","false","10.7"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

"\n\nThat is how it all starts. But you aren't some lone adventurer trying to make the world work right again. In this decidedly Norse-inspired story, you are merely a person with the mantels of leadership thrust upon you, even if you don't really want to be responsible for the hundreds of clansmen, fighters and varl that trail after your banner. But they are your people now, and as each day passes you begin to understand how every decision you make has a consequence-- and that sometimes, even if there really isn't a good decision to be had... you still have to choose.\n\n\nAESTHETICS\nThis game is beautiful.\n\nOne of the reasons I fell in love with Banner Saga is for its visuals. Aside from the fact that almost each and every piece of screenshot is an elegant work of art, the overall sound and music provide the mood for a sombre yet fairytale-like journey. The UI and animation in-game are also beautiful to look at and harks back to a time when animation styles were traditional and organic. The characters are also very well designed, as was the overall lore that added a sense of depth and mystique without using the standard RPG fare. I wish they could have had more time for delving deeper or a longer plotline, because at times it felt as if some parts were intriguing but left untapped.\n\nNARRATIVE\nBut what made it even more beautiful was its "weight". This game is the great kind of narrative, and one that you can participate in. Although other games usually give users free reign over characters' choices and plot lines (choices are technically as simple) Banner Saga gives implicitly moral dilemmas and decisions where you aren't particularly certain of the outcome-- much like in real life. And like real life, some outcomes may be grave.\n\nBATTLE SYSTEM\nYou are in control of your battles. Although the battle system takes a bit of getting used to, it makes tactical warfare as engrossing with all unique abilities per character. They all play differently. This is especially interesting because you feel like you are fighting as individuals and not as a certain class type. I admit, there are points where the UI or gameplay mechanics can be improved (an undo walk button? a way to know spell range before moving?) and the standard tactics would really be to maim rather than kill, but I think that they balanced this splendidly enough because I was neither too disheartened nor did I find it too easy to use.\n\nOverall, my experience with Banner Saga was wonderful. I recommend it to people who love narratives, pretty art and vikings, to people who are insightful about leadership, who want to manage circumstance and to people who are interested in thinking through their battles. I recommend it to people who are open to the possibility of their hearts breaking, and to those who are willing to give it some 12-14 hours of love. I thoroughly enjoyed my journey. <3","August 31, 2014","true","15.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Banner saga introduces several new genre elements:\n1) Your damage output depends on how much health you have\n2) Decisions you make between battles can be life and death for your characters\n3) Turn order changes based on the number of remaining characters on each side\n\nI think 1 & 2 are really awesome, but 3 detracts from the experience for me. Instead of trying to kill your opponents, each battle is a struggle to keep as many enemies alive as possible, but with only 1 - 2 life remaining, so they can't do any damage. If you kill an opponent, then the remaining enemies move up in order (essentially getting more turns), which means if there is a powerful enemy in a battle, then by the end, they go every other turn. Enemies like Bellower that heal on their turn make this mechanic even more ridiculous.\n\nIf they make a banner saga 2 or come out with additional content, I hope they consider using a standard turn mechanic, where killing an enemy is actually favorable. Also, the map gives the illusion that the game is an open world with lots of travel options, but you are given very few opportunities to make travel choices; I'd like to see more variety in travel.","October 16, 2014","true","13.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game is forged by your choices... Every choice you make has its effects, making or breaking relationships, saving or sacrificing the lives of your caravan, finding or losing supplies and wealth. The combat is tactical and turned-based, (Similiar to games such as Disgaea, Final Fantasy Tactics, Suikoden etc.) but is unique to anything I've played before due to its Willpower system. Using your Willpower sparingly and at the right moment can really turn the battle in your favor. The music score is also brilliant, it's the icing on the cake.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything about the story, but I will say it's compelling, it really does leave you wanting more. Also, as the story is shaped by the choices you make, I'm sure it'll be a different experience the second time around.\n\nIt's rare to see this type of game now'a'days, truly a hidden gem.","March 22, 2014","true","24.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Great artwork, an interesting world inspired by Norse mythology, a interesting but sad story full of interesting characters and unique, enjoyable combat. I began to genuinely care about many of the characters, they are well written and some have distinctive personalities. You will often have to make walking-dead style decisions where you must weigh risk versus supplies, morale and your available fighting force. Later in the game some of the choices you must make are quite difficult and make the story feel like your own.\n\nThe combat is turn-based, with you moving your selected squad members about using different abilities to damage enemy armor and health, which also serves as strength. Weakening armor allows you to do more damage to strength, while damaging their health/strength reduces the impact of enemy attacks. I found the combat difficulty to be well balanced if not a little bit easy for most of the game, I only failed a battle once but often I was down to my last guy when I won.\n\nSadly things fall apart a bit near the end of the game. The story becomes a bit contrived with the introduction of a certain character, and the final battle is problematic. You are forced to use a specific character in this battle despite making a big choice regarding this character right near the end that in my mind should have left her out of the battle. I had not leveled this character up at all, she was weak and unhelpful in combat and this made the final encounter near impossible for me on the normal difficulty level.\n\nApart from the last hour or so of this ten-hour game, I really enjoyed the Banner Saga and would put it on part with The Walking Dead in terms of story, characters and meaningful choices that have surprising results. one caveat is that there is no voice acting for most of the dialogue, so if you dislike reading you might not enjoy this game as much. I personally would take no voice acting over bad voice acting, but for some this might be a deal breaker.","March 23, 2014","true","10.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

Perhaps one of the freshest games to appear on the PC scene in the early 2010's, albeit carrying with it a cumbersome battle system that makes even the SNES die-hards who sat through Ogre Battle laugh at it.\n\nNo one can deny the beauty of this game's art direction paid in homage to the late and great Eyvind Earle of Sleeping Beauty fame, but its the brass trumpets and wood flutes that echo through the ice fields of Austin Wintory's soundtrack that truly triumph. Yet there is always a niggling feeling whenever I am thrust in to a battle. When it comes to crafting strategy RPGs the greatest game of all to take inspiration from is chess. I adore chess, but chess doesn't make me grind my teeth. I'm hoping that the team go back and refine the battle system a little more for the later games. Tweak it here, twink it there, and the final result should end up palatable.\n\nAnother sticking point is the overall story. It tries to achieve the same grand scale that its visual and aural brothers easily scale, but we have all seen and read tales that depict an immense calamity that greatly determines the fates and destiny of the powerful few. Granted The Banner Saga contains stories that may seem slightly original, and the plot twists (alongside brutal character choices) make up for it, but I would have loved a Norse-inspired saga with more races or cultures or whatever. Instead it's mostly a landlocked ice nation that revolves around one shamanistic religion. Those who demand cake will never always be served cake so my antagonist attitude toward this game, especially in the light of this game riding off Kickstarter with a very small crew, shall remain nothing more than personal wishes.\n\nI will however raise my hat to those in the lore department. You made the map experience absolutely delightful and original. Thank you.\n\n\nIf anything - play The Banner Saga for the truly epic scope crafted within the art field. It is a beautiful game with a strong heartbeat and many will not be disappointed.

You become attached to the characters who have their own personalities and depth. The other part of the game is managing your rations, because the whole game you are pretty much travelling to save the lives of others and yourself. If you get into it, you can feel the hopelessness of everyone. Mainly because there is no hope. There is no happy ending, and I think that's what makes the game so appealing. It's like "The Empire Strikes Back", or if the White Walkers from Game of Thrones busted loose from the wall and there was no Dany, Jon Snow or Tyrion to make things right again.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you love RPGs.

The story, dialogue, and the sense of urgency and danger is really well done in this game. But to me, the combat is so frustrating and feels like it works against you. Movement is extremely limited and makes no sense. If my archer moves 3 spaces when he can move 5, he CANNOT move 2 more spaces afterwards. Why? I don't know. Archer range is shorter than enemy movement range, meaning you need a protective wall for your archer or else he will get destroyed by melee.

Very enjoyable, given that you know what to expect.\n\nGameplay: First thing to note - this isn't a traditional CRPG at all. No open world, no exploring, no looting random enemies etc. etc. Basically, the game consists of story given in textual form plus tactical battles. Surprisingly enough, this game is actually very much like a Japanese visual novel: making choices in dialogues with some fighting in between. Nothing wrong with that, but I guess there are people who dislike that kind of stuff.\nCombat system: The game has an original turn-based combat system which can be a bit confusing in the beginning, but is, in fact, very consistent and coherent. Fights are interesting and challenging - this game isn't easy at all at Normal difficulty (though it isn't exactly hard, the balance is just right). So that part of the game is very well-executed.\nGraphics: The artwork in the game is to die for! For me at least it was love at first sight. I actually find it quite difficult to stop pressing F12 all the time. Every single screenshot is a piece of art!\nMusic: Good, adequate, though I'm not exactly willing to listen to that soundtrack when not in game. Which isn't a bad thing, there aren't that many game soundtracks that can stand on their own.\nStory: I'm not quite finished with it so it's a bit early to say, but so far - not bad at all. And I would definitely play again to see what different choices can lead to. All is well here. If it wasn't for one thing... which is in fact the only thing I didn't exactly like about the game ->\nWriting: This is the only thing I find somehow... lacking. Don't get me wrong, I like the plot, I like the characters. I don't like writing itself, because it lacks style, it lacks flavor. It wouldn't be such a big deal if this game wasn't at least 50% textual. I'm not saying that all the characters have to speak like they are in the poetic Edda, but all those "ok", "crap", "yeah" and "everything was a mess"-sort of descriptions are not to my liking.

It have some downsides like a bit to linear and that a lot of the chooses that you make have bad results or really bad ones. May just be me choosing badly of course, second playthrough should shine some light on that.\n\nThe story is excellent such good writing and really capture the feel of dread and fleeing for your life chased by an overwhelming enemy. There is some light points and some humour in there as well to balance that out. The artstyle is so beautiful and every frame is so well crafted. Combat is fun and interesting even if it took me some time to get used to it and understand it completely and all hail turnbased combat I missed you so.\n\nIf I should bring something up that is kind of bad and that frustrated me a bit it's the resource part of the game and the severely limited quantity of it. Sure one could say it portrays the flight and scarcity of supplies for refugees in war time. But when you use the same resources to buy food and equipment as you use for levelling your fighters it get's a bit to much. If I had my way the levelling system should be separated with it's own points from the whole food and equipment currency. I had several fighters that could level up ones or twice even but no possibility to because I needed to buy food for my caravan. Could not buy items for them and even if I could they would have been to low level to use them.\n\nOver all though it is a good game and for me worth the money and I do hope to see more as it's set up for a sequel or another chapter or two.

That's great and all, but I care about how a game PLAYS.  And to put that into perspective, we're going to have to get some ♥♥♥♥ out of the way right off the bat.\n\nThis game is a step away from the ordinary.  Some people are going to be turned off by that.  In fact, some people will cry.\n\nMe?  I praise the sun.\n\n\nSee, The Banner Saga isn't a game that holds you by the hand.  It informs you of things to a degree, drops a few hints in the narration and dialogue that you have to actively seek out, and then expects you to make an educated guess on how the world around you will react to your choices.  And trust me, it doesn't always react nicely.  You'll have party members smashed for doubting in your own abilities.  You'll have friends betray you because you stuck to your opinion just a little more than they'd like.  You'll get mad.\n\nDeal with it.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is that it's about prediction and reaction.  You're always given enough to predict things well enough, if you see the subtle signs in front of you.  And whether you catch those signs properly or not, you'll be reacting to how things play out, so keep a cool head and salvage your situation the best way possible.  Ultimately, you can replay it again and try to not make the same mistakes you did the first time around.  See how it changes your story.  I can guarantee that there will still be surprises even your third time around.\n\nReplay value is basically the name of the game.  It's long enough to be an adventure, but short enough to keep multiple plays from becoming tedious and grinding.  There's a lot of choice, big and small, and all of it will impact your story in a major way by the end.\n\nThe combat, in a similar vein, is largely randomized encounters.  You can affect the difficulty of each war encounter by how you choose to approach it as well.  Rush in and take on the harder enemies to spare your army?  Take a cautious approach and let your army take the brunt of the forces so your own battles are less stressful?  There's a handful of possibile approaches that further alter your experience.  And don't let the simplicity of the combat statistics fool you, there's a lot of ♥♥♥♥ to think about for every battle.\n\nFor everyone who's had the opportunity to learn the battle system via multiplayer battles in Factions, it's second nature already, but for all newcomers...there's a lot of subtle things that matter in very major ways.  Positioning is key.  Killing vs crippling a target can vastly affect momentum swings.  Effective use of willpower can clutch out an entire battle.  Sometimes letting a few allies actually die is exactly what you need to do to win.  There's a lot of forethought that can be applied and number crunching is crucial.  Can it be brutal at times?  Absolutely.  But it's never unfair.\n\nSo, let's sum this all up.\n-Do you value transparency in choices?\n-Do you like to know exactly what's going to happen before you do anything?\n-Do you usually follow a walkthrough when playing through a game for the first time?\n-Do you reload whenever a character permanently dies?\n-Do you get frustrated when you can't just kill everything in your way?\n\nSorry, game's probably not your cup of tea.\n\n-Do you like thinking ahead to predict outcomes?\n-Do you like learning how to manipulate a system to your advantage?\n-Do you value strategy over action?\n-Do you like role playing and value decision making?\n-Are you capable of taking responsibility for poor choices?\n\nIf these are the case, be prepared for an amazing experience you'll never forget.\n\nWith that said, this game gets my full recommendation.  I also encourage anyone interested to give The Banner Saga: Factions a try first, since it's free and will let you experience the battle system to your heart's content.","January 25, 2014","true","20.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Turn based combat with a beautiful art style and vikings? YES PLEASE. So I picked it up during the steam summer sale and I played it. I was promptly disappointed.\n\nAs I said before, the game has a beautiful art style, and a pretty interesting story. You lead a caravan of people running away from an "evil" army. You have to manage supplies and make a wide range of decisions that result in multiple outcomes. An example: Refugees approach your caravan, what do you do? A) kill them B) Take them in C) Send them away. Take them in? They could take supplies and run or reveal a hidden cache of supplies to help you. Being able to spend the game making choices throughout the "journey" is what would have made the banner saga a fantastic game. It has some measure of replayability trying out different options/choices and as I said, the story is actually interesting and had me intrigued enough to not put the game down.\n\nSo why don't I recommend this game?\n\nWell the crux of the game is the turn based combat. The combat is similar to a lot of other turn based games but it has been simplified. The combat gets really boring after a few battles. The battles never really vary, there all pretty much the same thing. No difference in environment, no real tactical decisions during combat. Its dry, repetitive combat. The units don't do anything to improve this.\n\nThe units you get throughout the game have different abilities, which is cool, but they each only get one (ie a wide swing that hits 3 units, or a shield bash that knocks units back) dull ability. The units themselves can only level up to level 5. Which is a pretty low cap for leveling units. Leveling them does make them stronger, and make their respective abilities better but its almost a chore. I LOVE building strong characters, I spent many hours playing fire emblem, final fantasy tactics and other similar games building strong characters with interesting abilities. In this game the abilities are bland and leveling your characters isn't interesting or fun. Sure it's necessary for progression, but its a chore.\n\nSo we have a low level cap, boring units, boring abilities and boring combat. What else? The LENGTH of this game is INCREDIBLY short. I have 7 hours played, and I've beaten the game. From what I understand, this game is a part of a trilogy, and the second part will be released after a short break from the development team. So that begs the question, why is this game 24.99 for a few meagre hours of gameplay. Its entirely possible the second saga of this trilogy will take your characters from before, raise their caps and continue with the admittedly interesting story, but that doesn't change the fact that the first game in the series is dull and it relies on a second game to make itself worth anything.\n\nTL;DR:\nDespite the cool choice system, the art style, and the story, the game falls flat. The core aspects of the game such as the combat and character leveling/abilities are bland, and the length is appallingly short. The game does have replayability, as you can pick different choices every playthrough, but personally, the incentive of a different outcome is not worth playing anymore of the combat. This game simply isn't worth it. Maybe in a few years when its dirt cheap or comes with the supposed other 2 games in this trilogy. As a standalone game, 24.99 isn't worth a decent story and some pretty pictures. Especially since the combat feels like a chore, especially after you've seen how the short story ends.","July 19, 2014","false","8.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I was really drawn to the cartoon-like aesthetic. Unfortunately, only the opening cinematic is fully animated, but the rest of the game is still beautiful. The setting is vaguely Scandinavian-ish fantasy, featuring men, Varl (a race of horned giants), and the Dredge (a race of stone creatures that are invading the land). It is the end of the world, with a unique apocalyptic fantasy feel.\n\nThe game is a mix of tactical combat and leading your caravan by making lots of little decisions as you travel. Some decisions have big long term consequences, which is nice. Once I got into the game a few hours, I got invested in the few main characters' stories. I really enjoyed the game and found a couple moments emotionally touching.\n\nThe combat mechanics are pretty gamey in some ways. You and the enemy alternate taking turns with a single fighter, even if you don't have the same number of fighters. Losing one of your characters effectively lets your other characters act more often. If either side loses all but one character, the game switches to "pillage mode", where all characters on one side get a turn before the single enemy does. It encourages you to keep some enemies weakened but alive until you can take out all the more powerful enemies.\n\nI switched between 'Normal' and 'Easy' periodically throughout the game. There's quite a big difference between them. The final battle, especially, I found impossibly difficult on normal, but unexpectedly easy on easy.\n\nHighly recommended if you like turn-based strategy and the cartoon-like visuals.","January 19, 2015","true","11.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Though the story ends up being rather short (I completed my first playthrough in ten hours), it is very well done and kept me interested from start to finish.\n\nThe experience and leveling system is unique and rewarding.  As you defeat enemies, win battles, and make choices during text-based events, you gain Renown, the currency used to purchase items, level up you heroes, and buy supplies.  On each level up, you can add two points to your hero's stats.  These stats include Armor (used to reduce incoming damage), Strength (used as both health and damage potential), Willpower (similar to stamina or mana in other games), Exertion (the amount of Willpower that can be used to boost movement or damage in a turn), and Break (used to reduce enemy armor).  Combat with these heroes is continually a balance between choosing to break enemy armor so that future attacks do more damage, or attacking to reduce health, which also reduces that targeted unit's damage potential by that amount.\n\nWhile traveling, your units will need supplies, which you purchase with Renown as well.  If you run out of supplies, the non-hero members of your caravan (Clansman, Fighters, Varl) will begin to starve and die off.  This will make enemy encounters far more challenging and dangerous.\n\nFinally, the text-based events of the game play a massive role throughout.  You will continually be cycling characters in and out of your party based on your decisions.  For example, it's possible to have a hero with you from start to finish, but it's also possible that you will get that same hero killed in the first event that they are involved in.  This, I found, is what truly made this game shine as a unique experience.\n\nI highly recommend this game to those who like tactical strategy games, Norse mythology, and deep storytelling.\n","January 24, 2015","true","10.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The unique art style looks like a hand drawn cartoon but it doesn’t take away from the gravity of the plot.  The game primarily consists of two sections, the caravan and the battlefield.\n\nThe caravan is the player’s home base and mode of transportation.  A fair amount of time is spent watching the caravan travel along a 2d map as you travel, you encounter bandits, disease, fire, and numerous other things that can help you or kill of members of your group.  Most of the plot unfolds here as well.  The game does a great job of depicting the hopelessness and fear of your characters, but it’s worth noting that there is virtually no voice acting.  Reading the script isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but keep in mind there is a lot of dialogue to get through and that means a lot of reading. So be prepared.\n\nThe combat is reasonably deep and combining health and attack power into a single statistic makes for a unique experience.  Unfortunately there can be quite a lot of repetitiveness in the battles.  After the first chapter or two, all of the non plot related fights feel far too similar.  Add that to the fact that there is no height in the battle field and the fights start blurring together.\n\nThe art style has a unique beauty, and the combat is fun, if repetitive. If are okay with, or enjoy reading dialogue and like tactical RPGs then pick up a copy.  If you are on the fence then spend some time with the free multiplayer version, The Banner Saga Factions.  That might be good enough.","January 15, 2014","true","9.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Yep, pretty stupid.\n\nThe laziness in which the character portraits and animations are made. The art was interesting, but come on, one stance and animation for the entire game? Sometimes they try to make it look like everyone is standing around talking to eachother, but   it just doesn't work. If you didn't want to spend time making mulitple animations just don't do them at all. Instead you're left with some half finished piece of garbage. I remember arriving a town and meeting some Varl and thinking hmm, this guy looks familiar! Oh wait, that's because he was a complete clone of another character I had except he was wearing red instead of green. Same face, same weapon, same hair, same beard, same facial animations, literally the exact same character except his tunic was red instead of green. Shameful.\n\nThe utter lack of abilities and customization. Each character has one ability and most of them are worthless. No skill trees, no talents. You get to put in stat points, but they have a cap and there really is no room for creativity.\n\nNo topography on the battlefield. Every map was exactly the same, a large square with no obstacles or cover. They had some  interesting artwork, but it was all just the same square.\n\nViking oregon trail. You just walk and walk and walk and walk and walk. Sometimes you get a choice! The choice usually screws you over or has no affect. Oh man I remember a game screen pops up and it talks about 'warfare mode' or something. I'm thinking, yeah, I have like 800 guys under my command right now, this will be one hell of a battle! Then a menu pops up and you're given a few choices with accompanying text (which is always the same, ALWAYS). It had potential and then just layed an egg. It was just the same ol battle again.\n\nThe interface was terrible. Equipping items was weird. The promotion screen has no way to be closed and you have to exit the entire screen to get it to go away.\n\nIN SUMMARY:\n\nI bought this game for full price not knowing it was a kickstarter game. I was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and thought it was a waste of money. Then I found out it was a kickstarter game and I thought "Ah, I'll cut them some slack" and then I got really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when I say that they raised around 700% more money than they asked for. So let me get this right, you rake in all this cash and then you fart out this half finished pile of rubbish with character clones, ♥♥♥♥ interface, 1 dimensional story and utter lack of depth and you charge $24.99??? AND, the game is ~8 hours long! 8 hours!\n\nOh they're going to split it into a trilogy so they can charge you again and again for their half finished games! Brilliant. Raise a bunch of money on kickstarter, keep all of it for yourselves and then drill your customers. I love the preview videos, they show all these animation cutscenes which look awesome and then you buy the game and there's like maybe 2 or 3 of them.\n\nSeriously don't get tricked into buying this piece of garbage by all the fanboys. This game is miserable.\n","January 28, 2014","false","8.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NBBeard/recommended/237990/","NBBeard","Nin. Ten. Do.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NBBeard/","446 products in account","The Gods are Dead.\nThe lands of The Banner Saga are desolate and barren, the sun hang motionless in the sky, men speak of the end of days as death marches from the north. Stoic has made a game that is just like the land it is based in, stark, cold and beautiful.\n\nThat beauty is the very first thing you will see when you begin your march in the banner saga. Half the time I was playing The Banner Saga I could not believe what I was looking at, the hand drawn feel and look of classic Disney or the better bits of ‘80s animation.  The aesthetic plays into gameplay as well, with the banner over your party getting bigger as your caravan gets bigger and as you accomplish what you can along your very hard journey. Characters and character classes have distinct looks which helps keep the many characters straight and to pick out what type of enemy you were fighting.\n\nThe only place that the art slightly falls down is in the arenas that you spend a good chunk of your time in over the course of the game. They are simple grids, sometimes in interesting locations, other times in just fields of snow. There is no topography to the maps, which is good for keeping battles from getting too complex, but doesn’t help with battle variety.\n\nTactical RPG battles are only part of the experience, but are quite important to the experience as a whole. The system brings some interesting mechanics to the tRPG genre while dropping some others. The central mechanic is built around managing two stats on both friends and foe over the course of a battle, Armor and Strength. Strength is interesting in that, it is both your health and how hard a character can hit. The more damage done to a character the less damage they can deal. That is where armor becomes important, blocking damage to strength and allowing characters to stay in battle. Being smart with how you balance your approach to the many fights that the game puts in your path will make impossible seeming battles, just barely winnable.\n\n\nUnit selection also plays a major role in The Banner Saga with not just character class mattering, but also character race. The game has two playable races, humans and Varl. Varl are half man half animal giants that take up four squares on the battle grid instead of one, they hit harder, but are far less mobile. Humans are smaller and can take less hits, but can pester enemies and make it possible to chase certain types of enemies down.\n\n\nUnlike some other games in the genre such as XCOM The Banner Saga does not feature permadeath in battles, but instead characters can be lost in a much more interesting way, your choices outside of battle.\n\n\nStory in The Banner Saga is second only to its art. The story is told from multiple perspectives, as characters deal with a world descending into chaos as an old enemy “the Dredge” a race of obsidian creatures invades from the north. The perspective shifts between an Varl Army and refugees fleeing from the dredge. I loved the contrast of the campaign trail  of the well stocked army of Varl Warriors as it marches home with the prince of man to solidify a long held treaty. You are never short on supplies or warriors and, while a few characters can die, you will mostly be losing faceless stats of Varl and human warriors.\n\nIn contrast Rook the main character of the refugee campaign, and the main focus of the games story, has a much harder story, that is also full of much more interesting choices. Every choice you make is a pyrrhic victory, either making life harder for yourself or the caravan. On the run from “the dredge” you never feel like you have enough supplies to make it to the next town, which may not even be there anymore, or may be hostile to outsiders. Choices made early in the story, may crop up later as double crosses and or loss of supplies or even characters that you have invested a lot of time and resources on.\n\nAlmost not choices that you have to make as Rook are easy, even small choices may have big consequences.  Even the meta game choices when you stop in town may effect the over all game for you, for example: the main resource in the game is renown, you gain renown from battle and certain actions outside of battle. Renown is treated as both a currency and experience for your party members, leaving you with the choice of feeding your caravan, so that you have enough men to make it to the next town, or leveling up your party so that you have a chance of surviving the next encounter.  And the game is ready to knock you down emotionally Game of Thrones style by having smaller seeming choices cost you a fully leveled character, just remember, be careful of who you trust.\n\nOverall The Banner Saga is a beautiful game that has a few issues in gameplay, but most of that is  settled out by having some the most accessible gameplay in the genre. Its story is dark, and leaves you with choices that are as interesting and difficult as choice made in any game before. I want the next chapter and I want it now after the dark and stark ending of the first chapter of this saga.\n\n","January 16, 2014","true","17.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

This game personally was a great game to end the year.\n\nSo the Banner Saga is a turn based stratergy RPG with choose your own adventure choices. The combat is engaging as it is important to know when to strike an enemy's health or to break their armor. The characters you travel with are interesting with their own views of the situation for the most part. A couple of your members only show up once or twice and never appear again which is a bit of a shame. The lore in this game is actually quite cool to read which you can when you view the map.\n\nNobody can talk about the Banner Saga without mentioning the artstyle. It's amazing and is truely wonderful to see though most of the cutscenes are just still images and that was a missed opportunity however the music is just as good and can really help immerse yourself in the game.\n\nThe Banner Saga is a worthy game to play with good combat, great story and amazing art and music.

I would have waited until all parts came out if i knew this.\n\nIncredible art and music, kinda boring characters, never really cared what happened to anyone.\n\ncombat is weird, difficult.  its a deep combat system and makes sense, i just never really enjoyed it or felt like it "clicked".  I would have liked to have tried more of the available characters in combat but renown is so scarce that i didn't have enough to level nearly enough of my people.  The caravan part was fun at first but ultimately doesn't really have any bearing on the outcome of things as i suspected-just felt random, every choice a gamble..  at certain times youre rewarded for being trusting and generous and then later you're punished for doing so.  perhaps this is supposed to be realstic, but it doesn't give you a way to get better at making these decisions, so i just ended up loading save games and trying the different options.\n\nWeird game, like the story, feel like it wouldve been a better movie than game.\n\nIts decent overall, nothing groundbreaking though.

The music is fantastic, the relationships between the characters feel genuine and real, and while there isn't as much VA as expected, it works out for the best.  Granted, I haven't played that much but so far it's great.\n\nThis was a drunken buy.  I was afraid I would regret it, but I don't.  It's very well done.  What I like about it is how the story progresses.  This is a survival story, the beginning of the apocalypse.  It's enjoyable because you become the leader of these various groups.  You can feel like you're really in charge of these lives through the dialogue.  The choices you make can really affect you.  "Bah, I should have done that!" "Shew, I knew it was a good idea to send her there, that was a good decision!"  I made a decision to bring a boy into combat with us and he was awesome!  Really glad I did, but then a decision not ten minutes later took him from me.\n\nThat's where the one-save is nice.  If I had another save slot, I would have reloaded.  Your decision are set and stone and that's satisfying in and of itself.\n\nThe combat is simple but it works well.  I like it and I like leveling up and taking care of my heroes.  It's a good system.\n\nAt first I didn't like how there were so little voice-overs in the dialogue, but frankly, it's better this way.  I can read it a lot faster than anyone can speak it.  So, really, I'm glad there's not that much VO.  People complain about it, but it's better.  Same for the cutscenes.  I'd rather have dialogue than cutscenes.  The VA that is there is great, especially the ones where you're approaching a village or something like that.","January 14, 2014","true","12.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Moreover, YOU ARE NOT EVEN BEING SOLD "THE WHOLE GAME"-THE END OF THIS GAME IS BARELY THE MIDDLE OF THE MAIN STORY. So, it's also a bunch of bad marketing thrown into the mix.\n\nWhile not a terrible game, THIS SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AT $25. Even if this game delivered a long, developed story akin to a fantasy book (which it does not both in the quality of its predictable plot and in its length), the price would still be too high. Considering that in order to truly finish the game you will have to buy a future expansion, THIS IS A BLATANT MONEYGRAB.\n\nIf you are a story-lover, then Banner Saga is NOT for you. It has developmental depth of a comic book and dialogue is not necessarilly great either. This game to reading a good book is what Cheez Its are to a good meal.\n\nIf you are looking for role-playing experience and to make impactful choices in a dynamic environment, then, again, this game is NOT for you. This game is a ride on a rail-road track, with events that force you to make decisions half the time without giving you enough feedback on the possible impact of those decisions. You will have to simply guess many times, and then the game would try to anticipate your choices by delivering cheap plot twists. It's quite silly. Moreover, after completing the game, it is easy to see that there is actually an optimal way to run through the story.\n\nIf you are expecting a deep, addictive tactical combat game, then just go for the f2p BS: Factions. Vanilla BS only delivers many boring copy-paste fights against highly-generic AI enemies.\n\nConclusion:\n\nUnder the pretense that this game is an interactive story deeply affected by your choices and spiced up by some awesome tactical combat you are being sold an elaborate beautiful Flash game akin to the games from sites like Armorgames and Newgrounds. This product lacks in content, delivering only the first chapter of the story, without a definitive ending. That is a giant no-no and a red flag for any story-based game, considering the whopping price of $25.\n\nWhile a good buy at a price of, let's say, $10 (considering the de facto NECESSITY of expansion purchase), this is a lackluster buy at $25.","March 4, 2014","false","17.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

This game does have some of the best music I have ever heard in a game and also some extremely beautiful artwork. Some of the story parts offer a very engaging expereince however, this game is padded out with filler and is incomplete. the combat is dull and actually requires little to no strategy. the story "ending" happens after the death of a character that has a very convoluted backstory. the many names thrown at you are also very confusing to keep track of. I have no idea what happens to everyone else still iving in the end including the massive serpent creature....which seems to only have been relevent to end a battle sequence. your decicions have actually very little effect on anything and it is quite obvious that on several decisions the outcome would have been the same regardless of your choice. The ending sequence in particular was ridiculous by forcing you to include Allete a weak underleveled, useless, character that, thanks to the poor story telling, I couldn't care less about. This game is ovepriced and very unsatisfying in the end. unless you have actually beaten it; dont fool yourself. this game leaves much to be desired. Maybe if more than a handful of people worked on it or they had another few years and double the money things would be different but this games ambition is too great for its own good. there are so many pointless features like the map for example and I'm completely disenchated by this game now.

There are some moments in the story which will provoke an emotional reaction. Mostly "noooo!", it is a bleak tale of the apparent end of the world after all.\n\nHowever, it is short, I felt, for the price asked for. It is also apparently part 1, and part 2 and 3 are as yet, unfunded, according to the developers - they are waiting to see how well it sells before they can commit to making any more.\n\nThe balance at the moment, is somewhat off, as relating to management of resources. This is supposed to be addressed soon in a patch though. I experienced a few game lockups, which were very, very frustrating due to how the game saves its state. Having to force-close the game and reload, meant having to redo an hour or more.\n\nI'm conflicted as to whether or not to recommend this. On the one hand, if I recommend it, then it raises the chances of the story being continued, and finding out what happens next. On the other hand, the length of the game, for the price asked, and some of the problems I encountered, and the prospect that parts 2 and 3 may never exist, means that I can't honestly recommend it at this time.\n\nPros: Art is great, setting is interesting, story is involving.\nCons: Short length, price, a few glitches, cliffhanger with uncertain prospect of resolution.","January 21, 2014","false","12.8"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

The gods are dead. The sun unresting in the sky.\n\nIn this game you follow two groups. One is the group of Hakon, a leader of the Varl, still kind of uneasy in the role of leader. He has to get along with Ludin, the prince of men, and his bodyguards and entourage.\nThe other group is lead by Rook, a hunter from Skogr. He is together with Iver, a varl he has known for a while, his daughter Alette, Egil, archer Oddleif and all of his clansmen.\n\nAlong the way you can gather people to join your caravan as you travel the world, fleeing for the Dredge, stone creatures. Fighting them almost becomes monotone, as there aren't a lot of other enemies in the game, except for some enemy humans and varl. But the game makes up for that by fitting it perfectly in the story.\n\nThe other thing that helps making this game not so monotone is that the special events (raids, attacks, fighting families, hunger, theft, curious characters, etc.) are sometimes random and don't appear in a certain order. You have to think wise though if you want to let certain people in or out of your caravan, as your actions can have heavy consequences.\n\nSometimes, parts of the game seem a little buggy (losing people due to hunger while you aren't skipping a day for example).\n\nIt takes a while to really understand the dynamics in fighting. I was a bit confused by how willpower and renown works, so my advice to players is to really read into it while the game explains and train with your character for practice-battles, or fighting enemies becomes frustrating and confusing. I almost finished my first playthrough and I'm very surprised. Definetely going to replay the game, as certain decisions seem to have a huge impact.\nWhat a worth for my money!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genisage/recommended/237990/","genisage","genisage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genisage/","462 products in account","I love this game. I still haven't beaten it, and I'll try to update my review when I do, but so far, there is very little about this game that is not fantastic. I bought it for the atmosphere, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. The amount of work that went into making a cohesive and interesting world is impressive. After playing for only a couple hours, I had learned enough about the world to become attached to it, but I still feel as if I've seen only a small part of a grander picture, and I'm enjoying the process of discovering more about the world immensely. There are a few jarring elements, the speech sometimes feels a bit off, and distances and travel times are hard to judge. But overall the characters, the world, and the events of the game create an atmosphere that make this game fantastic all on their own.\n\nSpeaking of the characters, you will probably get attached to them. It's difficult in a game like this to strike the right balance for the main characters between blank slates, acting only according to the whims of the player, and fully developed characters who make their decisions regardless of what the player wants. The Banner Saga does a good job with that, the characters have identities of their own, but they are faced with choices where they could reasonably go either way, so the player can still influence them to some degree. You're never in complete control of them, and there might be times when their character prevents you from making a choice you would prefer, but you always feel like you are influencing the story.\n\nI spent a lot of time agonizing over the choices I've had to make throughout the game. I was surprised by how much I cared about the characters as they journeyed across the continent, and it sucks when a seemingly harmless choice ends up hurting them. Sometimes you can recover from a bad decision with particularly good strategy in the next fight, sometimes it's just a matter of making the best of what's left, but it all contributes to my inability to stop playing this game.\n\nI like the combat system but don't have a lot to say on the topic. I've definitely never had this much trouble with a strategy game before, but it's (almost) always winnable. It took some getting used to, but the strategy part has started to make more sense.\n\nThe art and music are great, of course, but you know that already.\n\nThe only things I've found that I don't like are:\nYou can't see movement range when setting up units\nYou can't see enemy move order when settng up units\nYou can't change your own move order when setting up units\nYou can't change equipment while setting up units (or more importantly, when selecting your party before the fight)\nI find myself misclicking a lot. It would be nice if you could undo moves if you haven't actually taken an action yet. This is especially annoying when I have a ranged ability, and I can see the range from my starting position, but I miscount the number of spaces I need to move before the enemy is in range, and then I can't change my move, so I'm stuck doing nothing.\n\nAll in all, the game is great, and you should buy it. It's definitely worth the price.","May 19, 2014","true","15.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gameplay is part Oregon Trail with the other part being a mix of chess and Shining Force or Fire Emblem.  Character deaths are only seen through dialogue and do not happen on the battlefield.  The combat system is interesting as well because you have to consider whether to break an enemy's damage resistance or go straight for their health/strength.\n\nSidequesting in this game is virtually impossible because of the impending doom that follows them so resource management is a necessity.\n\nI am very interested in what the next one holds.","January 16, 2014","true","32.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I promptly spent my homework time playing this game....and dinner...and well, 7 hours later I beat the game.  I really liked the flow of the game and the consequences of your choice.  So i decided to play it again, but make new choices.  The conversations didn't really change, but the results of my choices did.\n\nI enjoyed the intro movie and thought a lot of the game would have the same animation cut scenes, but they didn't. That i found to be a let down.  The music however was always spot on, which definitely added to the gameplay.\n\nThere are parts that I may be missing, but some of the storyline hasn't been developed once introduced.  It may be because of my choices throught out the game, but huge chunks of potential story are just not there. I want to know what this "darkness" is, or wtf that snake has to do with anything.\n\nOverall I liked the game due to the asthetics, and the Oregon trail feel of the game.

The choices you make and the people you talk to definitely have a noticable impact. I just restarted my game now that I have a better grasp on the combat and a key character that I had for quite some time in my other game died because I made a different choice this time around. We'll have to see if that choice plays out with enough benefits to outweigh this decision D:\n\nPros:\n-Love the storyline and the combat\n-Good balance between using the ingame 'currency' to either buy supplies so you don't starve, or to buy rank ups for your key warriors, or buying items that boost the warrior's performance.\n-I don't always pay attention to music, but so far have felt it matches the situations to set the mood/atmosphere very well.\n\nCons:\n-I got to a particular two-stage fight fairly late into the game and my current lineup is unable to pull off a win, I have tried almost all last weekend, several 2-3 hour sessions at the same fight. I've read how others deal with it online, and because I don't know how far back I need to go to load a previous save....I have no choice but to go back and restart the game. AGAIN.\nThis fight's difficulty ramps up too quickly. Even after I changed the in-game difficulty to easy, the fight says we will rest one day and then go at it, and in easy difficulty my warriors should proc a day of resting and be full strength but they do not. At the normal difficulty this team has made it through many fights but this one's mechanics are not matched anywhere else to prepare you for it nor does the game give you any help in being able to ramp yourself up for it.\n\n\nAside from really the one glaring con that has forced me into restarting my game to better prepare, it's a good game. I do wish we could explore more of the world map. The game puts an emphasis on checking out the map and having all this detail on it, and then because you're following the story line, you don't get to chose where you're going or do any side quests to different locations. It'd be cool if, in an expansion or patch/update they add more content that is exploreable within this realm.","January 25, 2014","true","23.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Honestly i didn't think i'd enjoy reading instead of watching scenes and listening to the speeches but that actually made me feel like i'm really involved in it.

Only the last fight was hard on normal and i wanted to see the ending so i switched difficulty to easy, will definately play it all over on hard. It does seem to have many choices you make throughout the game and even the small one have effect. Several things did not really make sense, you lose so many landsman, fighters and varl if you travel without resources, and in the end you finish with however many of those left but does it make any difference with how many you finish it? Made no sense to me, but i havent serched for the answer either so maybe it does have some kind of effect. In my point of view game does have minor flaws as i would call them but those are not vital at all. Definately worth getting! Looking forward to continuation of the story!","January 16, 2014","true","27.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gods are dead. The sun unresting in the sky.\n\nIn this game you follow two groups. One is the group of Hakon, a leader of the Varl, still kind of uneasy in the role of leader. He has to get along with Ludin, the prince of men, and his bodyguards and entourage.\nThe other group is lead by Rook, a hunter from Skogr. He is together with Iver, a varl he has known for a while, his daughter Alette, Egil, archer Oddleif and all of his clansmen.\n\nAlong the way you can gather people to join your caravan as you travel the world, fleeing for the Dredge, stone creatures. Fighting them almost becomes monotone, as there aren't a lot of other enemies in the game, except for some enemy humans and varl. But the game makes up for that by fitting it perfectly in the story.\n\nThe other thing that helps making this game not so monotone is that the special events (raids, attacks, fighting families, hunger, theft, curious characters, etc.) are sometimes random and don't appear in a certain order. You have to think wise though if you want to let certain people in or out of your caravan, as your actions can have heavy consequences.\n\nSometimes, parts of the game seem a little buggy (losing people due to hunger while you aren't skipping a day for example).\n\nIt takes a while to really understand the dynamics in fighting. I was a bit confused by how willpower and renown works, so my advice to players is to really read into it while the game explains and train with your character for practice-battles, or fighting enemies becomes frustrating and confusing. I almost finished my first playthrough and I'm very surprised. Definetely going to replay the game, as certain decisions seem to have a huge impact.\nWhat a worth for my money!

If you're familiar with tactical RPGs like Heroes of Might & Magic, chances are you will enjoy this one. The gameplay is mainly about turn-based battles on a chess board wich a various sets of character to put into. But the game also relies a lot on choices you make during your journey. And boy, what a joyrney if i might add!... The visuals are just stunning. Your caravan travels accross long panoramical landscapes of snowy hills and frozen forests. It sets the tone for the story brillantly told through a lot of dialogs and interactions between characters. The musics are great, often featuring folkloric chants that makes it even more imersive to this nordic fantastic tale.\n\nThe battles are challenging then easier once you learn to use the right tactics. Their outcomes will depend of the characters you choose.

You have a finite amount, so do you level up your heroes, get items, or buy supplies? Later in the game you can usually only choose one, so choose wisely.\n\nOne misconception I had before buying the game was that your heroes could be killed in combat.

While the story is fairly linear, you will end up in the same place no matter what, who is still alive when you get there will vary wildly from person to person. The game is built on the concept of an apocolypse and the developers had no problems bringing the harsh choices such an event would bring. The game gives a good frame work of the events and then allows the player to tailor how their individual journey plays out. Major plot points will be the same but the pieces that will in the blanks will be customized, and are often memoriable.\n\nCons: Some people don't like cartoony art (I think it's beautiful in this game). There is no save system, it autosaves but it saves multiple copies so it's easy to backtrack. The combat is far inferior to the Banner Saga Factions and not just because it's next to impossible to create an AI on the level of a human. In Factions, every unit has a special ability making positioning and targeting key to success. In Banner Saga, a fair amount of enemies have no special moves, even into late game, erroding some of the tactical depth. This is further compounded by the lack of enemy types. The game is also very short (took me 8 hours), if you don't replay games often this might be a big deal to you. There's also a lack of exploration due to the onrails nature of the story. And finally, RPS has said they found the story hard to follow early on. They don't give you all the details about why what's happening is happening until later but, I never understood where this confusion comes from but feel it's probably worth mentioning.","January 25, 2014","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don Draper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWerepyreKing/","392 products in account","Today I finished The Banner Saga, and after reading many reviews, I have some responses and things I liked about the game.\n\nResponse to its "unfairness": that is the point of the game, that thousands of people are dying and it's going to be a bit unfair. I can understand being angry at that, but that's the direction the developers wanted to go into.\n\nThe battle system is interesting, with two primary stats: Strength, and Armor. Damage = Attacking Strength - Defending Armor. Low armor/health allies usually are backed up with a bow or special abilities which are very helpful in the late game; being able to have full health and deal full damage in late-battle is a godsend.\nYou can pick any ally you want to go into battle, with a cap, and what order they go in. If your enemies have less people than you, they are given a slight advantage because the order goes you-them-you-them. When you have 1 opponent left it goes into pillage mode, which essentially means that unless the last opponent is very strong the game will end.\n\nThe story, with which I was most impressed, made me forget about anything else I didn't like. It was dark, depressing, and basically the Oregon trail with Vikings. Between story and fighting was traveling, where you had to balance supplies and leveling up your characters, as well as making decisions which could easily kill off characters (sometimes "unfairly", as I said above, sometime not - like if you decide to take up a dangerous thief in disguise).\n\nThe animation is rather static with beautiful elements and scenery. I would pay thrice this game's value for an art collection of this game.\n\nOverall, good 7-8 hour experience, and I would recommend it to people. who are looking for a slow-paced game with a heavy story-driven experience.

The story has tonnes of Lore if you look around the map, but if you want the basics of the story then the return or a warlike race that despises humanity - The Dredge - led by an invincible leader called Bellower has sent the world into chaos.\n\nThe gameplay is a strategical, turn-based sing-player combat against the Dredge or other survivors and each character in your caravan has certain skills and unique abilities that can help you develop solid stratedgies for taking down opponents. It has the novel idea of your health also representing strength, so the more health you lose the less powerful your character's attacks will be. You have a whole array of units such as archers, shieldbangers, warhawks, etc.\n\nInbetween battles there are chapters, in each chapter you will play as one of three POV characters leading a caravan across this hostile world in a way similar to "Oregon Trail". Here you will make conversation choices with other characters and sometimes the wrong ones will result in your characters dying or leaving for good, which results in you having less units to fight with in the tactical combat - a lot of people have a problem with this but it actually works as good incentive to level up everyone rather than just focus on one character and make them the best; you could lose them at any point. One character in particular, Egil, who has a special ability that let's him block almost any attack (so pretty useful when utilised correctly) can be killed about 8 times during these conversation choices and you actually get an achievement for keeping him alive! The choices also offer a bit of replayability in terms of characters but there is little in the way of overall change.\n\nThe game isn't perfect; in the "Oregon Trail" part you have fighters, clansmen and varl (Varl are part of the mythology and are giants with horns) that you are charged with keeping alive, managing supplies to do so, but many players point out you can let them all starve to death and still complete the game without consequences, however it seems this will remedied in the sequel which will make your caravan more important.\n\nAnother issue is that there is little difference in terms of combat scenarios with everyone with the terrain remaining basically the same and the enemies changing only slightly over the course of the game, due to the different number of units you have to experiment with the game rarely gets boring or too repetitive but given it's estimated run time of about 8 hours you're unlikely to get tired of it in that time.\n\nA lot of people take issue with the game opening with a cinematic scene and not having any more in the game and their is little voice-acting. But if you judge this game by that then you are missing out. The artwork is beautiful and it is well written if a few of the in-universe words (such as the insult "Skal") can take a while to understand.\n\nUltimatley, the game has its little imperfections, but they do not take away from this being a spectacular and original game that is definitley worth playing. A fun experience that is excellently presented and executed with a diverse cast of characters, intricate and compelling story and a solid combat system.","April 16","true","67.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

You have a few tough decisions, but in the end, the game has it's somewhat linear path and will play along while you watch. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but not everyone likes it that way.\n\nDuring the game, you will be in control of few characters and their caravans, travelling through Viking inspired lands of humans and giants... When in combat, you will choose a party of available characters and fight in turn-based map (similar to Heroes). Nice touch is when you fight in big battles and have more options before and after combat, that will affect the outcome of the battle. Anyway, after combat, you get Renown points and each character can level up (if they killed enough enemies) by spending Renown from the pool. Renown is also used for trading supplies and items.\nAside from visuals, combat is pretty much the best part of the game... It is both simple and fast, but not so easy to master, which is great.\n\nAnd now for the cons; By far, my biggest letdown in the game is its ending... It is very anticlimactic and abrupt... The whole story is nicely presented, it keeps you going and then BAM! It's over... They were obviously getting ready for the second part, but nevertheless, it left the bitter taste in the end...\nSecond bad thing would be the Renown point system (which I explained earlier mostly because of this). Anyway, since game is (except for combat) similar to choose-your-own-adventure book, you are not able to fight when you want and how much you want (or need); you have a very limited amount of Renown points. And since these are used for everything (leveling up, buying items and supplies to keep caravan alive), you need to be careful with how you spend them; and then, you level up some guy, spend a large amount of renown, and he dies in the next scene, and you can do nothing about it. Although, it is realistic to not have ability to control everything, it is still frustrating, and game should not (as they cannot) be 100% realistic...\n\nShort version;\n\nPros:\n- Absolutely beautiful visuals\n- Really, really pretty visuals... Trust me xD\n- Nice voice acting and script...\n- Story is nice and compelling for the most part\n- Combat is GREAT!\n- Music is really nice and adds to atmosphere\n- The game is pretty much choose-your-own-adventure book (if you like that)\n\nCons:\n- Game ends abruptly\n- Renown system is nice and simple, but frustrating sometimes (read up for more info xD)\n- The game is pretty much choose-your-own-adventure book (if you don't like that)\n\nAnyway, I liked this game and enjoyed most of the time I played it... I do recommend it, and I plan on playing the second part, too...","May 9","true","12.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is 1 out of 3 in a planned trilogy by the way. This is something I was not aware of a when I initially purchased the game. There you are prepared now on the good...\n\nNow please bear in mind I do not think I would be nearly as bitter about the ending if the the rest of the game had not hit on so many levels. Initially I thought the combat in the game was based on too simple of a concept but after an hour of play I realized in execution there is a great deal of depth. The simple concept by the way is that of combining atack power and life into one stat for your characters. It really flips the whole concept behind a tactically rpg on its tail and made me think through every battle (and paiiiinfully so on the Hardest Setting). While the RPG style Character Progression of your characters are an Important aspect of gameplay I was pleased to find that the actually Tactical aspects of the game are firmly in the driver seat. To me this is the highlight and the reason any fan of the genre should take the opportunity to download this game (I admit waiting for a sale myself but I would not have been disappointed if I had paid the $19.99 it's currently listed at either).\n\nThe story and experience itself is very dark one. It was clearly intended and I feel like the developers hit the nail on the head when it came to using every method and mechanic availalbe to them to create that atmosphere. Your watching this World Tear itself apart while the characters fight to hold it together. The animations, story, music, the gameplay all are all geared up to make you feel that way and were a resounding success.\n\nThe complete butchering of the end of the game really hurt and pulled down the review a notch but overall the hours (and i have far more than 10.2 that steam has me at for some reason) of greatness vastly overshadow the final few moments and bad taste I had after finishing the game for the 1st time. This game is refreshingly different from anything I have played before and would recommend it to just about anyone intersted in this genre.\n\n8/10","January 2, 2015","true","32.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Art, music & story combine to provide a haunting world that drew me in.  The combat mechanics are a genuinely fresh twist on turn-based tactics for me too.\n\nMy expectations were entirely met given the information provided on the Steam store page.  What I enjoyed most:\nLore and setting inspired by Viking mythology.\nA soundtrack I immediately wanted on my playlist.\nA great art style with plenty of 2.5D hand drawn stuff (apparently inspired by Eyvind Earle, an artist I was previously unfamiliar with).\nStory & characters that moved me in spite of how brief the game actually is.\nA unique combat mechanic that provided solid fun & challenge.\n\nThe story successfully creates a serious feeling of relentlessness, thanks to the Dredge presence & the caravan mode.  The lore mostly is on the surface with no opportunity to delve deeper into any history or such, but what's there is fun.  Character interaction is engaging through the entire game.  One thing that I find very odd is that the writing & dialogue reads like a bad translation into English.  I can't see any reason why that should be the case.\n\nI like the combat a lot.  Two of the primary stats are Armor & Strength.  Strength doubles as both Hit Points & damage dealt with normal attacks.  Armor mitigates Strength damage, but can in turn be reduced by armor-break attacks.  This puts a nice spin on the conventional experience.  There are light RPG elements as well.  Kills grant "Renown," a currency used either to level up heroes (boosting their special abilities along with one or two stats) or to purchase Supplies and/or items at markets.  You'll need Supplies to keep your caravan alive & fed as they journey across a land dotted with cities, ruins, forests & a lot of dangerous encounters.\n\nPlayer choice is encouraged in The Banner Saga & results in a variety of good or bad outcomes for your combat encounters, caravan or individual heroes.  Yes, a game in which story decisions actually can make things easier or harder!  Most of these choices seem straightforward, although one or two felt arbitrary to me, as if any choice would end up hurting somehow.  These tough moments are just part of the game & in my opinion amplify the tension, desperation & relentlessness that characterize the plot.\n\nOf three difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard) I did a playthrough on Medium & managed to nab more than half of the achievements.  It's hard to keep your caravan's morale from dipping too low!  I gave up on Hard difficulty.  Medium provided significant challenge.  I certainly had moments of frustration retrying fights after defeat, but each time changing my tactics worked out fine.\n\nThis is the first of a planned series and I eagerly await the next installment which will supposedly be available in 2015.  If you're a player like me who appreciates artsy indie games, I'd recommend this highly.  Also recommended for any player who enjoys turn-based strategy & RPGs.","July 26, 2015","true","15.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a game that's easy to learn but hard to master, which will keep you coming back for more.\n\nOver all it's a great game but it's not without it's flaws:\n\nThe hardest setting can be a tad ridiculous and demands a bit of perfection... If you're looking to just enjoy the story it's best played on the easiest setting as I found the final battle and latter half of the game a bit unbalanced in terms of difficulty... I'm sure normal mode is equally as challenging as I found hard almost impossible to complete near the end.\n\nThe story is also a bit long and there should of been a way to skip the boring walking segments but I suppose it's all part of the artistic style that's supposed to emerse you in the game.\n\nThe leveling and reward system needs a bit of tweaking... I don't really enjoy how each character get's stronger based on their individual amount of kills... It kind of pigeon holes you in to using a single set up the entire game. Using a single strategy might not always work out in certain fights which can leave you kind of gimped in the late game.\n\n7 / 10","January 16, 2015","true","9.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/237990/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","We’ve seen the world coming to an end many times now. Oftentimes it’s used as a meaningless crutch in order to get things going, to have an artificial reason as to why you have to kill a bunch of enemies. But there are stories that make the end of the world compelling yet again. Because there is something inexplicably fascinating about such a cataclysmic event. The Banner Saga makes the case for the latter. It creates an apocalyptic scenario and thrusts you directly into it. And it’s utterly brutal and unapologetic about it. Your actions have the power to save lives. More often than not, things will go wrong. People will die and the world may yet end no matter what you do. It’s a bleak proposition and yet so incredibly motivating.\n\nThe Banner Saga is based on Viking mythology and takes place across a vast Nordic land inhabited by humans and varl. The varl are horned, giant-like creatures that were created by the gods. Humans and varl were bitter enemies for ages until the gods grew tired of it and created the dredge, monolithic stone creatures that have a particular thirst for destruction. The two warring races had to unite and push back the dredge into the far reaches of the northernmost wastes. A tenuous peace has lasted since. But the dredge are back in greater numbers than ever and they are mowing down everything and everyone in their path. But the real problem is – the dredge are on the move because they are fleeing an unknown darkness intent on engulfing the entire world. The lore isn’t particularly original or elaborate, but it is really intriguing.\n\nAs the player, you will be controlling two separate caravans making their way across the lands. One is a varl expedition of kings and princes in the middle of human/varl peace negotiations trying to make their way to the varl capital whereas the other is a human group running to save their bare lives from the outpouring of bloodthirsty dredge. The goal is to survive. You will endure many hardships during your travels and you will have a direct impact on the outcome. Many choices will present themselves to you and the outcome will rarely be clear. You will face certain repercussions of your choices further down the line. Almost all of them are equally compelling and will directly influence who joins you, who lives, who dies and the overall state of your caravan. Other games tell you of hardships, The Banner Saga throws you right in the middle of it so as to feel the brunt of it on your shoulders.\n\nThe production values will leave you in awe, wondering how is it possible that this game was made by a three-person team. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous, truly some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Complimented by a superb soundtrack consisting of Viking-inspired tracks, the game manages to create an intensely thick atmosphere, one of beauty drowned in misery and despair. The importance that these elements have on the game and the overall experience cannot be overstated. Throughout the game, there are these calm scenes in which you just observe your caravan slowly moving through the lands and it’s so inexplicably memorable.\n\nWhen it comes to the actual gameplay, apart from the continual decision-making, the big star here is the turn-based combat system. I have played a rather large number of both turn-based strategy games and turn-based RPG’s and I have never come across a combat system quite like this one. What’s most interesting about is that strength and health are the same stat so as a unit loses more and more health, it becomes more and more useless. However, the armor stat is equally important because even if your unit is more powerful than the enemy unit, it won’t deal much damage until you take the armor down. And this is then complicated further because you can either choose to deal armor damage or health damage. Also, all the different units have different special abilities. All of this creates a highly tactical combat system which really makes you think about how you approach the battle.\n\nWhen it comes to shortcomings, the first thing that comes to mind is small enemy variety. Sometimes you’ll fight humans or varl, but mostly the dredge will be your opponents and it would have been nice if they had more unit types. Also, considering that it’s a 2D game, the loading times are unusually long. The game will also leave you wanting more once it ends which you may see as a negative as you’ll want to continue the story right away instead of waiting for the next chapter. However, this is offset by a relatively high replay value. A second playthrough will surely turn out completely different than the first.\n\nThe Banner Saga is a fantastic game which will place the heavy burden of leadership and responsibility on your shoulders. It will lead you through a beautiful yet bleak world and it will provide a challenge in both its hard choices and tough combat. And it will be a journey to remember.\n\n9 OUT OF 10 (SUPERB)","August 19, 2014","true","21.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

When resting at villages/cities or when the caravan is moving events pop up giving you multiple choices, often difficult ones as either your caravan, your integrity as it's leader or the people in the surrounding area may suffer from your choice (like your supplies are low - steal from these peasants or pass by letting clansmen in your caravan starve?)\n+ The combat situations you are getting into are reflected in the actual combat fields you are fighting on (you are not randomly thrown into some generic landscapes; the areas are visibly designed accordingly to how they were previously described, and have fitting assets like buildings, corpses or passive fighters of all the participating factions observing the events).\n\n~ Final boss battle can be frustratingly hard (at least on any other difficulty than "Easy")\n~ Story is not finished. It was promising as long as it lasted, but ended rather abruptly, I didn't expect the game to end where it did. I guess this is where the line "Saga" comes into play. Stoic is apparently outlining or already working on the sequel. If you expect a conclusive story from this single installment you will be disappointed.\n~ There is a feeling of deep lore. There is a big world map, and literally any place, landmark and terrain formation you can click at to get a description of it's history or naming or whatever. This alone deserves some respect in my opinion. But not all - perhaps naturally - is used in any gameplay-related way. The worldmap itself only serves as an overview as to where you are, and where you will be going, to get an understanding of your journey. You can very well never look at the map and still get along.\n\n- Only very few voice acting, and never during character dialogues (the launch trailer falsely suggests there to be more).\n- Hostile AI is occassionally doing some strange moves, sometimes hurting their own combatants more than yours.\n- No idea if it's me but sometimes the game glitched a bit. I was clicking around the combat options of one of my fighters and somehow the game ended the turn of that fighter despite me never wanting to do that. In one occasion I noticed my fighter was teleported on another combat field too. It didn't happen >that< often, but often enough for me to notice, and in some instances it prevented me from finishing some combats as I had hoped to do.\n- Special moves of the fighters are sometimes a bit difficult to understand. A full explanation you can only look up before a battle. When in battle there is only a reduced description which sometimes lacks important details. So you either need to learn these moves beforehand (there are training battles in cities/villages and when resting with your caravan) or do trial and error (there is some room of error as long as you aren't a perfectionist, fighting on "Hard" or on "Normal" against the final boss). This could possibly have been made easier by allowing you to look up the full character profiles (and special move descriptions) during combat too.","June 15, 2014","true","21.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Hell yeah, that's what I thought, and believe me, this alone is worth the 5 bucks you can spend in sales. (and you shouldn't pay MUCH more.)\nThe Banner Saga is a turnbased RPG with adventure elements. Think of it like a mixture between The Walking Dead or Oregan Trail, with the fighting system of Wasteland 2 or Heroes of Might and Magic. The main aspect of the game is to get your caravan to a safe point, travel through the land, and while traveling, ensure you survive, don't starve and keep your morale up. Sounds boring? I tell you, it's not! Prepare to meet characters you won't forget, make super tough decisions with very hefty consequences, that make you want to restart the whole game (I seriously once did, lol).\nThe fighting has some cool unique features, and, depending on the difficulty you chose, can be freaking hard. Another good feature though: Losing a fight doesn't simply get you to a gameover-screen, instead you have to live with that loss and it's consequences. Your comrades could die (yes, there is permadeath), your caravan could lose many people, and so on. Every choice in this game, makes a big impact.\nNow to the negative sides of this game. Unfortunatly, you can complete the game in around 4 hours, which is okay if you want to re-run it, but I would have preferred a longer story. (remember, don't pay more than 10 bucks!)\nFurthermore, there is no free saving, it all happens through checkpoints, which sometimes are a bit annoying and misplaced. Lastly, and that's really something I wished they would have changed, there is some brilliant voice acting in the game, only problem is, it only appears very rarely. Most dialogues between the main characters are not voiced at all, and that takes away something I feel.\n\nBut, if you are looking for a game with stunning visuals (oh god, does this game look good), a neat story, cool fighting system, impactful decisions and a really good soundtrack, this is the game for you.","December 29, 2014","true","9.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The game will run on even the shakiest toaster and will run a skilled player around 10-12 hours for their first time through. Subsequent playthroughs are tantalizing, the desire to see if you can remedy past failures and save those whom you lost is strong by the end of the game.\n\nHighly recommended.","January 15, 2014","true","20.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dysp_loops/recommended/237990/","dysp_loops","Dysp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dysp_loops/","239 products in account","I enjoyed the game quite a bit. To start off one playthough takes about 10 hours.\n\nSince the game is fairly different than most games on the whole, I figured it'd be easier to point out the similarities it may have with some established games. The game's a little bit like:\n\nFire Emblem -  grid based combat, but individual unit turn-based with a strength as hp mechanic and armor -- you can try out The Banner Saga: Factions, the corresponding free multiplayer game to try the combat,\n\nOregon Trail - you travel along a fairly linear path making decisions as you go with a caravan nonetheless,\n\nDragon Age - unlike Fire Emblem series where if you lose a character in combat, you lose him/her in the campaign, in TBS you can only lose characters through decisions you make out of combat -- falling in combat will only injure a unit for the next fight, unless you rest at camp or have enough time pass to heal the injuries,\n\nKing of Dragon Pass - the decision system is similar and you will be given chances to wage war, however you only control the army by choosing one command, such as Charge, Formation, Defend, etc. which then prompts a regular combat scenario,\n\n---\n\nThe campaign affects combat in several main ways. Probably most importantly, it affects who you will be able to play as in combat and which encounters will be combat encounters or bypassed through resolution or avoidance. You can add new characters to your party or even accidentally, or purposefully, kill off members of your team.\n\nNext,  your caravan morale affects how much willpower your team has starting the match. Willpower allows characters to use their special abilities, deal extra armor break or damage, and to move further in a single turn. If your caravan morale is low, your team will start fights with less than normal willpower, but if they start with high morale, they will receive bonus morale.\n\nLastly, from making some decisions, you can gain reknown (the currency used to level up units and to buy equippment and supplies -- supplies are used to feed your whole caravan and maintain morale).\n\n---\n\nStrengths:\nAs you'll see stated in most any other review, TBS is a gorgeous game. The combat is equally good and quite strategic.\n\nThe vast and detailed world map shows the scope of the game's world in the classic Tolkien fashion.\n\nThe characters and decisions are very impactful. You can lose or gain key characters (and their equipment) based on your decisions. Some decisions will have immediate results, while others may show up long after you've made them.\n\nWeakness:\nThe biggest issue I had with the game is that it felt lopsided on the decision system. If you made a series of a few bad decisions, you wound up always struggling to get supplies, and on the flipside, if you make a series of good decisions, you have a fairly easy time. This is because all of the systems seem to compound on eachother. I preferred to be struggling, because it kept the tension of survival prominent.\n\nI enjoyed the overall structure of the story and the many decisions I had to make along the way, however the dialogue sometimes was poorly phrased, such as by using modern colloquial slurs. Some characters would use lore-based expressions, while others frequently sounded like they were from the current era.\n\nThis was an odd issue. Some character and city names I did not know how to pronounce, and so I didn't commit many characters and places to memory.\n\nLastly, you're always moving forward, from point A to point B. Once you leave camp or town you continue back on your journey. Instead of directly choosing your destination, you're sent in the general direction the story tells you to go, able to take detours or backtrack only when an event decision occurs.\n\n---\nOn Combat:\nIf you are not familiar with The Banner Saga's combat, I could see it being a fairly difficult game, as common strategic thought is to kill off units rather than leave them maimed and on the board. With TBS's turn-based system, one character takes a turn then control passes to the opponent to move one character. The order of character movement is established before combat and can be changed only by a few special characters once in combat. Although it might seem odd at first, this system requires much more strategy than just going from one side of the board to the other wiping out all enemy units. Each time you kill off an enemy unit, you are giving the opponent an advantage, slight or large dependent on the difference between both sides' total units.\n\nI find TBS's combat system to be a good addition to turn-based strategy family and prefer it to most other turn-based game systems.\n\nWhat I'd like to have seen:\nSkirmish mode - a mode to fight on all the different maps vs the AI using characters unlocked through the story-mode,\n\nCharacters & Maps - story characters/classes added to The Banner Saga: Factions (the multiplayer version of the game);\n\nMultiplayer - The Banner Saga: Factions accessible in-game from TBS's client; I think leaving the two games separate can cause some confusion for players, some may only know about one version and not the other;","January 15, 2014","true","31.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

This gave the enemy a free turn every time his move came up.\n\nWhat I should have done is let him die, and this drives me nuts, cause any game mechanic that involves "sacrificing" a player just so you don't give the opponent an advantage is dumb, and illogical.","January 22, 2014","false","4.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

However in Banner Saga, it is one faction then the other faction, regardless of how many soldiers/characters are left. What this equals out to is that fights are brutally rough when trying to take out single tough enemies. More that that it feels so utterly non-sensical that if you fought well, and had all four/five/six characters, and your enemy has one left, that one will get to act four/five/six times more often then anyone of your characters.\n\nThe whole concept is confusing if you think about it too much, but more than that, characters you like to use, are used less often in relation to the enemy in most fights, and they are more likely to die, if they catch a lone opponents ire, because that enemy can attack your one character four/five/six times before you can get them out of danger.","September 17, 2015","false","13.1"," 26 of 49 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","26","49","0","0"

That is how familiar I am with this game at the time of this review.\n\nLet me say this first: the game is visually stunning. Every single environment, character, and frame of animation has an astonishing hand-drawn/painted feel to it. It seems as though they used a method of rotoscoping to bring the characters' motions to life, and it looks pretty damn impressive. Also, the score is brilliant. The song "Onward" is what gave me the final push towards picking up the soundtrack.\nAlright, so it looks and sounds nice, but what about the most important aspects: gameplay and story? For the most part, gameplay is top notch. Their unique spin on the turn-based genre is fairly hit or miss; you either love it or hate it. That stems from the fact that your fighters' health also determine their damage output. I personally found it very interesting and that it added an extra layer of strategy to each turn. It's all about calculating risks and how to combine each warrior's playstyle to create one combined force.\nMy first main issue (of two) is what happens in between combat. The caravan sequences, despite being pretty, are pretty monotonous. They only serve as the "resource management" portion of the game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I loved making decisions along the journey, and this is the first game I've played that actually has logical ways to handle each solution (not just a "good", a "bad", and a "wrong" choice), but some of the consequences that came from those actions were pretty unfair. I think it's fair to have someone's decisions mean life or death for some party members, but it almost seems like the odds are stacked against you in many cases. A second playthrough might remedy this, but I didn't even know you could have certain party members with you all the way to the end; it seemed like there was a point where they had to die, but I guess not. Also, using the same resource to buy both supplies and level-ups/equipment for your fighters seems like an interesting idea, but it falls flat. You either starve your caravan or fight battles with weak warriors.\nThe story is both cliché and original. The setting, characters, and ideas make it fresh, but some of the creative decisions made (like referring to something evil as "the Darkness") make it seem like a slight retread of past ideas. Despite this, the world and its inhabitants are interesting, and that to me is more important. The viking/Scandinavian influences fit very well and gave the game (for me) an aspect of intrigue due to very few other games doing something similar. I seem to like the leader characters/father figures the most when it comes to narratives, so I naturally grew fond of Rook and his daughter Alette. I also enjoyed having Iver, Hakon, and Mogr around, all three of them being varl (giant horned men).\nMy second main issue comes with the conclusion of the game. The length is decent, but it leaves so many plotlines unresolved that it hurts. I understand that Stoic Studio plans on adding on to this series and making it a trilogy, but some of the immediate questions/conflicts aren't touched on at all. The ending feels like a midseason finale rather than a season finale. I'll be happier once they actually do release the next chapter, but I was slightly disappointed. Even though I'm not into JRPGs, I am familiar with how long they are. I was hoping for something along those lines; a truly epic saga told in one tale. Unfortunately, this game is part of a trilogy and it knows it.\n\nDespite me complaining about it for the past paragraph, I can't wait to see what happens next. If you are a fan of turn-based strategy, Norse mythology (kind of), games with beautiful art styles, or you're just really in the mood for something that allows you to make decisions with real consequences, you really can't pass this one up.\nPROS\nGorgeous visuals/music\nCompelling narrative\nEngaging strategy gameplay\nInteresting setting/characters\nCONS\nInconclusive ending\nSlightly tedious caravan/resource management\n\nOverall: 8.5/10","August 12, 2014","true","29.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

There are dozens of characters, all with compelling personalities and motivations, and while you only take full control of a couple of them, the story sections are filled with so much thoughtful dialogue you will end up relating to just about everybody. But even more than that is the world they find themselves in. Drawing largely from norse mythology while adding a few twists of it's own, The Banner Saga shows us a land rich in narrative and life. The first time the map opened up I spent the better part of an hour exploring and reading and understanding it all- it's just that well thought out. You lead your band of warriors and clansmen through hostile lands, trying to unearth the secrets of the most recent crisis. The sun has stopped, the gods are dead, new behemoths loom large, and hordes of stone-skinned warriors threaten to destroy everything. The world of The Banner Saga almost gives the feeling of the real world- much bigger than your individual experience, yet you still eke out your own path and do what you can to help. Whether you help yourself or the world at large is your choice.\n\nNow this game has a lot of moral choices in it. There's no morality system (thank god), but very frequently you will be choosing between many tough decisions to make. Almost everything counts, too. If you ever wondered what leading a large group of people in tough times feels like, I think this game gives a very flavorful taste of that. Definitely not something to be missed, if only for that experience.\n\nI've already gone on a while- I leave the sound and art direction for the interested player to look into. Needless to say both are beautiful and compelling. I can't recommend this game highly enough. It delivers on several fronts- gameplay, story, music, art direction- this game has it all. If you happen to dislike the game in one of those areas, you're in luck, because there are three more to please you.","October 6, 2014","true","60.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Is it a perfect game? No, but I still love it.\n\nLittle needs to be said about the striking graphics, which seem lifted directly from a high-budget animated feature, so this review focuses mainly on gameplay. The battle sequences are what initially drew me to the game, in part because I prefer turn-based strategies to RTS. Elements of the battles remind me of the "Tactics" games (Ogre Tactics, Final Fantasy Tactics, etc.), which is a good thing. The system is carefully thought out, and a few bad decisions can see a character knocked out and unable to fight for one or more in-game days. This does create some potential for replayability, as a later run through would allow you to make different choices, but at this point, replayability is not something I see as a strength in the game. Why? That has to do with what happens outside the battles.\n\nUnsurprisingly, one must consider resources, which is standard fare in a TBS. But in the dialogues that occur, one's choices can mean losing characters, both individuals and groups. More so than most other games, there is a sense of permanence in these decisions, which brings to mind one of the strongest elements of this game: storytelling.\n\nAlthough the pacing often seems very slow—particularly when walking from one area to another—the story that unfolds is brilliant. On many occasions I found myself wishing The Banner Saga was a feature film so that I could just sit back and watch it happen.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game to fans of strategy games, with the caveat that those who prefer twitchy RTS games will probably find this too slow paced. For those new to strategy games, it may still be worth it, if only to enjoy the beautiful graphics and compelling storyline.\n\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nAudio: 9/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nReplayability: 6/10\n\nOverall: 9/10","October 12, 2014","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is brutal, makes you feel bad everytime you see the effects of your decisions. Because they matter. Because the world is tough and if you fail as a leader, your people die. Because if you decide that those resisting farmers shoudl give you their food so your clan can survive, you will have to kill them. This is Banner Saga, and it is awesome!\n\nI am not normally the one to play story-driven games, but this one had me at the first choice to make. The combat system is refreshing enough to make it feel your tactic matters. Someone that got hit a lot, can't hti back this hard, someone withotu armour left, gets hit harder as well. Pretty logical, but amazing how it surprised me with these mechanics I have never encountered in any game so far.\n\nBy the way, if you are not the type for story-games, try out Banner Saga: Factions, it is free to play and features the same classes and battles as Banner Saga, but in a PvP-environment, where you fight against other leaders.\n\n9/10 just because there is a small bit of potential left.

The game sets the pace with impressive animated cutscene reminiscent of the 1978 animated LOTR film/animated Shakespeare, though, sadly, fails to follow up with similar quality in much of the later content. The static animation is of a high quality, but I feel that the storyline and game as a whole suffered as a result of the sparsity of such talented animation. Admittedly, this may have been due to budget restrictions - as this game is said to be the first installment of a trilogy, fans will undoubtedly be able to expect a more polished, invested experience from the upcoming episodes on account of the financial success of Stoic studios' initial sales.\n\nThe tactical gameplay has a challenging learning curve, though a tutorial introduces the player to the basics and a 'training' mode will help uncertain players get to grips with the system in short order. If you wish to try it out before purchasing the game, you can play an online FTP version of the battle system called 'The Banner Saga: Factions'. However, the compelling OST, along with a plot-driven investment in the outcome of each engagement, ensures that the single-player product has a (superior, IMHO) mystique of its own.\n\nMy only reservation concerning this otherwise well-executed game is the lack of an inherent multiplayer capacity. The FTP online version is evidently designed to satisfy this purpose, though I was disappointed that purchasing the game did not offer any kind of bonus or incentive to get involved with the FTP multiplayer component.\n\nOverall, though, The Banner Saga is illuminated by an absorbing narrative set within an atmospheric and enchanting environment, supported by the foundation of a solid tactical game mechanic.","June 28, 2014","true","134.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I learned to live with my regrets, learned to cope with them and keep going; by far, the best thing the creators of the game could have done was not have a savegame feature. You live with the consequences of your choices - and more often than not, there's always a second side to the story.\n\nThe story ended just as it had begun to make a small portion of sense, though by asking more questions than answering them. I went back to the title screen and was about to hit "Restart" when a message popped up - "If you restart the game, all your previous decisions will be overwritten". I stopped. Yes, I can go back and play the game and know what to expect now, and probably make a lot less of a fool of myself by making better decisions. But then, it wouldn't be the experience it was meant to be. The experience of putting you in a world that is dying, possibly already dead, where your only hope is to survive; to save a few lives on the way is a bonus, but hard decisions will need to be made. Hard decisions that will stick with you, long after you've finished playing the game.\n\nSo I didn't restart it, and my ill-conceived decisions are going to sit there until Chapter 2, where I can relive them again. And I will miss some characters dearly, while others I will not bat an eyelid to. This is what a great game is meant to encourage. In a bleak world where the hopelesness and fear seem to be the only constant, where even mountains can be torn asunder, you cling on to the fact that though you may have sacrificed a few men, you survived. And that's all that matters.\n\nBecause don't you know, the Gods are dead?","January 27, 2014","true","17.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitsuneKelso/recommended/237990/","KitsuneKelso","Kelso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitsuneKelso/","1591 products in account","I have now completed the game twice and feel like I can properly review the experience. Starting off, this is a very nice change of pace from the regular game, mixing a blend of choose-your-own-adventure with some turn-based combat. Add to that a beautiful artstyle and a superb soundtrack and you get a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end.\n\nThe first playthrough was definitely the most memorable as each choice you are presented provides a provocative and ethical dilemma that needs to be solved, often pitting you against a range of really bad choices where there's no real "good" outcome to any of them. The feeling of hopelessness and desperation oozes from every minute you play it, and it truly feels like you are the last hope and salvation of your entire caravan of people and fighters. On the second playthrough, things are a little less engaging, as you start to realise that some of the choices you can make through the journey are somewhat arbitrary and you end up running into most encounters and situations no matter what choice you make along the road. You are also aware of some of the more important events and can easily avoid them by, for instance, refusing to allow certain characters to join your party along the way.\n\nThe combat is fairly well balanced throughout the game and often provides a nice challenge even on Normal difficulty. There are portions of the game where you are part of a smaller battle sequence where a regular turn-based fight can be extended into a second round, but you are almost always at such a severe disadvantage when you launch a second round that I ended up only attempting it a single time, getting my ♥♥♥♥ handed to me, and then staying away from them for the rest of the experience.\n\nHere I can take the time to address one of the problems with the game, being the isometric perspective of the battles. At times it can become very cluttered when a lot of allies and enemies are placed in squares next to each other, making targeting of enemies and using abilities somewhat annoying at times. The option to turn the camera, so to say, would have helped here, allowing for easier battle management. However, this could be seen as part of the design, making the heat of battle seem more confusing for the commander.\n\nThis following paragraph is somewhat of a spoiler, but not a massive one, so skip to the next one if you want to experience everything for yourself: The very final battle (and the preparation leading up to it as well) is a very stiff challenge, and if you have been unlucky or have been spreading out your experience points and currency too much, you might not even be able to finish the game. On both my playthroughs, the final fight took a number of attempts to finish, and me winning mostly just comes down to being lucky in the rounds that I won on. The fight itself is very unfair at times and can leave you very frustrated. However, as it is the last fight in the game, the stiff challenge is somewhat appropriate, but it could be more fairly balanced. Seeing as you could possibly end up in a situation where the entire sequence becomes impossible, ruining a perhaps 12-hour game for a player and forcing them to restart or jump back to a previous point, I can understand that a lot of players are really frustrated at this part.\n\nThe game also ends rather abruptly, but with a nice climax in the story. I can only imagine that this is because the developers are working in an episodic format and I have heard people mentioning that this is supposed to be the first part in a three part story, which would make perfect sense with the way the story is formatted. Overall, the story is engaging and you truly want to see the characters come through it.\n\nAll in all, I strongly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good story-driven game with an emphasis on turn-based combat. If you're a fan of the old choose-your-own-adventure type games and books, this is also very appropriate for you. The beautiful artwork and soundtrack should also peak your interest, and if you're more interested in the story, the visuals, and the sound, you could turn down the difficulty to Easy and just enjoy the ride. You won't regret it. :)","January 29, 2014","true","19.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game sets the pace with impressive animated cutscene reminiscent of the 1978 animated LOTR film/animated Shakespeare, though, sadly, fails to follow up with similar quality in much of the later content. The static animation is of a high quality, but I feel that the storyline and game as a whole suffered as a result of the sparsity of such talented animation. Admittedly, this may have been due to budget restrictions - as this game is said to be the first installment of a trilogy, fans will undoubtedly be able to expect a more polished, invested experience from the upcoming episodes on account of the financial success of Stoic studios' initial sales.\n\nThe tactical gameplay has a challenging learning curve, though a tutorial introduces the player to the basics and a 'training' mode will help uncertain players get to grips with the system in short order. If you wish to try it out before purchasing the game, you can play an online FTP version of the battle system called 'The Banner Saga: Factions'. However, the compelling OST, along with a plot-driven investment in the outcome of each engagement, ensures that the single-player product has a (superior, IMHO) mystique of its own.\n\nMy only reservation concerning this otherwise well-executed game is the lack of an inherent multiplayer capacity. The FTP online version is evidently designed to satisfy this purpose, though I was disappointed that purchasing the game did not offer any kind of bonus or incentive to get involved with the FTP multiplayer component.\n\nOverall, though, The Banner Saga is illuminated by an absorbing narrative set within an atmospheric and enchanting environment, supported by the foundation of a solid tactical game mechanic.","June 28, 2014","true","134.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Because of these two attributes I've finished the game twice (on normal and hard difficulty). The game is divided into two things: the journey with strategic aspects and tactical turn-based battles.\n\nThe journey strategic-wise is simplistic and bad. The whole morale-supplies-renown management, while quite interesting, is broken. I don't want to spoil it to you, dear player, but let's say that one thing is much, MUCH more important than the other. What I have to add is how strong narrative is. Characters are likable. Choices don't leave a lot to be desired (very rarely I was left with only unsatisfying dialogue options). Beware of outcomes of your choices though - they are merciless!\n\nThe tactical turn-based battles are freaking good. The mechanic of initiative in this game is original and you have to get used to it (newbies cry a lot about it). All statistics are useful. Abilities are varied and most of them are VERY satisfying when used. The game doesn't give you much freedom with building your characters which is (just a little) disappointing. The battles have almost no luck factor. No critical hits or random points of damage but you have certain % to hit (although it appears only if enemy has higher defense than your strength, nothing bad).\n\nGraphically this game is great. A lot of backgrounds are similar to each other but some are simply beautiful. What you see on the screenshots is what you get. And that's good because artistic look of the game is one of the reasons I decided to buy this game.\n\nMusic is diverse. In my case I was tired of listening to some types of music (Menhir ones) but others were pleasant. Battle music is what I like in this game.\n\nBottom line, the game is linear, focused on story telling and choice making, has oversimplistic strategy elements. In my opinion it's amazing looking, decent sounding and has very good tactical elements. 7/10\n\nP.S.: This game has checkpoint system. You can't save whenever you want. It's not a big problem though because it saves quite frequently.","July 25, 2014","true","34.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Banner Saga is an epic tale with male and female heroic characters based on Viking themes and Nordic mythology where your choices affect the course of events in the story so you have to make those choices carefully. You are going to choose your combat group, add skill booster items to your characters, add travellers/clansmen/warriors/varls to your caravan, control the food supply while travelling in harsh conditions, balance the morale of the people, etc. Briefly, you are going to learn how to be a leader in difficult times. (if you practice your play in normal mode first, it's likely for you to win the combats in hard mode later)\n\nDialogue parts are simple, where you only see a brief animation of the active character however the simplicity doesn't lower the quality of the game, vice versa, every visual part of this 2D game are done by hand and Arnie Jorgensen achieved a great job on illustrating the beautiful characters and the setting.\n\nThe music is totally enchanting. The fully orchestrated score was written by Austin Wintory, the composer of the soundtrack of Journey. It features Malukah, Peter Hollens, Johann Sigurdarson and Taylor Davis as soloists. You can buy the soundtrack as an extra.\n\nI always support the idea of donating money to indie game companies for their basic necessities and buying a legit copy of the game however the only part I dislike about The Banner Saga is the price of 25$ which I find too much.","February 10, 2014","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let these guys into your caravan? Trust the helmeted-guy over the crazy-looking one? Send out your damage tank, leaving your archers exposed?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/recommended/237990/","LordWeh","Lord Weh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/","344 products in account","The Banner saga is a light roleplaying game which fuses several elements to create an epic norse-inspired fantasy story about several groups struggling to survive during the end of their world. The experience is streamlined, with the roleplaying and strategy elements being fairly minimal but highly effective. This is a game where the focus is on the setting and the story, it stays away from being a grand cinematic experience and instead feels more like a personal struggle.\n\nGameplay varies between side-scrolling travel as you see your caravan moving along the countryside, zoomed in static screens of visiting cities / landmarks, and isometric combat. Whilst travelling you must manage supplies in a style similar to Oregon Trail, stocking up between towns, whilst events crop up that break up the journey and throw your plans awry. Once in town / landmark locations you can choose between visiting certain characters or locations (to engage in dialogue, events and decision-making), stocking up on items and supplies at a market, training or resting.\n\nOnce you enter into a combat situation it becomes an isometric turn-based affair. The combat is a little tricky to learn to start with (or at least I found it to be), but after a couple of fights you start to get acquainted with its intricacies. I’ve seen a number of complaints related to how the combat was too easy or too difficult (although there is a difficulty slider that can be adjusted at any time), and mention of certain tactics that are far more effective than others, but overall I found it relatively quick and fun. It’s interesting enough as a side-distraction from the story (or enhancing certain key events), but it’s not the main meat of the game.\n\nSomething I found very refreshing was the fact that several characters who felt important to the story died during events and certain combat scenarios in my play-through. Being used to games like Mass Effect and so-on, where characters will only die during certain rare events that almost feel telegraphed, the contrast was welcome. I’ve heard people complain that you could spend time and effort levelling these characters up and investing resources on them only for them to die, but personally I found the threat of losing people thrilling and enjoyable, adding a sense of danger to the world and considerably heightening the tension during my journey.\n\nThere is almost no voice-over work, although what little there is works well to help set the scene. The majority of the game is text, which gives the game a slower, more considered pace (a good thing, in my opinion) and I felt it lent a narrative, novel-like feel (although it is light in descriptive text compared to something like Planescape: Torment).\n\nThe art is absolutely gorgeous, travelling across the landscape is a treat in and of itself, I thoroughly enjoyed watching my caravan crawl on to new vistas, new towns and landmarks. A few of the story twists and surprises are beautifully rendered in the art style, some whilst travelling whilst others are still scenes with text overlaid on the screen, a cost-effective but evocative way of displaying these events.\n\nThere is a map which is, mechanically at least, fairly useless, but I recommend not overlooking it. It’s beautifully drawn and each element on the map is clickable giving you a little background information on the world and its history. It helps you understand the scale of the distances you’re travelling, although I felt it could have benefitted from some markers to show where you’ve been, how far the next town is and so on.\n\nWhilst this is the first chapter in a planned trilogy, the story does reach a conclusion of sorts here, although there are still many unanswered questions and a few important events are left hanging. But don’t let that put you off, there’s enough here that it feels like an interesting and valid story in its own right.\n\nI got about 15 hours from a single play-through, although I suspect it could be done in 8 – 10 if you’re really good at the combat sections (or set it to easy) or manage to skip certain events. Overall, I’d highly recommend it, I found it very rewarding and interesting and I'm eagerly awaiting the second chapter. It is very slow, but engaging, and if you don’t mind spending your time reading through a game instead of watching flashy cinematics, you’ll find this a unique and satisfying experience.","January 22, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Calling it RPG with turn based combat can be a bit misleading. You don't create your character and have little impact on how the characters you control progress. Instead you will be taking control of different characters throughout the story. It is an interesting approach to the storytelling and it works really well.\n\nThe gameplay is really solid. The combat has enough deapth for my taste though it is not good enough to play it just for that reason (you should try free multiplayer Banner Saga: Factions though!) but it complements the story really well. While the story is on rails and you won't be able to choose were to go. There are many tough decisions on the way you will have to make which will have repercusions in the game. Some are small and some can kill key characters. While the game always leads to the same end, the game feels very organic.\n\nThe plot isn't particulary brillaint but great characters, engaging choices, stellar atmosphere, artsyle and soundtrack make it a good story. Just keep in mind it is a first chapter in the "Saga" so while the game has nice arc and culmination, many questions will remain unanswered. Many people complain about the ending but I thought the game ended on a strong note.","December 25, 2014","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Banner Saga can be summed up with a few simple words, impacting RPG, challenging Combat for the one that seeks it, and strategic group management. The game takes inspiration from Nordic and Slavic mythology to form a whole new fantasy world were mankind struggle to live side by side with large human like Varls.  You will during the game follow a group of survivors that try to flee the struggles of war. It is an interesting world were even as the whole world is at war, people find small things to argue about. The artwork and music inside the game is masterful, everything is hand drawn and I for one often stuck around some areas a bit longer to just look at the background while listening to amazing soundtracks. The concept of the game is split into two phases, the roleplaying world and the battlefield. in the first one you follow a panning caravan of people as they progress the world while in the combat phase it turns into turn based combat with a very interesting health/armor system that will require you to find the best possible tactic to defeat your enemy.\n\nThis is the first game in a planned series of three and it will leave you with a rather impacting cliffhanger but it also leaves you wanting more. With all the decision making inside the game the replay worth is massive, there are tons of branching stories that will challenge you to progress the story in your own way, some decisions may seem good at the beginning, but might end up getting you all killed. I recommend this game for its immerse and original story, and the strategic and tactical turn based combat.","December 21, 2014","true","30.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Visually unique by its drawn artwork and backed by an amazing soundtrack makes most scenes quite interesting. While it might seem boring to watch a caravan slowly churn to the next location or waiting for the next event. I mostly just found myself drawn in. My biggest complaint, which isn't even a big one to me, is I wished more dialogue was voiced. 99% of all dialogue is text, which is fine for me to read but I'd certainly be down for Ubin (the narrator) talking more. The voice work that is there is very well done, just used sparingly.\n\nThe gameplay itself is mostly broken down into two segments, the combat itself and moving around the world. Traveling has very little options on "where to go", but some events allow for options. The system works by having renown (currency used to upgrade heroes and buy items/supplies) balanced between having enough food to not starve, but still upgrade units. Combat can stress this because having people get injured requires rest, which takes a day of supplies to do.\nUltimately it works fairly well but any nags I would have end up being drowned out by me enjoying the overall experience. It does become fairly difficult, and that was just on normal. But I bet if I replayed it I would have less issues, but I'm willing to bet hard difficulty would be a challenege.\n\nI would definetly reccomend anyone to play this game if you enjoy turn based combat games (kings bounty, might/magic, etc) or someone who just enjoys a good world to sink yourself into.\n\nFor whats basically a 3 man made game for ~700k. I am quite content with what was released from my original backing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AurelieNix/recommended/237990/","AurelieNix","Nixieofthemillpond","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AurelieNix/","99 products in account","The Banner Saga is quite the story, actually, most of the game is just that, story, history, dialogue, choices and characters that interact with one another. A Viking themed inspired game, The Banner Saga is heavily inspired by Kay Neilsen’s art as well as John Hench’s art on Disney’s The Sleeping Beauty (my favorite Disney, as a matter of fact, because it’s all so god damn gorgeous.) The story revolves around the return of a great evil, the Dredge, and Bellower, an invincible boss ♥♥♥ Dredge. The game has you play two groups of people/armies, as the both journey through the land, running away from the Dredge, running to it, or just running. The game, although heavily focused on story, having you read through quite a lot of text and dialogue, remains very interactive. As you Journey, you have to make sure to care for your caravan, the people in it, the rations of food, and who you choose to or not let join your group. The environment, the world, the look of Banner Saga was so very beautiful that I couldn’t stop myself from taking far too many screenshots, and I’m not sure what I’ll do with all of them.\n\nThe gameplay of Banner Saga is a turn based, strategic kind of battle system. Each of your character has a specific class and/or set of abilities, which you can level up and strengthen as they are used in your battles, the highest level is 10, and I originally though that was a bit limiting, but it turned out not to be limiting at all, as this turned out to be a shorter game than I expected. Elves, dwarves, orcs, humans, your basic and adored fantasy stuff, accompanied with an absolutely wonderful and immersive orchestrated soundtrack by the Dallas Wind Symphony and written by the great Austin Wintory, along with a lot of other musicians I quite frankly want to bow down to.\n\nThe Banner Saga was a great story. As a bookworm, and avid gamer, it took some of my favorite things, the look of Sleeping Beauty, stories, reading, fantasy and a really great turn based system that I think continues to be grossly underrated, and made something quite frankly, absolutely beautiful. I only wish that the game had been a tad longer, as the ending took me by surprise and left me dissatisfied, I wanted more. The replay value of the game I had yet to test, but I have no doubt that I would very much enjoy this game another time.\n\nThere’s something I’d like to take the time to dive a little deeper into, actually:\n\nThe Female Characters of The Banner Saga; There were a lot of things that I noticed happening or being said in the game that pleased me. In one the groups that you follow/lead there is Alette. Established as an amazing archer, I was often afraid that Alette would be refused by her father to show her skills and even participate in the battles, as a lot of female characters are. Introduced as fighters but reduced to watching the men fight from the sidelines. This was not the case. All of the female characters introduced in the game, Alette, Oddleif, Ysra and Nid, all participated to the battles. There were many lines where you are given the option to take away their agency and refuse their demands of, say, training the civilian women to know how to fight, or approve, and the dialogue between the fame characters and you are quite nice. “A strong woman, what does that even mean?” Yes, what DOES that even mean, Oddleif? *slams fits onto table*\n\n9/10 Con: Female characters are all archers and thus have the same animation. I often made the choice to leave out most of them and rarely have them in my party as they all seemed a lot of the same thing, someone from the Banner Saga has since contact me to tell me that this was something they were asked to change, and was thus changed for Banner Saga 2, I am very curious to check this out. Con: Too short.\n\nPro: ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful, great soundtrack (Actually all the sounds in this game were really great), loved the story, the concept, made me think of a Lord of the Rings type of game with a whole lot of Disney in it.\n","April 13","true","25.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This has caused an old rock-like enemy of human and giant, the Dredge, to resurface and begin tearing a bloody swath across the land. Taking on multiple characters, you take to the road to either stop, understand, or escape this catastrophe.\n\nThe Banner Saga's gameplay is split into two portions: an Oregon Trail style caravan mangement system that puts you squarely in the shoes of quartermaster and a turn-based tactical RPG.\n\nThe former portion of the game may occasionaly have you gritting your teeth. The Banner Saga is a game that is committed to its themes of kinship, journey, and perseverance both through its story and gameplay. As such, you will not only be required to make diffcult choices through the story, but also on rationing a relatively limited single currency system that is used for purchasing items, upgrading characters, AND buying supplies for your caravan (without these, they will die of hunger). It is the managing of all these things, along with endeavoring to keep your caravan's moral high, that some may find unfair. I, on the other hand, find it exhilarating and refreshing that Stoic has enough faith in the player to acctually put them through the very challenges that characters suffers through. It will give you a sense of accomplishment for each passing day late in the game. If this kind of challenge is your thing, this game will be an excellent match for you.\n\nIf you're a fan of the combat in Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem (to a lesser degree of similarity) this will keep you excited to engage in every battle. The variation on characters losing health and armor directly tying into their strength in battle will provide you an interesting challenge. Also, there are plenty of characters and classes that bring their own unique stats and special abilities to the field that are sure to keep you devising new strategies with each new, powerful recruit. That is, if your choices do not get them killed!\n\nSpeaking of choice, certain events do feel scripted, or dare I say "linear". They are, however, judiciously mixed with tragedies that are completely avoideable. For this reason, Stoic has struck a balance between pushing forward a narrative that has an end and allowing the consquence of your choices to play out.\n\nThe game will ocassionally make you feel disheartened and it may even make you fruastrated over the difficulty of managing the caravan and party if that is not your thing, but it will challenge your sense of saftey in choice, tell you a bleak and whimsical epic, and provide you a incredibly fun tactical rpg.","January 19, 2014","true","28.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The different options you have for decision making, and the result of the decision making, seemed a bit random at times but in a hostile environment like your heroes face in the game, you never know how your story will go.\nI spent about 6 or 7 hours through my first play through and will likely go back and see whatever endings or outcomes I can get.","September 29, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, it isn't exactly a true traditional RPG as described. In fact it's a turn-based tactical RPG in the mould of Agarest etc. It is refreshingly original in its setting and themes and the combat is quite interesting. It appears to be a little on the short side and is not without other issues but, nevertheless, remains a very good game all round and there is at least a measure of replayability for those who like to discover alternate ways of completing the game. Its main drawback is that the "random" encounters just aren't random enough and trial and error will leave you knowing the best response to most situations. Faults aside, I really enjoyed playing this and its price presents good value for what you get. 80%","March 15, 2014","true","9.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This means that when the enemy has lower numbers, they get more turns. It lets them get in and beat on your weaker people several times and you may not even have a chance to react. Since losing a character in combat means that you have to rest and that he or she will be weaker in additional fights, it is sort of annoying when there are two enemies left and they both get to move over and over again to take out your weakened guys.\n\nThe maps are all flat. There is no terrain at all.\n\nBetween battles, there are story portions that play out like a really well illustrated choose your own adventure book. A situation will arise, you choose between two or three options, and then you get a result. There is no indication whatsoever of how the choice might play out, so you might as well just pick the choices at random.\n\nThere is one currency in the game and you have to spend it to level guys up. Of course, you never know when one of these random story instances is going to kill someone that you spent that currency on.\n\nIt's really not a good game.

Saying "The Banner Saga is the first part of a planned trilogy" at the bottom of the expanded "read more" section apparently gives the dev team carte blanche to dice up a cohesive story and sell it to you one part at a time.\n\nIn a trilogy each episode has to stand on its own, have its own arcs and resolutions even if it's part of a greater arc.  The Banner Saga leaves everything up in the air, ending abruptly after terminating a single minor character arc in a moment of cutscene-forced incompetence.  It isn't a natural end to a story, in context it begins way more character development than it concludes and it feels as though the game is just throwing up its hands and saying "that's about a third of the story, roll credits."\n\nImagine if Baldur's Gate II ended right after you arrive in the Kuo-Toa city, or if Dragon Age: Origins cut off when the Antivan Crows ambush you, then they asked you to buy the rest of the game a few months down the line.  Cutting this story up the way they have they didn't even try to bring the game to a natural conclusion, they're simply forcing it to be a trilogy.\n\nThe aesthetics are solid, the combat is serviceable and the caravan mechanics reinforce the tone and setting of the game.  But the bottom line is you're coming to this game for the narrative and your agency within it, that's what you want from a team with this pedigree and that's what it's being sold on.  It's a good story well told, but it stumbles massively on a single bad design choice that thoroughly spoils the experience as a stand-alone game.\n\nOther quibbles: lack of cloud and controller support.\n\nAssuming the quality of the writing remains consistent buy it when you can pick up all 3 in a bundle.  As it is now, I cannot recommend it.","December 20, 2014","false","17.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With VIKINGS.\n\nI've only played a little ways in and I'm very impressed.  The art style of this game is fantastic - the art is a little like a mix of a 'good' version of the rotoscoped animation from Bakshi's Lord of the Rings, plus some of the stylization in 'secret of the kells.'  it feels like playing through a carefully crafted fantasy novel where the creators took it quite serious.  The tactical combat feels pretty satisfying, and the sobering choices that matter not in a 'good versus evil' context, but in a morally gray 'actions have consequences' context where you make your own morality makes this title feel very adult and mature.  On that note, so far I am enjoying playing a wise big-hearted viking giant who helps the weak and makes personal sacrifices while making wise decisions about protecting his warband.","January 16, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you like tough decisions and cool characters, I highly recommend this game, go buy it.\n\nLong version:\n\nThe Banner Saga is an incredible game filled to the brim with attention to detail and an interesting if not slightly cliché setting mixed with intriguing writing and scenarios. It has you put as the leader of a caravan, wandering the land in search of shelter from the elements and anybody, or anything that might be chasing you.\n\nOne of my favourite things about this game is how small you feel in the world, yet more importantly; a part of it. As you move along the 2D screen with a gorgeous backdrop, it really gives you a feeling of wonder. You are nearly always dwarfed by the massive altars known as Godstones, or towering mountains that dot the entirety of the game and it really put you in your place as a someone who is in a world that has existed long before you've arrived and will continue to do so long after you have left.\n\nThe art style, is surprisngly great. It resembles an old Disney movie with its animation and aesthetic, yet it fits. The animations are simple, yet effective, from simply swinging a sword, to slamming your woodcutter's axe into the ground behind you so you can take the bow of your back and shooting at an enemy.\n\nOne of the most engrossing things about The Banner Saga is the decisions that you make, and there is a lot of them. From deciding whether to let your caravan rest a day, improving their morale yet losing a day's worth supply of food in the process to deciding whether you let a fully developed character to die for the cause. I can't remember a decision I made where I didn't think that every option I had wasn't worth considering, and that's a really good thing. The sheer amount of decisions you make and the different results they show are absolutely great and the branching storylines allow for more than one playthrough. The overall plot is a bit hit and miss, and can be confusing at times; but it's the small interactions between characters that you're travelling with and the protection you feel for the unique characters as well as your whole caravan that makes this game's storytelling great.\n\nThe combat is pretty good and reasonably challenging. It's a turn and stat based combat system in which you move around on a small, square-grid battlefield to try and defeat a small host of enemies. Before every battle starts you may choose in which order your party may attack in by placing them in an initiative queue which dictates who goes first and last in your attack order. The way that works is that you have your party member take an action, and then the enemy takes an action, and so on and so forth until all but one person on either one side remains, then a special phase called "Pillage!" starts. The person with the larger party may then use that entire party to utterly destroy the last person on the opposing party, as they have next to no actions to take before they get, well, pillaged. I like this combat, to an extent and in my opinion, could use some polish.\n\nThe UI and character progress screens are simple yet easy to use for the most part as well, not really too much to say about them.\n\nThe music in this game is to a very high standard and fits in perfectly with the world of Banner Saga which, like the world, fills you with awe, yet gives you the will to constantly push forward.\n\nThe main negative points of this game (there isn't too many I can think of) is the tutorial and ending. The tutorial doesn't really give you a solid grasp on the combat as you should have, even with its seemingly simple nature. It'll take you at least 5 battles to get a proper hang of it. The ending is quite abrupt and unexpected and doesn't too a great job of tying the whole plot together in a nice way and left me wanting just a little more of a satisfying conclusion.\n\nThe Banner Saga is a great and utterly charming game that boasts an amount of intelligence and complexity put into decision making that a lot of triple A titles fail to reach.

With VIKINGS.\n\nI've only played a little ways in and I'm very impressed.  The art style of this game is fantastic - the art is a little like a mix of a 'good' version of the rotoscoped animation from Bakshi's Lord of the Rings, plus some of the stylization in 'secret of the kells.'  it feels like playing through a carefully crafted fantasy novel where the creators took it quite serious.  The tactical combat feels pretty satisfying, and the sobering choices that matter not in a 'good versus evil' context, but in a morally gray 'actions have consequences' context where you make your own morality makes this title feel very adult and mature.  On that note, so far I am enjoying playing a wise big-hearted viking giant who helps the weak and makes personal sacrifices while making wise decisions about protecting his warband.","January 16, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has a unique art style and the music and mood set a steady tone from the very beginning.  I expected a rich story and interesting characters and, while I wouldn't say that I'm disappointed, it does come off as a wounded product in some regards.\n\nDon't get me wrong!  I love the game and the story is deep and dark enough to add gravity to every decision you make.  The creators did an excellent job of giving the player powerful agency in developing their story--a weight and caution in your tactics that I have only seen elsewhere in Fire Emblem games.  The consequences of your actions are severe enough that you will take your time and address every issue with the true consideration of a leader of men and varl.  The pace of the game is also quite nice; I finished my playthrough in about eight hours.  I had expected more, but on the same note, I consider this game to have exceptional replay value.  I see myself completing it in full at least one more time, perhaps even a third.\n\nMy gripes with the game generally submerged in the latter half.  The story is steady and alluring in the early chapters, but once you reach the halfway point, it begins struggling to play catch-up and develop the world it somewhat neglected while it was busy developing the characters and their conflict.  It's very rushed and, without spoiling anything here, it feels like every major event introduces more questions than it answers.  The end of the game does not feel so much like the end of a game as the end of a single episode.  It is my hope that Banner Saga 2 will come to be and fill in the blanks.  Voice acting would have done wonders to add further depth to this story as well and I hope the creators will keep that aim in mind.\n\nAll in all, while I may have had somewhat unfair and lofty expectations from a game that brandished such a beautiful first impression, I would say that I remain pleased with the result.  This game is well worth your dollar and I hope that you will play through it more than once to experience the variety in the secrets of paths less travelled.

In most tactical RPGs, the barrier to difficulty can simply be hurdled by a spot of grinding. Here, there's no such opportunity. At every stage of the game you are hounded, chased from one location to another, the weight of the enemy always at your back, with hard decisions (which often only make you weaker) stacking up as you move along. There's no chance to pause and grind the game's singular currency - renown - which leaves it always scarce in quantity. This forces you to choose between purchasing supplies for your caravan, strengthening your warriors, or purchasing a shiny item to give you a small power boost, and it never feels like enough. At no point in my playthrough did I feel overpowered. Even my strongest warriors could be felled in one blow if I made a bad tactical decision. At the start of each encounter, there was always the sense of, "I don't know how I'll make it through this one," and following each battle, "I can't believe I made it out of there alive." And that's only the combat. The game also constantly forces you to make difficult decisions throughout, which frequently lead to the death of your party members. It's not always obvious, either, and since the game has no manual saves - only a handful of sporadic auto-saves - you can only change your mind so often. Sometimes, a decision you made hours ago will come back to haunt you much later, wreaking havoc on your party. So yes - in this game, there isn't just the illusion that your choices matter - they do, and you're bound to make some bad ones along the way. It's a bleak game, and feels like Game of Thrones meets The Walking Dead in terms of tone, and hope (or lack thereof). Luckily, it's also a gorgeous game, with a hand drawn aesthetic that looks quite unlike anything else out there. The combat system is interesting, but not nearly as varied as Japanese TRPGs like FF: Tactics, or the Disgaea series. By the end of the game, the mechanics do feel like a bit of a slog - but then, it suits the game's mood perfectly. To come out as some super charged badass capable of leveling a whole army isn't the point here, and wouldn't suit the story. Here, the core is survival, and the grim likelihood that at any moment, any one of your party might not make it to see the next day.","January 16, 2014","true","15.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you like tough decisions and cool characters, I highly recommend this game, go buy it.\n\nLong version:\n\nThe Banner Saga is an incredible game filled to the brim with attention to detail and an interesting if not slightly cliché setting mixed with intriguing writing and scenarios. It has you put as the leader of a caravan, wandering the land in search of shelter from the elements and anybody, or anything that might be chasing you.\n\nOne of my favourite things about this game is how small you feel in the world, yet more importantly; a part of it. As you move along the 2D screen with a gorgeous backdrop, it really gives you a feeling of wonder. You are nearly always dwarfed by the massive altars known as Godstones, or towering mountains that dot the entirety of the game and it really put you in your place as a someone who is in a world that has existed long before you've arrived and will continue to do so long after you have left.\n\nThe art style, is surprisngly great. It resembles an old Disney movie with its animation and aesthetic, yet it fits. The animations are simple, yet effective, from simply swinging a sword, to slamming your woodcutter's axe into the ground behind you so you can take the bow of your back and shooting at an enemy.\n\nOne of the most engrossing things about The Banner Saga is the decisions that you make, and there is a lot of them. From deciding whether to let your caravan rest a day, improving their morale yet losing a day's worth supply of food in the process to deciding whether you let a fully developed character to die for the cause. I can't remember a decision I made where I didn't think that every option I had wasn't worth considering, and that's a really good thing. The sheer amount of decisions you make and the different results they show are absolutely great and the branching storylines allow for more than one playthrough. The overall plot is a bit hit and miss, and can be confusing at times; but it's the small interactions between characters that you're travelling with and the protection you feel for the unique characters as well as your whole caravan that makes this game's storytelling great.\n\nThe combat is pretty good and reasonably challenging. It's a turn and stat based combat system in which you move around on a small, square-grid battlefield to try and defeat a small host of enemies. Before every battle starts you may choose in which order your party may attack in by placing them in an initiative queue which dictates who goes first and last in your attack order. The way that works is that you have your party member take an action, and then the enemy takes an action, and so on and so forth until all but one person on either one side remains, then a special phase called "Pillage!" starts. The person with the larger party may then use that entire party to utterly destroy the last person on the opposing party, as they have next to no actions to take before they get, well, pillaged. I like this combat, to an extent and in my opinion, could use some polish.\n\nThe UI and character progress screens are simple yet easy to use for the most part as well, not really too much to say about them.\n\nThe music in this game is to a very high standard and fits in perfectly with the world of Banner Saga which, like the world, fills you with awe, yet gives you the will to constantly push forward.\n\nThe main negative points of this game (there isn't too many I can think of) is the tutorial and ending. The tutorial doesn't really give you a solid grasp on the combat as you should have, even with its seemingly simple nature. It'll take you at least 5 battles to get a proper hang of it. The ending is quite abrupt and unexpected and doesn't too a great job of tying the whole plot together in a nice way and left me wanting just a little more of a satisfying conclusion.\n\nThe Banner Saga is a great and utterly charming game that boasts an amount of intelligence and complexity put into decision making that a lot of triple A titles fail to reach. I overall give the game a 8.5/10 with a high reccomendation.","January 7, 2015","true","18.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It is the first game in what is said to be a trilogy.\n\nThe combat system in the game is rather simple but in my opinion hits the right notes. It’s neither too hard nor too easy, and it fits the general mood of the game very well. Voice acting is almost absent in the entirety of the game, which gives it a distinct old-school RPG style (and surely bother some people). The Norse setting and aesthetics are dazzling and work wonderfully without the stereotypical elves-and-dwarves background so commonly associated with Fantasy games (I think it is worth mentioning that Arnie Jorgensen worked for DC Comics as cover artist and penciler). The chilly, stark soundtrack composed by Austin Wintory (famous for the back then PS3-exclusive game Journey), coupled with the visual aspect of the game, creates a perfectly consistent atmosphere of dreadful cold and silence while you roam from town to town in the Nordic landscape. As far as I know, the decisions you make during the game don’t change much of the story itself. They affect your gameplay directly, though, and can alter the overall experience (especially in War! events), so you must think twice before you act upon a request made by a clansman or a caravan you meet on the road.\n\nAnyway, I do recommend this game, not just because I enjoyed it specifically, but because I believe Stoic studio has the potential to continue making quality games (be that a sequel or something else entirely). Their first game is enough proof for me.","September 18, 2014","true","19.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's clear that what it contains is beautiful, but there are a few problems. I won't go into it at length - the bottom line is that it's a great game and worth playing. One playthough will last you about 10-12 hours on Normal, well worth the cost of entry.\n\nTo be brief: The game is beautiful, from stem to stern. Its visuals are like a hyper-realistic fever dream of Saturday morning cartoons drenched in the beauty of a thousand years of northern European history and design cues. The music from Austin Wintory (of Journey fame - the game, not the band) consistently floored me. You spend quite a bit of time simply watching your caravan mosey along from crushing disappointment to miserable turn of events to death and misery - and the music is what makes it intense and enjoyable.\n\nIf I had to describe the gameplay, I would call it Oregon Trail Tactics Emblem. As you move from place to place on your journey, you are presented challenges. The right answer may not always be clear, but you always have to make a choice and reap whatever consequences or rewards that come. This makes every decision intense, as you weigh between three or four different possibilities, any one of which could lead you to starvation, death, or an unexpected moment of kindness. The battles are where the Tactics part comes into play. If you like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, or XCOM, you're pretty familiar with how this works. There is a lot of room for strategy, employing big hulking Varl or your shield bearers to both block movement and set up counterattacks, while having your archers strategically placed to persecute weakened enemies.\n\nAll of that sounds positive, and it is. However, here's the imperfect part: The story, while in my opinion quite good and entertaining, feels like the first few chapters of a book. Or like a story that ends at the beginning of the first part of what should be a trilogy - like Lord of the Rings just suddenly stopping at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring. It is a tremendous climax, coming at the end of a very difficult trial, with absolutely no resolution after the fact. I had bought up a huge amount of supplies expecting an epic journey afterward, and right after the following battle I was treated to a (very moving) cinematic and the credits.\n\nThe reason I am annoyed by this is because I desperately wanted more. I was misty-eyed by the end, but ready to forge onward. It was, to say the least, disappointing.\n\nHowever, all I can do is hold out hope that Stoic produces a sequel worthy of picking up the banner and carrying onward.","August 18, 2014","true","18.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The journey these characters are taking is meant to be bleak and arduous, and playing the game feels like an extention of this as the days slog on: you have been starving for weeks, the characters you've invested the most resources in have died inexplicably, and on top of it all, you face the endless hordes of monotonous battle vs the same enemies over and over and over again.\nSo for now, for my own sanity, despite my admiration of the creators intent and craft, I can't go on.

The game is beautiful, feels like playing an adult version of a Disney film, but you can tell that from the screenshots. It has a very interesting combat system, although it may be a bit tough if you aren't familiar with tactical rpg's. It reminds me a bit of Vandal Hearts if anyone remembers that game.\n\nThe character progression system is also interesting, though it could be a little more explicit on things like what each stat really does. So far the story is compelling, and I do look forward to seeing it through, and possibly playing it multiple times to see what my choices may change.

Only after that I've googled it and realized that Stoic's kickstarter campaign passed under my radar. And that was most unfortunate for me, because we're talking about a game that breathes norse mythology, is beautifully crafted with hand-drawn artwork inspired by '1950-60s Disney genious' Eyvind Earle and has an amazing soundtrack by Austin Wintory, the guy behind the musical score from Playstation's big indie hit 'Journey': the only game that makes me cry like a baby after EVERY god damn playthrough.\n\nSo, yeah. How did I miss that Kickstarter? I don't know. What I know is that since discovering about Banner Saga I've hyped it so much inside my head that I dare say that, in a way, it was a little disappointing. But not in a way that compromises the game - just in a way that doesn't satisfy the 'almost-fetichist' personal desire I built up for this.\n\nYou start playing as Ubin, a varl (horned giants) that leads a tax caravan through the frontier cities between the varl lands and the human cities. After some time, however, you get to meet and play as Rook, a small village huntsman, and Alette - his daughter. They're being chased by Dredge, these humanoid stone creatures that seem to be quite strong and suddenly start pouring from everywhere. From there on the game is a long and arduous road for survival - as simple as that.\n\nPutting it that way, however, doesn't make justice for the beautiful landscapes, the amazing characters and the incredible tale you'll weave along the way. And more importantly: death is around every corner. Choices are tough, choices are insecure and you'll find yourself questioning your own morals for the sake of the people that follows you. Sometimes you'll have to be harsh, sometimes you'll be kind... And might even regret it later. Or be rewarded, even. There's nothing sure in The Banner Saga. Nothing is guaranteed, so it's advised to be careful about who you're going to care about.\n\nI'd certainly give Art and sound a 10 - I'm giving a 9 for two reasons: for art, I must admit that the initial cutscene is so beautiful that the game left me wanting more. There is, however, no more fully animated cutscenes. Not even the ending. So I was a little disappointed there. And for 'sound', the reason is very similar: sometimes I miss some voices or a better use of 'human sounds'. For a game that clutches you so deeply on emotions and attachment, it feels a little out of place that all dialogue is only written.\n\nGameplay works well. It's not great but it's enjoyable. The fighting mechanics are good and I really liked the balancing and tactics around armor and strength. I wish there was a little more variety, but that's not a big deal.\n\nEmotionally... Well, just play it. I recommend you don't, ever, load your game when something bad happens. Seriously. It's a game about a journey - a true viking saga - and about the pain and the loss and the sadness in said journeys. It's a game about decisions, a game about caring for those you love and losing them because YOU thought that this was the best thing to do... And it wasn't. This is very, very functional as a player-driven narrative. And if you take the plunge into the fantastic and beautiful world of The Banner Saga, it will reward you intensively. I assure you.\n\nCommunity, well... I didn't play the multiplayer part much, but a few rounds have shown me that people are nice and fun, so I suppose it's ok.\n\nOverall, The Banner Saga is a beautiful yet silent game. And by silent I mean that it has a lot to offer but you have to go there, you have to take it's hand and walk into the forest. If you do - you'll be so immersed that when you're done you'll realize that we are just guests upon the land...\n\nPS.: Just a warning - this game is the first part of a TRILOGY. Don't expect much closure, all will be explained in time...","February 3, 2014","true","13.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VGMMDI/recommended/237990/","VGMMDI","PryingOpenMy3rdEye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VGMMDI/","110 products in account","I’ve heard a lot about The Banner Saga, but, due to my laziness, I never really checked out their kickstarter page to see what all the fuss was about.  However, I was lucky to get myself a review code from the publishers and I have to say that it wasn’t anything I expected.  I feel like I’m playing the Oregon Trail, but with Vikings, which would make my nine year old self jealous.\n\nIn a world where the sun no longer shines and the Gods have all become deceased; there are only humans,  varl and the dredge.  Humans were the original creatures who were clever, varl are a cross-breed between man and animal being quite large with horns and dredge are large armored enemies that are quite mysterious.  A new war is breeding with the dredge now attacking the other two races leaving them to flee from all they know and out into the wild.  The humans and varl are now trying to reduce the threat while not trying to kill each other.\n\nI can say that the story is unique, even if it started off a bit slow.   While there is the main plot with the dredge running everything over there are many sub plots going on at the same time.  The main plot doesn’t really change. The sub plots, however, all depend on the choices you make.  These actions can affect the first few minutes, and it can make everything exciting.  You have no idea who will betray you or when someone will die, and nothing really ever goes right.\nMy one main issue with the story is if there will be a second one.  There are many questions to be asked and no real answers were given at the end.  If the saga does indeed continue then this isn’t a problem, but if they decide to end it right here the ending leaves you feeling lost.\n\nThe battle system is turn based where one player goes and the other one follows, just like chess.  When one side is down to one fighter it goes into a pillage mode where the opposing team only gets one turn until the other team is done with the remaining players.  Renown is gained from killing players which later can be used to upgrade characters, buy supplies or new charms.\n\nWhile fighting, your character can either try to do physical damage to the enemy’s armor or attack their strength.  Your strength also counts as your health which means the more you have the more damage is done and the less is the opposite.  Each character has a special ability that can be used using their willpower.  They can hit the armor, strength or even both and can be used to help allies.  Altogether there is a lot of strategy to be done with this and it is quite distinctive and varies from other roles playing games.\n\nAfter a battle is done you have the option to camp or stop in town to either train, rest or shop around.  Between towns you will have a caravan full of warriors or clansmen you need to take care of.  Keeping a full stock of supplies is needed so they don’t go hungry and you may run into people to help or they could be bandits who will try to steal from you.\n\nWhen upgrading your characters with the renown you collect after battles there are a few options to go through.  After killing a certain number of opponents you are given the option of increasing your ability to a new rank, armor for blocking damage, strength for damage and heath, willpower to hit harder or perform an ability, exertion for how much willpower you can carry, and break which is the amount of direct damage you can naturally do to an enemy’s armor.\n\nThe graphics would have to be the first thing I noticed right away.  It is a 2D art style where I feel like I’m watching an old cartoon show on a Saturday morning.  I have to say the first hour of everything almost made me forget I was playing a game.  The majority of the game is done through text with little to no movement from the characters while they are talking.  I was hoping for more voice work, but sadly I was wrong.  I know I shouldn’t be complaining and letting my imagination do the work, but it felt like a missing piece with its grand entrance.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.  This was well done in graphics and story for an indie game, but the battle system is what really brings you in.  As I said it can be a little hard to get used to at the start, but once the training wheels are off be ready to face not only challenging enemies on the field, but also hard decisions.  I would say an eight of ten is the right score for this game because while it does have many unique qualities to it, it isn’t perfect either.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/lkf1Z2AqtHo","January 14, 2014","true","19.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This sounds much worse than it actually is though - the story remains very gripping!\n-The gameplay has its flaws, and can get repetitive. The hard difficulty offers a great challenge!\n-The story is rather short and with a disappointing ending, though easily replayable.

The rest of the package is developed to a point that is more than satisfactory, but when a game is centred around the plot it seems rather silly to leave in such precarious shape.\n\nI won't delve into details, but a significant proportion of the interesting strands of the plot remain unresolved (or worse, unexplained to begin with) and the tale's rather clichéd conclusion fails to have any emotional impact due to the lack of character development over such a short timeline.

Definitely worth the 20$ that I have spent.\n\nOverall grade: 9.5 / 10\n\nPros:\n- Breathtaking storyline\n- Stunning Visuals\n- Engaging Score, sets the mood nicely\n- Battles are well done, can set difficulty if it gets too hard\n\nCons:\n- Save states are always automatic, can't manually save and go back","January 14, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Actually, if it were several dollars less (or on sale) it would be worth recommending on that merit. Unfortunately, they have made the mistake of attempting to pack a game in with this work of art and underlying game is really bad.\n\nBarring some scant and predictable events, you have no control and no agency in the traveling portion of the game. Strategy essentially amounts to buying enough food at each stop to last out a journey of predictable length. The game even makes a lame attempt to reference Oregon Trail at one point but you can't alter your pace, hunt for food or any of that. All you can do is watch the caravan move and occasionally click a pop-up. While the timing of the events can be random, the results of the choices are predictable and usually so inconsequential overall they are essentiall cosmetic.\n\nMuch of the criticsm of the battle system revolves around the choices made for its turn-based system. While the system is valid, no effort has been made for the AI to take advantage of it. The opposing force scripting is simplistic in fact, that it is outright self-destructive with some units because simple checks were not put in place for splash damage abilities. The battles take place at scripted intervals with scripted rosters and all but one of the battle maps are simple rectangular grids.\n\nConclusion: Wait for a sale, turn the difficulty to Easy. Bear with the game and enjoy the art and story.\n","April 15, 2015","false","33.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's far too linear for that, even though you can somewhat influence where the story branches at certain points. Don't expect too much control over things.\n\nThis game isn't that much of a turn-based tactics battler. Sure, the combat is okayish and gives you something to do in addition to clicking through dialogue, but I never found the fights that engaging and at times it was dull and repetitive. There are way more interesting turn-based combat games out there, don't grab this if that's what you're looking for.\n\nHowever, this game is a pretty good visual novel! The story and characters were interesting, the world is mysterious and the art and music side is well done. If you want to experience a pretty gripping viking fantasy survival story, this game works. Well, at least until the end, when there's not enough closure and it becomes pretty obvious that this is actually The Banner Saga: Episode 1 and it's definitely building up to a sequel. At least the game doesn't over-explain things so the sense of mystery remains.\n\nStill, if you enjoy nice hand-painted visuals and very light RPG story elements and just want to be told a neat story, this is a decent experience for that. Just don't expect any sprawling larger-than-life epic, this is quite quickly over even though the world and lore probably could support a larger game in the same setting.","August 1, 2015","true","10.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Also, you might have a choice not to fight, but wont be able to upgrade your characters or earn any reknown otherwise. (Yes, you can get little reknown for other good choices, but far from enough) This renders the fight necessary but boring.\n- the story only scratches the surface of what would have been possible. The game stops with the first real boss and shortly after all the main characters are introduced. It also leaves a big story gap in between the two main "armies".\n- the "choices" you can make will all end in the same story progress and actually all your choices will make everything worse, like being kind to people will almost always end in you being screwed over by these people, and you wont get any reknown.\n- the "armies" lack significance. It doesnt matter how big your army is. At least it didnt matter in my play-throughs. At one point i had only 3 varls in my army and could defeat the enemies army by charging in.\n- the atmosphere lacks depth. The pictures are beautifully painted and the army wandering the lands look great. But the characters remain static, because their depictions are static and do seldomly show emotions. I couldnt connect to any of them. Also, it seemed to me that any character you like will die anyway, no matter what you do.\n- the way the story is told is patchy at best. Important or emotional scences are just told as text without any visual or audial aid. Ok, videos are expensive to make, but a picture or speech would have been possible. Like the scene where you can decide weather to take the enemies child with you or not. This scene remains hollow and undetached.\n\n+The story, the music, the artwork is great, but its just not a whole game.\nPS: I backed this game from the beginning. Not unlike Broken Age, it feels very short and shallow.","February 12, 2014","false","11.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

After finishing it for the most part on normal difficulty I want to but I really cant reccomend people buying it.\n\nThe good : Amazing visuals, animation and sountrack. Thats about it.\n\nThe bad: it would be easy to say everything else but im going to elaborate.\n\nWith such an amazing score and visuals the game has virtually no voicework to accompany the dialogues. Which would ok if it werent for hte fact that they are either poorly translated or just badly written. You can skip 90% of the dialogue and still be on the same page if you had been paying attention.\n\nThe unitally cool and challenging combat quickly becomes boring or unfair depnding in you difficulty level. There arent many different enemies so you end fighting the same 4-5 guys for 9 hours and the strategy never evolves beyond gang up on the weak guy. The special abilities of each hero are very situational and I maybe used 3 abilities regulary.\n\nSome mechanics are downright broken. The demand for provisions to supply the caravan is completely optional since there virtually no penatly to loosing clansmen/varl. The renown points (with which the game is very stingy) are better spent on your crew and gear.  Beware some party memebers are prone to sudden death during the random encours on the road. So dont be surpised if a badass warhawk level 5 gets killed by dregeling off screen with little infleunce by the player.\n\nDespite the strong visual and audio presentation the story is moot and the characters never evolve beyond thier booring achetypes. The pampered prince, the innocent girl, the reluctant leader etc.\n\nOver all I would say stay away from this beatiful siren fo a game no matter how tempting the and song lull you to its purchase\n","January 16, 2014","false","14.9"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","2"

Hell yeah!\nThere are many problems i have with this game but there are also some things that were done right that i found as well. Here's list of things I found and you all can be the judge\n\nPro's:\nPretty cool story, when all is said and done.\nThe whole leading the caravan part of the game, awesome, felt like i was playing the war scenes from a game of thrones\nAll the characters had pretty decent stories and personalities\nThe combat was pretty cool once you got the hang of it. Think tactics ogre mixed in with some wierd type of chess\nArt fit the feel of the game perfectly\n\nCon's:\n\nYou obviously set yourself up for a sequel. By this i mean, there are good cliff hangers that leave me thinking "oh, well what are they going to do now?" and then there's  ones that leave me saying "What the ♥♥♥♥ you spent all this ♥♥♥♥ing time mentioning these things that your not even going to tell me about? Seriously? Not even a hint?"; the later of which you did, and i'm kinda upset about that.\n\nThere are bugs still in this I had it crash a couple times on me and the load times for the graphics in the game are pathetic. Borderlands 2 loads quicker than this game does for me. (check out ivrir's story background after that big thing to him happens, btw, it's bugged)\n\nGame feels rushed half way through, and heres why i say that:\nYou just randomly stop switching between rook and what's his horned face. Just stop. You could've totally split off with him and gone off on his on journey up to the point that he regroups, but you didn't and i was kinda disappointed.\nYou're ending is abrupt, i wasn't quite sure that i hit the end untill the credits popped up.\nThere are 2 GAPING WIDE plot points that never really come to surface, which is too bad becuase I kind of wanted to see more of it.]\n\nThe army combat parts are a little lacking. Honestly, I felt like i  could have led a charge the entire time and been better off.\nI would have like to actually have command of my armies as well instead of just saying how to engage. A perfect example of how i'd've liked this game to play the army scenes would be Suikoden. Do some like that with your army combat.\n\nIn conclusion(again), Don't buy this game unless its on sale or the cost has gone down to around 10-15$ and you'll be much much happier. Took me about 14 hours to complete and i was a terrible leader who told every one to do what they want, which i'm sure divertered most combat situations, so i could see this game lasting at most 20 hrs on the first play through.","January 15, 2014","false","13.5"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","1"

Also you need to calculate your meterials to fed your people etc. so you always need to think carefully before act. Especially in harder modes. its not like some RTS or other popular strategy games.

Characters level up like in typical RPGs and you can equip them with stat-enhancing gear (only one though, and the highest level is 5). You'll quickly decide your front 6 and rarely deviate from it.\n\nYou will also learn that this game outright hates you, dealing you pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cards when you are called upon to make a decision. Not always ♥♥♥♥♥♥, however - some lead almost nowhere. But this where the story is primarily told, and because of these infrequent horrible decisions, and the occasional story-affecting choices, the saga feels like it's yours. I'm quite confident that someone out there has done precisely the same things as I did in this game, but, whilst I was playing it, it didn't feel that way.\n\nThe art style is pretty. Think 50's-80's Disney style stationary art with basic movements programmed in for battles, but with the minimal, yet highly appreciated, foreground and background falling snow to give it an easy 3D effect. Nice all around.\n\nMy only beef with this game is it's story, particularly the ending. It just ends to soon to put it plainly. Any self-respecting storywriter (who knows or does not know that they may be writing a trilogy) would not have ended it in this way. So many great and interesting angles are left unexplored and hardly explained! The Gods are dead (not much of a spoiler as it's right at the beginning of the game) and yet no explanation is offered. The sun has stopped moving (again, beginning) and no explanation is offered. The (apparent) main boss is introduced 2/3 of the way through without any previous hinting of how significant he's going to be. Why? Because his significance is paired with his existence. Very poor. And it's not even like he's a good main boss: there is a literal earth-shatterer that would have made for a killer main boss!\n\nThe storywriters need firing for this one. Actually, just fire the ones who argued that it should end in this way because they need to go back to junior school. I don't care if a trilogy had been in the plan the whole time, a good story does not introduce a key aspect of the storyline and then just do nothing with it.\n\nI do recommend this though. It's a great game. The tone is excellent and it really feels like your saga. When you finish in a day (if your dedicated enough) you'll see what I mean by just how ♥♥♥♥ing disgraceful the ending is.","April 22, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But taken as a whole the experience is deeply fulfilling, thanks to well developed characters that you will actually care about and want to get to know, a narrative and game world of epic scope, and a tactically rich turn-based battle system that puts some smart twists on tradition. And what more can I say about the game's stunning artistry? Some of the cutscene portraits and landscape shots made me wish I could print them out and frame to hang on my wall, instead of only being able to capture them as screenshots to use for desktop wallpapers. If Disney or Rankin/Bass ever made a mature cel-animated movie about Vikings, it would probably look a whole lot like The Banner Saga.","April 24, 2014","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I immediately started playing again, not for the sake of acheivements or even getting a "best ending" but just wanting to do things a little differently.\n\nI'm not really a connoiseur when it comes to music, but unlike other games I never listened to my own music on top of the game's.\n\nVisually this game is amazing. Boiled down, yea its a bunch of simply cycling illustrations, but those illustrations are brilliantly done, and never make you feel like you're watching some dumb gif loop.\n\nIn line with that it is one of the only games I can play on my laptop's fan run like a jet engine, which is to say, it is in no way demanding for any computer to run.\n\nThat said, assuming that the place where my first game ended is in fact the ending of the game, I think the loose ends did catch my attention. That didn't at all take away from the overall experience, and if anything it makes me think that they will (hopefully) be releasing a sequel, what with the girth of lore that was given to the game. Over your travels within the game you travel not even a fifth of the presented world, but it never feels like you're missing anuything. In actuality it just made me wish I could go farther, which is probably the right way for a game to make you feel.\n\nThe combat is fantastic. I was amazed and enthralled with Factions, and the minor tweaks that were made to pre and during combat gameplay was done with this game in mind, not bending to any sort of predesigned border. Such a thrilling experience during every battle.\n\nA small thing that I really did appreciate was that RNG was in the hands of the player. Only by equipping certain items did RNG ever come into play, which is something I wish a lot of Tactical Strategy RPGs (or what have you) would do as well.\n\nTL;DR,\nA game with the smallest of blemishes that left me wanting more, 9.5/10","April 26, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a fairly unique mechanic that, while not the most entertaining in the world, is paced well, and both thought provoking (to ensure that you can keep functioning well as a party you have to think about what you do in each and every combat) and fun. Outside of combat, the "overland" mechanical business of actually running a caravan is a very interesting challenge that really made me think about my choices. Especially towards the ending where the choices get significantly harder to make, and it becomes much more apparent that being the "good guy" won't always be the best choice of action. The story is excellent and well written. To be quite honest this is one of a very few games that has actually made me cry. Artisitically this game is stunning. It is very obvious that those who worked on visual assets had both talent and actually gave a damn about how the finished product looked, making this probably the most visually beautiful game I've played in a while.\n\nOverall I highly reccomend this game to anybody who enjoys a high quality storytelling game, and to those who still enjoy a turn based tactics game.","January 7, 2015","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nice to hear the authentic accents in the few spoken lines and the music is outstanding. The gameplay consists of dialogue choices and a basic turn-based, grid combat system. As with all the best choice based dialogue games, some of the choices are the sort that cause you to sit and think for 30 minutes before selecting something you immediately regret.\n\nThe combat is repetitive and once I had a go-to team I found it difficult to break from a routine (giants at the front to smash some up the baddies, archers at the back to pick off the smashed). The combat almost feels like it was added to make the game a game instead of what could have been an excellent interactive story. It beats quick time events I guess but the lack of enemy types makes everything too easy. When got bored of the combat I bumped the Difficulty setting down to Easy only to find out it was the final battle in the game. So, it was good enough for my 10 hour play time.\n\nEverything about the game feels very much like a touch screen was always in the back of the developers minds. This is not a complaint, the play style is perfected suited for dropping in and out to extend what can be a pretty bleak story. The odds are certainly against all of the characters and a string of badly handled choices can result in some miserable  setbacks.\n\nI picked the game up in the Summer sale 2014, excellent value for money. I'm on board for the planned sequels. More spoken dialogue and improved combat would build on the excellent foundation set up with The Banner Saga.","January 10, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A breath taking tale set across a very Norse inspired world.\n\nFirst starting the game is a simple tutorial built into the game, yet never plays out the same each time. The enemies are diverse, yet follow a very similar pattern. This repitition of patterns makes it easier for you to fight, yet with each new enemy added, the challenge becomes more difficult as enemies start to become more difficult to tackle. A true strategy game, where each move can determine the fate of each party member.\n\nYet party members aren't safe in the story either, for you choose how the story plays out. With each choice, party members react with their own nature, meaning that every choice has weight behind it. No option is "correct" or "wrong" even. Each merits it's own rewards, and consequences.\n\nThe background/battlegrounds are wonderful. Simply wonderful. The attention to details, in this beautifully drawn world is lovely. As your party travels, the landscapes that you see are breath taking. And this effect is expanded on by the soundtrack which compliments it so very well. It has a talent for turning even the more dull parts of the game into something enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 5/5. Banner Saga is a must for anyone who loves strategy. It's challenging, and provides a great story full of life. Since it does have modding compatibility, I can't wait to see what new challenges the community can make.","December 18, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What appears to be a simple tactical combat engine is an incredibly in-depth system. You can learn through experimentation or through paying attention to some dialogue.

Let that struggle immerse you in the amazing story. Ask yourself who you are.\n\nReally, though, I play a lot of games, and from a technical standpoint they did a really great job on this. Both a satisfying ludic experirience, as well as a narrative one.  No need for fancy graphics to hide the mediocrity found in most modern games.

The score, the sounds, the visual style, and the writing all work together beautifully to tell the story of a merciless world falling apart. It's tense and you're always on the verge of annihilation, and the music alone could tell you so. It's gritty, and the crunches of axes breaking armor and the grunts and moans of the injured make you feel it. People are fragile and the perpetual march is exhausting, and the heavy shambling motions of bodies shows you so.  As the leader, you constantly have to arbitrate the problems of your followers, keep them optimistic, keep them fed, and keep them alive while a continent of panicking and desperate people is being overrun.  Everything harmoniously comes together to weave an atmosphere where feelings of dread and anxiety are constant. Your choice isn't whether or not people die, it's who dies now so that fewer will die later.  In every artistic regard this game is an achievement.\n\nUnfortunately it's not for everyone, though. Its roots are in the artistry, not the gameplay--people have some valid complaints about that. Only some. I didn't dislike the gameplay at all, but I was very wrapped up in every other part of the game.\n\nPlay it for the experience.","February 14, 2015","true","107.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It can feel slow and some might get bored if they don't know what they are getting into, but this game is not meant for your ADHD RTS players counting their clicks per minute. So simply be prepared for what this game is, a "graphic novel" with interactive story elements that have direct repurcissions on the story, intermixed with solid turn based strategy combat.\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nLoved the look of this back on kickstarter where I first saw it when it was already funded. Then I was thrilled to see it one day on sale on Steam. I can tell you without shame or regret that I've poured a few hours into this one (multiple playthroughs) and my only complaint is that the story ended, too soon perhaps, but if it were one long play through I think I'd still have the same complaint, which is really a compliment more often reserved for great literature than video games. So I tip my hat to Stoic. Now be good and go make me more adventures to have on that vast and storied looking map!\n\nThe Banner Saga has a lot of potential for more content (though I don't know of plans for any) but regardless of that I have read the developers are working on a second title, so the adventure will continue one way or another but it would be nice to have additional content within this version, I'd be all over that. So assuming those *explitives* over at King (the makers of bejewelled clone: candy crush) haven't managed to somehow own the word "Saga" (since they are seeking a trademark and disputing people using the word "saga" in their game titles) which is nearly as ridicioulous as it is sad, I'll expect to be throwing my money at the boys and girls over at Stoic ASAP.\n\nAll the best and good luck with the completely unnecessary issues with those tap app jockeys.

As I began figuring out the system my enjoyment of combat increased a lot as I began to make the right decisions and win more battles. For example, archers arent very strong against armored enemy, but they can plink away at armor whilst the melee character moves in - once both have broken they can both finish off the enemy quick.\n\nAlso theres a practice battle option which provides random set of enemies. It doesnt improve or injure your heroes, just practice. These are usually harder than what you face in the normal game, allowing you to improve a lot and learn how to beat the odds. Playing on the hardest difficulty is essential I think otherwise you might find it too easy. If you like the game's combat is a good addition and adds a bit more to the game's challenge.

The actual story is very good, although it's rather bleak (which is a perfect fit for the Viking setting, of course).\n\nAdd to that a suberb art design, composed of breathtaking traditional 2D art like I've never seen before in a computer game; and a fantastic soundtrack, and you've got yourself a truly amazing game. It's not flawless, though: while some of those flaws (like lack of full voice acting) are completely understandable, given Stoic's small size, others (like the lack of subtitles, or being forced to replay the last five hours of gameplay due to some decision you took waaaay back that now means game over for you) are not.\n\nBut even with these flaws the game is still a gem, totally worth the two years Stoic took to develop it since the game's Kickstarter campaign was funded in 2012.","January 15, 2014","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Between the big bodies of the varl and the need to worry about managing armor vs strength there is enough going on in the combat to keep me satisfied for the length of the game.\n\nIf I do have one complaint, it would be how arbitrary some of the dialogue choices' consequences seem to be.

The combat put a great spin on the turn based strategy game with its use of health as your attack stat, causing combat to flow a lot differently than say XCOM.  It also has an Oregon Trail feel, as not combat parts of the game flow very similar to that.  The game tends to be very heavy, as you often make hard choices.  I found myself having to give it a break here and there just because the wieght of my decision got to me. In my opinion a must play.

Every decision you make in the game is important and a lot of the conversation choices could result in the death of a character over another in some cases.\n\nIt shows this was made by some of the oldschool Bioware guys who have since left that company.  The story and characters are all very interesting and I've only scratched the surface of the game.\n\nThe artwork and music stand out in this game more than any other I've played.  The art is only 2d but it's some of the most beautiful 2d artwork I've seen.  The music is perfect and fits the art with a very viking feeling to it.  The incombat animation is very smooth and looks great.\n\nThe gameplay reminds me of old FF and Suikoden games where you have many different heroes with different job classes.  There are as far as I can tell about 17 different job classes each with it's own special abilities.  Every character you get can be ranked up, have an item equiped etc.\n\nIf you are a turn based strategy, with a bit of RPG fan I highly highly recommend picking this game up.\n\nFinal Note:  This game has an auto save feature, which means not being able to save the game at every decision, making them far more important in the longrun.  Save Scummers beware, this is not the game for you.","January 14, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well...it's amazing.\nThe art and animation are beautiful, story is book worthy, and this is one of the rare games I've played where choices actually matter. I think of this as part Fire Emblem and part Oregon Trail. Fighting is turn based and requires a good deal of strategy as when to take off enemy armor or go straight for their health as well when to use your characters abilities. In the overworld you need to make sure you have enough supplies to get you from city to city and along the way events will happen from thieves stealing supplies to possible permanent character death. The same points you use to buy supplies are used to upgrade you heroes. Do you use the points to make your fighters better or do you buy supplies so that you can get to the next city? I had moments while playing where I felt acutal despair as I watched my supplies run dry hoping that maybe I could find some more supplies from an event and cursing myself for using to many points to upgrade units.\n\nDid I mention the art? Oh I did...WELL IT'S FREAKING GREAT!\nThough I only saw one animated cutscene in the game just watching your caravan walk across the plains and seeing beautiful mountains at your back. The God Stones with their elaborate designs that also give you a little insight to the lore of the world. The in-fight animations are also very good and I think there's something really cool about the way the magic looks in the game.\n\nI think this game was worth shelling out $25 but hey that's just me. With all of the choices you can make in the game I'm very willing to do a second playthrough on a harder difficulty.","January 20, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

People not getting this and getting beaten constantly is the number one source of criticism I see - people don't like it the combat because they don't understand this. To be fair to these people, the game never explains this, you have to learn it on your own. If you learn to use this approach early you'll get a lot more out of the game.\n\nThe way this game presents choices is a breath of a fresh air. To contrast with BioWare, where the major choices are all set pieces in Banner Saga they're presented much more organically. I've yet to beat the game, but already the story feels very personal based on my choices, compare this with other RPGs, where you often don't see the outcome of your decisions until the end.\n\n*Possible Spoilers Below*\n\nSomething that's very interesting is the use of two protagonists. They manage to make playing as each caravan feel very different, in a good way. In one it's all about war and diplomacy, in the other it's all about desperation and survival. The different feel of playing as each is much appreciated.\n\n*End Possible Spoilers*\n\nThe combat is incredibly satisfying. Normally, I prefer real time with pause combat, but Banner Saga's system is great. It's very tactical without feeling overwhelming.\n\nThe music and the art are just phenomenal. I can't do them justice here.\n\nThe world building is also great. It manages to draw effectively on Norse mythology and culture without feeling derivative. There's lots of familar imagery and themes but they're presented in a very fresh way. I'm playing the game as much to find out what happened in the world's past as I am to find out where the story goes. The setting is one of the game's biggest triumphs.\n\nEDIT: Having now finished the game I'd like to add some more thoughs. The game as a whole is fantastic. I can't wait for the next episode - I want to see how my choices will affect the rest of the story. More than that, after the events of this episode I'm very excited to see how certain characters develop.\n\nThe character writing is very, very strong. I was surprised just how attached I became to some members of my party. There are some truly memorable personalities in this game.\n\nThe major set pieces of game are also fantastic. There are a couple of situations that you face that spread over multiple in game days, where you will be forced to make a lot of hard choices in rapid succession that are truly epic. I can't say any more than that as I couldn't imagine a greater disservice than spoiling in any fashion the two events I have in mind.\n\nEDIT2: I'd like to add, if you liked The Walking Dead you'll enjoy Banner Saga. The characterisation of the protagonist and approach to choices are very similar and the stories even have some similar themes.","January 24, 2014","true","33.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the soundtrack to the art direction to the interface, everything is immaculate and elegant. Nothing feels rough around the edges or half-finished as far as those elements go. The gameplay is unique- a combination of choose-your-own-adventure style frequent decision-making, an Oregan Trail-like survival and travel element that involves some resource management, and the battle system itself which involves tactical strategy and some interesting components like individual health and defense bars to attack, and the Varl race of characters who take up a lot of unit space in battle but have high attack power. There are so many characters to choose from during battle- as many as 20 are encountered by game's end and even character usage involves some decision-making as characters only level up by not only actively participating, but getting in a number of kills.\n\nNow for some of the downsides- though there are such a plethora of options and routes to go on, nearly all lead toward the same end and plot points seem black and white in nature- you either picked the "right" answer leading to hidden items or a surplus in resources, or you picked the wrong one which can set you back in progress. But making wrong decisions matters little since the difficulty level is low until the end, and the initially interesting tactics-driven combat is actually quite simplified compared to other strategy RPGs. Aspects such as equipment management involve collecting numerous accessories and each character can hold just one. Character classes and stat allocation is similarly straightforward. On the bright side, that makes this title a great choice for those new to the genre and not very interested in micro-management.\n\nThe storyline is interesting and involved, but there is not much clarification of the lore. While the character and plot development is nicely done, it can be vague with some side characters receiving barely a line of exposition. While I compared the decision-making to a choose-your-own-adventure novel, it has nowhere near the verbosity of visual novels or many story-driven RPGs. The writing is of an appreciably high standard of quality though and the lack of meandering over any particular element (whether it be storytelling or the various types of gameplay present here) keeps the game fast-paced.\n\nI achieved completion at around 10 hours and do feel there is some replay value here, but the general asking price ($24.99) is very high for this amount of content. I would suggest waiting for a sale of at least 30-50% off. The exception being if the subject matter is particularly riveting to you, in which case I'd say go ahead as it is likely to impress.","July 2, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Progression happens at a slow, steady march. Battles are fought with fewer units, and higher stakes.\n- The map is extremely tolkien-esque, and packed with exquisite lore. This is a detailed, reactive world that you can get lost in. The developers understand that the more you know about a setting, the more emotionally invested you'll be.\n- It's a joy to retrain your strategy instincts for this game. The mechanics are innovative, unusual. Character stats such as strength, armor and willpower don't mean what strategy/RPG game veterans might assume they mean.\n- The game is balanced very, very well. Persistently difficult, but fair, with a long smooth learning curve.\n\nThe feature of the game that is most obvious is the art. Almost every screen from the battles to the menus looks and feels like a high-resolution, blu-ray remastering of a rotoscoped 80's animated film. What strikes me, though, is how well the art, the writing, and the game are unified in their artistic vision.

Characters level up like in typical RPGs and you can equip them with stat-enhancing gear (only one though, and the highest level is 5). You'll quickly decide your front 6 and rarely deviate from it.\n\nYou will also learn that this game outright hates you, dealing you pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cards when you are called upon to make a decision. Not always ♥♥♥♥♥♥, however - some lead almost nowhere. But this where the story is primarily told, and because of these infrequent horrible decisions, and the occasional story-affecting choices, the saga feels like it's yours. I'm quite confident that someone out there has done precisely the same things as I did in this game, but, whilst I was playing it, it didn't feel that way.\n\nThe art style is pretty. Think 50's-80's Disney style stationary art with basic movements programmed in for battles, but with the minimal, yet highly appreciated, foreground and background falling snow to give it an easy 3D effect. Nice all around.\n\nMy only beef with this game is it's story, particularly the ending. It just ends to soon to put it plainly. Any self-respecting storywriter (who knows or does not know that they may be writing a trilogy) would not have ended it in this way. So many great and interesting angles are left unexplored and hardly explained! The Gods are dead (not much of a spoiler as it's right at the beginning of the game) and yet no explanation is offered. The sun has stopped moving (again, beginning) and no explanation is offered. The (apparent) main boss is introduced 2/3 of the way through without any previous hinting of how significant he's going to be. Why? Because his significance is paired with his existence. Very poor. And it's not even like he's a good main boss: there is a literal earth-shatterer that would have made for a killer main boss!\n\nThe storywriters need firing for this one. Actually, just fire the ones who argued that it should end in this way because they need to go back to junior school. I don't care if a trilogy had been in the plan the whole time, a good story does not introduce a key aspect of the storyline and then just do nothing with it.\n\nI do recommend this though. It's a great game. The tone is excellent and it really feels like your saga. When you finish in a day (if your dedicated enough) you'll see what I mean by just how ♥♥♥♥ing disgraceful the ending is.","April 22, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But taken as a whole the experience is deeply fulfilling, thanks to well developed characters that you will actually care about and want to get to know, a narrative and game world of epic scope, and a tactically rich turn-based battle system that puts some smart twists on tradition. And what more can I say about the game's stunning artistry? Some of the cutscene portraits and landscape shots made me wish I could print them out and frame to hang on my wall, instead of only being able to capture them as screenshots to use for desktop wallpapers. If Disney or Rankin/Bass ever made a mature cel-animated movie about Vikings, it would probably look a whole lot like The Banner Saga.","April 24, 2014","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I immediately started playing again, not for the sake of acheivements or even getting a "best ending" but just wanting to do things a little differently.\n\nI'm not really a connoiseur when it comes to music, but unlike other games I never listened to my own music on top of the game's.\n\nVisually this game is amazing. Boiled down, yea its a bunch of simply cycling illustrations, but those illustrations are brilliantly done, and never make you feel like you're watching some dumb gif loop.\n\nIn line with that it is one of the only games I can play on my laptop's fan run like a jet engine, which is to say, it is in no way demanding for any computer to run.\n\nThat said, assuming that the place where my first game ended is in fact the ending of the game, I think the loose ends did catch my attention. That didn't at all take away from the overall experience, and if anything it makes me think that they will (hopefully) be releasing a sequel, what with the girth of lore that was given to the game. Over your travels within the game you travel not even a fifth of the presented world, but it never feels like you're missing anuything. In actuality it just made me wish I could go farther, which is probably the right way for a game to make you feel.\n\nThe combat is fantastic. I was amazed and enthralled with Factions, and the minor tweaks that were made to pre and during combat gameplay was done with this game in mind, not bending to any sort of predesigned border. Such a thrilling experience during every battle.\n\nA small thing that I really did appreciate was that RNG was in the hands of the player. Only by equipping certain items did RNG ever come into play, which is something I wish a lot of Tactical Strategy RPGs (or what have you) would do as well.\n\nTL;DR,\nA game with the smallest of blemishes that left me wanting more, 9.5/10","April 26, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

By beautiful I mean soundtrack, artwork and story. It's really enjoyable and definitely worth playing. It has a very... "Authentic" feeling to it.\n\nPros:\nArtwork - The artwork is beautifully drawn and everything is nicely animated. Even though a bit simple at times, even the simplicity of it all seems to blend in perfectly with everything.\nMusic - The soundtrack is nice and gives off an appropriate vibe considering the setting, but it's not incredible. It's nice, really, but it could have been a bit more diverse.\nStory & Character development - The story and character development are amazing. Even though they have small flaws, everything seems somehow inevitable and most of the time you are basically doing everything to make the best out of an impossible situation. That's the real struggle. Doing the best you can - no matter how bad it is.\nThe characters are nicely designed and some of them actually evolve in unexpected ways, even if they do scream cliché at times.\nSkills and attributes - These go hand to hand with their usability in combat (which I will explain below) and how much you really need to think about when you upgrade them.\nCombat - I assume that we've all seen this type of combat by now and its basics should come as no surprise to anyone. I like the general combat style, but what I love about it are some small touches that make it... Unique. Crippling the armour of an enemy is generally optional in games, but not here. No way. If you want to actually have a chance at slaying Dredge, then you really need to buff up your armor breaking. Also damaging an opponent will not only hurt them physically and take down their hp, but will also reduce the damage they do.I like the fact that the game forces you to weigh your decisions carefully, most of the time having to choose either damaging an opponent with a small burst for the moment or simply working your way until being able to constantly damage them for higher values.\nCons:\nVoice acting - Although sometimes done well, a large part of the voice acting in the game could do with improving. Of course, it's understandable seeing how the actors were chosen and the fact that Stoic didn't exactly have an immense budget for this project.\nDecisions - This is the type of game which is, for the most part, story-driven. Generally the types of fans that play this type of game are the ones that expect their role and their decisions in the to be important. It is exactly the type of game from which fans expect every decision to be important and to have significant consequences. Don't get me wrong, they're important, obviously, but I wish that some of the decisions that ulteriorly end up with the same result to have some more depth to them. The fact that quite often anything you choose to do will lead you through the same events is not what bothers me. What bothers me is that the game is quite transparent about that and lets it off quite easily.\nCharacter leveling - I really think that they should have sticked to the standard form of leveling (Everyone who's still standing at the end of the fight will get exp), buuut they didn't. Instead you gain exp for dealing the killing blow on enemies. Normally that wouldn't be so bad, but it's just so much easier for some characters to get the kil than others, that it basically makes the process of leveling certain classes very, very difficult. There's always that one big guy, with the two-hander that comes in and beats the crap out of everything that's still standing.\nEquipment - Well, there's really not much I can say about the equipemnt section because it didn't actually stand out. I expected equipmented rooted into the lore of the game that can help an immense deal, but I actually got a lot of items which could situationally help... Somtimes. Some items are good, sure, but not really that much. The difference they make isn't all that noticeable if you spend your points properly.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a great game, definitely worth buying if you enjoy your good ol' tacitacal turn-based. But it's more than that. It's actually a great buy if you simply enjoy a good story. Combat isn't all that difficult and it's easy to get into, even if it does, at times, get a bit tiring (I'm talking about you, people who want to try out every possible path and never want any characters to get knocked out.","August 4, 2014","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved it.\n\nThe gameplay is just rock solid in all respects If I had to describe how the game plays in one sentence, I would have to say it plays like "Xcom" meeting the dialouge trees of "Mass Effect" with small bits of "Monster Loves You" wrapped in a giant Norse blanket. While it sounds stupid, it is the best description I could think of. The game has three basic activities: fighting, talking, and caring.\n\nFights are handled as a turn based strategy game. There is a large grid and you have an overhead view of your units (usally around five or six units) and your goal is to kill anything that is not one of your units. Units of course have varied abilities, sizes, and each unit can level up. Overall, the strategy part plays into the strengths of the genre and doesn't venture to far outisde of them. There is no permadeath, but on difficulties above easy players that are knocked out on the battlefield will require time to heal and be at there greatest strength.\n\nNow what helps this game stand out are the dialouge sections of the game. Between fights you will engage in conversations with the people around you and make decisions about, well, many things. This can determine the kind of fights you get into, the members in your party or how other future events play out. It helps that the dialouge is well written. Just keep in mind that it is presented in mostly drawings with no voice acting. It did not bother me in the slightest, but it may bother some possibly.\n\nThe other part of the game is traveling on the road and taking care of the day to day events. In these sections, your caravan is shown traveling across a large landscape and blocks of text popup every once in a while describing something that has happened and giving you choices of how to react to it. These sections also can change the fights you have and your party members among other things. They are nice down times between the action and help give the game the feeling that the journey really is a struggle.\n\nI overall adored this game. While the presentation was simple, it was strikingly beautiful and bolstered up by the strong mechanics surrounding it. If you like story based games and don't hate strategy games either, pick this up.","February 14, 2014","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat put a great spin on the turn based strategy game with its use of health as your attack stat, causing combat to flow a lot differently than say XCOM.  It also has an Oregon Trail feel, as not combat parts of the game flow very similar to that.  The game tends to be very heavy, as you often make hard choices.  I found myself having to give it a break here and there just because the wieght of my decision got to me. In my opinion a must play.

Every decision you make in the game is important and a lot of the conversation choices could result in the death of a character over another in some cases.\n\nIt shows this was made by some of the oldschool Bioware guys who have since left that company.  The story and characters are all very interesting and I've only scratched the surface of the game.\n\nThe artwork and music stand out in this game more than any other I've played.  The art is only 2d but it's some of the most beautiful 2d artwork I've seen.  The music is perfect and fits the art with a very viking feeling to it.  The incombat animation is very smooth and looks great.\n\nThe gameplay reminds me of old FF and Suikoden games where you have many different heroes with different job classes.  There are as far as I can tell about 17 different job classes each with it's own special abilities.  Every character you get can be ranked up, have an item equiped etc.\n\nIf you are a turn based strategy, with a bit of RPG fan I highly highly recommend picking this game up.\n\nFinal Note:  This game has an auto save feature, which means not being able to save the game at every decision, making them far more important in the longrun.  Save Scummers beware, this is not the game for you.","January 14, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The turn-based combat is conducted on a "game board" with square spaces for your units to occupy. Truthfully, The Banner Saga's combat works well enough, but it's not anything special - there's nothing innovative or exceptional about it. It serves its purpose well enough, is fun, and offers some challenge. What makes The Banner Saga so wonderful is just about everything else about it.\nIt's difficult to summarize all of the aspects The Banner Saga does really well. Right off the bat however, you'll probably notice both the art and audio of the game are fantastic.\nIt's rare to find a game that creates a unique artistic vision and implements it so well, while still managing to include a great, effective soundtrack. It's probably fair to say a lot of games struggle with nailing either one of these, let alone both. But, The Banner Saga creates a beautiful, deeply atmospheric experience with its classically inspired animation visuals and moving soundtrack. Of course, this could be all for nothing if it's being used to prop-up a weak story; fortunately, it isn't.\nIf I'm being honest, I don't think I could name another game that comes close to creating such an oppressive story and atmosphere. The pacing of The Banner Saga is excellent; there's a true feeling of dread and desperation constantly building from chapter to chapter as you try to make (what you think are) the best decisions for your caravan, while fighting through seemingly impossible odds. This is a game full of choices - who to accept into your caravan, who to help, when and where to camp, who to take with you into battle - there are many, often tough, decisions that you'll have to make. All of these decisions are presented well, and all of them have consequences, some dire. This makes each playthrough potentially unique.\nIn The Banner Saga, the world is crashing down around you, and you're left facing insurmountable odds. It will be up to you to lead men, women, and varl. You'll make many decisions, some of which you may come to regret. The world of The Banner Saga is bleak and grim. It's hard not to look at this game with a sense of both wonder and despair, and for that it's impossible for me not to recommend it.","August 16, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It managed to do so with an amazing live score, voice acting, and beautiful artwork to boot.  I came to really appreciate the characters and even became invested in them as was revealed by certain turns in the plot.  I like the mechanic pretty well, but compared to other tactics RPG's the options for fighting seem somewhat limited.\n\nThe whole game isn't based around fighting, though.

If you take the time to invest yourself in each character, you really start to feel their plight as the game moves forward.\n\nUnfortunately, getting invested in the characters is difficult because of the large amount of text presented to the player in conversations. I know full voice-over for a game of this scope (and a small development team) is very expensive, but it's just a bit jarring to go from enthralling VO to text choices.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game that tells a great story in a beautiful setting.

Progression happens at a slow, steady march. Battles are fought with fewer units, and higher stakes.\n- The map is extremely tolkien-esque, and packed with exquisite lore. This is a detailed, reactive world that you can get lost in. The developers understand that the more you know about a setting, the more emotionally invested you'll be.\n- It's a joy to retrain your strategy instincts for this game. The mechanics are innovative, unusual. Character stats such as strength, armor and willpower don't mean what strategy/RPG game veterans might assume they mean.\n- The game is balanced very, very well. Persistently difficult, but fair, with a long smooth learning curve.\n\nThe feature of the game that is most obvious is the art. Almost every screen from the battles to the menus looks and feels like a high-resolution, blu-ray remastering of a rotoscoped 80's animated film. What strikes me, though, is how well the art, the writing, and the game are unified in their artistic vision.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shattered_time/recommended/237990/","shattered_time","Ninstrument","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shattered_time/","38 products in account","So this game....is great! I have many kind words to say about this and being a huge Final Fantasy Tactics(SRPG's for that matter) fan this was a real treat to see on Steam's front page one day. I have some things about the game I love and I have some things about the game...well that I actually hate. Yes, it has left that much distaste in my mouth haha but thats not to discourage you. It is most likely something formed from my biased and practically purist views of SRPG's.\n\n\n\nSo first, the things I love ^_^\n\n1-The Art\nCant say enough about this, its phenomenal and its like being in an interactive Disney game of brutality and brings me back to the SegaCD days and old PC of point and click adventure/exploring days. I could easily say; play this game to just be immensed inside this beautiful game.\n\n2-The Music\nIt's very well composed and suited for everything thats going on in this story and era its cast in. I'm a musician/composer myself and cant help but appreciate it from that sense, but I would imagine most people who arent into music would only be pulled into the feelings of this game easier similar to a Hollywood movie.\n\n3-SRPG Elements\nWell..... I love this aspect of the game and its 90% of the reason I bought this game. I've played every SRPG I can get my hands on from Fire Emblem series and Final Fantasy Tactics to the overly diluted systems of Ogre Tactics and Disgaea. While I prefer a system that is well thought out with its boundaries and expansions within its systems, I do sometimes prefer a bit more of openness in the system such as Disgaea, but my mind tends to grow bored with endless options as everything becomes bland quicker than key roles that tend to shine within a system with some boundaries.\n\nBack to this game though, its set up a bit differently. The classes are chosen ahead of time, if you can even call them classes, more like roles from the characters backgrounds. Archers,Bruisers,Tanks,Lancers,etc are some things you can expect to see early game. All with their own special moves and ranges on the map as well as movement across the map.\n\n4-The Story Telling\nIts great and very reminiscent of a great game that allows you to feel as if you have some control of the outlook of the characters,story,and ending. Games that come to mind are those of the Bethesda Series of Fallout and Elder Scrolls. Killing of key characters, ignoring causes for better or worse, choosing to help yourself or others, choosing sides/factions, and moving your "Army" around the map to different encounters...well its all here. While I love this open book approach and multiple answer dialogue options I can definitely feel the sting of any choice I make afterwards.\n\nSo onto ....the hated aspects.\n\n1-SRPG Elements Constrainments\nThis game has control of your progression...very tightly. I'm only assuming the developers wanted control of how you progress and made this decision intentionally. Since I dont appreciate the restriction personally, I disagree with the direction almost entirely. I know building those mechanics would take a lot of hours to put in place and could have been a budget decision or they could have wanted this part to be light and not focused on heavily by the player. I just cant help but want to(ignoring the fact that i'm a veteran and have lots of things to compare this system to) considering you are fighting...well 75% of the time and you are always ALWAYS at a disadvantage. Not a single fight in this game are you evenly matched none the less above the enemy. So with no way inside their system to really cater to your playing style, I find myself getting irritated with the lack of in the system. Its presence is there, but its faint.\n\n2-No Saving\nEverytime I make a decision that affects something important, I prefer to be secure in my decision. I'm aware...Life doesnt have a pause button and once things are said and actions are done, the ripples around are permanent. But this isnt life, its a game. I prefer (personally) to have control over the game having control. So the lack of saving makes this...well a bit irritating. If you are similar to me then you too will be annoyed by the lack of this function. I dont play through Fallout 3 five times and make a different decision everytime I do something important. I would rather save and see what each option does. Personal way of playing and I wont claim its anything else. Its not right its not wrong, I just know I'm not the only person who does things this way with dialogue option heavy games such as this.\n\nOn top of that, its an autosave system. So lets say you make a decision and you think things were going well, you win the battle, you lose it, whatever. A character you've placed an item on,used your points on to level up,etc dies and you find out through dialogue. They are GONE. Caput. Reload your previous save to try and win the battle? Nope. Reload to make a different decision in dialogue? Nope. Outcome permanent.\n\nNow that i've said that, I have to say there are some kind of ways around this. For one, it autosaves in multiple areas so if you can escape before the dialogue is done and reload there are more than one times I've used this to go back before the new autosave has saved the ripples in the ocean. Also it seems(if I recall right) when you quit abruptly(ouside of battle of course) it makes a save point at that direct point of leisure. So you can constantly quit the game and reload to beat this system. But this is....well redundant. There should simply be an intuitive save function in place to save yourself the annoyance.\n\nOn a final note, its my impression that the developers wanted you to push past these losses as they are constantly letting you know you are in an ocean that you have no control over and you will gain/lose characters often due to storyline but when you lose an invested in warrior to a minor choiceits nothing more than annoying.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nIts a great game and one many will love. I'm very happy to play what I have of this game and I plan on finishing it all the way through. Do I plan on playing it twice or more to see the other options? No. No. and No. But I feel compelled to see the rest of the story and love looking at this game. Not to mention it actually plays flawlessly and is very well developed in all aspects minus my disagreements with the character progression system and resource management. Play it if you like games similar to FFT and Fire Emblem and make your own opinion, I strongly urge this. Thank you Stoic for your modern SRPG and I look forward to your future works and to see you mature as a developer.","March 15, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has an intense storyline that makes the player really feel the urgency of the characters. Part of this is due to the way "renown," or the game's version of XP works. Renown can either be spent leveling up your characters OR on supplies to keep people alive -- and there's never quite enough renown to go around. The use of scarce resources works really well into the storyline and even more into the player's decisions of what to do. I'm not really much of a tactical combat fan so I was surprised by how much I really enjoyed the game.\n\nThe best part, however, are the really amazing visuals (outside of cutscenes). I plan on playing through the game a second time just so I can screencap some of the scenes. And even better than the graphics? The music.\n\nReally the only thing I could complain about is that the end of the game doesn't really feel like an ending. It's more of a resolution to the current situation than a resolution to the entire storyline.

The Banner Saga has some of the most beautiful art I have ever seen in a video game, and with a fantastic soundtrack (which I can't get enough of), it's a great accomplishment. But that's not all at what this game excels, because it's RPG/tactic combat and difficult choices to make, are also something I strongly praise. However, even with such a great formula, I can't overlook the fact, that it feels rushed and incomplete. There are some rare moments of voice acted animated scenes, but only in the beginning, and are nowhere to be found even near the end of the game. Also in some parts of the game you just know that things were suppose to be much bigger, but due to some kind of constrains, they ended up as they are.

This title has such a mesmorizing score and astonishing artwork. Let's not forget about the  characters. Combining all that with the impressively well done story leaves you with an immersion one would not expect from an adventure game.\n\nYou are the leader of your clansmen and during your adventure you encounter numerious trials and tribulations, many which will leave you questioning your morale compass. To name a few: Starving strangers, backstabbers, gluttony, schemers, gender equality, racism. How will you deal with them in each encounter? How will you deal with troublemakers in your caravan? I found this to be very much like The Walking Dead mixed with Oregon/Organ Trail in terms of the choices you are make!\n\nThe game eases you into the story and gameplay mechanics. The turn-based combat system is very easy to understand with a steep learning curve. Players who are familiar with tabletop, armor values, attack values, etc won't have as much trouble. The difficulty is in the risk factor. There are two values, Strength and Shield; Strength is for attack value and health while Shield is your armor value that reduces incoming Strength attacks. Despite how this all looks really simple, it's a lot more complicated. I had a very interesting time learning how to maximize the effectiveness of combat. There is also a limited resource called Will that you can exert your troops to more further or deal more damage. Do you weaken the enemy shield first before dealing a swift deathly blow or do you attack their strength and make them deal less damage in return?\n\nI am a huge fan of the story and setting. I love Norse mytho and Banner Saga has numerous hints of it as inspiration. I'm also fond of many of the characters personalities and how well detailed they are. They have layers of complexion and every single one of them have their own goals/motives/opinions; strangers can become allies, allies can become enemies. However, looking back, I wasn't able to bond with most of the characters...strange.\n\nI cannot applaud the developers enough. This here, The Banner Saga, is a work of art. I cannot sing enough praise.","January 22, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I LOVED the art.  I'm halfway through my second playthrough.  The plot was confusing for a while, with many characters and locations introduced in quick succession, but I got into it after an hour or two.  Waay too many loading screens.  The game (when you aren't in combat) is all dialogue, or "choose your own adventure" style dialogue choices, or uninteractive video of your caravan moving from place to place, or a picture of a location you're temporarily staying at with a few locations to click on and visit.  Character and inventory management is simple.  Lots of character classes, each with their own unique power, which keeps the combat fresh throughout the game.  The "caravan" mechanic is unique and interesting but shallow.  There are several events that only occur if your caravan has high/low morale, and "war" battles are easier or harder depending on how many fighters you have, but that's pretty much it.  The game has a pretty short campaign that ends abruptly with no resolution to the major plot threads.  There are some unexpected plot twists and upsets and hard choices where the outcome can be permanent loss of characters in your party.  I enjoyed the story so I didn't care, but I could see getting irritated when you lose a character you like because of a single dialogue choice.  You have no warning about what characters are going to show up in later parts of the game, so you will likely waste points leveling up characters who will disappear later.  This game doesn't even visit half of the locations listed on its large detailed map. I only played single-player.  I hope they release followup campaigns.","March 20, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The battle system takes a little getting used to (I kept failing to get my raned units within range of the enemy at first), but is very good. The story and choices are the main part of the game for me though, as they're more engaing than the battles. I definately agree wuth the comparison to GoT as you do feel characters may be killed off at any moment if you aren't careful.  One decision I actually decided to sleep on as I knew it would probably be a bit of a game changer and I was torn between two options.\n\nThe only thing I would say is a big downside to the game is that it is the 1st part of a trilogy so the game stops very suddenly. The price and the descrition do not prepare you for this and some people may feel a bit ripped off by it as you aren't getting a full game.

When enemies cluster it is difficult to tell what is going on. I really need to rotate a camera for this. Which brings in the second issue. You sometimes make movement pathing errors. You can't take these back, there is no undo so you can get screwed by no undo for just basic movement when you haven't taken any skill / combat actions.\n\nBesides these two flaws.

Combat is well polished, the art gorgeous. Definitely have a new favorite.","January 17, 2014","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meganerd18/recommended/237990/","meganerd18","MegaNerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meganerd18/","86 products in account","This game is one of those ever increasingly rare games that prove video games can be more than just a few hours of entertainment, they can be interactive art. the art style is incredible and animations are pretty well done, and the decisions you make the whole way are gut wrenching and could either help save you, or cause you problems. Trust this person, or this person, and if you trust the wrong one, then you could get betrayed. Sacrifice your travelling companions for your combat party, or risk yourselves for the better good. It truly started making me start questioning every decision, and really makes you question yourself as a leader.\n\nRook, basically the main character (theres a bunch of little storylines in there, but you are mostly playing as Rook), was simply a hunter, seeking to live a safe quiet life while protecting his daughter, when suddenly you are attacked and the leader of your small village is killed, and suddenly, everyone looks to you as the new leader. Thrust into your sudden leadership role, you must make tough decisions, that only get tougher as you go from leading a mere couple of dozen people to leading over 300-400+, all while seeking to protect the group and your daughter, and seek salvation.\n\nAs for the combat, the strategy is a bit tough to get used to, but incredibly well done, and makes you start depending on your team, but that can go badly if you make a poor decision and get one of those main allies killed. Leveling up is well done, especially since your "Renown" which you have to spend each time you level up and buy stuff like supplies and items, is not gained in huge amounts, but not gained in small amounts, making more decisions on whether you want to level up now, or spend some renown to get some more food supplies, which you might need, or risk running out of food before the next opportunity to get more.\n\nAs for the length, I found the game pleasently long, but not too long as to feel boring. The interesting interactions going on between characters made me not even notice how long I'd be playing, and that is something I really like. The other thing is that due to the sheer amount of choices you have, I almost want to go back through and play again just to make different choices.\n\nHowever, about the one issue i had with this game is whenever you are travelling, all you can do is simply watch, and the environment is not much to watch, and there are times where you will travel for like 2 game days without anything happening, which kind of kills the pace of the game at times.\n\nOverall, I very highly recommend this game. It's more than just a game, its truly what makes gaming great, showing that games can be art and entertaining.","January 21, 2014","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Beautiful character and scenario design, simply flawless, the sort of thing you wish disney made an epic animation. Although characters have their own personalities and philosophies, the lack of voice acting spoils the experience during dialogue parts a bit. Investing your renown on characters that suddenly leave your host of fighters is rather disappointing. The story and the world's own mythology which supports it are incredibly interesting, the map exposing a little bit of information of every element is stunning, but the game final scene brings and abrupt end for this rather short chapter, leaving most of the main conflict and most of the world unexplored when those features are already revealed there. It gives you the feeling that this planned 'trilogy' could have been released all together in a single bigger game. Also. Vikings.

I play it on PC too with no problems. It runs great, plays very well with other apps, slipping in and out of full screen nicely (at least on OS X Mavericks). It's also gorgeous. And hard... very hard. There are few games I've dropped back to easy mode on but I was getting so frustrated with not being able to progress in the story that I did. And it has still been challenging. Lots of branches in the story and different characters to level so the replayability looks very good. Did I mention it's gorgeous?\n\nMaybe it's because I'm a father with a daughter of my own, but I also found the storyline between Rook and Alette to be quite touching. There is little actual spoken dialogue but what there is makes me wish they had been able to do more, especially for some of the characters, not just the narrator.\n\nI think the only thing that bothers me a little sometimes is the isometric view can get a bit mucky in big fights with a lot of characters and I would love to be able to see things easier. I think that is the only gripe I can think of. I hope the people that made this game keep making more.

This is no simple "tank and spank" game, you have to take into account many factors which soon become second nature in the course of a fight.\n\nThe story is beautiful, not because of it's content but because of how it is told; the game plays out like a Tolkein or Robert Jordan story, with many perspectives that change with the decisions made and the continuing life of death of a character.\n\nThe best part is knowing I can go back a try again, and the story will change from what I did before.\nI just put in six hours only to find myself outnumbered and on the verge of death, and i have no problem starting over to fix my mistakes as new options will open up to me.  not to mention the challenge of getting Egil to live through the whole damn game, that boy is the biggest freaking target ever.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 9 out of 10, its wonderful and iconic with very few flaws, but somtimes it can become its own worst enemy.","January 21, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The entire game sounds fantastic from the heavy beating of drums to the triumphant bellow of horns the entire sounds epic from start to finish.\nAs I said before the game really feels like a great mix of turn based tactics and Oregon trail. Combat takes place on a grid and you and the enemy take turns bashing each other. With each character having different strengths and weaknesses and a simple yet deeping twist on how your units health works the game really makes you feel accomplished for each and ever battle you win. That is a good thing because honestly this like to give you a bad hand a lot.\nThe other half of the game is the traveling part, as you and your viking caravan cross mountians and icy wastes you must deal with a number of issues such as "Do we have enough food?" "Can we trust these strangers we just met?" The game makes you choose and everything you do has an effect on the caravan as a whole. Letting some strangers join you might mean they steal a bunch of the food in the night and then suddenly you are in the middle of nowhere and people are starving to death right and left as you push forward. You must make tough choices often times sacrificing one resource or another while trying to keep the people and warriors you take on in good spirits.\n\nIn the end the Banner saga is a deep game with rich lore and a enduring characters and it's a adventure worth taking.","January 21, 2014","true","45.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(And who doesn't love vikings?)\n\nIt has a great story and quite an unique art style. People tend to forget how immersive animation can be in both video games and movies/series, I mean.. How often do you see an animated game these days?\n\nWhile you are travelling the land with your caravan you'll never get bored of the background.. it so addicting to watch at, same goes for your caraven which increases in size in time.. it is kind of satisfying seeing all those people march with you upfront.\n\nThe music is incredible nicely song and again.. immersive, I did notice a lack off of it while travelling with the caravan sometimes though. But beautiful nonetheless it grabs all the dangerous and emotional moments.\n\n\nChoices are rather important in the story.. If you make a certain choice one of your hero characters can suddenly betray you or your army gets sick by picking fruit from certain trees. Also don't let too many people join your caravan no matter how nice it might seem. (You will run out of supplies and most of them will starve to death!)\n\n\nThe combat gameplay itself isn't that impressive but..

Every decision you make in the game is important and a lot of the conversation choices could result in the death of a character over another in some cases.\n\nIt shows this was made by some of the oldschool Bioware guys who have since left that company.  The story and characters are all very interesting and I've only scratched the surface of the game.\n\nThe artwork and music stand out in this game more than any other I've played.  The art is only 2d but it's some of the most beautiful 2d artwork I've seen.  The music is perfect and fits the art with a very viking feeling to it.  The incombat animation is very smooth and looks great.\n\nThe gameplay reminds me of old FF and Suikoden games where you have many different heroes with different job classes.  There are as far as I can tell about 17 different job classes each with it's own special abilities.  Every character you get can be ranked up, have an item equiped etc.\n\nIf you are a turn based strategy, with a bit of RPG fan I highly highly recommend picking this game up.\n\nFinal Note:  This game has an auto save feature, which means not being able to save the game at every decision, making them far more important in the longrun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shattered_time/recommended/237990/","shattered_time","Ninstrument","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shattered_time/","38 products in account","So this game....is great! I have many kind words to say about this and being a huge Final Fantasy Tactics(SRPG's for that matter) fan this was a real treat to see on Steam's front page one day. I have some things about the game I love and I have some things about the game...well that I actually hate. Yes, it has left that much distaste in my mouth haha but thats not to discourage you. It is most likely something formed from my biased and practically purist views of SRPG's.\n\n\n\nSo first, the things I love ^_^\n\n1-The Art\nCant say enough about this, its phenomenal and its like being in an interactive Disney game of brutality and brings me back to the SegaCD days and old PC of point and click adventure/exploring days. I could easily say; play this game to just be immensed inside this beautiful game.\n\n2-The Music\nIt's very well composed and suited for everything thats going on in this story and era its cast in. I'm a musician/composer myself and cant help but appreciate it from that sense, but I would imagine most people who arent into music would only be pulled into the feelings of this game easier similar to a Hollywood movie.\n\n3-SRPG Elements\nWell..... I love this aspect of the game and its 90% of the reason I bought this game. I've played every SRPG I can get my hands on from Fire Emblem series and Final Fantasy Tactics to the overly diluted systems of Ogre Tactics and Disgaea. While I prefer a system that is well thought out with its boundaries and expansions within its systems, I do sometimes prefer a bit more of openness in the system such as Disgaea, but my mind tends to grow bored with endless options as everything becomes bland quicker than key roles that tend to shine within a system with some boundaries.\n\nBack to this game though, its set up a bit differently. The classes are chosen ahead of time, if you can even call them classes, more like roles from the characters backgrounds. Archers,Bruisers,Tanks,Lancers,etc are some things you can expect to see early game. All with their own special moves and ranges on the map as well as movement across the map.\n\n4-The Story Telling\nIts great and very reminiscent of a great game that allows you to feel as if you have some control of the outlook of the characters,story,and ending. Games that come to mind are those of the Bethesda Series of Fallout and Elder Scrolls. Killing of key characters, ignoring causes for better or worse, choosing to help yourself or others, choosing sides/factions, and moving your "Army" around the map to different encounters...well its all here. While I love this open book approach and multiple answer dialogue options I can definitely feel the sting of any choice I make afterwards.\n\nSo onto ....the hated aspects.\n\n1-SRPG Elements Constrainments\nThis game has control of your progression...very tightly. I'm only assuming the developers wanted control of how you progress and made this decision intentionally. Since I dont appreciate the restriction personally, I disagree with the direction almost entirely. I know building those mechanics would take a lot of hours to put in place and could have been a budget decision or they could have wanted this part to be light and not focused on heavily by the player. I just cant help but want to(ignoring the fact that i'm a veteran and have lots of things to compare this system to) considering you are fighting...well 75% of the time and you are always ALWAYS at a disadvantage. Not a single fight in this game are you evenly matched none the less above the enemy. So with no way inside their system to really cater to your playing style, I find myself getting irritated with the lack of in the system. Its presence is there, but its faint.\n\n2-No Saving\nEverytime I make a decision that affects something important, I prefer to be secure in my decision. I'm aware...Life doesnt have a pause button and once things are said and actions are done, the ripples around are permanent. But this isnt life, its a game. I prefer (personally) to have control over the game having control. So the lack of saving makes this...well a bit irritating. If you are similar to me then you too will be annoyed by the lack of this function. I dont play through Fallout 3 five times and make a different decision everytime I do something important. I would rather save and see what each option does. Personal way of playing and I wont claim its anything else. Its not right its not wrong, I just know I'm not the only person who does things this way with dialogue option heavy games such as this.\n\nOn top of that, its an autosave system. So lets say you make a decision and you think things were going well, you win the battle, you lose it, whatever. A character you've placed an item on,used your points on to level up,etc dies and you find out through dialogue. They are GONE. Caput. Reload your previous save to try and win the battle? Nope. Reload to make a different decision in dialogue? Nope. Outcome permanent.\n\nNow that i've said that, I have to say there are some kind of ways around this. For one, it autosaves in multiple areas so if you can escape before the dialogue is done and reload there are more than one times I've used this to go back before the new autosave has saved the ripples in the ocean. Also it seems(if I recall right) when you quit abruptly(ouside of battle of course) it makes a save point at that direct point of leisure. So you can constantly quit the game and reload to beat this system. But this is....well redundant. There should simply be an intuitive save function in place to save yourself the annoyance.\n\nOn a final note, its my impression that the developers wanted you to push past these losses as they are constantly letting you know you are in an ocean that you have no control over and you will gain/lose characters often due to storyline but when you lose an invested in warrior to a minor choiceits nothing more than annoying.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nIts a great game and one many will love. I'm very happy to play what I have of this game and I plan on finishing it all the way through. Do I plan on playing it twice or more to see the other options? No. No. and No. But I feel compelled to see the rest of the story and love looking at this game. Not to mention it actually plays flawlessly and is very well developed in all aspects minus my disagreements with the character progression system and resource management. Play it if you like games similar to FFT and Fire Emblem and make your own opinion, I strongly urge this. Thank you Stoic for your modern SRPG and I look forward to your future works and to see you mature as a developer.","March 15, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I LOVED the art.  I'm halfway through my second playthrough.  The plot was confusing for a while, with many characters and locations introduced in quick succession, but I got into it after an hour or two.  Waay too many loading screens.  The game (when you aren't in combat) is all dialogue, or "choose your own adventure" style dialogue choices, or uninteractive video of your caravan moving from place to place, or a picture of a location you're temporarily staying at with a few locations to click on and visit.  Character and inventory management is simple.  Lots of character classes, each with their own unique power, which keeps the combat fresh throughout the game.  The "caravan" mechanic is unique and interesting but shallow.  There are several events that only occur if your caravan has high/low morale, and "war" battles are easier or harder depending on how many fighters you have, but that's pretty much it.  The game has a pretty short campaign that ends abruptly with no resolution to the major plot threads.  There are some unexpected plot twists and upsets and hard choices where the outcome can be permanent loss of characters in your party.  I enjoyed the story so I didn't care, but I could see getting irritated when you lose a character you like because of a single dialogue choice.  You have no warning about what characters are going to show up in later parts of the game, so you will likely waste points leveling up characters who will disappear later.  This game doesn't even visit half of the locations listed on its large detailed map. I only played single-player.  I hope they release followup campaigns.","March 20, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The battle system takes a little getting used to (I kept failing to get my raned units within range of the enemy at first), but is very good. The story and choices are the main part of the game for me though, as they're more engaing than the battles. I definately agree wuth the comparison to GoT as you do feel characters may be killed off at any moment if you aren't careful.  One decision I actually decided to sleep on as I knew it would probably be a bit of a game changer and I was torn between two options.\n\nThe only thing I would say is a big downside to the game is that it is the 1st part of a trilogy so the game stops very suddenly. The price and the descrition do not prepare you for this and some people may feel a bit ripped off by it as you aren't getting a full game. However I got it on sale so don't mind as much (although I am dying to know what happens next). I would say Steam should make a note of this being a "Part 1" so people know the emotional turmoil they will be in upon finishing the game.","March 18, 2014","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Thank you to everyone who "Kickstarted" this beautiful gem. The art, story and music completely pulls you in to this dark and wintery world full of beared humans and horned giants struggling to survive. Getting use to the combat takes a bit of trial and error, but there is something about the mechanics that i prefer over other grid based games. There are minimum dice rolls, so it feels much more like chess where positioning of units are vital.\n\nThe game does have some flaws though. Keeping your caravan alive and well fed while leveling up your units is a pain.. yet there is little consequence other than low morale when you start losing clansmen due to no supplies.

It has a fairly unique mechanic that, while not the most entertaining in the world, is paced well, and both thought provoking (to ensure that you can keep functioning well as a party you have to think about what you do in each and every combat) and fun. Outside of combat, the "overland" mechanical business of actually running a caravan is a very interesting challenge that really made me think about my choices. Especially towards the ending where the choices get significantly harder to make, and it becomes much more apparent that being the "good guy" won't always be the best choice of action. The story is excellent and well written. To be quite honest this is one of a very few games that has actually made me cry. Artisitically this game is stunning.

The score, the sounds, the visual style, and the writing all work together beautifully to tell the story of a merciless world falling apart. It's tense and you're always on the verge of annihilation, and the music alone could tell you so. It's gritty, and the crunches of axes breaking armor and the grunts and moans of the injured make you feel it. People are fragile and the perpetual march is exhausting, and the heavy shambling motions of bodies shows you so.  As the leader, you constantly have to arbitrate the problems of your followers, keep them optimistic, keep them fed, and keep them alive while a continent of panicking and desperate people is being overrun.  Everything harmoniously comes together to weave an atmosphere where feelings of dread and anxiety are constant. Your choice isn't whether or not people die, it's who dies now so that fewer will die later.  In every artistic regard this game is an achievement.\n\nUnfortunately it's not for everyone, though. Its roots are in the artistry, not the gameplay--people have some valid complaints about that. Only some. I didn't dislike the gameplay at all, but I was very wrapped up in every other part of the game.\n\nPlay it for the experience.","February 14, 2015","true","107.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The strategic part is very basic and isn't more complex than a game of checkers. Also the user interface is really abysmal, the worst I've ever seen in a strategic game. For example you can't inspect your team members attributes and abilities when choosing who to bring in battle. While in battle the interface isn't better and choosing the action to perform feels very cheap. Abilities are described "with text" like a game from 20 years ago, no icons and no visual aids. Very very basic.\nDespite all this I still recommend the game; why? Because the story is tragic and mature like it rarely happens in games lately. It is really up to Norse Myths standards... The music is a masterpiece that is alone worth the price of the game and the experience, as whole, feels like a work of love from its developers.

This title has such a mesmorizing score and astonishing artwork. Let's not forget about the  characters. Combining all that with the impressively well done story leaves you with an immersion one would not expect from an adventure game.\n\nYou are the leader of your clansmen and during your adventure you encounter numerious trials and tribulations, many which will leave you questioning your morale compass. To name a few: Starving strangers, backstabbers, gluttony, schemers, gender equality, racism. How will you deal with them in each encounter? How will you deal with troublemakers in your caravan? I found this to be very much like The Walking Dead mixed with Oregon/Organ Trail in terms of the choices you are make!\n\nThe game eases you into the story and gameplay mechanics. The turn-based combat system is very easy to understand with a steep learning curve. Players who are familiar with tabletop, armor values, attack values, etc won't have as much trouble. The difficulty is in the risk factor. There are two values, Strength and Shield; Strength is for attack value and health while Shield is your armor value that reduces incoming Strength attacks. Despite how this all looks really simple, it's a lot more complicated. I had a very interesting time learning how to maximize the effectiveness of combat. There is also a limited resource called Will that you can exert your troops to more further or deal more damage. Do you weaken the enemy shield first before dealing a swift deathly blow or do you attack their strength and make them deal less damage in return?\n\nI am a huge fan of the story and setting. I love Norse mytho and Banner Saga has numerous hints of it as inspiration. I'm also fond of many of the characters personalities and how well detailed they are. They have layers of complexion and every single one of them have their own goals/motives/opinions; strangers can become allies, allies can become enemies. However, looking back, I wasn't able to bond with most of the characters...strange.\n\nI cannot applaud the developers enough. This here, The Banner Saga, is a work of art.

Starting with the obvious, the landscapes and soundtrack are both breathtaking and plain epic. But what what really reeled me in, even more than the wonderful and immersive atmosphere, is the storyline. Twisted, and relying so very much on the player's choices. You often don't know where you're going, what to decide, whom you should trust or not, and must rely on your own judgement (often wrong !) and guts to advance. It is such a pleasure to feel like you're are actually choosing, or creating your own path rather than following the same patterns as always ; and it's not so often that a game really makes you think twice about a choice that will (maybe) haunt you until the end...

The fights are hard without feeling unfair. Resource management is amazingly difficult. The story and dialogues are well written and captivating. The art is beautiful and the soundtrack is simply amazing. The choices one has to face are hard but interesting and seem like they will suck me right back in when I return to the game. The voice acting is so well done that I wish that all of the dialogues would be spoken. The sound design just blew my mind in parts of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saber-scorpion/recommended/237990/","saber-scorpion","Saber-Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saber-scorpion/","79 products in account","The Banner Saga is a post-apocalyptic Viking Age Oregon Trail with fights. If you're still reading instead of buying this game on that description alone, fine - let's get serious: The Banner Saga is a story-driven, turn-based strategy-RPG with incredible art and music that oozes atmosphere and sucks you right into its bleak yet beautiful world.\n\nBasically the game tells the story of caravans of Nordic humans and horned giants called Varl struggling to survive after Ragnarok. The gods are dead. The sun has stopped moving in the sky. A great darkness is descending from the North, bringing with it an unstoppable host of mysterious stone creatures called Dredge. The game looks like a Disney animated feature (one of the good ones), but the story has more in common with Game of Thrones than Pocahontas, filled with old blood feuds, betrayal, and grey morality. The point of view switches back and forth a few times at first, getting the player acquainted with the many different characters. Players who aren't paying close attention may find themselves confused, especially in the dialogue scenes where it's not always made abundantly clear who is speaking.\n\nThe art in this game is gorgeous - just look at the screenshots. Unfortunately the only fully animated and voiced sequence comes at the very beginning, and all of the following dialogue scenes are silent and only minimally animated (blinking eyes, blowing hair, etc.). A bit more animation in the conversations - changing facial expressions to fit what is being said, for instance - would not have been amiss. But even so, everything looks fantastic, including the character animations in combat.\n\nThe sound is great too. One of the requisite Kickstarter "stretch goals" was to hire a live orchestra for composer Austin Wintory, and it shows. Some of the vocal elements weirded me out at times, but on the whole the soundtrack is outstanding, and perfectly complements the mood and setting of the game. There is very little voice work - mostly limited to narration - but all of it is good, if heavily accented.\n\nThere are two sides to the gameplay. Let's call them Oregon Trail and Gladius.\n\nIn the Oregon Trail parts, you will see your caravan trudging slowly over the picturesque landscape. As you travel, you will lose Supplies. Supplies can be purchased in towns using Renown, the other currency in the game, which is also used for leveling up characters and buying magic items (each character only has 1 inventory slot for 1 magic item). If you run out of supplies, then each day some of the people in your caravan will die. You can rest for 1 day's worth of supplies to improve your caravan's Morale. High morale will grant you bonus Willpower in combat. Random encounters pop up on the way, offering a series of choices. Choose carefully. I will talk more about the Choices & Consequences aspect of the game later.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from a those event choices, the Oregon Trail gameplay has little actual effect on the combat or the story. There are Steam achievements for managing your caravan well, but otherwise you can let everyone die and still finish the game, since apparently your main characters are able to live without eating (?), and a bit of rest will still improve morale. It seems like that needs fixing to me.\n\nNow for the Gladius part of gameplay: the turn-based combat. It's an interesting system. Each unit has both Armor (blue) and Strength (red). You can attack a unit's Armor to make it more vulnerable to Strength attacks. Reducing a unit's Strength not only lowers its health but also its damage. Here's where things get interesting... As long as you both have at least 2 units alive, you and your opponent will always alternate turns. This means that, if you reduce an enemy unit's strength to 1, it's often better to leave it alive but crippled than to finish it off, because your enemy's turns will be wasted on these weak units. But even crippled units can still take you by surprise, and killing them grants you bonus Willpower points, so it's a strategy you have to learn to play just right.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is that I found the combat fun and challenging. Though it could benefit from added variety (each character only has one special ability), it's a solid and engaging system that makes you think. You can switch the difficulty mode at any time if combat feels too easy or hard. I found the standard difficulty perfect on my first playthrough, though that final boss battle was... we'll just say adequately frustrating.\n\nThe final boss is also the only fight of the game (I think) that you need to win. All other fights can be lost, and the story will continue without a game over screen. Though characters who fall in combat do not die if you win (they only become injured for a few days), losing combat too often can have an impact on the story that could possibly get characters killed.\n\nIn fact, let's talk Choices & Consequences, which to me is the most important aspect of any RPG or semi-RPG. Unfortunately, most of the choices in the Banner Saga story have a clear good option and several bad options. And I don't mean "good vs. evil" - the game does an excellent job of maintaining a grey morality. I mean "ideal choice" vs. "less ideal choices", instead of equally viable options with a mix of good and bad consequences. This is bad, because it encourages metagaming and savescumming in order to find the "right" choice.\n\nDespite this, the consequences of your choices aren't to be underestimated. While they won't change the overall path of the story (which, like your path of travel, is pre-determined and linear), some choices can have immediate, disastrous consequences like the loss of many supplies or the sudden permanent deaths of characters in your group. Others (especially one in particular) can have delayed consequences that you might not see coming much later in the story. Which is a good thing!\n\nSpeaking of savescumming, I should mention that this game has no manual save system - just a checkpoint system that creates separate saves at the start of each chapter. I'm tempted to call this a good thing, because it curbs the temptation to load frequently. And if there's one thing I can say for certain, it's that The Banner Saga is best played by going in blind and never loading your game, even if you lose a fight, especially since there are very few ways to get a true "game over" screen. You will get the most out of the story and the experience this way.\n\nAnd yes, it's an experience. The story builds up slowly, so stick it out through the first few parts and you'll be rewarded. You will fight and struggle to survive as resources dwindle, you will make tough choices and watch beloved companions die, as you lead your ragged fellowship to the bitter end. Only... it's not quite an ending, because this is only the first chapter of a planned three-chapter game. Sorry! Don't get me wrong; the story definitely reaches a satisfying climax. But it's fairly short, and you're left wondering what happens next. Guess we'll have to wait and see!\n\nThe Banner Saga is a relatively short and simple game, but it's a good one. Sure, it could be improved by things like non-linear map roaming, a branching story, and more unit abilities and terrain variety in combat. But I applaud the small team at Stoic for not being overly ambitious with their size and budget. They seem to have a clear vision of exactly the game they want to make, and they made it with passion. Nearly everything the Banner Saga tries to do, it does very well: outstanding art and music complement a unique and interesting epic story with solid writing, backed up by fun and challenging gameplay. What more can one ask for? Basically just more of it, but that should be on the way! Perhaps the next two chapters will bring added features and complexity too.","February 23, 2014","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

See, what this page kinda neglects to mention is this is part one of a planned trilogy. I mean, I don't think I can verbally describe to you the look of "what?" on my face when the credits rolled just after what felt like the end of the first act. And while I don't generally mind multi-part stories, I think each game should at least have a satisfying self-contained story that ties in with the larger story. One series I like to point to on that is Harry Potter. Each book in that series has a self-contained story, but they also all tie in to the series-long story. This game... there's not much in the way of resolution by the end is what I'm saying. I guess in some ways that's a good thing, since if the game were much longer it would start to drag a bit, but... I just wish I'd known.\n\nOther than that, it's got a unique story, an interesting world, a unique visual style, the combat is decent (albeit a bit repetitive after a while), and I do genuinely think it's a good game; it just isn't a finished story.","April 14, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I immediately started playing again, not for the sake of acheivements or even getting a "best ending" but just wanting to do things a little differently.\n\nI'm not really a connoiseur when it comes to music, but unlike other games I never listened to my own music on top of the game's.\n\nVisually this game is amazing. Boiled down, yea its a bunch of simply cycling illustrations, but those illustrations are brilliantly done, and never make you feel like you're watching some dumb gif loop.\n\nIn line with that it is one of the only games I can play on my laptop's fan run like a jet engine, which is to say, it is in no way demanding for any computer to run.\n\nThat said, assuming that the place where my first game ended is in fact the ending of the game, I think the loose ends did catch my attention. That didn't at all take away from the overall experience, and if anything it makes me think that they will (hopefully) be releasing a sequel, what with the girth of lore that was given to the game. Over your travels within the game you travel not even a fifth of the presented world, but it never feels like you're missing anuything. In actuality it just made me wish I could go farther, which is probably the right way for a game to make you feel.\n\nThe combat is fantastic. I was amazed and enthralled with Factions, and the minor tweaks that were made to pre and during combat gameplay was done with this game in mind, not bending to any sort of predesigned border. Such a thrilling experience during every battle.\n\nA small thing that I really did appreciate was that RNG was in the hands of the player. Only by equipping certain items did RNG ever come into play, which is something I wish a lot of Tactical Strategy RPGs (or what have you) would do as well.\n\nTL;DR,\nA game with the smallest of blemishes that left me wanting more, 9.5/10","April 26, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every decision you make in the game is important and a lot of the conversation choices could result in the death of a character over another in some cases.\n\nIt shows this was made by some of the oldschool Bioware guys who have since left that company.  The story and characters are all very interesting and I've only scratched the surface of the game.\n\nThe artwork and music stand out in this game more than any other I've played.  The art is only 2d but it's some of the most beautiful 2d artwork I've seen.  The music is perfect and fits the art with a very viking feeling to it.  The incombat animation is very smooth and looks great.\n\nThe gameplay reminds me of old FF and Suikoden games where you have many different heroes with different job classes.  There are as far as I can tell about 17 different job classes each with it's own special abilities.  Every character you get can be ranked up, have an item equiped etc.\n\nIf you are a turn based strategy, with a bit of RPG fan I highly highly recommend picking this game up.\n\nFinal Note:  This game has an auto save feature, which means not being able to save the game at every decision, making them far more important in the longrun.

I loved it.\n\nThe gameplay is just rock solid in all respects If I had to describe how the game plays in one sentence, I would have to say it plays like "Xcom" meeting the dialouge trees of "Mass Effect" with small bits of "Monster Loves You" wrapped in a giant Norse blanket. While it sounds stupid, it is the best description I could think of. The game has three basic activities: fighting, talking, and caring.\n\nFights are handled as a turn based strategy game. There is a large grid and you have an overhead view of your units (usally around five or six units) and your goal is to kill anything that is not one of your units. Units of course have varied abilities, sizes, and each unit can level up. Overall, the strategy part plays into the strengths of the genre and doesn't venture to far outisde of them. There is no permadeath, but on difficulties above easy players that are knocked out on the battlefield will require time to heal and be at there greatest strength.\n\nNow what helps this game stand out are the dialouge sections of the game. Between fights you will engage in conversations with the people around you and make decisions about, well, many things. This can determine the kind of fights you get into, the members in your party or how other future events play out. It helps that the dialouge is well written. Just keep in mind that it is presented in mostly drawings with no voice acting. It did not bother me in the slightest, but it may bother some possibly.\n\nThe other part of the game is traveling on the road and taking care of the day to day events. In these sections, your caravan is shown traveling across a large landscape and blocks of text popup every once in a while describing something that has happened and giving you choices of how to react to it. These sections also can change the fights you have and your party members among other things. They are nice down times between the action and help give the game the feeling that the journey really is a struggle.\n\nI overall adored this game. While the presentation was simple, it was strikingly beautiful and bolstered up by the strong mechanics surrounding it. If you like story based games and don't hate strategy games either, pick this up.","February 14, 2014","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saber-scorpion/recommended/237990/","saber-scorpion","Saber-Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saber-scorpion/","79 products in account","The Banner Saga is a post-apocalyptic Viking Age Oregon Trail with fights. If you're still reading instead of buying this game on that description alone, fine - let's get serious: The Banner Saga is a story-driven, turn-based strategy-RPG with incredible art and music that oozes atmosphere and sucks you right into its bleak yet beautiful world.\n\nBasically the game tells the story of caravans of Nordic humans and horned giants called Varl struggling to survive after Ragnarok. The gods are dead. The sun has stopped moving in the sky. A great darkness is descending from the North, bringing with it an unstoppable host of mysterious stone creatures called Dredge. The game looks like a Disney animated feature (one of the good ones), but the story has more in common with Game of Thrones than Pocahontas, filled with old blood feuds, betrayal, and grey morality. The point of view switches back and forth a few times at first, getting the player acquainted with the many different characters. Players who aren't paying close attention may find themselves confused, especially in the dialogue scenes where it's not always made abundantly clear who is speaking.\n\nThe art in this game is gorgeous - just look at the screenshots. Unfortunately the only fully animated and voiced sequence comes at the very beginning, and all of the following dialogue scenes are silent and only minimally animated (blinking eyes, blowing hair, etc.). A bit more animation in the conversations - changing facial expressions to fit what is being said, for instance - would not have been amiss. But even so, everything looks fantastic, including the character animations in combat.\n\nThe sound is great too. One of the requisite Kickstarter "stretch goals" was to hire a live orchestra for composer Austin Wintory, and it shows. Some of the vocal elements weirded me out at times, but on the whole the soundtrack is outstanding, and perfectly complements the mood and setting of the game. There is very little voice work - mostly limited to narration - but all of it is good, if heavily accented.\n\nThere are two sides to the gameplay. Let's call them Oregon Trail and Gladius.\n\nIn the Oregon Trail parts, you will see your caravan trudging slowly over the picturesque landscape. As you travel, you will lose Supplies. Supplies can be purchased in towns using Renown, the other currency in the game, which is also used for leveling up characters and buying magic items (each character only has 1 inventory slot for 1 magic item). If you run out of supplies, then each day some of the people in your caravan will die. You can rest for 1 day's worth of supplies to improve your caravan's Morale. High morale will grant you bonus Willpower in combat. Random encounters pop up on the way, offering a series of choices. Choose carefully. I will talk more about the Choices & Consequences aspect of the game later.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from a those event choices, the Oregon Trail gameplay has little actual effect on the combat or the story. There are Steam achievements for managing your caravan well, but otherwise you can let everyone die and still finish the game, since apparently your main characters are able to live without eating (?), and a bit of rest will still improve morale. It seems like that needs fixing to me.\n\nNow for the Gladius part of gameplay: the turn-based combat. It's an interesting system. Each unit has both Armor (blue) and Strength (red). You can attack a unit's Armor to make it more vulnerable to Strength attacks. Reducing a unit's Strength not only lowers its health but also its damage. Here's where things get interesting... As long as you both have at least 2 units alive, you and your opponent will always alternate turns. This means that, if you reduce an enemy unit's strength to 1, it's often better to leave it alive but crippled than to finish it off, because your enemy's turns will be wasted on these weak units. But even crippled units can still take you by surprise, and killing them grants you bonus Willpower points, so it's a strategy you have to learn to play just right.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is that I found the combat fun and challenging. Though it could benefit from added variety (each character only has one special ability), it's a solid and engaging system that makes you think. You can switch the difficulty mode at any time if combat feels too easy or hard. I found the standard difficulty perfect on my first playthrough, though that final boss battle was... we'll just say adequately frustrating.\n\nThe final boss is also the only fight of the game (I think) that you need to win. All other fights can be lost, and the story will continue without a game over screen. Though characters who fall in combat do not die if you win (they only become injured for a few days), losing combat too often can have an impact on the story that could possibly get characters killed.\n\nIn fact, let's talk Choices & Consequences, which to me is the most important aspect of any RPG or semi-RPG. Unfortunately, most of the choices in the Banner Saga story have a clear good option and several bad options. And I don't mean "good vs. evil" - the game does an excellent job of maintaining a grey morality. I mean "ideal choice" vs. "less ideal choices", instead of equally viable options with a mix of good and bad consequences. This is bad, because it encourages metagaming and savescumming in order to find the "right" choice.\n\nDespite this, the consequences of your choices aren't to be underestimated. While they won't change the overall path of the story (which, like your path of travel, is pre-determined and linear), some choices can have immediate, disastrous consequences like the loss of many supplies or the sudden permanent deaths of characters in your group. Others (especially one in particular) can have delayed consequences that you might not see coming much later in the story. Which is a good thing!\n\nSpeaking of savescumming, I should mention that this game has no manual save system - just a checkpoint system that creates separate saves at the start of each chapter. I'm tempted to call this a good thing, because it curbs the temptation to load frequently. And if there's one thing I can say for certain, it's that The Banner Saga is best played by going in blind and never loading your game, even if you lose a fight, especially since there are very few ways to get a true "game over" screen. You will get the most out of the story and the experience this way.\n\nAnd yes, it's an experience. The story builds up slowly, so stick it out through the first few parts and you'll be rewarded. You will fight and struggle to survive as resources dwindle, you will make tough choices and watch beloved companions die, as you lead your ragged fellowship to the bitter end. Only... it's not quite an ending, because this is only the first chapter of a planned three-chapter game. Sorry! Don't get me wrong; the story definitely reaches a satisfying climax. But it's fairly short, and you're left wondering what happens next. Guess we'll have to wait and see!\n\nThe Banner Saga is a relatively short and simple game, but it's a good one. Sure, it could be improved by things like non-linear map roaming, a branching story, and more unit abilities and terrain variety in combat. But I applaud the small team at Stoic for not being overly ambitious with their size and budget. They seem to have a clear vision of exactly the game they want to make, and they made it with passion. Nearly everything the Banner Saga tries to do, it does very well: outstanding art and music complement a unique and interesting epic story with solid writing, backed up by fun and challenging gameplay. What more can one ask for? Basically just more of it, but that should be on the way! Perhaps the next two chapters will bring added features and complexity too.","February 23, 2014","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has some interesting takes on the tactical RPG genre, an awesome art style with beutiful scenery and rich characters. I found the story interesting and was especially impressed by the hardship and difficult choices of a refugee story arc.\n\nI was, however, also a little frustrated. The skill caps of your heros are very low, and I feel the leveling/customization choices  are quite limited. At least you get a lot of heros to try out but you don't get enough time and resources to explore them all very well. I also did not like that the narrative unnecessarily imposes that you play a certain character. Especially in a part, where Alette, a relatable girl, could easily be the main character you are forced into the role of Rook, her father, and have to decide her fate with some patronizing choices.

The score, the sounds, the visual style, and the writing all work together beautifully to tell the story of a merciless world falling apart. It's tense and you're always on the verge of annihilation, and the music alone could tell you so. It's gritty, and the crunches of axes breaking armor and the grunts and moans of the injured make you feel it. People are fragile and the perpetual march is exhausting, and the heavy shambling motions of bodies shows you so.  As the leader, you constantly have to arbitrate the problems of your followers, keep them optimistic, keep them fed, and keep them alive while a continent of panicking and desperate people is being overrun.  Everything harmoniously comes together to weave an atmosphere where feelings of dread and anxiety are constant. Your choice isn't whether or not people die, it's who dies now so that fewer will die later.  In every artistic regard this game is an achievement.\n\nUnfortunately it's not for everyone, though. Its roots are in the artistry, not the gameplay--people have some valid complaints about that. Only some.

However, the strength system is horribly unbalanced heavily favoring units like warhawks while units like archers have little recourse once an enemy is upon them. Couple this with the fact that units you invest in can very abruptly die via text menu decisions and you've laid the path for a brutally unlikable experience. I'm also not terribly fond of the inability to move after issuing a command nor am I fond of chain battles when there isn't any sort of healing. Not being able to move through my own units was also not well thought out.\n\nWhile you can advance units by spending Renown on them it quickly becomes expensive and the stat points you're allowed to allocate are sparse at best. Couple this with the fact that a unit can leave or die at any time and I have to wonder why anyone would bother. As well, the save system is janky as hell. Want to save and come back whenever you like? Too bad - you're back at the start of the chapter. I guess now you can maybe stop that party member from abruptly dying. Sloppy decisions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRetroKnight/recommended/237990/","TheRetroKnight","TheRetroKnight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRetroKnight/","31 products in account","I have finished the game, and decided to write a review afterwords so I can give you my one hundred percent honest review of this game, especially since I can recall every about it since I've just finished it.\n\nSTORY\nThe Banner Saga is one of those games that you see it, and say, "That looks epic." And it really is. The story of the game is lengthy, and it took me eight hours to beat it (however, I played it on Easy which I highly recommend you play for your first playthrough, since this game is VERY unforgiving in combat later on). You switch from two groups in the game who are trying to survive in this world, which is inspired by Viking mythology and design. However, the game focuses on one after the first three or four chapters. The group that isn't the main group is about a group of varl (giant humans who have horns sticking out of their heads) trying to deliver the prince of the humans back to his home, while also having their soon to be varl with them. The main group is about a man, named Rook, trying to escape from the Dredge (stone-like golems that seem to want nothing more than death and destruction, and the end of the world) while protecting his daughter.\nYou play as Rook most of the game, while you sometimes go to the varl group as you see their story unfold. In the end, their paths will intertwine. That is all I can give about the story without giving spoilers, but I will say it's one of the greatest stories I've ever seen in a videogame. And the game had even surprised me many times with emotional moments, which I didn't expect in a game like this.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay of the game is very simple. Outside of combat, you make choices by clicking on one of the options of what to do. And I will say, there is no voice acting in this game. Some voice acting comes up when they talk about a town, since you must travel from town-to-town while managing supplies and morale (like Oregon Trail, but easier). Conversations should the characters speak to one another, but you merely read the words. To me, it felt like reading a visual novel, but yet it was so well done. In combat, you also use the mouse. The combat is turn-based RPG, where units have armor and strength (health). If you damage armor, you can basically kill enemies in one hit by hitting their strength afterwards. However, you get numbers of how much your unit will take off, and it's very nice and clean. The combat animations are slick, and characters look fantastic in the art design the game has done. Combat can take up to five minutes, or twenty depending on how good you are at strategy, which you don't have to worry as much in Easy mode. The battles at first are simple and easy, but later on you will get your ♥♥♥♥ kicked, because the Dredge are powerful and sometimes unfair on higher difficulties. So, if you're playing the game for the first time, play it on Easy. You will enjoy it a lot more.\n\nDESIGN\nAs I've stated, the game looks gorgeous with it's hand-drawn graphics that are breath-taking at moments. Everything fits together, and everybody looks different in the game, despite on character who you don't get more then ten minutes, so it's fine. Every character looks like they could be real, and the game actually makes you care about these characters,  So if you make a choice that kills one, or one just dies in battle, you really do feel the emotional impacts. You have the characters you love, and the characters that annoy you, and the characters you hate. It really does feel like a visual novel in a way, but with choices and some fighting including some RPG elements, but it does a fine job of making worth playing.\n\nVERDICT\nThe Banner Saga is one of the games that you can't wait for the sequel to come out (especially since the only thing that stunk was that it ended suddenly, and will pick off in the game with your choices, so we can only hope the next game[s] are as good as this one) and truly surpirsed me. It shows that RPG turn-based combat works really well for an amazing story that this game has. You feel connected to the characters, and when one dies, you feel that emotional impact as you can even cry sometimes. Sure, it doesn't have fancy cutscenes and has a lot of reading, but it's one of the best RPG games out there, and I will be waiting for when the next game comes out, and probably praise that game too.  9/10\n","September 27, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The neatest part that will also be the most frustrating is that you cannot create save slots. So if you are at a juncture and someone dies, they stay dead in your game. Don't worry, characters that fall in combat will only be injured for an amount of days equal to how badly they got gibbed in battle (at least on normal difficulty). But sometimes people will die as a result of your actions and then they are just dead. The story is well done with some twists along the way. The setting is the real powerhouse though - it's the end of the world and you are trying to eke out some survival. It's reminiscent to zombie apocalypse games because the dredge you fight seem rather mindless. What saves it is the nordic fantasy theme and the varls. The varls are apparently a cross between human and ox, but they live for hundreds of years and are basically giants. Also they cannot reproduce anymore so the amount left is finite.\n\n-Gameplay-\nThere are 2 main screens in the game, the traveling screen which tracks how many people, varls, and supplies you have as you trek across the landscape and the grid battle view where you fight tactical combats. Overall both of these systems work very well. I was frustrated at first by how frequently my archers and other squishies died. Now I treat them like fragile objects and play very carefully with them. It isn't worth it to run halfway across the map for a kill only to get swarmed and killed. Send the tanks in first, create a wall, then pepper them with your long-range units. Instead of getting gold and experience you acquire Renown which functions as a currency for everything in the game. Want to buy an item? Spend renown. Want to buy food supplies? Spend renown. Want to level up your army? Spend renown. Obviously you don't get enough to do it all, so you balance losing women and children with wanting to have a stronger army to fight through and save the rest of the caravan. Lots of little decisions come back later in the game too, which shows you that your choices do matter. Overall it's very fun and addicting, with a "One More Turn Style" gameplay.\n\n-Story-\nIt just throws you into this lord of the rings inspired setting, but instead of dwarves, elves, and orcs, you get human, varl, and dredge. Along the way you start piecing together the history and relationships of the world, but rather than show a setting where the fantasy races are leaving or dying off, everything is dying off. The sun has literally stopped in the sky and people are constantly asking you what to do because its the end of the world. While this might make the whole thing seem pointless, you do get sucked into the characters and their struggle to survive through some good characterization and lots of poignant moments with your own personal choices driving the narrative.\n\n-Music-\nA bit halting here and there, sometimes there will be silence for a long time and then suddenly music begins! The quality of the tracks is very high though, I am usually glad when the music does come on. It's also voice-acted but I can't tell you to what extent because I prefer reading walls of texts.\n\n-Verdict-\nGreat tactical game. If you like tactical combat and reminisce for Oregon Trail style random stuff happening then this is for you. The whole thing plods along and is very slow, so take your time with it and you will be richly rewarded. I've sat at a key decision juncture for 5 or 10 minutes trying to deduce how things will play out. Since I can't just reload and find out, it may actually get a replay out of me too. The combat is unforgiving but once you learn some tricks you'll feel unstoppable.","September 28, 2015","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You could do everything right and the next move you could literally be starving your caravan to death. Not that that makes any difference because the amount of people you have with you means nothing to the game. The very few full scale battles you get into are staged because you haven’t gotten to a point where you could have lost members of your caravan.\n\nBeing able to purchase items is also a joke because if you care about your people even in the slightest bit then you will just be using your renown to buy supplies and leveling up your characters, who just wind up dying off at the slightest whim anyways. Ill mention Egil as an example and I know that it’s supposed to be an achievement to keep him alive, but really? Is the life of people just a joke/game? How can I possibly create a bond with anyone when their lives are so trivial?\n\nI don’t know about you but I can’t stand games that are intentionally impossible to play for the casual player. I’m just saying that if you want to have any sort of success at this game, it is impossible to do so without some sort of walkthrough.\n\nOh by the way, loved the combat, music and scenery.\n","February 20, 2014","false","45.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has an intense storyline that makes the player really feel the urgency of the characters. Part of this is due to the way "renown," or the game's version of XP works. Renown can either be spent leveling up your characters OR on supplies to keep people alive -- and there's never quite enough renown to go around. The use of scarce resources works really well into the storyline and even more into the player's decisions of what to do. I'm not really much of a tactical combat fan so I was surprised by how much I really enjoyed the game.\n\nThe best part, however, are the really amazing visuals (outside of cutscenes). I plan on playing through the game a second time just so I can screencap some of the scenes. And even better than the graphics? The music.\n\nReally the only thing I could complain about is that the end of the game doesn't really feel like an ending. It's more of a resolution to the current situation than a resolution to the entire storyline. Of course, this may mean a sequel in the future!","June 29, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many of the choices presented to you throughout the story are legitimately hard decisions to make, and the possibility of losing party members or forsaking rewards makes you think about your options, and makes each run of this game a little more unique.\nI do have my gripes with it though: some of the classes don't feel too unique from each other, special attacks aside, and for the most part, the story doesn't really branch out much. Your decisions do indeed affect immediate events, but you're still locked on the story progression the game wants you to take.\nDon't let that be a turn-off, however. I've poured nearly 12 hours into this game, and I've enjoyed each one of them.\n\nFINAL GRADE: A-\nHighly recommended, but there's considerable room for improvement.","April 24, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Banner Saga is like an exquisite dessert. The portion is small, yes, but the flavour is so unique that you would definetly want more.\n\nFood metaphores aside, I recommend this game highly. The combat mechanics are great, the visuals are awe-inspiring, yada-yada-yada. The thing that got to me most, is the atmosphere of complete desperation. The world is ending, and there's nothing you can do about it. No heroes to battle the darkness and win, no magical swords to end the enemy horde's approach. Every victory is temporary, you run, losing people and land. You learn to appreciate small things, like getting a bunch of supplies from a village. HELL YES, my caravan will not starve for a whole day!

I find the artwork beautiful, and the combat fun. I love the fact that my choices have consequences, even if some of the consequences are painful...when something bad happens I just consider what I might do on another play through.\n\nI find the combat interesting and somewhat complex...it is taking me a little time to figure out what each characters' strengths are and how to best use them (and I'm sure I haven't got it all sorted just yet, but I like the challenge). I'm not in a rush to finish, and am enjoying every moment. The only thing "bad" I can say is that I've read there is only about 9 hours of gameplay...I would have preferred to pay $50 and gotten a full game if that is the case. But that being said I am really loving this game and wanted to provide a different perspective to some of the naysayers.\n\nSomeone said that the outcome of choices weren't "transparent" enough, lol yes, that's kind of the point I think. What fun would it be if you knew exactly what would happen with each choice you make? I like the uncertainty, I like that bad (and good!) things happen unexpectedly based on what you do. I like this game in general, and applause the devs for creating something so unique. I know that you can't please everyone, but consider me one of the pleased! Thanks!

The turn-based combat is conducted on a "game board" with square spaces for your units to occupy. Truthfully, The Banner Saga's combat works well enough, but it's not anything special - there's nothing innovative or exceptional about it. It serves its purpose well enough, is fun, and offers some challenge. What makes The Banner Saga so wonderful is just about everything else about it.\nIt's difficult to summarize all of the aspects The Banner Saga does really well. Right off the bat however, you'll probably notice both the art and audio of the game are fantastic.\nIt's rare to find a game that creates a unique artistic vision and implements it so well, while still managing to include a great, effective soundtrack. It's probably fair to say a lot of games struggle with nailing either one of these, let alone both. But, The Banner Saga creates a beautiful, deeply atmospheric experience with its classically inspired animation visuals and moving soundtrack. Of course, this could be all for nothing if it's being used to prop-up a weak story; fortunately, it isn't.\nIf I'm being honest, I don't think I could name another game that comes close to creating such an oppressive story and atmosphere. The pacing of The Banner Saga is excellent; there's a true feeling of dread and desperation constantly building from chapter to chapter as you try to make (what you think are) the best decisions for your caravan, while fighting through seemingly impossible odds. This is a game full of choices - who to accept into your caravan, who to help, when and where to camp, who to take with you into battle - there are many, often tough, decisions that you'll have to make. All of these decisions are presented well, and all of them have consequences, some dire. This makes each playthrough potentially unique.\nIn The Banner Saga, the world is crashing down around you, and you're left facing insurmountable odds. It will be up to you to lead men, women, and varl. You'll make many decisions, some of which you may come to regret. The world of The Banner Saga is bleak and grim. It's hard not to look at this game with a sense of both wonder and despair, and for that it's impossible for me not to recommend it.","August 16, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The turn-based combat is satisfying and provides a nice balance of challenge and complexity. The soundtrack is sweeping and epic. The visual design is absolutely gorgeous, very reminiscent of early 90's Disney. The writing is pretty good too, with an pretty interesting and varied cast of characters, as well as a pretty cool setting influenced by Norse mythology.\n\nThat said, I felt the setting was a bit clumsily introduced: the game throws a ton of lore and proper nouns at you without adequately explaining a lot of them (for the first half of the game, I had no idea what the hell a "Mender" or "Valka" was).\n\nMy biggest complaint is the way the turn system worked: rather than having one side move all their units, then the other side move all their units, it alternates between the two: you, enemy, you, enemy, you, enemy, etc. This means that if you have six people active and the enemy has three, those three will be getting two moves each for each one move for your own people. It's kinda hard to explain in text, but the game essentially punishes you for doing well in combat by giving the enemy more moves the more you whittle down their numbers.\n\nThe save system is pretty frustrating too: You only get one uncontrolled autosave file. That's it. No manual saves or multiple save files. Is that too much to ask for, especially in a game like this that features so many different outcomes based on your choice?\n\ntl;dr Great combat aside from the crappy turn system, damn gorgeous visual design and soundtrack, pretty good writing and setting, albeit one that was clumsily introduced. Would benefit greatly from having manual saves.\nI still give it a solid recommendation in spite of its flaws","March 20, 2014","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall I love the cartoon feel to it.\n\nEnough of the graphics. The main thing I love about this game is the fact that the decisions you make, actually do have an effect. Not only that but it makes you think about what you want to say, Do you need another character? Do you need more suplies? What one should I choose to keep my character alive? Should I take a risk?\n\nAll these questions I was asking myself as I progressed.\n\nHowever sometimes I felt that some decisions made no sense to me - personally - and that some were harsh as it sometimes causes some of the characters to die, it obviously has no effect on the story but it is annoying as you may have levelled that character to a high level and spent your XP points on him and then he is gone, seems like a waste.\n\nI also dislike the fact that one group of characters you get to play with are not as powerful as some of the other groups and I felt like some characters I was able to level up easier as they did more base damage, the "archer" type felt fairly useless in most circumstances as the space the "Dredge" can move is so great compared to the range of the arrows, it felt like a wasted character to me, they have low armour and low strength and it just did not gel with my preferred playstyle and also I felt like the Varl were FAR superior to the humans.\n\nHowever the storyline was interesting although fairly short, it also had me addicted for the 5-10 hours it lasted and I am on my second playthrough on a harder difficulty and choosing different options. It has replayability in that way.\n\nThe final boss fight is extremely challenging and I enjoyed it thoroughly, with many retries, and many rages.\n\nAmazing animations in combat and although the Voice acting was scarce, it was effective when used. It could have been used more and there is A HELL OF A LOT OF READING, which I am fine with but you may not be. When speaking to people, it sometimes felt like it was drawn out and too much text but I liked it nonetheless. Requires patience.\n\nI would advise you to pick this game up, mainly if it is on sale. 100% worth $15 and less but I picked it up for $5 I think.\n\nAn amazing game overall and I loved it so much while it lasted.","June 27, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only complaint is that the ending, though cathartic, was rather abrupt and a left a question or two unanswered.","June 1, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Wykorzystywanie skilli i odpowiednie ustawianie wroga na planszy - klucz do zwycięstwa. Chwilę zajmuje żeby to ogarnąć. Grajcie na najwyższym poziomie trudności - trzeba nieźle kombinować. Nie ma nagrywania w każdym momencie, niektóre decyzje przynoszą efekty po kilku godzinach od jej podjęcia - to wszystko sprawia,  że gra się ciurkiem i trzeba godzić się ze swoimi wyborami. Postaci giną, odchodzą, walki trzeba powtarzać aby osiągnąć optymalny efekt. Gra raczej dla starszych graczy, bo nie prowadzi za rękę. Tutorial jest ubogi. Wszystko wychodzi w praniu.\nJedna rzecz, która mnie lekko zirytowała to ostatnia walka. Fabuła narzuca udział w walce postaci, której w ogóle nie rozwijałem. Trzy dni się męczyłem i nie dałem rady - musiałem wgrać stan sprzed decyzji o tym kto bierze strzałę. Przechodzę zaraz po raz drugi na pozomie normal - pierwszy raz zagrałem na hard i ani nie rozwinąłem wszystkich postaci, ani wszystkich fajnych artefaktów nie mogłem kupić. Prawie 50h zabawy, przy czym wiele walk powtarzałem.

Choices in encounters during caravan travels add both to the story and battle strategy, introducing a population and resource management aspect which changes depending on how the player chooses to engage enemies in group battles vs using army reserves in a cautious or direct manner. The Banner Saga has turned out to be a far more charming and deeper game than I had ever expected. More and more mechanics are introduced as one gets further into the campaign. This is one of the most satisfying SRPG / adventure experiences in a long time. I had hesitated due to the price, but for the current midweek madness sale, $10 is an amazing deal. If you were holding off for any reason, now is the time to pick up this title.

I find the artwork beautiful, and the combat fun. I love the fact that my choices have consequences, even if some of the consequences are painful...when something bad happens I just consider what I might do on another play through.\n\nI find the combat interesting and somewhat complex...it is taking me a little time to figure out what each characters' strengths are and how to best use them (and I'm sure I haven't got it all sorted just yet, but I like the challenge). I'm not in a rush to finish, and am enjoying every moment. The only thing "bad" I can say is that I've read there is only about 9 hours of gameplay...I would have preferred to pay $50 and gotten a full game if that is the case. But that being said I am really loving this game and wanted to provide a different perspective to some of the naysayers.\n\nSomeone said that the outcome of choices weren't "transparent" enough, lol yes, that's kind of the point I think. What fun would it be if you knew exactly what would happen with each choice you make? I like the uncertainty, I like that bad (and good!) things happen unexpectedly based on what you do. I like this game in general, and applause the devs for creating something so unique. I know that you can't please everyone, but consider me one of the pleased! Thanks!

Many of the choices presented to you throughout the story are legitimately hard decisions to make, and the possibility of losing party members or forsaking rewards makes you think about your options, and makes each run of this game a little more unique.\nI do have my gripes with it though: some of the classes don't feel too unique from each other, special attacks aside, and for the most part, the story doesn't really branch out much. Your decisions do indeed affect immediate events, but you're still locked on the story progression the game wants you to take.\nDon't let that be a turn-off, however. I've poured nearly 12 hours into this game, and I've enjoyed each one of them.\n\nFINAL GRADE: A-\nHighly recommended, but there's considerable room for improvement.","April 24, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The cast of dozens are beautifully rendered and animated, and set in the backdrop of a beautiful world in turmoil. The gods are dead, the sun has stopped, and something evil is coming.\n\nThe story sucks you in, and challenges you with difficult moral and tactical choices throughout the game. Not only must you prevail on the battlefield, you must protect, feed and care for a growing caravan of refugees fleeing the evil on your tail. As your caravan traverses the beautiful windswept landscape you watch the narrative unfold, with each choice impacting on your fighting capability, morale, and dwindling food supplies.\n\nThere are no easy choices. I am writing this review after my second playthrough, and can better appreciate this. The story is essentially linear, but seemingly innocuous choices could end the life of your favourite hero, or leave you with a knife in your back. Most games give hints to possible outcomes; The Banner Saga teaches you that life is arbitrary, cruel, and that you can't save everyone. The only consolation is perhaps that no matter how bad things get, none of your choices can (I think) make the game unwinnable - but you will live with the burden of knowing that had you chosen more wisely, perhaps more lives could have been saved.\n\nCombat is turn based, and, until the get the hang of it, pretty brutal. In another nod to realism, health and attack strength is linked - an injury means your hero can't hit as hard. As your team is weakened, each successive wound compounds upon the last, spiralling you closer to defeat. Battles can be nail-biting affairs, but the tension this mechanic creates is delicious, and makes prevailing all the sweeter. My only criticism is that there were too many monotonous battles mid-game, but perservere, and your skills and your heroes will be honed for your ultimate confrontation in the last chapter.\n\nDespite its minor flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed this game; twice.

Are you prepared to redefine what you consider "moral" as your mental and strategic mettle are put the the test constantly? And finally, can you handle the emotional consequences of your actions as you struggle to balance the needs of keeping yourself, your party, and the rest of your caravan alive?\n\nBanner Saga puts the questions to the test as you traverse through a gorgeous, norse mythological world...albeit on the run from dire enemies all the while. The game is fantastic overall, despite the rather monotonous and somewhat flawed battling system (e.g., an odd turn-based system that alternates your turn and the enemies every time; thus, even if you have 6 members alive and they have only 2, they still get to go multiple times while your characters only get to go once in turn). However, the real appeal is essentially the entire story itself: It is full of twists and turns, celebrations and mourning, and heart-wrenching choices through every step along the way. And the music! Oh, the music is simply some of the most aesthetically pleasing sounds you will ever hear; fitting seamlessly throughout the gameplay.\n\nThis game is only part one of several (out of a total of three I believe that are in development), so pick it up now while you have the chance (and when it is on sale of course!). I believe this game cuts a well-earned 9 Varl (Viking) axes out of 10 Dredge heads.

The big drawback to me was the combat which i didnt find all that exciting. You play as two seperate factions, the Giants who seem to be on easy mode, they always have plenty of food and morale and smash the enemy in combat easily, and the humans who seem to be constantly on the verge of starving with poor morale and much harder in combat to get by with. All in all it was a fun game that i would reccomend, i just hope they make combat more exciting with the next one, and they dont make you choose between the cool item or feeding your caravan ;)\n\nAnother drawback i found to this game after getting my new ultra hd monitor is you cant change the resolution manually anywhere. It displayed well enough with my old one which was 1920 x 1200 but with my new one at 3840 x 2160 the game is just a small box in the middle of your screen.

Telling a story in a bleak and beautiful world, the game developers have crafted an excellent experience. Based upon Norse and Icelandic lore, the Banner Saga makes you empathize and feel for the characters as they traverse the bleak hills and snowy woods of their world. In addition to possessing an amazing art style which hearkens back to 1960's Disney animation, the game's combat is both tactical and enjoyable.

The game was created by Stoic Studio, was founded by people from the famous BioWare Studio, gave the world such great role-playing games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect and Dragon Age.\n\nWorld of Banner Saga is gloomy, harsh and designed to the last detail. Inspired by Scandinavian mythology and stories about the vikings. Before the player unfolds a fascinating story, will be given the opportunity to observe developments from the point of view of several different main characters. Hunter Rook with his daughter Alette are saved from their village, which was attacked by dredges, dark warriors, whose armies are threatening to destroy all life in this world. Giant Hakon leads an army together with the human prince Ludin to help Grofheim, besieged the capital of the Kingdom.\n\nBanner Saga is role-playing game (RPG) with turn-based battles. During the 8-9 hours of the game player will have to make the hard decisions and none of the proposed options will be not definitely good, you always have to face the consequences of your decisions. The player will lead to the final goal not only the main characters, the number of which is constantly changing - someone will come, someone will leave, and someone will die. Also player will be responsible for the people, who walking in the caravan with him: refugees fleeing from dredges, who destroyed their home.\n\nEspecially I want to tell about plot and dialogues. All dialogues in the game are presented in the form of large amounts of text. The text is extremely high quality, it is like you situate in an interactive book where you decide what and how will happen next.\n\nMusic plays a huge role in creating the atmosphere of the approaching end of the world. Scandinavian themes  plays on the background of colorful snowy scenery and it is just incredible. Under calm music caravan covers the distance from one village to another, under the anxious music soldiers and giants go to the last battle against horrible dredges to protect their families. Under such musical compositions I would like to sincerely empathize with the characters.\n\nFor this game I would waste my free day, wrapped in a blanket with a cup of warm cocoa. The music and visual style of  Banner Saga make the game like complete artwork, which I will replay several times, to get new impressions.\n\n10 brave vikings out of 10.

The combat seems pretty simple on the surface, but they way they use Armor and Strength is neat. A unit's Strength is effectively their HP, and the damage a unit can do is Strength - Armor.  If a unit's Strength < opponent's Armor, they have a (Armor - Strength)*10% chance to miss completely.  If you ignore armor and go for strength attacks, you run the risk of missing with your weaker characters, but if you only focus on armor, they can do more damage to you on their turn.\n\nBetween fights, you're on an oregon trail style adventure after the invasion of your village by Dredge, a race of heavily armored people from the north. They're the main antagonists of the game, forcing the main characters to flee from city to city looking for refuge. The number of supplies you have determine how many days you can travel before your clansmen and warriors begin to die. In addition, the longer you travel, the worse your clan's morale gets, meaning you have to balance supplies with camping and resting. Various dialog and story events play a part in the number of clansmen you lose or gain if they decide to join your caravan.\n\nThe story mainly revolves around a hunter named Rook, who falls into the leadership role in a caravan of refugees. You and the other characters are attempting to find refuge between two separate apocalyptic events and a horde of invading warriors. Similar to Game of Thrones, the story is barely ever not dark, but it fits the tone of the world. You're not on a quest to save the planet, you're just trying to get your people to safety.\n\nOnly downside is that it lacks closure on some of the bigger story elements.

I'm very, very happy with the end result. The visual style in-game is amazing. The vista while the caravan is travelling is just a treat to see, and there are so many portions which could stand alone as works of art in themselves.\nThe character designs and combat animations are all great, IMHO. The only thing that could, perhaps, make it "better", would be if they had millions of dollars to spend on full animation and voiced dialogue...but from what I've seen and played through, that wouldn't really be necessary, and may even detract from the experience.\n\nIt took me around 12 hours to finish. Normal Difficulty.\nI enjoyed the gameplay, overall, particularly the story choices (and, well, the story itself). The management of the "resource" you can earn and spend, Renown, keeps things interesting: do I use it to level up my characters? to buy my characters items to buff them? or do I spend it all on supplies for my caravan?\nCombat itself is quite well done. It seems relatively simple, at first glance, but turn order, unit placement (both during setup and combat) and target prioritization soon become quite important and can make for some very engaging and even stressful fights.\nThe armor and strength stats mechanic is also an interesting feature: Each character has an armor and strength value, with armor reducing damage, and strength acting as both health and damage capability, with the latter decreasing as strength is damaged.\nTaking all that into account, along with each combatant's innate/passive ability plus their activated abilities, along with the willpower mechanic (which boosts damage, or movement, or pays for ability use)...and it may not seem so simple anymore. Which isn't a bad thing. :)\n\nThe soundtrack's great. I loved Austin Wintory's work on "Journey" (I wish it'd get ported to PC; I'd gladly buy it a second time if it came out for PC). From the softer, somber tones of some of the caravan marching tracks, to the faster and heavy beats of the combat track...all great. I love the tracks with the strong vocals in them, and the last piece in the game was amazing (the credits song/music, too). I'd definitely recommend getting the Soundtrack.\n\nBugs? Glitches? I had one freeze after several hours of play, but I was alt+tab'ing a lot and had stuff running in the background. I also had one combat glitch that required me to load a game, but it was a one time thing.\n\nComplaints?\nThere's only one save "track". If you start a new game, it'll overwrite your previous saves.\nIt's an autosave system that saves at key points (like entering/leaving a town, after an encounter, etc.), which may also be a problem for some. I'm fine with it being autosave-only (since it keeps every autosave point), but the lack of extra save "tracks" or profiles is kinda annoying, esp. since I'm now thinking of a new playthrough and, this being the 1st chapter (of an intended trilogy? still fuzzy on that. I should re-read my backer emails...), saves could carry over and other stuff like that.\nVolume control. There isn't one. It's either you have music/sounds on, or you have them off.\nThere are also no subtitles. It's not really that important, as the voiceover parts are few, but it'd still be nice to have 'em.\n\nTL;DR:\nI loved the game. I'm looking forward to the next installment. Amazing art (waiting for my digital art book) and soundtrack (if you're going to get it: get the one w/ the Soundtrack), and engaging combat and gameplay. I'm very glad that I backed this game's Kickstarter. :)","January 16, 2014","true","25.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are fewer of them now, a product of your leadership, though, you are resolute in knowing that your courage and pragmatism saved many of them. Despite the hardship you have endured, you can hear laughter and merriment in the distance, dancing and joyful music. A smile graces your chapped lips.Your daughter stands besides you, clinging to your tunic, and with a gentle word she speaks looking on with you,\n\n"I think it's time, Father."\n\nWith a bellow from your lips the camp is broken down, and once again you find yourself on the road headed toward adventure, your banner, telling the story of your people all the way back to the beginning, flapping defiantly in the wind.\n\nThis is your time.\n\nBanner Saga is a game about the burden of leadership in the face of adversity. The tale is told from many points of view and unlike other games, I have yet to find a game over screen. Your choices are permanent & resounding. Failure sticks and has consequences. If you're familiar with X-Com, this is Ironman.\n\nIf you're interested in a great norse inspired story of men, beasts, and giants, in a time where the gods are thought dead, then this is the game for you.

I'm very, very happy with the end result. The visual style in-game is amazing. The vista while the caravan is travelling is just a treat to see, and there are so many portions which could stand alone as works of art in themselves.\nThe character designs and combat animations are all great, IMHO. The only thing that could, perhaps, make it "better", would be if they had millions of dollars to spend on full animation and voiced dialogue...but from what I've seen and played through, that wouldn't really be necessary, and may even detract from the experience.\n\nIt took me around 12 hours to finish. Normal Difficulty.\nI enjoyed the gameplay, overall, particularly the story choices (and, well, the story itself).

The game was created by Stoic Studio, was founded by people from the famous BioWare Studio, gave the world such great role-playing games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect and Dragon Age.\n\nWorld of Banner Saga is gloomy, harsh and designed to the last detail. Inspired by Scandinavian mythology and stories about the vikings. Before the player unfolds a fascinating story, will be given the opportunity to observe developments from the point of view of several different main characters. Hunter Rook with his daughter Alette are saved from their village, which was attacked by dredges, dark warriors, whose armies are threatening to destroy all life in this world. Giant Hakon leads an army together with the human prince Ludin to help Grofheim, besieged the capital of the Kingdom.\n\nBanner Saga is role-playing game (RPG) with turn-based battles. During the 8-9 hours of the game player will have to make the hard decisions and none of the proposed options will be not definitely good, you always have to face the consequences of your decisions. The player will lead to the final goal not only the main characters, the number of which is constantly changing - someone will come, someone will leave, and someone will die. Also player will be responsible for the people, who walking in the caravan with him: refugees fleeing from dredges, who destroyed their home.\n\nEspecially I want to tell about plot and dialogues. All dialogues in the game are presented in the form of large amounts of text. The text is extremely high quality, it is like you situate in an interactive book where you decide what and how will happen next.\n\nMusic plays a huge role in creating the atmosphere of the approaching end of the world. Scandinavian themes  plays on the background of colorful snowy scenery and it is just incredible. Under calm music caravan covers the distance from one village to another, under the anxious music soldiers and giants go to the last battle against horrible dredges to protect their families. Under such musical compositions I would like to sincerely empathize with the characters.\n\nFor this game I would waste my free day, wrapped in a blanket with a cup of warm cocoa. The music and visual style of  Banner Saga make the game like complete artwork, which I will replay several times, to get new impressions.\n\n10 brave vikings out of 10.

This game has amazing artwork, an immersive soundtrack and terric story. The atmospheric quality sets it apart from so many games. When I just saw the artwork, it immediately reminded me of the old '70's cartoon adaptations of "The Hobbit" and "Lord of the Rings". Albeit, the Banner Saga art is much more polished and beautiful.\n\nI've seen some reviewers complain, saying "boring". I think rgis criticism is more about a gamer mismatched with this game. Banner Saga isn't for everyone. It uses tactical, turn-based combat with specialized units. It's very reminiscent of "Gladius" from the old X-Box. If first-person shooters and fast action is your preferred style, go for it. I enjory a mindless shoot 'em up from time to time. I just respectfully disagree that Banner Saga is in any way boring. The combat is thoughtful, and with the right difficulty adjustments, pretty challenging. But it's the story that drives this game! No spoilers here.\n\nMy one criticism - I cried out with frustration when I reached the end of the game. There is still so much of the tale to be told.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TormakSaber/recommended/237990/","TormakSaber","[LUE] TormakSaber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TormakSaber/","509 products in account","The Banner Saga is a Strategy RPG that excels in presentation and storytelling, but falls a tiny bit flat in combat.\n\nThe game is based heavily on Norse mythology, in a world where longships and horsetravel is gone, and the primary mode of transporation is ox pulled carts and long, long caravans on foots. The gods are dead and gone, and men and Varl (giants)  seek to eke out an existence among the frozen north in the wake of wars against the Dredge, massive stone-golem-like creatures. You play as several of the caravans, trekking across the world as the Dredge begin to return.\n\nThe game primarily plays out betwene two phases: Overworld and combat. The worldworld phase is your caravan travelling across the world, conusming supplies, and interacting with random events that can be good or bad, picking up new members of your caravan, and sometimes party members. You must track your caravan's food supply and their morale, as low supplies causes your caravan to starve, nad low morale decreases your units' Willpower in combat, Renown is the currency for the game, and it's used to level up units, buy supplies, and buy items. The best way to get Renown is to fight. So you'll be doing a lot of fighting.\n\nCombat is turn based S-RPG fare. You get many party members, and almost every party member is their own class with their own active ability. Passives tend to be shared among archetypes: Archers, Melee damage dealers, tanky characters, etc. Characters level up as they personally accrue kills, so if you want to level up a character, you need to ensure they ♥♥♥♥♥he killing blow. This becomes an issue later as future characters join at levle 1, and can't handle the rigors of combat well enough, often, to be handed kills in combat that comes to the wire at times.\n\nIn combat, units have Armor, Strength, and Willpower, along with Exertion and Armor Break values. Strength doubles as your damage as well as your HP, so a weakened unit will do only very minor damage. Armor helps mitigate damage, and high armor can even give dodge-deflection chance to attacks. Willpower allows a unit to gain a 1 for 1 advantage on attacks, or moving, giving an etxra edge. Exertion determines how much willpower can be spent on an action, and Armor Break determines how much Armor a character can shatter. As a character attacks, they cna attack Armor or Health. Armor must be broken, otherwise only you rmost powerful character swill barely scratch foes. By breaking amror, you open them up to future, highher damage from all characters, and so you want to have at least a few charatcer swith powerful armor break stats, and then powerful Strength attacks to followup for the kill. Combat turns alternate betwene you and the enemy, regardless of numeric advantage, and so a smaller party will act individually more often than a larger one. Ths leads to a prevailing combat strategy: Break Armor -> Maim units to 1 HP so they can't hurt you and enemies have to "waste turns" with weake, useless units -> clean up. This flow meant much of the time, I wasn't using active abilities, sinc ejust smashing their armor and then Strength attacing wa smuch more effective. This, along with only a few enemy variations, meant combat became formulaic after being figured out.\n\nThe story and music, and artstyle is fantastic, with huge, spanning panoramas as you travel. The presentation is beautiful, and the game ends on a cliffhanger with a sequel not out yet, multiplayer arenas notwithstanding. My only other minor complaint is probably not a real complaint: There are dialog choices with will, very abruptly, end in character deaths. You are not refunded the Renown spent on levelling up the character. Other characters will only join for a very biref time and then depart, taking kills and renown with them. It can be frustrating to have a character all game, and then realize because of one dialog choice made over half the game ago, a character was doomed to death with no chance to save him. You could argue this means all choices have real consequences. I would argue it was more frustrating than pathos creating. If a Renown refund had occured, I wouldn't have minded.\n\nDespite that, I would recommend the game, if you're OK with slightly repetitive combat. It's not FULLY replayable in that you'll see "new content", but you could make the choices you didn't before. Some of them result in characters leaving, joining, or otherwise interacting in ways they wouldn't have otherwise. It is possible to kill damn near everyone in your caravan by the end of the game. Impressive or depressing: Your call.","April 29, 2015","true","22.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am so pleased with it, that I feel like I owe them more than just money.\n\nSome positive reviews will praise the game's graphics, and music. They are correct to do so. There is no equal.\n\nSome positive reviews will praise the story line. They aren't doing it justice. I started reading fantasy novels at around 11 years of age (I am 45). I started with The Hobbit, and read through a few hundred more before I got tired of the genre. This story engaged me. I cared about the characters, and I wondered about the world. With time, stories were told that satisfied my questions. I am very satisfied.\n\nSome positive reviews will praise the tactical combat. I've played far worse, but the combat doesn't make sense. A large part of it revolves around breaking a target's armor before an attacker's strength can damage the target's strength. A target's armor can be reduced, steadily, and without fail, by breaking armor; even with an arrow. The truth is, in an abstract way, the combat is fun. There are strategies that you can use to line up the enemy to increase your odds of success, but it doesn't feel like real combat. I cannot believe that arrows can reliably reduce the effectiveness of a target's armor, or that a severely weakened warrior can rip away a third of a target's armor every round.\n\nA few negative reviews comment on Banner Saga's linear format, that doesn't allow for meaningful choices when they're presented. I heartily disagree. Sandbox RPGs provide freedom, but their stories are watered down, and put on hold while the player explores. Banner Saga tells an excellent story with a sense of urgency, that requires you to make choices if you want the story to continue to be told. Yes, it's limited, but you can't have it both ways in a computer RPG.\n\nAnother interesting design choice is that the game doesn't allow for constant saving, and reloading. You make your decisions, and the game moves on. The only time that the game is over, and a reload is allowed, is when specific combats fail. Some people hate that, but for me, it's a great way to immerse yourself in the story. That is why I play role-playing games.\n\nIf you like a good story, and can handle some rather basic tactical combat, then this game is for you.","December 29, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With a sequel on the way I'll get my  wish eventually though.\n\nThis game is pretty story driven, it would have made a fantastic free roam rogue-like (or rogue-lite, honestly the original term has expanded it's scope just like rpg has over the years, get over it) but I'll take a story driven game when the story at least for me was this good. I've seen some criticism about the choices you make not mattering. I can't say for certain yet, I've just now played through once on hard forbidding myself from reloading to change my choices. As such I can't comment on how much the choices actually mattered HOWEVER, the 'illusion' of choice presented here at least made it feel like so much could have gone differently, my bad choices seemed to kind of snowball on me towards the end ramping up the difficulty quite a bit. It made me ache for the version of this game that could have been like FTL but better.\n\nBottom line:\n+The art is great, I absolutely love games that go so far to present a unique visual style such as this.\n+The combat seems super simple at first, but has surprising depth, appealing to the part of me that grew up playing final fantasy tactics. (No real character customization with classes or anything like that though.)\n+The oregon trail inspired travel from place to place is not only so much better and more immersive than how similar games simply move your little dot along the lines on a map, it lends itself toward making the world and the things in it feel massive. You will probably feel tiny by the end of this.\n+The story struck a chord with me at least, I got very attached to some of the characters and seemingly through my own mistakes lost a few of them. I found myself spending time reading about the locations I might be headed to on the map when I got the chance. I feel it was very good.\n\n-They use the same character shots on different backgrounds while flashing between them during dialogue portions of the game. It oddly works pretty well and isn't too jarring, but full animation or cutscenes would have been very welcome. I fully understand why they couldn't or didn't, but I kinda wanted to see the character's body language a bit, and see some of the scenes described actually shown.\n-I almost would rather they released a series of expansions to the game rather than a sequel. It really feels like even more could be done with what's here.","January 1, 2015","true","33.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is more linear, the composition of your party more limited, and the battle options less diverse. Nevertheless, it is an intriguing game.\n\nThe story focuses on the survival (rather than adventure and exploration) of two seperate groups traveling from one city to the next. Your caravan is composed of hundreds of npcs rather than just a party of a dozen or so like in many games and it is important to procure enough resources to feed them all. If you don't your clansmen and fighters begin to die off or abandon you. Likewise it is important to maintain good morale by resting during your travels, but doing so uses up a day's supplies without making any progress. It can be difficult to strike a balance especially since your resource for buying supplies is the same resource you use to level up your hero units and buy items to give them boosts.\n\nSometimes throughout the game you will engage in a War event in which you choose whether to attack aggressively, defend yourselves, or even run away. This decision determines how difficult your battle with the enemy will be and how many casualties your bulk forces will suffer. Additionally throughout the game random events will occur requiring you to make leadership decisions, like whether or not to aid the sick and injured, how to handle a drunkard, or whether or not to give in to bandits. These decisions are presumably meant to give you the sense that you truly are part of a large caravan of people, but you never have the option to talk with random clansmen on your own, or interact with them in any meaningful way. Essentially every clan interaction is a text box and a few options to choose from. Personally it fails to give me that immersive quality I was hoping for.\n\nThere is a vast map for the game world but you don't get to choose where to go or what route to take so the map hardly serves any purpose at all. Additionally it detracts from the beauty found in other areas of the game with it's childish scrawl and rough depiction. Similarly jarring are the many Godstones your caravan passes on it's travels. Each one is an opportunity to earn a special item but it is also a massive eyesore on the landscape and I hated having to see one each time. Otherwise the art was generally quite attractive with sweeping landscapes and beautiful splashes of color.\n\nBattles employ an interesting mechanic in which your health and your attack are the same stat. As a character loses health they also less effectively. Characters also have an armor statistic that reduces damage they take from enemy attacks. So for most battles the goal is to reduce your opponent's armor until you are able to deal damage to their strength and kill them. While some strategy is involved essentially the game amounts to beating on your opponent until you win. What little variety in abilities and strategic options exists is hindered by the lack of characters to choose from who employ them. Each character, with few exceptions is unique, but it's impossible to level them all up so you generally end up choosing the strongest few and sticking with them. Completley ignoring the rest of your party.\n\nI was also displeased to realize that if a character was equipped with one of my items when they left or were killed for story purposes, I lost the item forever. This made me paranoid about my party equipment and I would unequip everything from my characters after every fight, just in case.\n\nUltimately the rpg aspects of the game fell flat for me and the story didn't feel substantial enough, but the overall mood of the game and the unique battle system and story progressing were intriguing. It feels to me like an unfinished game in desperate need of polish and expanding. Nevertheless I do believe it is worth playing, even if it leaves you feeling a bit unsatisfied and wanting more.","November 9, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I've made many choices,lived and survived to regret it...yet....it had to be done... The game has such a great story and great atmosphere. Decisions you make in the game are crucial and may haunt you or bite you in the back later. I was playing the good guy.... Accepted or helped as many people as I could along the way. I let people join my caravan, assisted those who stayed behind. Until.... Someone turned traitor after a long while. Perhaps it was due to the low morale from our dwindling food supplies... or was it my leadership? I was accused of letting anybody from the road join the caravan. There was mistrust and there was alot of squabbling amongst the clansmen.\n\nMy logic was this: The common enemy was the dredge. No point fighting amongst ourselves.\nAnd that was how i rolled throughout the whole game. Pretty much like Game of Throne's Nights Watch style. I'd willingly accept anyone whose willing to join and help those that decide to stay, despite their lost cause. I've made a few good friends that way, lost a few too.\n\nThe ending...I think I made the right choice. Though sad, but I felt that whatever that had happened, the great journey, was all just to get that 1 character to the end. Bittersweet indeed.\n\nTLDR:  I felt like Ned Stark in Game of Thrones. Sometimes the best decisions aren't always the morally righteous ones. The game really shines in this part as well. The fighting is similar to XCOM styled games....its decent. You really have to decide your hero placements tactically and their moves too.

An epic tale with branching paths, some tactical RPG combat, a hint of managerial simulation, and of course the breathtaking visuals and music.\n\nFor me there were two main issues: combat isn't deep enough, and the caravan management seems tokenistic.\n\nCombat is a rare occurence in the game, which is rather short in comparison to most tactical RPGs. As a result, characters don't get much of an opportunity to grow. There's no way (that I know of) to go out and farm battles, so using newly-acquired characters that haven't had a chance to gain levels is often just asking for trouble. There are only five levels, however, so it's not a huge risk, but in most cases your characters won't get a chance to develop fully. Gaining xp is only achieved through kills, so this is also a problem for some of the more support-oriented characters.\n\nThe other "half" of the gameplay is managing your caravan, but this can almost be completely ignored, and is probably the most efficient route if you want your characters to get as strong as possible. There is a small penalty in it reduces your characters' willpower (extra moves you can make in combat), but compared with additional stat points it's a minor inconvenience.\n\nIn the end, I found myself just clicking to go through the motions of combat and reach the end as soon as possible, which was about 8 hours. It's a worthy game but it has its flaws, so while I recommend it, I suggest waiting for a price drop.","January 23, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game hinges on this, with passable and often ill defined combat mechanics, yet has unchangeable plot points. There's one junction in the game where no matter what you say, you do the same thing. It's blatantly to move the story and hinges on this stupid idea that someone's CONTROLLING YOUR THOUGHTS (Cue conspiracy theorist's music.) and forcing you to do this.\n\nThis is compounded by the fact that the point at which this happens, you're thrust into a situation where you can't better your position. You're stuck with wounded party members and with low morale. You are not allowed to change this, even though the game has previously always allowed you to do what you want.\n\nIt seems as though this game was rushed towards the end. There even begin to appear characters who are identical, but wear different coloured tunics. All of this would be acceptable if they didn't force you into fights you can't possibly win without either re-loading an earlier save (and I don't mean 5 minutes before the problem, I mean two to three hours.) or lowering the difficulty.\n\nA beautiful game with a nice combat system and, for the most part a brilliant story, is ruined by a forced plot progression that seems neither reasonable nor feasible.","January 18, 2014","false","21.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm not sure how exactly I'd label it. But the art is beautiful. Do you remember Dragon's Lair? One of the video games animated by Don Bluth? Or how about some of the movies he did: The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go to Heaven, Anastasia? This game's art reminds me of him and his work. And I mean the entire game looks like this, not just title cards or animations. It's amazing that they even made the battle sprites look like this.\n\nAs a whole, the game is a bit of a weird Oregon Trail meets high fantasy, with trying to keep your caravan alive between plot points. There are events along the way that you have to make choices on, either to you benefit or your detriment. I thought these were randomized but it turns out they're not so I'm a little disappointed in that regard.\n\nOn the battle side of things, I don't think The Banner Saga will win awards for innovation. However, it's simple and it works. I only wish there were some way to train characters since the number of battles you have in a game seems to be capped at a certain number. By this I mean battles only arise out of event opportunities, so there isn't any real way to grind and whatnot to reach higher levels. Regardless, I think characters are hard capped at level 5 anyway.\n\nThe story seems interesting and I am looking forward to what's in store for the future.","January 6, 2015","true","13.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Beautiful, high-res, hand-drawn. It's just gorgeous to look at. The in-game map is beautiful, too. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the soundtrack here, which is excellent and fits the world and the story incredibly well. The lore is pretty deep. A lot of work went into the world-building, and it shows.\n\nAs far as tactical gameplay, health and strength occupying the same function is brilliant, and the way armor and strength affect damage dealt is ingenious. Willpower and exertion are further interwoven, creating depth. It's fantastic and it works to provide the best tactical aspect of the game.\n\nHowever, combat design overall often feels a too raw and underdeveloped at higher levels. For example, why can't I check out my characters' stats while deciding who to use for the battle? Isn't that sort of important? Why isn't there a range attribute? Am I just missing it? I understand that shieldbangers move more slowly and have less range than other units due to their heft, but it'd be awfully handy if I could tell just how far they'd be able to move when placing them. Same with enemy units. There's just too much missing here. The basic premise involving strength, armor, exertion, and willpower is solid and incredibly innovative to the genre, but some major fleshing out needs to happen in order to get me more invested into the tactical combat being presented here. I often feel like I'm floundering, like I don't I have enough information to even begin to approach a battle tactically. It takes me out of the experience and I just tend to float through battles rather than plan and execute an actual strategy. And that's a very, very bad thing for a tactical RPG.\n\nI also question the system of having each side alternating moves, rather than assigning characters a speed attribute and having that govern when turns are taken and by whom. There's a huge missed opportunity here that would greatly affect the Man vs. Varl unit selection and it would help to balance the two units. Instead it seems they tried to balance them by making the Varl bigger and less maneuverable, but I don't think this works nearly as well. I ended up selecting mostly Varl units in each battle simply because they were the hardiest and I often didn't feel the desire to try and play tactically. Just roll the Varl out there with an archer or two and have them smash heads while the archers wear away the opposing units armor. A speed attribute would have added a great deal of depth: Do you opt for speed and maneuverability and quickly bring the fight to the opponent? Or do you go with a solid front line, advance slowly, and wear the enemy down while tanking through whatever damage they deliver? It would have added a ton of tactical depth that this game is missing.\n\nThe interface has some issues. You'd better be 100% on-point with your mouse clicks, otherwise you'll have to try and figure out where you went wrong, select the same unit again, and start from scratch with whatever you were trying to get him to do. It's way too easy to click the wrong thing, and just not intuitive enough to prevent regular frustration from occuring when you're trying to get your units to do what you want. There are similar issues with selecting units and placing them prior to a battle. This is a minor gripe, but by the end of the game it was incredibly frustrating to miss a click on a willpower star by a fraction of an inch, and have to select the character and tell him what I wanted him to do from scratch.\n\nThough the art is very well-done, I felt some of the character designs were too generic and too difficult to tell from one-another. There are a few Varl units who are basically just palette swaps from one another with very minor differences in facial features. Due to this, and not being able to view any details about a unit prior to selecting them in battle, I had a lot of trouble keeping the characters straight and often made mistakes during deployment that could have easily been avoided had I been allowed to view more details about which units I was actually selecting for battle. I mean, it doesn't even tell you which class a unit is on the pre-battle screen -- Just their name, level, and a picture of their face. No class, no stats, nothing.\n\nWeak characterization makes the problem even worse. I often confused Griss and Bersi, and by Chapter 5 I had no idea which one was which and often made mistakes in deploying them. I found it hard to get invested in any of the characters. None of them show any depth, and the only one written with any panache at all was Ludin. Poor dialogue exacerbates the characterization issues.\n\nDecisions are too frequently unclear about what you're actually selecting. I don't mind having things blow up in my face, but I need to be adequately informed on what it is I'm choosing to do. For example, you arrive at a fortress and enter, only to have enemies immediately attack it. You are given a choice as to whether to rest in the fortress, or immediately attack and attempt to break out. This choice is followed by another, in which you choose the actual tactics of your breakout. So you've got two choices to make at the same time, but you have to choose whether or not to rest before you're able to see what your options will be during the actual attack. Jeez, this is getting complicated... Still with me? Basically, you're forced to make an initial choice (whether or not to rest first) without adequate information to make the decision. If I had known that I'd have liked to charge the enemy and attempt to eradicate them all, I'd definitely have rested first. If I was going to try and distract them and get away, I'd have chosen to attack immediately to prevent more from arriving. The character I'm playing would have had all of this knowledge in his mind while making the initial decision as to whether or not to rest -- Why don't I? This kind of thing is present too frequently, and it leads to way too much frustration. It cheapens the decisions you're making.\n\nLosing characters to decisions made through the game, rather than in battle, is something that keeps the intensity up, but overall I don't think it works nearly as well as Fire Emblems system of permadeath within combat. It puts too much of the onus on the story sequences and takes away from the importance of the battles. If you're in this for the story, that's fine, but it lessens the importance of the tactical game and makes it too easy simply to trudge through battles without really caring what happens. Halfway through the game I began to just autopilot my way through battles. I lost my sense of investment in my units and my tactics and started to get bored of the entire actual game. I bought this for the tactical gameplay, not the story, and so I came away very disappointed.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe landscapes are beautifully rendered, the lore is surprisingly well-written, and though the characters are pretty weak, the story is engaging. Unfortunately, the tactical combat as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. It's solidly constructed at its base and its key gimmick (strength and health occupying the same stat, and weaving armor into the mix) is incredibly innovative, but too often I felt there wasn't enough detail or I didn't have enough key information to dig in and play tactically, which lead to me becoming utterly disinterested in the actual tactical gameplay about halfway through. I ended up switching it down to easy and blasted through the game just to see the story.\n\nIf you're looking for an engaging story framed in a beautifully constructed world, then you'll probably enjoy your time with The Banner Saga. As a tactical RPG, though, it's seriously flawed. The systems in place are intriguing but ultimately too raw and undeveloped for me to really endorse. So as a longtime fan of the genre, it's hard for me to recommend this game.","January 21, 2014","false","12.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I put off buying the Banner Saga for a while due to some sceptical comments i read about the game. I had heard it was fairly lengthy and the story was relatively good so in the end that was enough for me.\n\nThe positives really are in the way this game looks its very much like playing an old disney fantasy esc film. Its stricking in its colour scheme, that much is sure however during "cutscenes"  if you can call the coversations of text, cutscenes the still characters portraits dont respond physically to anything going on around them and this can create a disconnect between their expressions and whats actually happening.\n\nThe game is broken up into three parts the camping which is where the covos/levelling take place, the trekking, which is basically just you watching your little ant party move left or right.  And the combat which is about deciding whether to damage health or armour. Attacking armour first means more damage can be inflicted to the health while attacking health first will mean the enemy wont do as much damage with less health. Simple.\n\nTurn based strategy how i love it! most of the time. This game quickly becomes dull, the enemies are the mostly the same and the action doesn’t leave much to the strategic eye compared with say, X-com or Civ. You will quickly find the best strategy and the many unused characters in your party will soon become useless because why would you use anyone thats woefully underleveled and under powered.\n\nWhile there’s something relaxing about the trek across the frozen tundra there is also a tedium to it. Sure random events pop up but they do little to effect the course of the game. Alot of big decisions are actually arbitrary and change little in the narrative. This game feels less like an RPG and more like a adventure game with RPG elements tacked on.\n\nFinal thoughts, I don’t get the hype I really don’t this is an average game it really is, to me at least. The lore in the background of the story seems awesome , the map is huge! But neither are utilised to there potential, you just get carried through the story down a linear path and don’t really influence it in any great way. The art is lovely but beyond that what is there here to become engrossed in? By the end I really couldn’t be bothered It took me 7 hours and it was a slog for the last 3 the combat just didn’t go anywhere beyond its simple mechanics. The story was interesting to begin with but soon became flat at the half way point, no questions I had were answered, and at times it became rather predictable ( think game of thrones). When I have to force myself to finish something I cant recommend it, its as simple as that.","March 25, 2015","false","7.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

All incited through a gripping main story, which unfolds beatifully, and the small decisions you can make along the your adventure. They really have an impact, at least it gives you the feeling they have. To be honest I have not expected this gmae to be this good. Things get really grim when you run out of supplies and oyur fighters start dying, your numbers dwindle and the enemy is at your heels. Very intense and well done!\n\nThe setting is so cool, I would like to know more about the lands, vikins, varls and dredge and also what nordic mythology was frame for them, havent found much yet though.\n\nGame mechanics are also very exciting. It takes some time to figure out how the battle system works but it is very well thought through and one really needs some good tactics to prevail. Battles can be hard but they are also very rewarding.\n\nThe only that comes to mind when thinking about problems, is that departing characters take the items you gave them with them. Thats a bit frustrating because some items are pretty expensive.\n\nAll in all this game is easily a 10/10 points due to it being so surprisingly good!","December 2, 2015","true","11.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltonky/recommended/237990/","waltonky","Puzzlebox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltonky/","318 products in account","The Banner Saga is a turn-based...fantasy battle game? I'm not sure how exactly I'd label it. But the art is beautiful. Do you remember Dragon's Lair? One of the video games animated by Don Bluth? Or how about some of the movies he did: The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go to Heaven, Anastasia? This game's art reminds me of him and his work. And I mean the entire game looks like this, not just title cards or animations. It's amazing that they even made the battle sprites look like this.\n\nAs a whole, the game is a bit of a weird Oregon Trail meets high fantasy, with trying to keep your caravan alive between plot points. There are events along the way that you have to make choices on, either to you benefit or your detriment. I thought these were randomized but it turns out they're not so I'm a little disappointed in that regard.\n\nOn the battle side of things, I don't think The Banner Saga will win awards for innovation. However, it's simple and it works. I only wish there were some way to train characters since the number of battles you have in a game seems to be capped at a certain number. By this I mean battles only arise out of event opportunities, so there isn't any real way to grind and whatnot to reach higher levels. Regardless, I think characters are hard capped at level 5 anyway.\n\nThe story seems interesting and I am looking forward to what's in store for the future.","January 6, 2015","true","13.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

However, the story is presented almost entirely through text and the dialog is often flat. You also spend maybe half of the game just watching a rolling background. Furthermore, some of the choices you make in the game have random outcomes; practically none of them are predictable. So it makes for a frustrating experience when you repeatedly draw a bad hand.\n\nI really hope Stoic's next effort is improved. Voiced dialog would have done much for the game, as well as abbreviated travel and more focus on stories as they occur in the villages and cities. I realize constantly being on the run was supposed to be a part of the plot, but Stoic needed to show more compelling ineractions between the members of the caravan to support that. I'm of the opinion they should have just faded to black, otherwise. Because I'm really not that interested in coming across random bandits that have no impact on the major story arc. Filler is not the way to go.","July 2, 2014","false","12.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Every time i had to make a decision i took like 5 minutes, because i felt that every decision was really decisive in the end and in some way it is!.\n\nSince the start i felt a really deep connection with each character, regreting some decisions that i make down the road.

Not slow in a bad way (for me, anyway), as you sit and for small portion of the game just sit and watch as your group travels slowly through the snow while you listen to the music and admire the landscape.\n\nThe game is set in a Viking-setting, though in a different world where the gods are dead and the sun is stuck in the sky. In the game you play named commanders of one-two caravans, travelling in snowy landscapes to lead your people to safety from war as they are attacked by a race called the Grudge. Your caravan will be affected by supplies(starvation and morale that you must take into consideration while playing.\n\nThe combat is turnbased and your characters can choose to hit the strength/hp or the armour of targets,each class/characters has a special ability and otherwise have standard melee and/or ranged attacks. The "currency" Willpower is used to make characters move further/hit harder and is gained through levelling up characters and defeating enemies in combat.\n\nNow the progress. The game only saves in the beginning of chapters and then has fixed savepoints in the chapters so if you fcked somethig up, you might have to reload from a good while back. Importantly; some characters die because of your choices in text events. In my first playthrough I let things happen as they did and personally enjoyed being responsible and having a few "war sucks" moments and having to make tough/wrong choices and getting a more personal feeling of the game.\n\nThe currency Reknown is used to level up characters and buy items and supplies. It is gained through winning combat. It's hard to juggle the spending on all those things, so I ended up buying exactly no items, few supplies and spending it all on levelling. (Adding gold (or something) as an additional currency to use on buying things and adding it to loot and lowering the reknown gains from battle would be nice, please).\n\nDifficulty; it's possible (at least on easy mode) to leave your entire caravan to die (your fighters will not) to starvation and poor morale. In the higher difficulties the morale will count towards your fighters strenght and hp in battle.\n\nThe game is however deep you want it to be; the map (thought sadly useless) is incredibly detailed with the entire map having names and stories for every forest/lake/mountain. You can also choose to talk to characters and how thorough you want to do the conversations. Therefore it's possible to rush the game or go fully into the story. A normal playthrough is 10 hours, all conversations included. I played through the game twice, once for making my own personal choices and story and once for more achievements.\n\nBuy for the story and for the atmosphere. Don't expect explosions and action all game as it definitely has its slower times. If you want a game with depth and a good feeling to it and can handle the slower bits; definitely buy. The games leaves you with that sad-good-feeling you'd get from surviving a war and having gone through some sht, but also been through an adventure.\n\nTip; always click the flag sin the corner when combat starts as it will show you the hp/armour of enemies at all times and not just on hover-over.\n\nExtra points to Nordic players as the language used at some points gives a few chuckles.","November 5, 2015","true","25.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"
