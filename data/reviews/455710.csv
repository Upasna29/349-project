This game is a mish mash of several demos from the Game Guru software (I own the software and have messed around with the demos, so I know this for a fact). How this is permitted to be  available on Steam for purchase is beyond me. Even at such a low price, it's a ripoff. You can just buy the Game Guru software and play the demos seperately. There's not much else added into this "Early Access" title.\n\nWhat you should really do is invest a cool, crisp 10.99 dollar bill in Corona Motorsport, the revolutionary racing game constructed from the ground up by a mad genius young man known as Lucas Game. You will see no reused assets from Game Guru or 10 fps sound zones that repeat the same line. You will encounter holes upon holes, and wonderful varying weather patterns all to test if there is something fundamentally wrong with your computer.\n\nPlease do not buy this game, but purchase Corona Motorsport instead. You'll have a better time. Tell 'em Sneeze sent ya.\n\nGood luck and have fun, really looking forward to overwatch on the 24th so I can stop purchasing these bags of garbage from nobody developers who want to earn a quick buck. I can just got to Wendy's and get something from the value menu, which I will be doing in a couple of hours, FYI.\n\nGoodnight and have a great week.\n\nTell 'em Game Guru sent ya.","May 15","false","0.4"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","35","39","5","7"

This game is an open-world game where you complete quests to earn copper, and to find out what happened to your family. This game goes around many diffrent aspects such as exploring diffrent cities, surviving an asylum, etc. as you try to survive from the dangers lurking around on the outside. This game has a lot of freedom, such as if you want to explore other cities, or kill some zombies, or kill all of the townsmen. Overall, this is a fun game with great potential, and I am excited for the official release.","May 7","true","1.5"," 6 of 30 people (20%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","20","6","30","3","7"
