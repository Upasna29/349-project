In fact, all this week after each of my long shifts on the ambulance, I've been coming home to play this; actually looking forward to it. The game isn't without faults, but I'll list each fault for you, as well as each positive point.\n\nThe Good:\n+The graphics are nice and for the most part, I can get 60 fps (unless there are six emergencies going simultaneously).\n+The animations are pretty sweet. For example, while checking patients, the doctor has several animations depending on the injuries...he will take out his stethescope for a sick person, start a fluid bolus on a trauma patient, and take out his pen light to asses the pupils of a patient with a head injury. Sometimes I just stop what I'm doing to watch the doctor.\n+Additional content compared to the other games.\n+Some pretty wicked calls to go to, including: hostage situations, bomb threats, robberies, medical emergencies, mva's, gas explosions, forest fires, building collapses, protests, missing persons...you get the point.\n+Day/night cycle. The weather also changes..so far I've only seen light rain and rarely a thunderstorm.\n+A.I. seem to be improved from previous games.\n+Level editor, although it's not too user friendly..unless you're familiar with SDKs, which I'm not.\n\nThe Bad:\n-As mentioned by others, the tracking issues are still present, but for me they haven't been too bad. The worst issue I had was with the search and rescue K9 vehicle making a loop around the block to get to an area literally 20ft away from the truck. And after I gave up on the missing persons mission, I sent it back to base, and it drove off the road and got stuck. That was frustrating, but in the end, it didn't break the game for me.\n-So far I've had two unexplained crashes while playing free play (I've submitted bug reports).\n-Minor glitches here and there.\n-Pedestrian A.I. seem to be pretty stupid. For example, if there is a fire in a building next to a sidewalk, the pedestrians will walk right next to it and sometimes can injure themselves.\n-I never purchased EM5 (the negative reviews scared me away), but from what I've seen and heard, this is basically a DLC and should not be marketed as a new stand-alone game. It's pretty much a re-skin.\n-Pricey for what you get.\n\nConclusion:\nWhen all is said and done, I can personally look past the glitches. I enjoy playing the game and find it to be relaxing. I also understand why some people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the marketing of this game. Hopefully this game doesn't go the route of Train Simulator "2016" where every year the devs release a "new" game with <insert year here> in the title, when it's essentially the same game. But for someone like me who owns "911:First Responders" but nothing after that, this game might be worth it for you. I was blown away at the improvements between the original game and the "new" one. Anyway, I would suggest doing your research before purchasing, but I'd also suggest not letting the negative reviews scare you away from purchasing it all together (maybe wait for a sale if you don't think it's worth the money). If you're interested in the 911 system, it's pretty much the only game I've been able to find that does it any justice (and even then, it isn't as realistic as it could be). Give it a shot!\n","October 21, 2015","true","15.0"," 59 of 74 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","59","74","2","3"

Mostly, whenever they worked.\nCan I honestly recommend it to existing player or even new players? Not really.\n\nThe game is (still) severely bugged and broken. Units will go missing or lock up. Automation will only work every now and then, most of the time a paramedic will stand next to a slowly dying patient without lifting a finger. Pathfinding is still a WorkInProgress kinda deal, far too often will units get stuck in traffic/buildings/eachother/imaginary stuff or simply wander off across the map. I also saw multiple crashes during the 4 hours it took me to complete the new missions -- not that it has 4 hours worth of content, most of the time was spent figuring out workarounds for whenever the game didn't work correctly. Restarting a mission for the 7th time because a broken game mechanic randomly failed you isn't "challenging content", it's just plain annoying.\n\nWhat was the point with doing all the work for the medieval map, anyway? Two one-event "missions" using a single type of unit? No fires, no "bring out the dead", no funeral pyres, no guarding the docks..\n\nIt all just really feels like a beta experience, like something that shouldn't be out of Greenlight yet.

I haven't played the rest of the series, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I personally like it. However, it has more cons than pros. First off, vehicles and the little people you command seem to get stuck in random places quite often. I've had fire engines wedge themselves behind buildings, and firefighters get stuck between trees. Also, you can never get vehicles to line up or park the way you want them to, they always figure a way to put themselves at some stupid angle that makes the crew have to walk halfway around the city to get back in.","October 18, 2015","true","9.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","4"

A good size\n- Reasonable graphics.\n\nAnd the cons:\n\n- Quite frankly, the pathfinding of these stretcher bearing idiots is $h!t. Sometimes takes a little hit and miss, but they eventually get to where they want to go.\n- There are still plenty of glitches, such as rescue dogs finding someone, but the person not actually showing up - dogs bark at invisible things\n- People standing around doing nothing. The function of a fireman is simple: put out fires, and rescue people. If a fireman is wearing his firefighting clothes, and arrives at a fire in a fire truck, what should he do? The obvious answer is put out fires, not wait around for me to tell him to pull out his hose, and start fighting a specific fire. And, once the fire's out, he doesn't move, he keeps spraying water onto the same object!\n- Accidentally overwrited a save, would have liked a "WARNING! This action will overwrite any existing game in progress!".\n\nOverall, the game is quite fun. Good simulation games are getting harder and harder to come across, and this is certainly a step in the right direction for Sixteen Tons and Deep Silver. I'm not a fan of this whole plague theme, but that's just my opinion.\n\nMy Rating: 7/10.","January 11","true","9.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Yet only 1 Major mod has been released with very few others in progress. And then for Em4 mods are still being made to this date. Now for me, the thing that made EM4 was the mods. I have played soo much of that game, enjoying a HUGE variety of mods. So after that very successful game you decided to Bring Emergency 2012 out. Which was hopeless. But then you decide to bring Emergency 2013, which again was hopeless. But then no, you decide to make Emergency 2014..... Once again rubbish. So then you make Emergency 5. Didn't work.  Not stable, barely moddable etc... So then you realise its time to bring out a copy-pasted version of Emergency 5, add a few extra missions, anotehr vehicle and there you have it! A new game... Emergency 2016. Makes me laugh really. I'm NOT saying that you Devs are bad at what you do in any way but I mean common... It doesn't take that much common sense to see what needs to be done.

It's barely optimized, the developers lack effort in improving the game. Buying this game at its full price would suggest that the developers do the right thing, but instead it's the contrary. Let the developers feel that you can't just launch a half way finished game and sell it as 'Emergency 5' then, a few years later, add a few more missions, act as if it were an entirely new game and sell it as Emergency 2016.","December 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The 2016 edition is horrible. Bad graphics, very bad unit pathfinding and plays exactly like the 2015 edition. There's no innovation height in the development.\n\nToo bad but i cannot recommend this at all.","October 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I don't know how, but they managed to break even the simplest things (pathfinding, for example). I played for exactly 3 minutes and 58 seconds and then quit. I don't even know what the difference is. They say new missions and new vehicles, but it's 100% the exact same with the exception of the pathfinding issue which is actually the opposite of an improvement.","October 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"
