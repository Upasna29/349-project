Focuses on who you know and what you know about them and selling information to the highest bidder for your own personal gain.\nI'd give the game 8/10 - People portraits are limited meaning you could see the same face in a lot of peoples potraits.\nThe game has flight exploration to other planets to meet other people and to use them against each other.\nI haven't played too much into it yet, but so far it's been very enjoyable and the detail for background on everybody is amazing to say the least. Well worth the price.","June 6","true","1.0"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

Each new game is already two centuries old, with a living history full of characters that are born, live and die before you even exist.\n\nWhen you create a character in this world, you face the same choices as all the computer-controlled citizens did. The decisions you make in your character’s early life set your starting skills and attributes, and your family connections and business contacts.\n\nThere is no set story. The game generates two centuries of characters, events and interactions to set the scene: as a player, you are born into this world and form relationships in it before the game starts.\n\nYou’ll then be able to create your own legend within this world: explore the known (and unknown) solar system, trade goods, run missions, leverage your contacts, and avenge members of your family as you see fit.\n\nThe game universe stretches to the far reaches of our current solar system, and with powerful scanner equipment installed on your ship you never know what you might find far from the busy jumpgates. In certain regions travel is very unsafe: pirates are known to hang out near the major gates, and discerning traders are well advised to travel with hired escorts.\n\nYou'll be able to purchase a variety of ships and be able to own more than one at once. Ships can be fitted with a variety of equipment, depending on what their hulls are designed to take. Weapons will come in all shapes and sizes, from standard bolters firing depleted uranium shells, to tracking missiles, to powerful mining and attack lasers. You can defend your ship with power hungry shields or by buying special armour coated hulls.\n\nShip scanners of various types are available, with different sensitivities to smaller and larger objects. Equipment and engines must be powered, and a player is free to choose the types of reactors used to provide power to the ship: choose from a range of types, from responsive yet inefficient fission engines to solar panels which provide a weaker steadier power supply.\n\nYou can purchase a regulator which allows you to adjust power to certain ship components whilst in flight. This allows you to boost shields to ram enemy ships, weapons and maneuvering thrusters in a dogfight, and redline your main engines when it's time to leave.\n\nDifferent components receive damage and can be repaired by mechanics that you will meet on your journey. Making friends with a good mechanic will make all the difference when you return half-alive from the Callisto salt run""\n\n\n*NOTE*\nI did -NOT- write this, it is rehashed information from their kickstarter. I added this as "my" review because i belive that this information should be on the store page proper instead of what is there now.\n\nI've only played for about four hours and that honestly is not enough to create a full review for a game such as this. I will come back to this review and edit it accordingly when i feel that i can do so properly.\n\nFor now i will give this game a big thumbs up thanks to the fact that i am having a ton of fun, my character is currently delving deep into politics in his ambitions to become the next president. Influencing people and relatives close to the current president, creating connections of wealthy and powerful peope whilst smearing others has never been more fun.\n\nHowever, be warned that this can be a really slow paced game with a ton of stuff to read, so if you are aversed to such things i advise you to check out a lets play on youtube before deciding on buying.","June 6","true","7.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

It's focus on infomation brokering and relationsip building is a unique take in a genre that has never done well with diplomacy.\n\nVideo review\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kL2QGQqWcbI","June 6","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
