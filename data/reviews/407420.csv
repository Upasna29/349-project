It's another one of these "joke simulators xDDD" games that only bring hatred. hatred for the fact that these games get good reviews as jokes. They then rise to the top, and then youtubers will play them and laugh at literally nothing. Then they make money for half-assing a game.\n\nPeople say video games were better back then, and sometimes due to games like this I want to agree. There was no market for ♥♥♥♥ like this back then.\n\nThere's no joke, no punchline, no anything. Don't buy this garbage. Why don't these joke games actually make a joke while making an actual enjoyable video game?","October 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 1,368 of 1,451 people (94%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","94","368","1","81","48"

So bugs are expected. But the problems with Gabe Newell Simulator go far beyond what could be excused by it being in Early Access.\n\nThe image for this game alone sums up pretty well all the problems with this game. The entire games quality is poor. No quality control whatsoever.\n\nHere's all the issues:\n\n- Full-screen doesn't work. It changes were the cursor clicks by around 2 inches.\n- The menu for the game looks like it was created within 3 minutes.\n- The controls/how to play section was literally made in paint.\n- Level menu lets you skip levels even when you've never played/completed them.\n- Level menu constantly doesn't show levels.\n- Text in the cut-scenes look like they've been made in Windows Movie Maker.\n- The game is laggy and badly optimised, no matter the computer or graphic settings you used.\n- Level layouts are very bare-bones and simple.\n- The AI are so unresponsive you can run straight by them and complete each and every level.\n- There's no audio in the entire game except the starting cut-scene and gun sounds.\n\nIf you want to see all of this and more for yourself, check here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=18&v=Wwi2xuKcUpo\n\nTLDR;\n\nGame is broken in full-screen. Game is sluggish. Menu is bare-bones. Cut-screen text is unreadable. Gameplay is mostly unresponsive and irritating. No quality control. Game can't hold your attention at all.\n\nThank Gaben for Steam Refunds.","October 13, 2015","false","1.8"," 462 of 503 people (92%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","92","462","503","19","5"

All I can say is wow.\n\nI should just say this game is a horrific piece of garbage and end it there, but no, I'm gonna do my job and tell you why you should stay as far away from this terrible game.\n\nIn Gabe Newell Simulator we play as Gabe Newell (DUH). We finally decide to release Half Life 3 and aliens take it away, so it's up to us to get it back.\n\nApart from the JPEG screenshot of the game story at the start of the game and the final level, there is no dialogue whatsoever. The graphics in the game are some of the worst graphics I have ever seen. All of it is just slapped up unity assets and that's it. The game has massive texture pop ins and sometimes the entire level disappears.\n\nThe gameplay is probably one of the worst third person shooters I have ever seen. You have an option of 4 guns which all do pretty much the same damage expect for the UMP which does basically nothing. You can't fire from your hip so you have to aim down sights. Gaben controls like a tank and every movement you make is clunky and unresponsive.\n\nThere is no sound effects what so ever. There is one song in Level 4 and gun sounds, but apart from that it's dead silence, so be prepared to be alone with your inner thoughts when you play this game.\n\nThe game has 6 levels in total and two endings, but you can see the alternative ending in the level select screen so you don't have to replay the game twice. To complete the entire game it took me 40 minutes and there is no replay value whatsoever so don't expect anything after the first playthrough.\n\nIn the end I can safely say Gabe Newell Simulator is the worst game I have played in my entire life and yes it tops my previous contender Slaughtering Grounds. This game is an abomination and proves the fact that there is no quality control in Greenlight. Stay far away from this garbage.\n\nFinal Rating:\n1/10 - Horrific\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the  review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 17","false","2.2"," 232 of 254 people (91%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","91","232","254","34","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedbeardOfOz/recommended/407420/","RedbeardOfOz","Redbeard.wp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedbeardOfOz/","956 products in account","All of the reviews I saw about Gabe Newell Simulator said that it was awful.\nBut I thought "No worries, at least it will be a bit of a laugh".\nBoy, was I wrong!\nI should have paid heed to the wise advice of the reviewers who told me to keep away from it.\nBut did I listen to the voice of experience? No, I did not - and I suffered for it.\n\nThere are two modes of play: "Story Mode" and "Steam Mode".\n\nThe "Steam Mode" gives you a number of click options, as if you are running the Valve company.\nRelease Half Life 3 and your money count starts to go up.\nThen you can upgrade your games, to make more money.\nFor what purpose? To see some big money numbers? Very pointless.\n\nThen there is the "Story Mode", which is the main game.\n\nYou can select a level, from 1-2 and 4-7 (the game is missing level 3 - no idea why).\n\nFirst off, make sure that you set the screen size to your computer's settings.\nI know that probably sounds obvious, but with every other game I've played the game itself would automatically choose the best screen size for you; but not so with this one.\n\nI spent some time playing this game on the wrong screen size.\nThis not only meant that I could not read all of the relevant text, but I couldn't play level 1 either.\nFor level 1, when I had the incorrect screen size setting, a text-based announcement (the first screen) was as far as I could go; there was no option whatsoever to do anything.\nOnce the screen size had been fixed, you could see a "Skip" button to click on to continue.\n(But, as it turned out, I probably shouldn't have bothered.)\nFinally, with the game screen widened, I could play level 1.\n\nLevel 1 starts with a dark theatre, which then goes to a screen which inicated that Half Life 3 to be released.\nUnfortunately, this scene can't be skipped, so if you are going to play level 1 again (which can only be done by closing and restarting the programme), you have to sit through it all again (which is annoying).\n\nIn level 1, you start off as Gabe Newell, in his office at Valve.\nThere is a pistol on the table - pick it up by using the E key.\nYou can engage in some text-based dialogue with a guy in your office.\nYou pick up a rifle from the next office.\nIf the rifle doesn't pick up straight away, keep hitting E on the keyboard (and move around a bit beside the gun whilst doing so, to make sure you are in the right position).\nThen you get to shoot an overgrown moth, and then some other aliens.\n\nI spent some time clicking away at the aliens, but my guns wouldn't shoot.\nIt turns out that you have to right-click to aim to shoot - as, in this game, you can't shoot off the hip at all.\n(I would have known that if I did the training with the correct screen size).\n\nThere was one alien standing in a room who I shot at through the open doorway (emptying an entire magazine) but who wouldn't die - it turns out you have to be in the same room as him to kill him (go figure).\n\nI tried the other levels as well, but . . . yawn.\n\nThe game isn't thrilling at all.\nThere is an attempt at humour when you engage in some text-based dialogue with the guy in your office, but it's not particularly amusing.\nI was thinking that the one saving grace of this game would be some brilliant humour (hey, even some half-decent humour would have sufficed), but it just wasn't funny.\n\nQuite frankly, Gabe Newell Simulator is a rubbish game.\nThe game play is poor.\nThe sound effects and ambience are not much chop.\nThe graphics are usable, but that's about it.\n\nLuckily, I bought this for next-to-nothing on a Steam sale.\nIt would be a sad occurrence if you paid full price for it.\n\nMy advice is to steer well clear of this rubbish game.","February 28","false","6.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

I dont know so I will start from all the way in the beginning . I looked at the pictures and I saw the Gabe Model and from there on I knew that this couldnt be any good . I bought the game and gift a copy to my friend . Launched the game and bam Unity . I had a dream once to create a game . I worked for so long and it was all gone . Seeing that screen made me remember the horrors from my past . The pain I went through when all the hard work was gone ;(  . I took a second chance at making a game when I was all alone with no internet . I torrented a lot of Unity Assets when I worked on my first game . Fisting fury was its name . . Than there was lost smiff and now my masterpiece . "2016".\n\nSo after learning through trial and error I had a functioning game in Unity a quest some characters . Only a Pre-Alpha . So anyways I launch Up the game I was reminded of everything , I sa the default unity menu and buttons . The poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ didnt put time in actually animating anything well atleast take that ga y default text box . So I get in the game the model is crap very low polly . I was speechless my arms were shaking the thoughts andmemories of my ga y cousin bothered me as I pressed the W key to walk to a man . A Dialouge chat appears . My heart sank I collapsed to the floor I woke up a few hours later . He torrented the assets , Just Like me ?\n\nThe exact same dialouge that was in my game was in here . Same font , same color , same everything . I couldnt believe it . The ♥♥♥♥er was so lazy that he used the default ont and everyhing for his release . I was almost in tears . As I walked I noticed the mouse was on my screen . The guy didnt know how to script ;{ he didnt know the simple script to lock the mouse . I then noticed the crosshair was the default crosshair from the dialouge Asset package . I was]lked and I shot some bugs . My friend on skype had already been killed by the bugs . The boredom grew inside me . I quit the game and tried to open my game I was working on . Its gone , its all gone all of my Builds everything . How could I been so foolish ?\nI was about to write a review I noticed a link to the guys youtube . My face had no expression . I looked at this 14 year old pinochio as he spoke some language I have never heard before .\n\nI am writting this review as I am reimporting all of my assets into Unity . After seeing all of the horrible games on steam and after I have played this "game" I am uploading my game to greenlight .","January 15","false","0.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","1"

In an attempt to fill the void, Antonio Renna has taken it upon his own soul to create and release Gabe Newell simulator - I.E. "I've played through my entire Steam library and now I'm really bored, so lets see how hard this really is to do Renna."\n\nThe previous sentence, in quotes, is actually the developer's entire name - Antonio is a shortened nickname version of it.\n\nPotential?\n\nLoads, m8. Loads. If Antonio were to run with his idea and put a bangin' soundtrack by a band like Anamanaguchi or he were to contract Nullsleep to throw a few beep boops together, I'd say that this game could compete with the likes of other FPS games that came out in 2005. None come to mind, but I bet it could.\n\nBut seriously..\n\nYou're investing in a joke. That doesn't make it bad, actually it's the kind of joke that I find entertaining and enjoyable - and I'm sure if Gabe has a sense of humor, he probably finds it giggle worthy as well - the fact that this has stuck around on the store for this long is probably an indicator of that.\n\nThe speed of the game is sloooooooooowwwwwww - you can play all of the levels (Except for level 3) from the get-go, the controls are clumsy, and no matter what I do I constantly click out of the game screen due to having more than one monitor (I assume).\n\nI would put more time in this game, but, I just don't really want to. That doesn't make it bad, and for the cost of a cup of coffee you can enjoy it too. It IS enjoyable, but I'd like to see the actual interface of the game work a little more tightly. Mouse capture would improve it immediately.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm recommending it. If you don't like it, get out.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","January 23","true","3.2"," 25 of 52 people (48%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","48","25","52","9","0"

This Game should be given to childen in all schools just for its depth of story telling, the music in the game even has its own audible tale!\n\nThe graphics are sublime, it is clearly Souce engine 5, the unity logo must be a ruse to through you off so you dont question why the other source games have been updated. You can tell by both the frame rate and the detail in the game, it must be running at around 120fps. And for the details, you just have to look at the floor or the sky. The floor has small marks and scuffs that a normal floor would but most games would miss out, the sky looks a deep grey but when you closely inspect ityou can see thousands of different shades to give it the true to life English sky.\n\nBut do you want to know what the worst part about this game is???\nIts the last game of its type, no game will ever compare to this.

The kickass remix on the title screen is all I needed to get hyped.\n\nAlthough this game is obviously a joke, I've still had quite a lot of fun already and don't regret buying it.  I'm sure you won't either, as it only costs you the lunch money your parents gave you.  This game stays in your library forever, whereas the food you bought at the cafetaria only lasts for a couple hours.\n\nAll hail our lord and savior of vidya, GabeN!

Gaben arives on the scene of G3 to reveal the greatest masterwork mankind has ever wrought with two hands: "Half Life 3" when suddenly the aliens attack, slaughtering the crowd like cattle. It is now up to Gaben to bring peace to the universe and steal back the master copy of Half Life 3 from the aliens before they can discover the secrets embedded in the very code of the game.\n-Pros:\n-Next Gen Graphics (On par with the PS5, and Xbox 2): Literally blew my eyes out of the back of my head.\n-Audio: The music throughout the game set the tempo for an action packed adventure through the life of Gaben, not to discredit the amazing sound effects provided by the studio throughout the game punctuating each moment with a sense of tangible realism.\n-Fantastic Gameplay: The gunplay and intelligent design/interactivity of each level is perfectly balanced and leaves no regrets to my mind as to lost potential.\n-Well crafted story: as above this game is surely one of the greatest narratives of our time, I found myself compelled to cry, laugh, and rejoice at each twist and turn in the shoes of our great lord and savior.\n-Amazing Value: At a pricepoint of a mere few dollars this game surely outweighs even TF2 in value to gameplay metrics, rising above other simulations as an economical and truly great game.\n-Cons:\n-Immersion: Although the graphics and sound were amazingly crafted, surely with love in mind, I found myself in a difficult situation. I cannot for an instant believe that I could, even through such a surely amazing simulation draw myself in comparison with our mighty lord and savior, Gaben.\n7/10- IGN "Could have used more boobs"","December 15, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NukeWolfIsAwesome/recommended/407420/","NukeWolfIsAwesome","NukeWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NukeWolfIsAwesome/","33 products in account","One day as I was browsing Greenlight something caught my eye. I was instantly interested in the completely generic, low-quality FPS called Gabe Newell Simulator, a game where Gabe Newell finally decided to release Half-Life 3 but his employees try to stop him(for whatever reason), and I quickly voted for its release. Months later, the FPS became a TPS, the terrible graphics became meh graphics, and the original plot changed significately(but still revolved around Half-Life 3). The new version even featured "Steam Mode", where the player could manage a simple version of Steam. The game seemed much more polished, featuring a new trailer and screenshots, eventually becoming numer 1 on Greenlight. Then the game finally released, and was not what I expected. There were several changes, though most weren't good.\n\nPros: Good background music (when there is any), Steam Mode is a good time-killer, the game features some funny moments, well-done ending scenes(for an indie game)\n\nCons: Low frames per second, seond level appears to have no music, backwards difficulty curve, Steam Mode is broken, levels have many moments where the player can't walk over a tiny bump without extreme effort, though bugs are supposed to be humorous according to the develpor most aren't, hardly any content\n\nIt's hard to recommend this. I almost do merely for it's humor, especialy the ending of the game. The game is cheap and none of the levels are locked(unless you die).. I also noted that it was made with Unity Personal Edition, so it had a small budget. However some glitches are game-breaking, making it nearly impossible to recommend unless it gets fixed. Buy only if you have money to spare. 4.5/10","January 10","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The best thing Steam has done in years was implementing the refund system (which I am fully taking advantage of here). Have you seen the quality control for Steam? It's god-awful, but I digress.

It's another one of these "joke simulators xDDD" games that only bring hatred. hatred for the fact that these games get good reviews as jokes. They then rise to the top, and then youtubers will play them and laugh at literally nothing. Then they make money for half-assing a game.\n\nPeople say video games were better back then, and sometimes due to games like this I want to agree. There was no market for products like this back then.\n\nThere's no joke, no punchline, no anything. Don't buy this garbage. Why don't these joke games actually make a joke while making an actual enjoyable video game?","January 22","false","4.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
