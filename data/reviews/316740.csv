(Cloud Level 2)\n\nThe gameplay itself is "okay" it would be better if every monster didn't push you off the platform causing you to start the entire level again. -.-\n\nThe "drawn in" monsters and characters are kind of funny to look at, other than that the game isn't that great. It's a very difficult platformer that isn't very fun.\n\nHowever, in the lava stages there's some epic music. I doubt kids had anything to do with the soundtrack but I thought I'd throw that in.\n\n\n","January 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","29","40","0","0"

These paged manuscripts can be found within the game by finding various locked crates throughout the various levels. It is the comparison of the original concept thought up by two children and the working designed construction of the game which stays nearly true to the original premise which makes this idea and concept somewhat magical and interesting. You can see other games by this designer here... http://www.dijayko.com/\n\nThere are a number of mixed reviews mainly due to the fact that the controls of the keyboard suck and more often then not will have you hacking away at the opposite direction to the enemy. Also the game is EXTREMELY difficult and most people are somewhat forced to rage quit somewhere during it's duration. So why then do I give this game a massive THUMBS UP???\n\nIf you have a controller you will not experience any problems with controls not being precise and as for the level of difficulty, yes it is a very challenging game to master and get through on the hardest difficulty which is what is needed if you are to unlock Steam achievements. However I find this level of difficulty somewhat rewarding and satisfying knowing it is somewhat an accomplishment venturing forwards. In fact at the time of my writing this, only three people in this world have thus far ever completed this game 100%.\n\nThe game never takes itself to seriously and there is a number of snickering moments. The levels are somewhat cute and each level adds it's own difficulty needing to be mastered. There are a number of weapons which you will need to upgrade extensively if you are to master this. And the soundtrack which accompanies the game is truly magnificent. It'll sound like there is an orchestra playing in each one of your eardrums. The level designs are somewhat friendly when it comes to navigation and you won't need to waste large amounts of time travelling to that place needed.\n\nStory is that monsters have spawned in and simply need to be stabbed a thousand times over to get the place of pen and paper back to looking how it use to look.\n\nThe game reminds me of other childlike looking games for the adult gamer like 'Neverhood' but even more challenging. From get go, the game does not like you and will want to poke you off a cliff every single second it can just to be done with you. Currently I myself am on the very last level of the game, perplexed with the jumping and hacking task which lays before me, but I keep reminding myself that's exactly how I felt when I was playing level 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on. Maybe one day I too will have this 100% completed trophy shimmering away in my trophy case.\n\nMy only complaint about this game is I would love to have seen pictures of these two kids which made this game or maybe even an interview as an extra bonus at the end of the game for completing it. Alas the only bonus you do get, is the knowledge of the fact that you have done so...","May 16, 2015","true","56.2"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

On the one hand this platformer-RPG has some cute graphics (although quite a lot of people won't like how simple and "empty" they can be) and a great, relaxing soundtrack. There are plenty of levels with ascending difficulty and a huge variety of enemies and bosses -every world, literally, has its own kind of enemies- that throw away tons of loot to collect which then can be used to upgrade weapons or construct different stuff like some very useful teleporters. If you want a relaxing game to play when you have some free time and you find its graphics appealing, then you can give it a try (since it doesn't cost much), but you have to play it on easy or medium at max, cause hard is irritatingly difficult.\n\nQuite disappointingly, hard is the only way to gain achievements and unfortunately it's very difficult and unfair. Platforms tend to get smaller and smaller as you progress and your jumps have to be more and more accurate every time, thus making the last worlds almost impossible to beat, since the controls lack the precission needed to make these jumps and if you press the button a tiny bit longer you fall into the gap and have to start the level all over again, as there's no sign of a checkpoint even on the biggest levels. God knows how many unnecessary and irritating deaths you will have to suffer on your way to beat the game (if your nerves manage to fight it till the end). And since this isn't enough, even these simple graphics can get confusing at times. For example some enemies can be hidden behind a tree or on a platform that's beneath you and you can't see them properly, so if you don't pay much attention you might get hit and fall, which equals to even more unnecessary deaths.\n\nHowever, the most annoying thing about this game is that you don't expect this kind of difficulty. There are these cute graphics, made by kids, there's also the sounds that make you relax and the first levels are quite easy, too. So you lossen yourself and sit back and then you get suddenly caught off-guard and smacked hard in your face for being such an unwary fool.\n\nSo, finally, if you want to have a little fun for some hours or buy something for your kid, you could give this game a try, if nothing else is on your mind, but if you are an achievement hunter that wants every game completed 100%, you should first double-check that you can handle the irritation caused by this game's unfairness, before playing it.","June 20, 2015","false","26.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","2"
