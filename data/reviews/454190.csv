"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oceiota/recommended/454190/","Oceiota","snarkmageddon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oceiota/","168 products in account","Product received for free\n\nIt's a pretty good game. At first glance it seem like something really easy and relaxing but it can be a bit challenging at some levels too (which of course just makes victory all the sweeter). Overall I liked the simple design and calming music which even though is rather repetitive when I actually pay attention to it that didn't bother me while playing. If anything it fits the level design pretty well. It is a nice break from fast paced games and the puzzles are just at the right level of challenge for me. Not laughably easy and not annoyingly hard, though it does fall more on the easy spectrum.\nOf course this is by no means a ground breaking experience or something a gamer just HAS to experience but rather a fun pastime that demands a few more braincells than watching cat videos. The idea is hardly new but the soft colors and music and the lack of a timer or a fall from the edge just when you're about to finish it gave me a soothing feeling while playing and even though it is not an instant favorite for me I did enjoy playing it.\nEverything works fine and for its price I think that the fact that it looks like a flash game can be easily forgiven. It has simple mechanics, minimalistic design and you can also change the buttons. I made "R" my restart button instead of the default "Del" and it's not a groundbreaking victory but I'm happy that I could. Overall, I looked but found nothing to complain about. Even the most casual gamer of whatever age can play it, it runs without a problem and feels like playing checkers with a good friend on a summer afternoon (well to me at least, don't hold me accountable if that's not how you feel when you play it).\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

Nothing much else to offer after you solve them all.\n\nOnly issue I had, hardware wise, was the FPS was in single digits when there was a lot of 3d objects in a level, but soon as I got close to the end of the level my FPS goes up gradually\n\nThe music is very soothing for a puzzle game.\n\nWhile I could do a refund since I beaten it under 2 hours, I won't. I would find that abusing the refund policy. Besides, I liked the concept it had. Gotten stuck a few times but usually managed to find a solution after a few attempts. It's a keeper.","March 30","true","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You are introduced to the concept of the game in the first few levels, and nothing gets added - just a slowly increasing amount of waypoints you have to pass through to get to the goal - the only real step up in difficulty is about half way through the second set of 16 levels when you start to get two pairs of waypoints of the same colour, although in most cases it tends to be fairly clear which ones pair together, but this mechanic does allow a few more interesting levels late in the game.\n\nIn terms of the interface it is mostly fairly good - the menu is simple to use, and in the game I used arrow keys to move around and enter for the next level (saving having to switch to mouse until the set of 16 had ended). The main frustration I had was the animations for colouring up/down and the goal descending, which jar the flow of the game every time you get to a checkpoint on your route.\n\nSo overall if you want a quick relatively simple puzzle game that can be finished in an hour or two you should be okay here, but don't expect too much.","March 20","true","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For extremely simple graphics (which would be fine if it ran well) I get about 5-15 fps (on the same rig that I get 45-60 fps for TF2 with good quality settings).\n\n-Input lag, while not totally debilitating, is consistently irritating, especially when you move one space too far due to delayed input registration.\n\n-It would also occasionally freeze at the completing of a level until I pressed ESC to bring up the menu.  Again, not totally debilitating, but another annoyance and in a simple game like this a significant percentage of the experience.\n\n-Achievements are epically bugged.  I unlocked the achievement for completing all easy levels, no problem‚Ä¶ BUT when I unlocked the achievement for completing all medium levels, the first achievement re-locked.  That's right, RE-LOCKING ACHIEVEMENTS ON STEAM.  How did the dev even manage that?  Sadly that can only be classified as an epic failure.  I have reinstalled and repeated this process twice with the same result of the easy level achievement re-locking upon another achievement unlocking.\n\n\nIf the achievements are fixed and the input lag and framerate are improved (say by a factor of 3) then Cubicolor would be almost worth the price for 1-2 hours of gameplay. I will say that the music and sound effects are nice for this kind of game.  Hopefully it is fixed in the future.\n\nAs it is, I can only advise to either stay away or be ready to request a refund if it has the same problems on your system.","April 2","false","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of the later puzzles boards are bigger with more colors, have a longer solution but they are not more difficult. I do like this game idea. I would recommend it to others, but if I could have a do over, I would NOT buy it myself. In my opinion, this game doesn't have enough complexity to be that interesting, and unfortunately, that complexity is limited by the curent boundaries of the gameboard (the main problem being, the more colors options the designer adds, the harder it is for him/her to disguise the solution path, which is why the 'smart' and 'genius' levels are not really hard at all. I think to fully realize this idea, the game board would have to at least be on some 3D, perhap even with klein bottle characteristics (cube can roll on either side of the 3D board).\n\nA minor complain is that I don't would like to control the speed of the cube so I can move faster and also I don't want to wait for the colors to change. By the time I make my first move, I already know the solution and I don't want to waste time.","March 21","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For less than $2USD I feel I got my money's worth.\n10/10 - would think myself to sleep again.\n\n\nPros:\nVery relaxing, a good simple game to take your mind off things for a short time.\nThe audio really makes the game. Glad to see creative commons music used and properly attributed. The sound effects as you plod around fit just right too.\nIt has a very gentle difficulty curve. Starts off incredibly easy and (very) slowly gets harder. The harder levels are a challenge too. There's three tiers, each with 16 levels - Normal, Smart, and Genius. I spent two hours with various distractions and got halfway through Genious. I'd say there's about 3 hours of gameplay and it's certainly replayable.\nThere's enough puzzles that you should be able to replay it without memorizing all of them.\nGraphics are simple and clean and scale well between low and high resolutions. No problems with framerate myself.\n\n\nThe game released today on steam so I'm not sure if any of this will change.\nCons:\nI couldn't get fullscreen mode to work right. When set, mouse clicks are offset from where the mouse displays, making it impossible to do anything. I had to manually pull up the game files, edit the settings xml, and disable fullscreen to get it to work again.\nMenus cannot be navigated via keyboard. It would be really nice to keep the flow of things. On a similar note, it would be nice if the mouse's right-click could pull up the menu too.\nNo controller support. The game lends itself well to being played via controller. There are mapping programs to map controls to keyboard keys but that's a bit overboard for such a casual game.\nSimilar to another review, I had a bug where I completed a level but it didn't seem to register and bring up the level completion menu. Pressing escape seemed to force it up though. Not too big of a deal but I guess it's worth mentioning.\n\nI definately enjoyed the game and would certainly enjoy some new levels. Possibly more in the same difficulties or new difficulties with larger playing fields, more color variations, or even just one color for everything.","March 18","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/454190/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","There are games that resonate with you more than others. Sometimes they‚Äôre from genres that you don‚Äôt regularly play. Cubicolor reminded me of the things that I loved about my school education. I can appreciate that to some of you that may sound bizarre but I was at my best as a student when I was given patterns, arithmetic and comprehension tasks to complete. I‚Äôve always had an avid love of both words and numbers. Although I didn‚Äôt do as well in maths in high school as what I should have I can put that down to teacher-student conflicts more than a disliking for the curriculum that was being taught. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by sporting statistics as well and working out the various patterns involved in comprehending the how and the why certain things perform the way that they do.\n\nCubicolor is yet another minimalist game that we have featured. This time you need to find your way throughout each level by changing color by moving over the plus marker and hitting the painted square of said color before moving on to the next color until you‚Äôve completed all colors and get to the exit. It sounds easy in theory but once you move over a box it disappears and you are unable to move over that square again. Therefore the game is a pattern maze. Some of the levels are easier than they look yet the majority are the other way around ‚Äì much more of a challenge than you would initially think.\n\nOne addition that would add a lot of value to the game is for Moltenplay to add a level editor. I‚Äôd love to see what the Steam community would be able come up with. Some of the workshop items added in other games are some of the best contributions to the game and are often pieces of brilliance that the developers of the game couldn‚Äôt have possibly thought of. This is often the case in puzzle games as it is a genre that often allows for creativity.\n\nThus far I‚Äôve only completed the normal levels but I very much look forward to completing the even more challenging levels.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Roll the now-colored cube onto a same-colored square to make it disappear.  Every square you roll across disappears, so pay attention to your path, because it matters.  The goal is to get all the colored squares to disappear, while leaving yourself a final path to the exit tile.\n\nIt's a fun minimalist title, with 48 levels in all.  None are more challenging than a few minutes of trying a few different paths before you'll find the solution.  I was left wanting more, but what was here was solid.  The art is well done, the UI is pretty minimal, which is fine, since a game like this doesn't need much in terms of UI.\n\nOverall it's a fun indie title made by a single dev who got themself through Greenlight.

I didn't feel it gradually getting harder, with some middle game levels being quite hard and some of the last ones solved in 2 seconds, but maybe it's just me. I enjoyed playing it overall though.","March 21","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
