"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/47540/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","290 products in account","Developed by Infinite Interactive and published by Namco Networks America, Puzzle Quest 2 is the sequel to the award winning Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords. This title is a match 3 puzzle roleplaying game and certainly one of the best in the genre. Your chosen hero is tasked with reclaiming the once peaceful village of Veloren from the evil clutches of the demon Gorgon. Many fans claim that this title is not as heavy on the R.P.G. elements as the first game and that the story is just not as expansive as the first title and I would definitely agree. With that said, roleplaying elements are still present albeit slightly lighter in application. You pick from four different character classes and earn XP as you do battle across the outskirts of Veloren. As you level up, your earned XP will allow you to upgrade a number of abilities such as Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Stamina and Morale. Your character is also able to equip a number of weapons ranging from swords, axes, bows, etc. and even a flintlock pistol...one of my personal favorites I have to say. There is also a wide variety of armors, shields, spells and poisons at your disposal as well, however, some of these items are specific to the character class that you have chosen.\n\nGameplay is quite similiar to that of Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords so fans of that title will immediately feel at home. The goal is to match a set of three or more gems in order to earn mana and action points. Mana powers the equiped spells in your spellbook and action points allow you to attack with your chosen weapon or devices. At the conclusion of each battle a certain amount of gold and experience points are awarded as well as the possibility of loot. The puzzle battles in this game, in my opinion, are some of the best you can play in this genre. This title is extremely fun and addictive like these games typically tend to be. Some days you could log on and play a few quick battles for fun just to get your fix and other days you could find yourself playing for hours on end in one sitting. The story, while not as grand as the first title, is entertaining and makes you want to continue playing to the conclusion. Aside from the basic puzzle battles, there are also quite a few unique minigames to play where you can earn additional treasure and experience.\n\nGraphically, this game is the best looking match 3 puzzle R.P.G. available even better looking than Gyromancer in my opinion. Visually, it takes everything that Puzzle Quest did and just polishes it to perfection. The isometric game world is highly detailed. You will see lots of interesting things in the backgrounds of the many dungeons, castles and structures that you explore. The puzzle battlefields are gorgeous and vivid. The gems are beautifully animated and extremely detailed. The hand drawn character art and attack animations just look fantastic. Sound effects and music in this game are also implemented just as well. The score fits the fantasy theme of the title perfectly and does it job competently yet I have to say it's still not as great as the musical scores in Puzzle Quest and Puzzle Kingdoms. I actually downloaded those soundtracks and find myself listening to them quite often because they are just that great. The sound effects are crisp and hard hitting. When you make a match three, combo or cause a cascade of gems to drop you definitely know it. Also, when you use a melee, ranged weapon or a spell the sound effects are phenomenal. I particularly love the click click boom of my flintlock pistol...so awesome! A pistol in a fantasy game...don't even ask it's just awesome and you know it is.\n\nI've spent quite a few hours in this game and will continue to do so in the future because it's just so entertaining. Fans of match 3 or puzzle/R.P.G.'s should not be dissapointed in this title. It's definitely one of the better games of the genre and anyone looking to try one of these games for the first time should get either this or the much acclaimed Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords.

Most notable are the changes to mana and that you now have a weapon. Overall I'd say it was a good change, as it doesn't feel like a recycled version of the first game at all, while still having the same basic gameplay.\n\nWith the mana changes, it's harder to become godly, but it also feels like every level gain is a really tiny improvement. Heavily investing in one stat has diminishing returns (which is fine from a balance perspecive). Enemies scale up a bit faster than you do, and once dead they stay dead, so there's a strange sort of progression going on there since you can't grind forever.\n\nSimilar to the first game, the encounter rate is through the roof. Fortunately you can skip a good number of encounters by simply ignoring the monsters. There's far less quests, but most of the quests in the first game were pretty pointless to begin with, so I guess this is can be seen as a good thing.\n\nFortunately the mini-games are toned down and varied, and luckily opening treasures has no failure. So it's nice to have freebies every now and then to break up the monotony.\n\nThe story, as best I can tell, bears no relation to the first game. Not that either one is special, anyhow.\n\nIf you like Puzzle Quest 1, I'd say this is a worthy addition. If match-three games aren't your thing, this game won't do anything to appease that feeling. I'll give this an 8.","December 4, 2013","true","42.7"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","38","41","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/industrian/recommended/47540/","industrian","industrian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/industrian/","415 products in account","Coming after the complete mess that was Puzzle Quest: Galactrix, Puzzle Quest 2 returns to the tried-and-tested Puzzle Quest formula we know and love with some enhancements to the gameplay and a streamlined story/quest mode. It's a good game (I wouldn't have played it for as long as I did if it wasn't) but leaves some things to be desired.\n\nFirst things first: the game is *incredibly* slow compared to its predecessor, both in character movement on the map screen and within the gameplay itself. And whilst the story of the original didn't set any new records in originality, Puzzle Quest 2's story is both completely unrelated to the first and so boring that I just skipped it entirely. They have also stripped out large chunks of the sidegames in the first game (castle building, mount training, item creation, etc) and replaced them with laughably easy "unlock doors" and "disarm traps" minigames.\n\nThe addition of the new weapon system makes things interesting, and opens up a new strategy to the game. But towards the end of the game I found this just made the game a cycle of building up weapon points, and unleashing them on the enemy - ending the fight within a few turns of doing so and reducing fights to a monotonous routine. The armor/blocking mechanic is also interesting at first, but to be honest it just makes the game slower.\n\nThat all said though, it's still a good game. Three-in-a-row game mechanics are simple and addictive, and I don't feel that the time I spent playing the game was wasted, but I don't see myself replaying it any time soon due to its slow nature (compared to the first game that I completed at least five times.)\n\nIf you like three-in-a-row games then you'll like this. But I would recommend the first Puzzle Quest a lot more than its sequel.","May 16, 2014","true","49.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Alright game, but not as good as 1.\n\nPQ2 was very streamlined compared to PQ1, though not as streamlined as Marvel Puzzle Quest.  Compared to 1 there are neither elemental masteries nor elemental resistance.  Your weapon is now an activatable ability, which you use a new type of gem to activate.  The weapon becomes your primary form of damage.\n\nThe fights are alright for the most part, except for the one or two times your weapon is replace by a very, very awful item that you have to use to kill a tough boss.  That fight ruined the game for me.\n\nThe overworld isn't a map so much as it is an explorable world, but with that comes confusion and annoyance.  There are secrets to be found but they're not very well hidden, and the paths are almost always blocked by a beastie of some sort.  You know, except for when they aren't, so you go around the entire dungeon just to avoid one fight.  I don't recall if monsters respawn or not, but I believe that they do not.\n\nThe entire experience was less enchanting than that of PQ1, but that doesn't mean this is a bad game.

I'll admit, it's not the most original story, but I didn't clock 40+ hours into this game for nothing. It's the addictive gameplay mechanics that kept me hanging around.\n\nThis game is a combination of Bejeweld style puzzle matching and RPG. By matching certain gems, you fuel your character's abilities, deal damage to the enemy, or build strength for melee attacks. As your character levels up, you gain access to better weapons and better abilities. Figuring out a strategy against your foes is incredibly rewarding, and if certain spells are timed right, your character can quickly come a formidable opponent. Leveling up my character was a blast, and with each new dungeon came numerous new enemy types for me to test my skills.\n\nThere are also tons of side quests to complete, given to you by the many village folk you come across on your travels. There is never a shortage of things to do. Also I cannot forget to mention that this game is gorgeous. The hand-drawn worlds and creatures are a sight to behold, and some of the bosses are unforgettable.\n\nThe only negative is that once you nail down your strategy, gameplay can begin to feel repetitive. While I was constantly rewarded with new spells and weapons, I found early on that a single spell combination was the most effective for my character, which meant I was repeating the same tactics over and over, making things a bit mundane. This is why I encourage experimentation instead of taking the boring route like I did.\n\nFor RPG and Bejeweled fans, this game is excellent. You get a ton of bang for your buck, and you will find yourself coming back time and time again.","May 28, 2014","true","46.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I got this game through a humble bundle, so it wasn't a waste of money. It started off fun, basicly it's a deeper version of Bejeweled  where matching colors gives you points that you can then use to activate certin skills in order to defeat your opponent.  Leveling up gives you access to new skills.  It was fun until about halfway through the game, where I kept thinking to myself "I've gone this far, I might as well finish it." But it just kept going.  Battle after battle. Fight after fight.  I rarely changed skills once I found an effective combo. Monsters rarely even posed a challenge, even towards the end, and the final boss was easily dispatched.  The "combat" just got so repetitive I was praying for the game to be over.  The odd thing was, once I beat the final boss, the game continued, as if I wanted the chance to go back and beat every single encounter that I may have missed.  No way.  I cant say this game is bad, but I can only recomend it if you REALLY like Bejeweled, and even then it's a chore.  It was suffering to "beat" it. No way in hell would I suffer through trying to get all of the achievments.  I didn't try online, so I cant say, but I doubt playing against a human would be much better.","December 30, 2013","false","51.6"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","0"

That game was broken in some ways, but not in a bad way, more that if you were careful and managed things just right, you could eventually create an amazingly over-powered character that could 'lock down' the whole board and win by the first or second turn.\n\nSure that made multiplayer pretty unmanagable, but for the single player game it actually gave a certain level of domination satisfaction of 'here is my incredibly over-powered end game character let me just splatter the fields of puzzle-battle with the remains of anyone foolish enough to challenge me'.\n\nI mention this because I guess having seen how over powered people could become in the first game, it seems like they made it a priority to 'fix' that in this second outing.\n\nWhile the core gameplay survived intact, it seems like they have gone to great lengths to reduce the utility and natural meshing of the various skills and secondary mechanics to the point it honestly feels less like an RPG dressed in puzzle elements, and more like a basic match 3 game with some very light rpg traces sprinkled in.\n\nThe 'overworld' is now quite limiting and slow.  While there are a number of options to go and do, they are often so removed and seperated that you will spend as much time wandering slowly from screen to screen as you will actually battling bad guys.  Additionally it feels like a number of the areas you 'could' possibly go are more or less artificially blocked by bad guys way higher level than you to the point that in the end there really is only one fairly linear line of progression along the enemies that won't just smash you routinely.\n\nIts not truly *bad* in that the core matching and fighting is ok, it just seems like here in the second outing, the overall rpg tone is honestly a net negative, not positive like it was the first time around.","June 7, 2014","false","7.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Puzzle Quest 2 tries to improve on the very simplistic quest style of the original by adding new puzzle types, brief voiceovers, and a third-person mode. However, the new puzzles aren't much different or more fun than previously, and navigating between screens and NPCs is an awkward, bogged-down process that seriously slows down game progress.  I often find myself just waiting for the game to let me move ahead. In addition, the soundtrack is dull and lifeless so far.

As in Bejeweled, spaces on the board are cleared by forming rows of matching colors, and empty areas are filled with additional tiles that drop in from offscreen. If you're lucky, the gems that drop in will match adjacent gems and cause additional cascades of damage to your enemy; many people have observed that this "luck" seems to happen much more frequently in the computer-controlled opponent's favor than it does the player's.\n\nScientists have demonstrated that many primates have an innate sense of fairness: if you give one monkey a greater reward than another received for the same task, they notice and become hostile. That being said, it's a given that nearly all artificial intelligence in video games cheats to some degree, since this is the easiest, most reliable way that a computer can present any sort of challenge to the human brain. Because of this sensitivity to unfairness we share with other primates, though, an important part of video game AI is not that it avoid cheating--which is extraordinarily difficult--but that it avoid the APPEARANCE of cheating. A single glimpse of obvious cheating by the computer is often enough to completely ruin a game forever.\n\nPuzzle Quest's developers claim that the game doesn't cheat, and more specifically that it doesn't know the makeup of the gems that will fall into the board after a move; I'm not convinced. What I am sure of, though, is that it FEELS like the computer is cheating, and it made the time I spent playing this game one of the most frustrating and least rewarding experiences of my life.","November 26, 2013","false","7.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Tactical decision making is surprisingly deep given the wide array of spells per class. Itemization, while somewhat diverse, is a bit lacking and arguably meaningless at times. Similarly, on normal difficulty the game doesn't present too much of a challenge and the penalty for losing combat is a counter intuitive -- you actually gain experience points for a failed encounter. That said, the positives far outweigh the negatives and one play through will give you roughly 40ish hours of entertainment depending on the number of side quests completed.  Additionally the classes are distinct enough that you'll probably want to check all of them out potentially quadrupling your game time. There are also Endurance, Tournament, and an online Versus mode that yield even more replay value.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yayforbeers/recommended/47540/","yayforbeers","YayForBeers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yayforbeers/","186 products in account","This is by far my favorite game in the Puzzle Quest series.  If you're looking for a change from the twitch gameplay of FPS and Action RPG games, this one offers a very chill experience.  The game is absolutely huge too, and there are no shortage of fights, treasures, and traps to discover.  The RPG elements are surprisingly deep for what is essentially a game of Bejeweled.  I really enjoyed the equipment and upgrade system, as well as the large amount of spells you can use for battles.  It sets up a surprising amount of strategy for battles.\n\nAs great as this game is, there are also some issues, though nothing that ruins the experience.  The AI is pretty much infalliable, especially if you leave a 4 or 5 match on the board accidentally.  It will always match it, without fail.  Regardless of how good you are, you will sometimes miss these bonus matches - and the AI always makes you pay immediately.  Second, some of the fights seem to drag quite a bit later in the game.. some of the trash monsters seem to cling to life for quite some time.  They're still very easy fights, but it shouldn't take 15+ minutes for a glorious hero to take down a random skeleton.  (Though it should be noted that I play a templar, and they're not meant to be damage machines)  Lastly, the board seems to Mana Drain a little more often than it should.  I understand there's a very random aspect to this game, but the AI should be able to compensate for this when deciding what the next gems will be.  I've had some fights mana drain 3 or 4 times in a few minutes, and that really draws out the battles.\n\nAgain, these problems are very minor, and I would still give this game a 9/10.  It's simply great addictive fun.","December 14, 2013","true","17.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While this still makes for a good game, it pales in comparison to the original Puzzle Quest. The maps are not as interesting and there certainly is not as much to do. The introduction of mini-games to determine quality and quantity of loot gets tedious; fast. The game looks just as polished as its predecessor.\n\nIn this Puzzle Quest, you cannot have your own castle or ride mounts or capture enemies to learn their abilities. This definitely takes away from the replayability of the game. Being able to learn any ability from any enemy really added a level of depth that, when missing, makes PQ2 feel barren.\n\nOverall, this game is not bad, but I do feel the developers tried changing too much with their game and took it in a direction that is less welcoming to people who wish to replay it.","December 31, 2013","true","10.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In the original, after you chose a class, you could learn all of their "spells" and also learn spells from those that you have battled a few time and whom you captured. You had a keep and you could improve these skills even more. It was fun and made fighting the same mobs worth it so you could build up your spellbook.  You could tame a "mount" and learn its spells. You did all of the learning via a slightly different matching game which was easier or harder due to the power of the spell being learned. In the end, you had a lot of choices on how to play and could have fun mix and matching your options.\n\nNot this game. There are a handful of spells for each class and that is it. There is a feeling of grinding which I did not have in the original.

Maybe a tad too long, as I felt I was done with the game before finishing it, and the leveling track, but maybe that's just me.\n\nOverall, you are playing a match 3 game, where events you complete build up power reserves that you use to deal damage to a NPC AI. The game sometimes feels like it's cheating, but overall the experience is fair. There are four classes to choose from, with a extensive ability list for each one, so you can customize your play experience to the style you like... although honestly, solving puzzles and dealing damage with weapons will probably get you just as far.\n\nIf you want a more portable experience, this will do.

It involves a simple concept: a puzzle game with rules similar to Bejeweled, and then takes this concept and stretches, twists, and rebrands it into a series of related minigames that are just different enough to feel like different concepts.\n\nThe overall system is a loosely cobbled together RPG. You have a character, who has stats, that goes on quests, and gets loot. Every combat, test, and "Roll", however, is judged by your performance in the Bejeweled-like game. In combat you play versus the AI, in lock picking and trap disarming you play solo but with a limited number of moves to make matches, etc. There's no mistaking it: PQ2 is the same puzzle, rebranded over and over.\n\nThe story is paper-thin, and is basically an excuse to fight fight fight, but the puzzle is a brain-teaser, and the AI can get pretty rough. There's also a multiplayer dueling mode for online play. It's also a very chill game that can be played for a few minutes at a time.","March 3, 2011","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game becomes repetitive with each battle becoming longer then the previous one. On top of which instead of programing a better AI with more strategic skill no. Instead to increase difficulty they make the AI set itself up by purposefully changing the gem drops so it all ways gets good cascades. so instead of have good abilities that actually make the game your stuck with abilities that are more or  less useless.\nunlike the first game where there was a lot of customization your stuck with a very limited number of abilities and no puzzles to boost items. also they got rid of the experience gems and gold gems that rewarded the player for longer matches.

Ok, I tell you as a friend: This is not the kind of game that you're gonna want to play for an entire day. It's meant to be tried casually, like doing only a few battles per day. I've made the mistake of fighting way too many combats at once and now I really don't feel like launching this thing ever again. Seriously, it gradually wears you down.

In the original, after you chose a class, you could learn all of their "spells" and also learn spells from those that you have battled a few time and whom you captured. You had a keep and you could improve these skills even more. It was fun and made fighting the same mobs worth it so you could build up your spellbook.  You could tame a "mount" and learn its spells. You did all of the learning via a slightly different matching game which was easier or harder due to the power of the spell being learned. In the end, you had a lot of choices on how to play and could have fun mix and matching your options.\n\nNot this game. There are a handful of spells for each class and that is it. There is a feeling of grinding which I did not have in the original.

It involves a simple concept: a puzzle game with rules similar to Bejeweled, and then takes this concept and stretches, twists, and rebrands it into a series of related minigames that are just different enough to feel like different concepts.\n\nThe overall system is a loosely cobbled together RPG. You have a character, who has stats, that goes on quests, and gets loot. Every combat, test, and "Roll", however, is judged by your performance in the Bejeweled-like game. In combat you play versus the AI, in lock picking and trap disarming you play solo but with a limited number of moves to make matches, etc. There's no mistaking it: PQ2 is the same puzzle, rebranded over and over.\n\nThe story is paper-thin, and is basically an excuse to fight fight fight, but the puzzle is a brain-teaser, and the AI can get pretty rough. There's also a multiplayer dueling mode for online play. It's also a very chill game that can be played for a few minutes at a time.","March 3, 2011","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love both of those game genres, this will be quite an amazing buy!”\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, I still stand by the fact that the game concept is incredible. Don’t worry, I’m getting to the point.\n\nThere are 4 classes to choose from. I created the Templar because he looked like a badass savage who gets the finest of poon on the reg. I set the difficulty to easy because I wanted to get a decent feel for the game before progressing to medium.\n\nSo I’m playing, killing monsters by beating puzzles, getting nasty armor, and completing quests. At this point, I’m saying to myself, “Man, I am such a G for finding this game. I’m winning way too easily though, let’s turn this puppy up to medium”.\n\nAny normal human being would think that medium means “The computer makes more educated moves to beat the player”. Well not this autistic game. In this game, medium means “Every time gems drop after the player makes his move, we’ll make sure that the correct gems drop for the computer so that it can get as many combos as possible”. Also, whenever the game gives you a recommendation on which gems to move, it sets the computer up to do massive damage for you. I’ve tested this hypothesis by playing multiple games, which Is why I am confident in my conclusion that my original accusations are definitely true.\n\nSo you must be thinking to yourself, “man, so you get $h1yt stomped on medium”? No, you still always win because you just have tons of health over all of the opponents. Hell, even all of the bosses that I have faced have had less health than me. If you’re going to rig the game, then at least FAHKIN beat me.\n\nThis game could have had so much potential, but the developers just decided to have downs syndrome instead.\n\nThen again, maybe I’ve become enough of an adult to realize the unfairness in games such as this one. Maybe this is God telling me that it’s time to grow up.\n\nYou know what? Maybe I should uninstall steam and focus on getting my life together. I have a textbook on MySQL that I should be studying. I should be paying attention to my girlfriend. Who knows, she could potentially be my wife someday. You know, I should really be spending quality time with my parents. I mean, they won’t be around forever.\n\nMan, Puzzle Quest 2 has really made me analyze what my priorities should be in this world.
