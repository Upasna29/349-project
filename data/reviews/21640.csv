Over time the levels get more difficult by adding obstacles, introducing various animal types to chase and even some enemies like wolves that can get really annoying while trying to do a double gold star rating on some of the levels.\n\nAs a child I had a toy that was an enclosed A4 shaped plasctic case with a clear top covering filled with little plastic pieces that you had to push around with a little truck that was moved by using a magnet under the bottom of the case. Somehow this game reminds me of it.\n\nI had great fun with this thing during my childhood and man am a I having fun with this game here now.\n\nI can totally recommend this game to everybody who likes a deep challenge from a game that looks so cute while being brutally difficult at times to master.\n\nAnd the music ... you've got to listen to the music in the main menu. Man I love that sh*t oozing that 70's scifi flair out of every inch ...\n\n(Though I have to admit while it's perfectly playable with your standard X-Box Controller, playing with your keyboard and mouse could get a little bit complicated as the difficulty keeps rising in the higher levels making it nearly impossible to win the missions without a controller ... you know what? This game is the perfect excuse for you to finally get yourself a Controller too ... I'm serious!)\n\nCheck the demo, have fun with it and then go an buy the game. It's totaly worth every penny they're asking for it.\n","September 25, 2014","true","4.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The music is fitting and it's upbeat, the controls can be changed from to completely mouse, to completely keyboard...or a mix of the two. This is for a casual gamer, someone who enjoys playing games but isn't out to get into anything too serious and is more or less just looking for something to pass time on. Another benefit is that levels can be replayed at anytime, should you find yourself getting silver instead of gold. The game also provides upgrades throughout your playing experience so that you are not just stuck with threatening to abduct and can't.\n\nBottom line: if you're a casual gamer, like me...then this is for you.","January 7, 2012","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's less a puzzle game, more a speed challenge.  Push the animals toward the mother ship, do your best to keep them from falling off a cliff or falling behind, and get the bare minimum there before the time runs out to seal your gold medal.  I don't think it's a bad game, so, strange as it may seem, I'm recommending it on a conditional basis.  If a more arcade-y, challenge-type game is what you're looking for have at it.  If you're wanting a cerebral experience, probably not.  (It does depend on how smart you are to begin with, I suppose.)","February 8","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're going to have a learning curve, but don't let it deter you. I'd play this game more often if I didn't have 30+ already from Steam and a handfull of go-to games among that number.","April 28","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
