Perhaps the star is the voxel-based environment, which starts out looking so glossy and cheery and then, in the chaos of battle, gets smashed to pieces in a manner reminiscent of maybe "Scorched Earth" more than anything else. Like in X-Com, the randomly-generated characters tend to work their way into your heart as you level them up, customising them for a particular combat role, and then - just as they're reaching their full potential - they tend to die tragically. I haven't gotten far enough to know if the endgame is good, but I feel I've definitely gotten my money's worth from the beginning and midgame.","March 17, 2015","true","11.4"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","45","49","4","0"

I'm assuming if you're reading about Enemy you're already familiar with squad based tactics and roguelikes. (If you're not, I'd check out other reviews). The unique aspects of the game include the destructable environment, the 80's video game idiom, a surprisingly easy game to mod in your own content, and a good level of squad customization. And of course, the combining of the squad turn based tactics and elements of the roguelike genre such as permadeath, no ability to reload saves, and procedural generation so that each game is unique.\n\nThe deliciousness of the voxel-based fully destructable world cannot be underestimated. Watching a a walking  bomb blow up a house, grenading a section of the castle ceiling on someone, or debris smack your players around are all deeply satisfying.  The unit customization is fun to mess with, and allows for a good variety of squaddies. You can have troops that react quickly to incoming enemies, ones that can see far and keep calm in difficult situations, ones that can move farther and jump higher when they need to, and ones that just don't die as quickly.\n\nOn the weapons of choice, in addition to ranged and melee you have bombs (throwing grenades for the most part, though you have land mines, tear gas, time bombs and staves) and Throwing. Throwing is a bit of an odd duck in some aspects-it's definitely the skill I'm most likely to injure my squad mates with, but picking up chunks of castle and chucking them provides for deeply satisfying moments. It also requires a bit more set up as you're constantly scavenging for the best things to throw at people and/or relying on other units for damage as much as you can.\n\nThe really neat thing is that, say, unlike X-COM, you have near complete customization when it comes to character growth. While the supporting troops you get are from a set of random archetypes, over time you will be able to mold them into the troops you want.\n\nIn terms of unique game mechanics for squad based tactics, the two major additions are mental damage and reaction fire. Mental damage is taken when your troops are hit or nearly hit, set on fire, or other various phenonama occurs. When it hits zero, your character will either go beserk, attacking the nearest enemy, or panic. I haven't seen this occur much in my own troops (I make the Mind stat a priority) but deliberately initiating it in the enemy is good fun. Firing shots with little to no chance of success becomes a valid tactic, and I've panicked more than one enemy by throwing bridge sections at it.\n\nA high reaction stat allows you to interrupt movement and actions by enemies. And if you have low reaction they will at times interrupt your actions.  Multiple interrupts a turn can happen, especially if you're moving your chaacters cautiously. Doing so and leaving extra time units with them will add a great deal of longevity to them. It's not just reaction fire too-being able to step a few steps back or forward can be more than enough to turn a sudden enemy into a managable experience. I find it to be a quite enjoyable addition to the genre.\n\nThe game mechanics are not that readily apparent to the player (though Tom has added in assistance here and there) , especially one unfamiliar with squad based tactics norms, and I think, rightly or wrongly, that the developer is relying on player familiarity with the genre to a certain extent. Given that many people may be drawn to it for the nostalgia factor, I suspect that the relatively unforgiving mechanics are a bit of a rude awakening.\n\nWith that in mind, the game has been quite well supported beyond its release. I originally had three more paragraphs detailing bugs, changes, and additions to the game that I thought would add to its longevity. The Creator is active on these forums and has been diligent in squashing bugs and working to ensure the longevity of the game. My original concerns and suggestions have been more than dealt with, especially with the addition of difficulty modes.  With just a few modders, I believe Enemy can continue to shine for years to come.","March 23, 2015","true","266.5"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

From the Platforming repairman, to the green tunic wearing adventurer. With a focus on squad based combat, Enemy is not an easy game. Permadeath makes you question all your decisions. You move carefully from area to area battling enemies and getting all sorts of random loot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flashgit89/recommended/339570/","flashgit89","Entity 351","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flashgit89/","408 products in account","My feelings are mixed on this game. However, if I were asked by someone drawn to this game by the X-COM comparison in the description whether it was a good buy or not, I would tell them to pass. Why?\n\nCombat in Enemy feels like a conglomoration of stripped down mechanics from XCOM. There is no surpression mechanic, but there is 'Morale'. For some reason important, information such as telling the player exactly what they are improving when they level a character is also absent. For example: A player wants to increase the ranged skill of a character. Telling the player that every point they put into said skill increases their chance to hit by a "moderate" amount is totally worthless. What is "moderate"? 10%? 50%? It's like this for every skill and every weapon.\n\nIt is impossible to telll how skills and weapons synergize with one another and how much damage you're going to be putting out at your level. The same goes for armor. There is an entire shop dedicated to armor and there are is only two types of armor that seems to actually offer protection despite dozens of options to choose from.\n\nCombat itself is extremely bland. There doesn't seem to be any sort of critical hit chance, nor are there any abilities that are unique to any class or character. The Platformer class plays identically to the Action class if you put points into the correct skill. Not to mention that there really isn't a whole lot to do in combat itself. You either can attack or you move, like checkers. There is no flanking mechanic, no 'real' cover mechanic, no surpression, no interesting abilities that allow you to control enemies, no nothing.\n\nThere is a poorly implemented version of 'overwatch', however it's pretty much worthless.\n\nThis is all really dissapointing because at it's core ENEMY has some really cool ideas. It's totally bizzarre to me why the devs didn't design some sort of cover mechanic in a game with voxel based destruction.  It's totally bizzare to me how they have something like fire propagation but don't have something equally cool for the other elements.\n\nI get that this is sort of supposed to be a Tactical Turn Based Roguelike and it's supposed to be touch. However, Roguelikes are also supposed to offer opportunity, choice and encourage experimentation. There should be at least 3 or 4 ways around every enemy in a roguelike, the cost and avaliability of those choices combined with limited resources make roguelikes fun to play. You may lose horribly, but at least you learned something.\n\nNot so with Enemy. It all boils down to playing the Line of Sight game from a FPS mentality rather than a TBS one and hoping something doesn't pop out of the fog of war and kill you instantly.\n\nSo to wrap this review up: If playing roguelikes and games with a cut down version of the XCOM's combat than Enemy is sure to meet you about 1/3rd of the way there.","March 18, 2015","false","14.7"," 42 of 66 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","42","66","4","0"

In fact, you can even kill everyone and no one would ever run or put up a fight. Perhaps they think you're just playing with them?\nYou can dress up as a Princess or use an actual one and take on mobsters, purple masked men, skellies, and more enemies while armed with a Hugh Jazz stone block many times your own weight.\nDespite the fact that you can stomp mechants who charge you outrageous prices, you cannot loot their steel chests for their wares. Of course, the huge box can be used to completely demolish the side of the hotel when that greedy concierge works.\nP.R.I.N.C.E.S.S. stands for: "Person Reprogrammed to Immediately Neutralize Castles by Excessively Slinging Stuff."\nYou can jump inside the tall green pipes and end up somewhere else on the map and jump onto the yellow floating boxes, just like in those games about an Italian plumber and that gorilla. Just don't expect to get a mushroom or an all-consuming dino mount for your troubles.\nIs an archer shooting at you from the safe confines of a wooden house? Are you too lazy to break in and deal with him/her? Simply throw a molotov or a fire ball at the door and watch the helpless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ get barbequed and/or crushed by the collapsing roof after a few turns. Kind of like the movie 'The Wickerman', only that he'll be burning like wicker, man.\nMelee fighter + Explod'steve = Dead teammate + stupidity\nDespite interrupting an Explod'steve in mid jump with a ranged character, you can still miss even with 60%-70% accuracy, often with humorous/frustrating results. This happened to me twice within the same playthrough. Needlessly to say, I didn't get lucky twice.\nYou can lose your created character even in your first battle. This is never game-ending though as he/she is 'just another character'.\nFor a game world where four powerful kings are ravaging the lands and invading towns, there is currently a complete lack of (friendly) soldiers and guards in the field or inside the towns. In fact, there's no government officials or rulers anywhere. Perhaps they all died in a huge combined counterattack on the Four Kings' bases when they first appeared. The only member of nobility in this world is the Princess and she's content with becoming the world's most mobile and dangerous siege engine.\nThis is a thinking person's game. Doing the classic Zerg Rush will result in you being Zerg dead and it'll be Game Over for you, Zerg. Plan your moves carefully and you may even win the battle without losing anyone.\nThis is like 'Long Live The Queen', except that your princess is a badass and it'll be her enemies who won't get to live long.\nCranky Kong would've loved this game if it didn't have so much physics.\nThe Princess could actually be Chuck Norris dressed in drag but if that was true, then the game would've already been completed in like a second. When the player looks at the places he'd travelled through afterwards, they would see that there is nothing left...\nThere's a dinosaur man in this game who could very well become the Princess' apprentice.\nDue to the nature of combat in this game (stray projectiles, bombs, Explod'steves, falling trees, flying debris, etc.), you'll spend less time causing devastation to the surrounding environment in each battle than you will spend actually winning, even unintentionally. To win a fight without hurting a tile of grass or dislodging a chunk of tree bark is more likely to happen with luck than with strategy.9/10 thrown bricks.","June 7, 2015","true","49.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","11","11","5","0"

Another significant issue is the camera. Like, what the hell is with the camera? Four fixed directions, no zooming, clunky controll-ey. Also, another issue is the lack of customization. You are allowed to pick one class at the beginning, and you get two random party members which will either be cool or suck.\n\nNEUTRAL/CONS\nAnother issue is the "Panic" system, which briefly makes your character go cray and run around in random directions without your control any time your character's sanity stat goes too low, which happens all the time. Some people may like the risk, but I'm not into the whole "Completely lose control of your character for a few turns" thing, so I'll put this under neutral. Another issue I have is the fact that you have to deal with Player and Enemy turns even when there are no enemies around. Fallout 1 and 2 had tactical overhead combat that only became turn based once you enter combat, or are sighted by enemies, and this may of sped up the pace a bit in between encounters and all that.\n\nGraphics look kind of like Minecraft. Ew. 2011 called and it wants it's player model back.\n\nPROS\n\nRandomly generated-open world-tactical RPG. I don't think there are many other games like that.\n\nThough it is pretty glitchy right now, the destructable environments are solid killing machines.\n\nThe textures are sitting in a folder with no encryption or anything like that, just open up the folder and edit Blue Plumber Guy to look like Mario. Dev seems to encourage stuff like this, judging by the fact that he released the Blender files for the models and stuff.\n\nComes with a level editor!\n\nOnce the bugs are fixed, I'd pick it up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/recommended/339570/","XmiseryX","Misery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/","382 products in account","So, this one is a pretty interesting game, conceptually.  It has alot of things going for it.  It's a tactical squad strategy game, which reminds me alot of Silent Storm, actually.  And clearly takes some inspiration from the old Xcom games.\n\nThere's alot going on here; you've got randomly generated maps, a big worldmap to explore, towns to go to and buy stuff in, characters to recruit, and a wonderful destructible landscape.  It's very satisfying to watch things shatter when they are hit, and every individual brick or block or whatever is a seperate entity, and can collide with and injure characters.   There's tons of different weapons and items, an easy to use level-up-your-skills sort of thing, and of course permadeath.\n\nBut, there's one thing that, for me, absolutely grinds this all to a halt and keeps it from meeting, or even getting close, to it's potential, and that's the morale system, if that's the correct word.\n\nEvery character, friend or foe, has a stat representing their mind/morale/courage.  When enemy attacks are fired at your characters, they'll take a hit to this number... no matter if the attack misses or hits them.  When this drops to zero, they will flip the hell out, and either run around like utter morons (problem number 1) or go berserk.  The running around bit is a problem because it DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE.  I understand the idea of representing a "fight or flight" response, and the urge to get the hell out of there to save yourself.   Too bad it's so poorly implemented though. Your characters wont run AWAY from the enemy; they'll simply run in totally random directions for awhile.  And I mean TOTALLY random.  They absolutely will end up standing 5 blocks away from 2 guys with shotguns and a ninja, or just stand in an open field with snipers everywhere, or.... you get the idea.  This makes no sense at all.  These guys, if they're going to panic, should run AWAY from the enemy.  You know, like people would actually do.  You run AWAY from the threat.  Not just zoom around in different directions followed by shoving your nose up the barrel of some guy's gun.  They can also go berserk instead, at which point they'll try a desperate attack against an enemy, and this one DOES actually work like it sounds, and so isnt much of a problem.\n\nBut then there's the way the whole thing is activated.  As I said, when attacked, your guys will get more and more scared.  But here's the thing:  they'll get freaked out EVEN IF IT MAKES NO SENSE.  If they're up against some guy who is so fantastically stupid that he's on the other side of the map, fires a gun DIRECTLY at a heavy object that's RIGHT in front of him, and thus hits it, your guys, who again are on the OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP, will stand there and go "HOLY EXPLODING COWS, BATMAN!!! That one almost hit me square in the forehead!  What a deadly sniper that guy is! I better get away!".  They will do this every.  Single.  Time.  And believe me, it gets really old, really fast.  You end up having to come up with somewhat odd tactics JUST to deal with something that is basically broken from the start.  Not a good thing, and for me, even though I wasnt exactly dying much, it just got so damn stupid that my interest just shattered.  Even if I won the map, I was like "That.... that was just so dumb.  I had to change my strategy because the bad guy pretty much shot himself in the foot a mile away, causing my idiot melee guy to run into the open and do a little dance for no reason!" and.... yeah.  I was just done at that point.   I love strategy games, normally.  But when they hit a point where logic just goes completely out the window, I just lose interest.\n\nAnd that's pretty much what happened with this one.   Being totally honest, I dont think that mechanic is even necessary.  Particularly considering the theme behind the game.  Your guy isnt just some random idiot; he's clearly an adventurer, having already been on assorted game-ish quests, like being a horror game protagonist, to hopping over spikes and into pipes like Mario.  The pathetic reactions to.... basically everything.... just dont make sense in this context.   I can understand a mechanic like that being added to up the difficulty.  But there's SO many other ways to add extra challenge without having to resort to something like that, as so very many other games have proven already.\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad game, but just has some glaring flaws (as that's not the only odd issue it has) that for some players might ruin it entirely.  I strongly suggest watching some videos and lets' plays on the game before buying, to get a sense of how it works.\n\nFor now though, I cant entirely recommend it myself.  But your tastes may definitely differ from mine.  Again, it's not bad. But particularly when compared to so many other strategy games out there, it just doesnt quite hit the point where I can genuinely give it a positive score here.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather give it a more neutral score, but Steam's overly simplistic system here doesnt allow me to say "Well, considering everything, I think this is a 6 out of 10, it's a decent game and you might like it but there's definitely some big issues". And I do still play it.  But since I cant just outright recommend the game and am suggesting that people watch some of it for awhile before buying, I'm not giving a thumbs up here.","June 20, 2015","false","10.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","16","22","3","0"

I read the description of the game and it sounded like it’d be exactly the sort of game I’d enjoy.\n\nHaving played the game I’m pleased to report that it is exactly the sort of game I enjoy!  :)\n\nSo far I’ve played a few hours, in that time I’ve got to grips with the various mechanics of the game, had a few characters killed off and managed to defeat the first boss.  I’ll sum my experience up with a few pros and cons below:\n\nPros\n+  The combat is great fun – it does remind me of the old Xcom games and while it can be quite brutal you only ever end up losing a character if you do something silly (running out of energy with your melee character!).  That said occasionally something mental will happen…like missing and knocking a tree on yourself but that’s all part of the fun (not to mention hilarious!).\n+  So far there seems to be plenty of weapons and items to use as well as challenging enemies.\n+  All of the terrain in destructible and is often usable tactically.  For example know there is an enemy in a building?  Chuck a grenade through the window and collapse it on him!\n+  Procedurally generated…a different game each time you play!\n+  The difficulty looks to be about right – I’ve not been massively outmatched so far but it’s also not a cake walk (I thought it was going to be when I had five characters but then I managed to get two of them killed!).\n+  Game is pretty solid and I’ve only encountered one bug so far.  I’ve flagged it in the forum and within about 15 minutes Tom had responded requesting more info.  I’m impressed with his dedication and desire to make the game the best experience possible for those that have purchased it.\n\nCons\n-  I can’t really think of any but if I had to pick anything I’d say that some of sound and the music can start to grate after a while.

The setting and the characters are generic, but that fits the premise of the game perfectly.\n\nCombat is turn based and feels like a weird, but tight mix of old X-Com, Final Fantasy Tactics and a little bit of Jagged Alliance (You hear footsteps to the east, during night ops) and just as unforgiving and deadly as your old x-com or early jagged alliance title. You'll lose squad mates (permadeath) and the surviving members might lose their cool when seeing their buddies stabbed, shot or burned to death, running amok or just panicking and run in circles. AoE weaponry and skills are as deadly and devestating as you know them from the early x-com titles, with incendiary weapons setting whole houses ablaze or collapsing trees in a forrest.\n\nCharacters can level up, if they survive, and you get a set of skills that focus on combat related tasks. Like base-requisits to use certain weapon types, health, mental health or your ability to jump over obstacles (or on roofs if you feel ninja).\n\nIf you're into loot collecting, there are tons of houses with chests and of course dead bodies, to replenish ammo, health-packs, bombs, weaponry and armor or just give you some plain cash money\n\nThe game can be very punishing and it's certainly not for people who get frustrated when a well placed fire bomb murders half your squad and sends the rest into panic, but for those who love that kind of gameplay it's a must buy.\n\nYou'll have to put up with some weird, old-school-like graphics, but I think they fit the setting perfectly.\n\n10/10, would buy again.","March 18, 2015","true","4.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Explosions leaves actual craters on the ground that your characters can take cover in. Trees and foliage can be set on fire that will spread. Damaged houses and building will collapsed upon themselves. You can cut down a tree, and have it fall on a building to break through the wall, which your characters can go through. This game has a truly dynamic environment that some AAA games has trouble figuring out.\n_Tight gameplay: Enemy's combat is as dynamic as its environment. Characters has a set amount of action points that they can use to move, attack, look through their inventory and so on. You can accidentally hit your allies if you have them within the line of fire. You can use the environment as cover, or turn it against your foes. Lots of different natural event that can happen with the combat here.\n_Highly customizable characters: You get to choose their stats, gears and fighting style. Do you want a fast moving ninja wielding a chainsaw? Or a sneaky sniper with a bow? How about a guy with a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other? You can have all of the above.\n_Randomized world: It's different every time!\n\nCons:\n_Graphics can be a bit offputting: Not the most flattering looking game, but that can be overlooked since the gameplay is so deep.\n_Bareboned music.\n_Uneven sounds: Some sounds are a little too loud while some are barely heard.\n_UI can take a minute to get used to: Although minimalistic and concise, you'll have to look around a bit before figuring out what means what.\n_Doesn't tell you jack: The game tutorial is non-existent, although the joy of discovery is in full effect here.\n\nIs this game worth the price tag? Ab-so-lute-ly.

Reminds me of Jagged Alliance 2 without taking umpteen hours to get anywhere or start doing cool stuff, and without all of the fiddly economic management. Right from the jump, you'll be: accidentally bulldozing walls, knocking trees over onto enemies, starting uncontrollable fires that threaten to engulf everything you hold near and dear, and assessing every map for every exploitable tactic you can muster in an effort to keep your squad alive as the world starts scaling beyond what your six-person squad can honorably annihilate. The game gets tense as hell, as the intended play mode is essentially Iron Man mode in a world with dwindling resources. There's an easier mode with saves and less dwindling, but fie on that.\n\nIn a lot of ways, it's an ingeniously modernized X-Com 1/2 or JA2, in that it strips out all of the base-building and research and economic worrying, reinvests some of that into character leveling, simplifies the controls to what are actually necessary, adds genuinely destructible terrain and structures with good physics and fire modeling, and makes the time between booting the game for the first time and doing something fun about 2 minutes; and it does all this while still retaining the fundamental complexity of the squad tactics in X-Com/JA2.\n\nAn unkind reviewer would say it's JA2-lite, which is true in a sense, but I don't have a problem with that. I'm not trying to spend 200+ hours fomenting a revolution again; I'm just trying to sledgehammer someone into and through a wall.\n\nAlso, surprisingly good music, sfx and cryptic NPC dialogues.","December 7, 2015","true","6.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

While the game is rather challenging (mainly due to the rougelike element in it), it is equally satisfying to beat the enemies with the weapons at your disposal, which also includes the terrain. There are basically four classes of attack: melee, ranged, explosives and "throwing" (which refers to throwing any object you can find, which includes parts of walls and the enemies themselves). Additionally, you can jump on enemies to damage them, a throwback to the old Mario-esque plattformers.\n\nYour band of brave men and women are set on a quest to beat the four bosses of the four biomes. While travelling, you can also hire new personnel that you meet in new sectors (up to six people in total), or gear up in villages with the money you have found on your way there. One biome plays different than the other, and mastering one biome does not make you an expert in another one.\n\nThe bosses all have unqiue abilities and part of the fun is, to find the best way to beat them (so I won't spoil anything here).\n\nPersonally, a big recommendation from my end, if you are an expert in the genres of tactical battles and rogue-likes. If you're looking for a cute, casual experience then you're gonna have a bad time.","March 22, 2015","true","18.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The characters are all based on common gaming characters - the action hero (good with guns) the wizard (focuses on staff weapons) and so on.\n\nYou move your characters, then the computer moves theirs. The goal is to kill all the enemies in the area, then move on. There are zone bosses to kill, and once you have defeated them all (there are currently 4) you win.\n\nThere are elements of roguelikes here too - permadeath for characters, and while the game autosaves fairly often, you can't save-scum and reload. Decisions are final.\n\nWhat makes this special, for me, is the physics. Everything is destructable, and it is endlessly entertaining watching a stray shot bring down a tree that flattens an enemy, or making a tactful decision to blow up a buildings weak points in order to make it collapse in on the occupants. Fire spreads and degrades the materials it touches, and weakens them.\n\nThe AI is fairly basic, the challenge lies in being prepared for surprise attacks and not letting yourself be pinned into a situation you can't get out of. The game is pretty hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, and gather some extra party members, it gets easier... until you find yourself trying to kill an undead vampire lord with 6 allies of his own in a close-quarters battle-royale in a crumbling and fragile stone castle ...... and you've only got an explosive throwing lunatic as your available character.\n\n\nI highly recommend it.","June 20, 2015","true","5.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's like Jagged Alliance meets Minecraft, with a bunch of old NES references thrown in.  I do have to warn anybody playing the game, that this game is HARD. LOTS of enemies will hurt you and you have very little healing. This forces you to be a lot more tactical than most games, so you can't just rush into the enemy with guns a blazing and hope to live for too long. You must use cunning, strategy, and tactics if you want to have a chance in this game.\n\nYou create one character at the beginning and are joined by 2 seemingly randomized characters. Some characters have guns or arrows, some are melee (having to get in close), some use bombs and explosives, and some attack by picking up things and throwing them. The game seems to favor the ones using guns, as melee characters are hard to get into the attack zone, throwing characters use too much time to find something then pick it up then throw it, and bombs are not plentiful to be very practical. This actually forces one to be a little more strategic than simply aim and fire so I think it works in the game's favor.\n\nOne thing the game doesn't mention, is that when you select your character, you can select what his environment and opponents will be (platformer based, horror based, fantasy based, etc). Also, each map is randomized, so you'll never get the same map twice (so you can't memorize maps and layouts).  Also, don't bother picking up items that you won't use, since nobody buys them from you. Though do take your fallen opponent's clothes if you don't like your own.\n\nDespite this game being so difficult, it's still fun to play anyway and keeps me entertained, which is the purpose of a good video game, is it not? If you like challenge and tactical turn based strategy games, then you may want to give it a try. If you prefer to rush in with guns blazing to shoot a bunch of monsters, then this is not for you.","January 2","true","3.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is serious tactical fun. There is zero handholding. You better get on your game fast son.\n\nMerchants don't restock, there aren't that many of them and gold is precious. Since there's no rest-to-heal mechanic, temples or peace-loving hippies about, you have to hold on to those health packs. Occasionally you'll find one on an enemy. I think this is the tightest game for healing I've ever seen. I'm walking around with my team at 60% health because I can only heal one of them and I don't want to waste it. Tense.\n\nI haven't even tried to take on one of the four bosses. I was creeping around the non-boss sectors trying to build up my team, but we got wiped. Noise counts. When you use grenades or shotguns, other enemies start showing up. If they have range weapons you could be in for a world of hurt.\n\nSome great scenes:\nChucking a boulder at a skeleton and having him shatter over ten meters of space.\n\nGuy's sniping at me from a house. Windows are too narrow to retaliate. Throw a grenade onto the roof, roof collapses and kills him.\n\nMobster in watchtower shooting at us, send my heavy in to take out one of the struts. Damn, it still stands on one strut! Still time to take out second strut. Tower falls over my guy, Buster Keaton style with him luckily standing in a gap.\n\nExploring a castle, I finally come to the throne room in the middle. Three guys. My heavy clubs a guy into a stone support beam (this was intentional). Beam shatters, enemy killed instantly. Other two guys throw down their weapons. "I surrender!"\n\npros\nthe game is straight up awesome\ndeeply satisfying turn-based combat\nnice physics\nmuch variety of enemies and environments\nREAL CHALLENGE!\nvariety of enemy levels: sometimes they'll be stronger, sometimes they're much weaker\n\ncons\nenemies regularly get caught in their own area effect attacks (ie.

Like losing your main character within the first 10 minutes - without a chance of reviving him. Dead means dead. OK, since the invention of "quicksave and reload" this shouldn't be an issue anymore, right? Well... except that there is no such thing implemented in Enemy. Yes, Enemy can be veeery tough sometimes :) But as soon as you accept heavy losses as a fundamental part of the game concept, you will experience an extremly well designed game! Instead of forcing you to save and reload a boring thousand times, Enemy provides new recruits to fill your losses. Which is much more fun, by the way.\n\nThere are more things, that really, really impressed me:\n\n+ The balance is extrodinary. Almost every game has either a tough start (with an easy endgame) or a tough endgame (with easy beginnings). Not Enemy! Enemy is challenging at the start and keeps that level till the very end! Everytime I thought I reached a "cake run phase" with a dominant tactic, Enemy threw a new kind of Enemy at me, forcing me to adapt. Digging a hole in the roof of a castle to kill those down below from high position seems like a clever idea... until you encounter a Grenadier, who blasts away the whole ceiling! Priceless!\n\n+ The physics! I never get tired to see the chain reactions, when buildings collapse or trees come down. Other games feel so static, Enemy is pure dynamic.\n\n+ The variety! At first I was very sceptic about the mixture of styles, genres, weapon types. Light sabers and wooden swords? Plasma rifles and Bows? Vampires and Robots? Does that fit together?? Yes, it does! It's funny, it's varied and it's more vivid than a "Bow +5" or something.\n\n+ Character developement! There are no useless skills. Every additional point makes you stronger. Every class has its purpose.\n\nBASELINE:\nThis game had me hooked like nothing in a long time!\n5/5 stars, both thumbs up!","March 18, 2015","true","44.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Pretend the entire game is wireframes and untextured areas.\n\nBecause this game is an absolute gem, and their graphical design choices are likely to bury it in "kids game" obscurity.\n\nSo, down to the gameplay. This is a squad tactics game, very heavily into squad tactics. It's very important to have your squad approach every situation carefully or you can swiftly find your entire group dead.\n\nThe tactics come down to how to kill enemies that are wandering around the map in such a way that they don't cause the terrain to murder your whole team. You can hide behind a tree and snipe from there, but you're likely to have the tree shot. One shot might be ok, but more than that and the whole tree will come down. Or you can use the same physics to your advantage. Blow a hole in the side a building the enemy are in to surprise them from behind. Or just collapse the roof on them. Or push a tree over onto your enemies.\n\nThe weapons all feel unique and impactful, and there are many different build paths that you can pursue in terms of skills.

First off, I love this game and I see it had pottential, but the issues are insane. I know it came out today, but they need to be adressed. The biggest issue is the freezing and crashing, the game crashes and then I have to reset it, it happens when I try and load a character from a save that crashed. It will freeze at random and freeze my system rendering me completely unable to do anything. Other than the obvious ones, the game is too hard and I keep losing right before I can get anything or level up to fight back. I know this is a game that is meant to be hard like old school games but I keep dying before I can even leave the house, seriously once I died because I accidentally pressed space before I did anything in the house, and my character was immediatly shot and killed. That basically it except for the really bad controlls, whenever I press Q or E it moves my camera to a fixed position so I can hardly see, like I really wish I could just decide where my camera is other than 4 fixed positions. This game is really good and fun but like I said, really hard.

It's got roots in everything, all the classic hero type genres the 80's and early 90s could throw at you and a simple, fun atmosphere to play in. Visually it has a the voxel appeal of Minecraft, simple graphics no longer denote simple gameplay, so it's a decent aesthetic for the styles it's calling on, and it deals with the environments uniquely as massively destructable. Its learning curve is almost nil, you figure out your squad and motions and from there it's as simple as marching around, murderin' stuff. Depth is a bit of a missed op, it's in dev, but the game is so very direct, march, kill, equip, move along, making no strategic uses of the destructable environments, and strangely not including construction of any kind, stores do not exchange cash for loot, there are no power-ups per se, no squad combos, and frankly is missing a few awesome archetypes (such as a Dig-Dug class or Builders). Enemies are either completely impotent or outrageously overpowered, usually the ones with bombs are above and beyond, often performing insta-kills, otherwise most can be completely avoided by gaining the higher ground and shooting them down. Audially it's very mellow, this is a game that won't barrage you with noise, the soundtrack is restrained, very decent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingkasai/recommended/339570/","kingkasai","King Kasai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingkasai/","371 products in account","A very good 'lite' turn based tactics game. Not 'lite' because it is easy or simple, but because it doesn't require as much commitment or long term strategic thinking as XCOM or Jagged Alliance, which I think is a major plus.\n\nI often find myself wanting to play a squad based tactics game with some form of campaign or persistence, but I don't always have the patience for the in-between battle strategizing or squad management. This game fits that niche perfectly, and while it's rather specific, I feel that if you want a relatively quick tactical experience akin to XCOM or JA, this game is for you.\n\nNot to mention that I adore the physics based combat. Destructible terrain is always a huge plus for me in any genre, and that's this games main attraction, mechanics-wise. I love the boss fortress levels especially, since you always have the option to collapse the doorways or the roof on your enemies. Most of the time it'll happen anyway, for better or worse.\n\nFinally, the variety of weapons keeps the battles pretty fresh. Mostly it's fun to mess with explosives. I had an awesome, but ultimately game ending plan that began with setting an explosive on what I thought was the wall behind the boss. Turns out, it was the hallway adjacent to the throne room. The hail of plasma bolts that followed my breach sent my team into a panic almost instantly. It was definitely a cool and unique experience, if a bit annoying.\n\nOh, that brings up a con. The morale system is a little wonky. I feel like I have to put a bunch of points into the morale stat just to stop my troops from fleeing at the first sign of combat. I understand the purpose of the AOE morale damage, but I much prefer the system from Xenonauts, where the actual impact point of the shots cause an AOE of terror based on the shot damage. In Enemy, it’s more of a beam of terror, where anyone remotely close to the projectile's path loses morale. Though honestly, this is the only significant gripe I have with the game.\n\nA final note; I love the different classes of troops in the game. There are a bunch of different roles your troops can play, much more than most other games of this sort. This diversity in the actual tactical engagements these roles afford does a lot to mitigate the relatively simple nature of the actual mechanics at play. Also, random tip: never forget about the jump function all troop have, it's extremely useful!\n\nAll in all, I love this game. It's mechanically simple, but what mechanical depth there is gives each battle a quirky feel. Fully destructible terrain, and a rogue-like approach to game length (and difficulty) fit this game in scarcely populated niche of the tactics market.\n\nIf you ever had the urge to start a game of XCOM, but lack the patience for all that base building and research nonsense, I fully recommend Enemy.","March 24, 2015","true","17.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Cliché stuff, and there is no problem with that. Let's get onto gameplay the game is a turn based strategy game, I've already mentioned your goal each level, but your overall goal is to kill the 4 main bosses. At the end of each fight you're sent to a map, you can select a square next to the one you're in, another fight will be initiated, you kill some skrubs, grab more loot, repeat. This game isn't very repetetive though, maps are randomly generated, and so are the levels, and to add to that, after making a character, you can select what genre they're in AND what they are within that genre, currently making 8 different paths for your character, why is this important? Depending on what you chose their will HEAVILY depend on what the map is generated to look like, the enemies you fight and the storyline... y'know... roleplay...\nOne of my favorite things about this game is the world around you, be careful, because the map itself is a weapon, break the stump of a tree?

You can't go wrong here.","March 17, 2015","true","20.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","3","6","3","0"

I'm talking TPK from an off-screen enemy within your first couple of turns. You will rage-quit, you will complain that its unfair... and you will come crawling back for one more chance to claw victory from the pixelated jaws of defeat. You don't win, you just do a little better each time.","March 17, 2015","true","17.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The combat options feel fantastic. You can trickshot trees onto enemies, use smaller rocks for cover.\n\nAnyone who gave the game a second shot after the introduction of an inn like feature for saving and for healing might be disappointed. I didn't have enough money at any point to use it.\n\nMobs are fairly unbalanced, and if you make the mistake of playing in the trope with Knights you'll find you have zero ways to take them out before they can kill everyone at early levels.\n\nFurthermore, theres no indication of mob levels apart from a red warning box if the difference is extreme. Up to 5 levels different encountered so far. Having a knight NPC who took ~4-8 points of damage from behind only, took no morale damage from frontal hits, and had 80 health could kill 5 PC's in a turn when berserked (from morale "damage")\nGrenadier mobs seemed somewhat strong offensively but could at least get shot down, bombed, or bum rushed if you're careful. The knight was hitting for 60ish points of damage on my level 3's on my second mission. Also this was on the easiest difficulty, which increases your medical drops.\n\nThe claim to "roguelike" only comes from a lack of saving apart from lower difficulty settings using the inn. The only way to save is to quit the game to continue later.\n\n\n\n","June 30, 2015","false","22.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Time, everything takes time, each character you get has 75 time per turn (no upgrading your time), there is no problem with that thats how all turn based games work, no the problem comes in where all the enemies feel like they have 150-300 time, when its your turn you can move or shoot, you barely have enough time to do both, maybe move like 2 blocks and shoot once, while the enemies will move half way across the map and shoot at you 4 times.\n\n2.  Nothing seems to be tipped in your favor, the horror character is my favorite but he starts in the swamp, sure you move slow in the swamp but thats not even what bugs me, my problem is I will walk out of my house and half the time i get one shotted out the door, now there are only 4 characters to choose from so thats like 1/4 of the game that is dead to me\n\n3.  Bugs, I really hope this game gets patched cause it is fun to play, but I have found my characters stuck in one spot where nothing works to get them out (jumping works ~50% of the time),  also I would have the area cleared and one character still wouldnt be able to leave and progress and even restarting the game doesnt let him move on, another few times the enemies have gotten two turns in a row completely skipping my turn, that whole player intercept idea is cool and all but it has messed me up and lost my turns more than enough times to say i like the feature, and when selecting your character use tab because clicking could easily make the wrong character move and mess your strategy up\n\nThese are my only real complaints with the game though, everything else about the game is amazing, the detail in structure and the combat is on point, watching the skeletons bones fly everywhere and bandits ragdoll to the ground is so much fun, you can use Pg up and Pg down to change how much structure you can see.  This game is challenging and maybe difficulty settings will be added in the future but as of right now be prepared to get destroyed at any given point in your experience.","March 21, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It also has a poorly fleshed out control scheme, and a clunky interface. All of these things are forgivable, in the indie world in my mind, assuming you make up for it in other areas. Typically, this results in a massive world, or an incredible range of things to do. Sadly, this is not the case here.\n\nThis game lacks any real depth. The first "level" will just end up being repeated over and over again, until you get sick to your stomache. Everything is over simplified, and in the end this just feels like the foundation of a game that was never finished.\n\nReally no value here, one of the few games to get sorted into "games I will never play again" list.","January 19","false","2.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Prepare to die a lot\n-the tooltips are brief and have an uncomfortably slow fade in-fade out,\n-despite having tooltips it doessn't do anything to introduce you to your UI or inventory management\n-No emotional investment beyond your own main character, who, can die off as inconsequentially as a random NPC\n-if there was a story I wasn't able to see it within the 4 or 5 tiles I explored over 4 restarts.\n-Music is very out of place in many situations. I recall balking more than a few times in and out of combat at the current tune.\n\nAll of these things are fixable. and personally, I could overlook most of them but the starting difficulty if that alone were fixed. Aside from these (personally) game breaking features, the premise of this game is fantastic and charming.","March 18, 2015","false","1.6"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","13","29","0","1"

But this simplicity might turn some off from this game.\n3.This game is HARD, but in a good way. It is hard in a fun way, where it never punishes the player to much for death, and you preatty much always know what went wrong. Sort of like FTL or Dark Souls.\n4. This game is very dark. If the trailer and screenshots didn't convince you. This game's graphics and sound remind not only the bleak outlook of the land around you, but also of your quest. Some people will like how the game's attitude matches its gameplay, others will hate it want something more positive.\n5.Unlike FTL, where you could get to world 5 or 6 on your first run, ENEMY will grant you no such luxury. You will play many games before you reach the first boss. However, each one of these runs I found to be quite engaging due to the procedural generated terrain.\nCONCLUSSION:While very good,this game will kick your A**. If you enjoy games Dark Souls, FTL, or Dwarf Fortress, and you like the accestetic, this probably a good choice. Otherwise, don't bother.","March 18","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
