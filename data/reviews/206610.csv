I am not really impressed though and wished I had saved my 1 dollar for some other game. Its alright for what it is. Its that same type of game play as, say...Candy Crush, but Candy Crush is FREE! They catch your interest with the 3D and the camera mode but that feature doesn't work very well. The screen moves around whenever you move your head, even slightly and in stead of it staying in the direction you are looking (like it is supposed to) it pops back to center. And its really useless. It doesn't help with gameplay or make it any more interesting, it just rotates the screen back and forth. Who can concentrate when your screen is swinging around? You can turn the camera feature off, but like I said before there are other games better than this that are Free.","January 6, 2014","false","0.5"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","61","67","0","5"

I'm pretty sure there isn't even a leaderboard (I quit before i could enter one because it was too easy).

Rather than level based career paths, 3SwitcheD sticks to just the standard continuous unlimited modes that progressively increase in difficulty as you go.Now there isn't a gamer alive that cannot be pulled in by the addictive monotony of Bejeweled, Tetris, Dr. Mario, the list goes on when it comes to unforgettable puzzle games, and Reality Pump try their all with a host of eccentrically named modes; Snazzy Swap, Clearing Clusters, Falling Star, Moving 4-Ward, Pathfinder and Gravity Switch.Snazzy Swap is your standard Bejeweled clone, swap gems around and match three to make way for some new gems on your game board, similarly you?ll find what I would call a version of Sega Swirl in both Clearing Clusters and Gravity Switch, both with their own unique spins on clearing the game board by removing clusters of two or more of the same coloured gems, then there?s Falling Star that acts similarly to Panel de Pon with some minor alterations, all sound familiar enough right? Well these are your standard puzzle types out the way, now the remaining two game modes are where 3SwitcheD really shines.Creating a new and an engaging puzzle mode is by no means an easy feat, but the two game types of Moving 4-ward and Pathfinder really take the biscuit, and the reason that these two stand out so well is the true strategic and tactical manner required to approach them.3SwitcheD's innovative 3D-Eye Tracking Technology is most certainly an allure to the game, and using a simple webcam allows the game space to turn into a fully tilting 3D environment.Contrary to your standard online leader boards, the highscore system in 3SwitcheD is extremely unusual and rather than source an online list of scores, you are asked to upload your score along with your email and name allowing you to appear on the 3SwitcheD website rather than in the game, this does stunt the competitive nature of the game, after all, everyone wants to be number one!One particular feature of the game that makes 3SwitcheD quite a marmite title is the inclusion of a male, or female announcer that comments on the combos you make, the time you have, and generally anything to ensure that you are not simply sat in the comfortable silence of a pounding soundtrack. Topware and Reality Pump have certainly collected together some of the best puzzle types in one game, however unfortunately apart from the strategic modes among them, the rest lack character.Overall 6/10.","November 27, 2014","true","6.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

My first thoughts before launching this were as follows:\n“The term 'rip off' is thrown around a lot these days, but I don't know if you can really say that this is a clone of bejewelled. I mean after all, there have been gem matching games throughout all of my gaming history, the first one I remember playing was Columns on the Sega Mega Drive, and I am sure that there were arcade games before hand, let's not prejudge.”\nSadly though, this was not the case. It is incredibly similar to bejewelled, even down to the deep voiced male who complements you throughout the game and the futuristic flying through space theme. The developers knew exactly what they were doing.\nWell actually lets be fair, the games it provides do have some differences....and indeed, this is where it falls down, the games are just unfortunately not as much fun, which is a real pity. The other difference it has is a head tracking feature which means as you move your head around it moves the puzzle around too, its a very interesting idea and I was quite impressed at first as we have draconian politicians at the moment who keep raising the tax on anything electronic and are trying to set up a firewall that would put China's in the shade meaning that I will probably never even see, let alone afford and Occulas Rift. However this doesn't seem to work properly, at all. It has a little view port at the top and it draws a box around where it thinks your head is, it couldnt make up its mind between my forehead and my left ear. I think this would work a lot better on a table......oh wait.... this is an ios port isn't it? Yes, I think it probably is.\n\nNow I am not an elitist person, I don't care if the game was originally made for DOS, tablets, in rpg maker or ags. Whatever! But there does seem to be a lot of this IOS porting at the moment where it feels that hardly anything has been tweaked for the pc experience. I don't know how to feel about this, on the one hand its quite naughty as it is a touch lazy but as someone who refuses to have any apple, or indeed any kind of tablet in her house it is nice to get some of the games back, indeed there are a lot of the older genres that are happily thriving on tablet format and I would love to get my paws on that, so if I can avoid having to buy one to experience them then all the better! As to how you feel about it, well its up to you, thankfully this one has no real complicated gestures that are harder to reproduce with a mouse than your finger.\n\nAhh well, lets talk about the games.\nBefore I start I should say that the graphics and sounds are at least pretty nice. They're not quite to the standard of bejewelled but they are more than adequate. The pieces explode into nice looking particles and swoosh away, the gems tinkle oh you can imagine the sound effects, you know most developers all buy the same royalty free sound effects CD. There is an online scoreboard if you are into that sort of thing. I didn't submit my scores because it needs your email address for some strange reason. The music is nice and atmospheric, probably the best part of the game but we are getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nThere are six games that come with 3switcheD:\n\nSnazzy swap\n----------------\nPersonal high score: 459,000\n\nThis is the standard swap the gems around and try and make lines of 3 or more. Only objective is to get a high score. It's functional but you've played it before.\n\nClearing clusters\n---------------------\nPersonal high score: 792,000\n\nThis is the game where you have to click the gems that are connected together and all the same ones touching clear. It's a little easier than one you might play in flash as it brings in new gems from the edges when the end columns are empty. It's a little bit more strategic than the previous.\n\nFalling star\n-------------\nPersonal high score: 713,000\n\nThis one is quite original, it plays a lot like the first one but when you start there are only the first 2 rows. Pieces then slowly fall down much like tetris, getting faster, if the entire board is filled and it tries to drop another one, its game over.\n\nMoving 4-ward\n------------------\nPersonal high score: 191,680\n\nIn this game you need to click on a gem and click on the grid space that you want it to go, it will path towards that space. You need to arrange the gems into a 2 by 2 square to clear them. On the left hand side it will show you shapes to construct to try and gain bonus points. New pieces spawn automatically getting faster and faster. Like falling star if the grid fills its game over. Pieces can only path to their grid space if there are no other gems in the way.\n\nPath finder\n-------------\nPersonal high score: 168,200\n\nThis game is identical to Moving 4-ward, only pieces fall after each move instead of automatically, also they removed the shapes. This game comes free with Debian OS if I recall correctly. That or its just been on my netbook for about as long as I installed it.\nThis is probably the best one of the bunch in terms of strategy.\n\nGravity switch\n------------------\nPersonal high score: 136,000\n\nProbably the most original game. It's pretty much the same game as  Clearing Clusters but you can swipe in 4 directions to change the gravity in order to create new clusters of gems.\n\nThe games, as you can see, are pretty standard to the puzzle genre and are a bit dull and tired these days. As far as I can tell that is it, there doesn't seem to be any unlocking to keep you playing unless you like high score grinding.\n\nHere's the worst part of it though. It requires an online pass. Yes, you have to register it before you have to play it. I thought online passes were completely dead now. Especially since EA, arguably the evillest company in the entire industry, said that it is giving them up. If you are against DRM you should give this one a miss.\n\nAll in all though, I cannot recommend this. Even if you are a fan of the casual puzzle genre it is taken for granted that you have not only already played this but own a superior version. I am not someone who dislikes casual games but unfortunately there just isn't that layer of polish and quality and the core games are just far too generic and done before. I am sure that almost everyone has played every game on this list with the exception of gravity switch, there are freebie flash versions of these games all over the internet. Come on guys, for the PC crowd we need something new and entertaining, asking £7 for this is unacceptable. Ultimately a very meh experience.\n\n3/10","June 29, 2014","false","1.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReploidArmada/recommended/206610/","ReploidArmada","ReploidArmada","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReploidArmada/","456 products in account","This game feels like a mash-up of several gimmicks at once. It has six different game modes, but they're essentially split into 3 pairs of game modes. The different game modes seem fairly similar: There's two where gems fall and you move them around a grid, there's two where you double-click on clusters of gems to clear them, and there's two where you're swapping gems normally as per Bejeweled. These pairs of similar game modes don't feel like they have any substantial differences.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of the non-Bejeweled game modes seemed at least somewhat innovative, but everything you do in the game is commentated on by a voice that sounds like he's aspiring to be Leonard Nimoy. Instead, it just comes off as abrasive and annoying. You'll hear such lovely phrases as "Space-♥♥♥♥!," "The combo meter is about to blow," and "This party train is now leaving." This incessant voice-over is my least favorite thing about this game, and I wasn't interested enough in the game as a whole to check whether I could turn it off. I couldn't try out the much-touted 3D feature, either, so I can't speak to that.\n\nHonestly, the only reason I have this game is that I was given a 90% off coupon for it, and I only paid a single dollar. For one dollar, it's a half-decent puzzle game, but it does things that have been done before - and with less annoyance for the player. For ten dollars, I recommend you skip it.","October 10, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Or 3SwitcheD, is a puzzle game reminiscent of the typical Candy Crush variants that are so popular these days.\n\nSix different modes, which alter gameplay enough for you to easily get a few hours of entertainment out of it. Would be better on a tablet, in my opinion.\n\nGraphics are pretty, but it's not always particularly obvious what you're doing, which isn't helped at all by the inclusion of '3D Eye Tracking' - which, in a nutshell means that you can enable your webcam, and the software will determine which way you're looking, and tilt the screen appropriately. GREAT if you're playing a 3D game that requires you to move your head around, but for a game like this where all the action iss on a 2D-plane, it's utter rubbish, and a gimmick at the very best.\n\nSoundtrack is pretty good, not particularly repetitive, and the voice which chimes in every now and then to stroke your ego is pretty easy to deal with as well.\n\nSadly, the £6.99 price point means I absolutely would not recommend this. If you can find it for a couple of quid in a sale or in a bundle - as I did - then it's enough fun to make the purchase worthwhile - but there simply isn't enough meat in the game to justify such a lot of money at full RRP.\n\nAnd - if you wish to see the game in action, I've gone and created a video for your entertainment:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9vlbKl9V1w","March 2, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
