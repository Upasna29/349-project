You need either main hero or alive commander to control fleet.\n\n- Ai controls fleets in combat automaticly hitting their strongest targets and based on commanders personality either flee like chickens or take it like a man.\n\n- Commanders can die and will try to escape to other ships when they are losing.\n\nUnique take to scouting.\n\n- Every  ship has  limited detection range and larger attack range... because this game has detection units.\n\n- Scouting is vital. Scouts allow you to shoot farther and recon new areas and secure sectors as beacons.\n\n- Dormant mode allows wide area fleets scans. You know what I mean when you try it.\n\nWeaponising resourses\n\n- You can use stuff like gas clouds as minefields.\n\nFactions\n\n- UNC  ( United Nations Confederation ) is an anti tecnology faction that uses " safe" tecnologies as railguns and missiles, being the " standard"  faction. Asia based.\n\n-SS ( Slavic Sirerians)"the aliens" : Use chemicals and bio weapons ( yes  chemicals and bacteria in space.) Are mostly male and somewhat ....manly. Slavic based.\n\n- NSAU ( North-South American Union)  : Is high tec faction that uses beam weapons, shields and .. this one was new to me check it out : Portable power generators AND mobile resource harvest buildings. America based.\n\nZone based space travel\n\nFleets use wormholes to travel  splitting all maps in to sectors enabling tactical attacks from multiple sides or really nasty choke points.\n\nYou should REALLY read the story about why there are wormholes close to earth: http://foresightrts.com/wormhole-anomalies/\n\nBackground story and progression\n\nBackground story itself  is good, but its presentation..\n\n- You live on humanity's own mess up pile, they nuked their own planet, messed up space travel in worm hole experiments and fight against each other in the progress.\n\n-  Read  background story before you play the game, more of the stuff makes sence then. Voice acting being one of them.\n\n\nMEH aspects.\n\n\nHow the story is told. Is a huge potential meh\n\nSome of the charecter commendaries are confusing and then there is voice acting. There are tons of negative comments about it and it can "Sound" atrocious.. least till you  bothered to read faction backstories from the web page.\n\n- UCN is mostly asian based none of them have native english its just common language.\n-Slavic Sirerians have intented slavic accent.\n-NSAU , well they are english. If you want to hear english : check out NSAU\n\nVoice acting actually was on most part design choise, also I heard from Jeremy that most of the voice actors were Volenteers, this is a small budget game after all.  (update : He changed pug's voice now ! )\n\nThe Artificial intelligence\n\nYou really either hate or love this.\n\nI got my ♥♥♥ kicked when I commanded everything myself. I had to learn to " let go" in mass fights and let the ai do its job.  It's not clever enough to start entire sector wide campaings with blizzard level of magnificience but its good enough be left to handle mass fights IF you do not order them too much.\n\nI have seen ai do stuff like\n- Cautious AI commander abandonts its fleet and runs.\n- Clever one focus fired enemy commanders down\n- More ruthless one totally ignored defense positions and just blew generators to kingdom come.\n\nThen again I also saw this : " Requesting attack to sector x" .. my OWN base was on that sector.\n\nMusic and sounds\n\nMostly background style music on neutral level, not something you'd want to burn on your harddrive and listen as separate ( As example age of wonder's sound track),  don't expect that, and the music's and sounds are good.\n\nGraphical presentation\n\nApparently game was made by choise somewhat simplistic, to allow larger fleet fight. This means there is not much eye candy.\n\nNor eastern eggs, nor cards. Stuff like that is on works.\n\n\nAnd now the "why oh why"\n\nUser interface\n\nI will first state that this is on rework apparently next patch.  Currently its complex.\n\n- Makers made the keybindings based on their own localisation, this resulted some farts like: repair key being altgr + 8 for eu player .\n\n- Creating fleets and assigning advisors is clumsy.\n\n- It's hard to remove units from fleets and to add them to other fleets.\n\n-Fleet view at times doesn't view fleets but instead your main commanders face.\n\nAnd small stuff like that.\n\nI want my skip button\n\nWhile they already added options to skip things there is no way to skip in game cutschenes yet, and seeing them half dozen times on retries can be a pain.\n\nYou can't skip end and defeat score screen either.\n\n\nSteam ui hates this game\n\nStandalone game works fine, but run it in steam you have issues like game crashing on alt tab.\n\nMultiplayer needs work\n\nMultiplayer is somewhat complex and well, de syncing on large games.\n\nSimple design makes game bland\n\nNot much to explore in this game, it focuses on execution and battles so the space is just full of small stars, not much debris asteroids or things like that.\n\nPolish in clarity needed\n\nSome things are hard to pick at, fleet locations, ally locations, you have to access minimap manually instead seeing it all the time but this is on works.\n\nTutorial sucks\n\nBut can be skipped !\n\n\n\nSummary :\n\n\nForesight is a space game placed on era where humans have nuked earth and ruined space travel with wormhole experiements, telling story of Thomas Locke UNC commander who will see quite a bit duing the game.\n\nGame is simple on the eye with decent sound score and good but optional backstory accessable from webside along with three fairly different factions and playstyles, that relies on semi ai controlled fleets  that can be used to fullest in zone based combat areas.\n\n\nWhile having lot of potential, it currently suffers from few ui optimisation issues as well as background based voice acting.\n\nThe game itself doesn't have fatal bugs.\n\nAs the game is now I'd give it 67/100 but it has potential to be  75-80 game and it will be, the dev's are very active, contact players and discuss their ideas openly.  Give it a chance, I did and I don't regret it.","December 22, 2014","true","109.2"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","41","45","2","4"

Old games are one of the best in the RTS genre. :)\nThe game doesn't necessarily bring so many new things to the RTS genre, it's however different but still alike with other Real Time Strategy games regarding the resource gathering, units battle, units production population  etc...\nThe multiplayer sadly is not as I expected, you need to request the IP of your friend in order to play and if you don't have a friend, multiplayer is not an option for you.\n\nI recommend this game if you look forward for diversity in the RTS genre but if you are looking for a game that offers a good story that makes your tears drop (like SC2 did for me), a good competitive level gameplay and intense multiplayer, you should go search for other games.\n","December 1, 2014","true","5.6"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","20","28","0","7"

Reminds me of the Star Trek Armada series. Has a fair amount of potential but does need some work. You don't have to really babysit your units in combat which is a good thing and the game itself is rather easy to pick up and play. Devs are really open to feedback as well which is always a good sign.\n\nHowever for the current price? I could not recommend it, but if it is on sale at a lower price then I definitely recommend giving it a go.","January 2, 2015","true","2.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","3"

You're playing as a commander with a mission to recruit other commanders, that will help you both, forces and advice in battles. It's totally up to you how you will manage your resources!\n\nAdvantages\nPleasant background music and sounds\nNicely written dialogues\nAwesome artwork in cutscenes, makes pretty good wallpapers\nStoryline seems quite interesting\nRetro graphics design is very likeable\nAfter one and a half year after release of the game, devs are fully active and game is often improved with pathes and fixes\nThorough and clear tutorial to introduce RTS simpletons like myself into the game mechanics\nDisadvantages\nVoice acting needs an improvement in my opinion\nMinimizing the game / restarting the mission leads to stutters and even crashes\nA.I. can't really cope alone at all, it requires constant control to be somehow useful\nSummary\nFull disclosure - I am not a real-time strategy games player, I played only few strategy games in my whole life and it's not my type of a game, but I'm trying to be reliable and objective in here as I possibly can.\n\nFirst of all, at the first sight you can easily tell that devs love what they're doing. This might not be some great AAA top title on steam, but they're obviously trying their best in here (Look at all those news, patches, upgrades and even their responses to reviews). Their love towards their game is a huge advantage for game itself!\n\nNow finally about the game itself, yay! Graphics looks old, indeed. But here it's not about graphics but about gameplay, so I like to think about them not as "bad" but as "retro". Music is not wonderful either but it's nice listen. I didn't got far enough into the game to fully explore its possibilities, but I clearly see all the potential in it and I will surely play more of it in future. Missions and battles themselves are highly rewarding, building up your fleets, preparing to battle and standing over destroyed ships of your enemies is awesome!\n\nI'd love to compare this game to some other RTS titles, but as I've said before, my experience with them is quite limited. But there's one thing I've noticed in here and what is not that common from what I know. I'm talking about how tactical this game is. It's not about how big and heavy your fleet will be, it's about how you will manage to lead it. For example, commander ships can only shoot forward and it takes time for them to turn around. Without those ships, bombers and fighters become useless and if you're using little and fast battleships to flank commander ship, you're gaining a huge advantage. I might be a bit too into this game...\n\nYes, there are some cons to this game, but it's understandable and game is fully playable and totally enjoyable despite them. One thing that bothers me is why this game is not in early access? It's constantly updated and fixed for better and better AND it would avoid some negative reviews from people who review "fully out yet bugged" game. But I guess there's developers reason behind it.\n\nSo yeah, long story short, an exemplary game from an indie studio. Recommended for everyone, obligatory for RTS lovers to see its potential.\n\nPersonal score\n8.5 / 10","June 5","true","5.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The Factions are fairly different from one another which is always good and the way fleets are handled by hiring commanders to.. well command them is an intresting change from what im use too. Plus the game does seem to be getting updates and bug fixes, updates that are indeed expanding and improving the game which is of course always a good thing as well.\n\nSo all in all i'd recommend Foresight to any fans of the RTS genre.

I am, however, impatient with the pace of the game. The loading times are long and there is an aggravating lull between transitions. The voice acting for the main character is awful. A lot of the sounds are unbalanced/unequalized/incorrectly compressed (if at all) and I can't stand the music. It gives it an outdated feel.\n\nBut the gameplay isn't bad. It reminds me of some old school RTS games. I wouldn't recommend it for the full twenty dollars, but on sale/bundle/promo if you like these types of games.","June 17, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

My current rig is running windows7 and is able to play Advanced Warfair at its highest settings, but it can't run Foresight?!\n\nHere are the details: I install it and launch the game, after about a minute it is able to  get to the main menu. So I start a game, it takes almost a full minute for it to load all the assets for the mission, and then puts me in. While in the mission it will barely keep up with me - as if i'm running a windows 95 device. And then one of two things will happen, either the game will freeze and become unresponsive, OR I restart the program  as intended, either way the results are the same; the game will never launch again! The screen goes dark and freezes,  or the first credit watermark comes up and freezes; and i'm force to kill the process in the task manager to close it down. The ONLY way to attempt to play it again is if i delete the game, find its folder in the steamapps folder and delete all that remains of it, am i able to download it and attempt a play through again.\n\nAs I said, fun LOOKING game....doesn't run at all.\n\nEDIT 2/27/15:\nAfter conversations with the developer directly, and tweaking multiple elements of system and game performance; finally got the game to work.\n\nCheck out its further review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJrW5j3P1W8\n\nFrom the start, I said it wasn't recommended, but after actually being able to play it, I have to change my vote.","January 29, 2015","true","6.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","10"

Usually very quick response time if you have any issues with the game. They continue to improve things on a regular basis. Patches are released frekvently.\n\nI think the graphics looks rather good. Sure, nothing spectacular compared to the best looking games, but not ugly in any way. Maybe parts of the user inerface is a bit clunky.\n\nOn the negative side, voice acting could be a lot better. It doesn't bother me that much, but if you really need perfect voice acting you should skip this game. Of course speech can be disabled if you want, and it's easy to read the dialog without it. Personally I think it's better to offer voice acting, even if it's not of highest quality, instead of just plain text.\n\nZooming is a bit limited compared to other new strategy games. It's nothing that hurts the overall gaming experience, but I would like to be able to zoom out a bit more.\n\nTo sum things up:\n\nThis is an actively supported space strategy title with solid gameplay. Yes it has indie game written all over it, but don't let that scare you away. If you find it on sale I think you should give it a go without hesitation.

As for what I don't like about it, the voice acting is horrid and the graphics aren't really reflective of modern day technology...the UI and camera controls (you can't rotate the camera and your zooming is limited) remind me a bit of Star Trek Armada from back in the day.  Base and turret building are present, but limited...there's just not a lot of building options here.  I do like the idea of building fleets and in doing so, your population cap will actually get smaller...at least that's how my experience went.  I essentially built ships until I hit my pop cap, hired a fleet commander and a fleet advisor and assigned them to the largest ship, then put them all into a fleet...then rinse and repeat.  There are three different factions and a skirmish mode, which I do like and appreciate.  I also like the wormhole/gate/sector system as it reminds me a bit of "AI War".\n\nIf the price were lower (say $5-$10), I'd give this a recommend.  As it stands, you can buy "Sins of a Solar Empire: Trinity" for $20 which has (in my opinion) better graphics/camera controls and more depth (tech trees, more resources, etc).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jydhAOjrzxs\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLMrqmGTnps","January 8, 2015","false","3.0"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","1"

It feels more like Early Access rather then release material.\nIt has forced vsync... which creates mouse lag... in a RTS game this is not acceptable.\nYou can work around this... for nVidia users you can create a profile for the game in the nVidia control panel, and force vsync off. This will resolve the lag issue and unlock the frames.\nThere is NO controls menu.. so never-mind changing keys on a PC tittle... you can not even see what the controls are... and the tutorial dose not do the best job of pointing them out.\nThe voice acting in the game is nothing short of terrible... it would have been better with text only.\nThe graphics... are bearable for a tittle of this price but i seen better graphics on games that cost half as much.\nThe AI dose not prio attacking units from structures and it just mindlessly plunges ahead shooting the first red thing it comes across regardless of whatever else it has around. At least this is what i found from the first 3 missions which is all i could go through before being to frustrated to continue. This is mostly because of the awkward controls and the lack of information about the controls.\nBecause i did not play past the third mission i can not speak to the actual strategy in this game... what it prioritizes, what are its values or what approach it takes.\nIt's not all bad... there are some good ideas here.\nThe squadron / fleet concept is very interesting from my perspective and so is the sector mapping, the artwork presented in the cut-scenes is top notch! But all of these pale if the gameplay hinders the player.\nI do not know why Strides rushed this tittle out...but i got a sneaking suspicion (the usual reason)\nI hope they will be allowed to continue the development of this project and that in time we will get a decent RTS out of it (at least...)\nFor now however i can find no justifiable reason for spending 23 euro on this version...maybe if you are really REALLY passionate about RTS games...maybe then.\nWhat else can i say... another sad day for RTS fans...unfortunately we kinda got used to it by now.\n\nFor a clearer view on the game you can watch my first impressions video :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWUcgmrsA_o&index=1&list=PLPu1MBLqtny7rnijEzJ3bPSEMepog_rOK","November 28, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

My main issue with it is that less than 3 hours in I had several bugs, my game crashed twice and at one point my main ship was frozen, couldn't move or anything during the 3rd mission when I tried to get it repaired at the allied shipyard before heading back to Earth, so yea its not perfect, the gameplay is nice enough, but the developers have to check out again for bugs, because its getting pretty annoying having issues and having to restart some missions all because it crashed or bugged. Still I'd recommend the game, in particular when nicely on sale, but otherwise I make a mention that saving often might be necessary until the issues it still have got corrected.","October 6, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","10"

I like the voice acting, the ship design (mostly) and the UI of the game, and I totally think you should play this is you even only kinda like RTS's. But there is one huge problem I have with this game, and its the camera controls. The control are made just so that you can never really look where you want to look fast enough, or see much of the map in your FoV.\n\nThe key mapping is super weird and is out of the way, but I couldn't seem to find an option to rebind them at all. Idk if you like slower camera controls, but it makes it almost unplayable for me. I put 4 hours into it to see if I could get past the camera issue, and I just couldn't. But I'm a cinematographer so I guess camera angles are more important to me that others. I didn't actually buy this game, I won it from watching Who's Gaming Now?! on Twitch, but I would have had to get a refund, no matter how hard it would be to give it up.\n\nPretty much if you like RTS's you'll like this. It doesn't really do anything new or innovative, but it's enjoyable nonetheless\n","October 6, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Those that caused the war have long since fled Earth for the distant galaxies. As planet Earth slowly died, the survivors eventually have to face up to the inevitable and go in search of a new habitable planet. At the same time an experiment with dark matter creates a spatial anomaly, causing multiple wormholes to open up across the galaxy. In an instant, distant worlds that were once light years away can now be reached within a matter of days or even hours. But as humanity ventures in to the unknown, dangers await and battles for survival will ensue. With those responsible for the nuclear war at large somewhere in the galaxy, will they be friend or foe, or have they become something even worse?  Do other dangers exit?\n\nForesite is a real time strategy game. In hindsight foresite is not  "Redefining Strategy in RTS". I was hopeful for foresite however at the start the game really did not shine the voice acting is bad and the tutorial is very slow paced and this immediately put me off the game. I stopped playing at that point however I decided to give it another try, I started a single battle and this was a much better experience to me. It plays like most rts games you have to develop your base, generate units, defend your base and attack the enemy base. The game doesn't really set itself apart from other RTS games your units each have unique attributes such as you can build large, slow, tanky ships, fast scouts, units specialized for structure damage etc.\n\nYour structures are your base, power generators, ship manufactury, turrets etc. The number of structures you can have are limited by the amount of power you have and that is limited by the number of generators you can create.  The number of ships you can control is dependent on the number of captain points you have.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is fairly catchy and some epic music is well placed in an epic fight. The game itself doesn't look ultra HD nor do I think it needs to.\n\n\nThe game play is fun but I do not see to much more in the way of strategic options than in any RTS game, once you get past the tutorial the game is fun though.\n\nIf you enjoy other RTS games then you will probably enjoy this one to, my first time playing I thought this game was not worth playing but after my return to it I believe it deserves a chance\n\n5/10 there are a lot of things that turn me off but its fun.","December 2, 2014","true","0.9"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

It is a Real Time Strategy game that focuses on creating a space fleet and destroying the enemies side. The game was published on the 28th November 2014 and is still having updates.\n\nGameplayForesight is a true RTS space themed game, and the game proves that to us the more that you play through this game. The start of the game is obviously the tutorial, it helps you grasp the basic concepts of what you have to do to build ships, attack enemies ect in order to progress through the game. The tutorial is very helpful, I felt like the it didn't drag on very much and I felt like I knew what I was doing when I got into the actual first level because this game is fairly complex. It explains each of the mechanics very well and waits for you to complete that one task before they move onto the next part. If you are into these sort of games then this tutorial will be pretty easy to follow, but if you are more of casual player this might seem a bit difficult to get used to everything and learning everything at once.\n\nOnce you are in the levels you will find that the game isn't as easy as you thought it would be. The game doesn't really require you to be speedy at creating your ships, but more strategic to create the right sort of ships to defeat the enemy team. There is a interesting mechanic that is in the game, that is if you find a wormhole you will be teleported to another space on the map, this could give you a great advantage as you could be behind the enemy and ambush them. The story isn't all that much in-depth as the game focuses mainly upon the RTS side and not the story which isn't really considered a bad thing in most cases for RTS games.\n\nThe controls of the game are very well made and designed. For the casual players they will probably use the default controls that are in the game. But for the more 'hardcore' RTS fans there is a huge section for the hotkeys where you can assign pretty much everything for if you are that sort of person who likes to do that.\n\nThe game's graphics are very well designed, with all the ships having that sci-fi sort of look to them. they have all had the same amount of detail to them. The space background and the sort of detail that the cutscenes go into are a different sort of style to what the actual game is. The cutscenes are kind of weird compared to the style of the actual game, and for me doesn't really fit in very much.\n\nPros+ Great tutorials\n+ Great level design & mechanics\n+ Simple and Advanced controls\n+ Unique type of RTS\n+ Steam Achievements and Cards\n\nCons- For casual gamers might be a bit tricky to start off with, there is a lot that you need to learn\n- Cutscene graphics are completely different from the gameplay graphics.\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsForesight is still a great RTS game, with the game being fairly complex it is great for both casual and hardcore RTS fans although casual gamers may have difficulty to play to start off with. The gameplay graphics are great, but the cutscene ones seem out of place. Overall a great RTS game\n\nRating: 6.8/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Yolo Army curator group here.","June 4","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Update the updates i also Rated from 8.2 to 9 for the goodie´s Released. The Game will be Continued for sure cuz it shows some things, but what will happen next? Dunno, i can´t wait for more of the awesome Foresight RTS series!!!\nI was really unsure @ first cuz some Screenshot were so confusing about the Gameplay and other things.\nBut you should really try it´s worth all the about 7x Hours i have played by now and it´s my #4 of most played games by now too!!!! (doesn´t that say much?)\nThe Gameplay itself feel compared to other games similar to Command&Conquer+Homeworld mixed in one game. This is also why i would Recommend it to any RTS player that like a good, Demanding diffculty sometimes and yet a chilled simple controlled game with Brain using.\nThe Races have Weapon´s,Skill´s and Tactics, Effects that you need to work out yourself\n(the NSAU was so demanding hard to me with turrets while SS/UNC were so easy to master for me)\nWeapon Effects like Nuklear missle and Poison etc should be handled CAREFULLY!!!\nThey will Destroy sometimes not only one ship and can cause a fleet Destruction!!\nThe Man behind this Game (Jeremy) is awesome and hard working! When i discover Bugs he always want to see and help me (this makes him a very very good Developer since not many Dev´s are like this!!!)\nI will Recommend this game every time you ask me!\nLast thing to say, i hope this game will get more than just this one Title since i would love to see more than just Foresight (Foresight addon, Foresight 2? etc)\nI hope i Read in some Year/s maybe more from the awesome Series.\n\n\nHere is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:\n\nGameplay: 9/10 (because its simple to use with fleets, innovative and has varity´s!)\n\nGraphics: 9/10 (Direct-X 9 engine, but it looks Just so Beautiful and can also be very Demanding on your System!)\n\nSupport: 10/10 (Never got better Support and fast updates when i Discovered Bugs!)\n\nPrice: 9/10 (highter than most think maybe worth, but its Price per Hour is very low with about 0,35 Cents per Hour played to Complete only the Main Story Plot!!!)\n\nStory: 9/10 (I am a RPG Lover so a Great Story is a must have for Games i play, i say this RTS has such a good Story. It also doesn´t keep the Story away like most games do. It always gives a bit of Story even in Missions they Talk about the Story Plot so be careful not only to fight and Read carefully in fights!!!)\n\nSound: 8/10 (Music is very good, but can be Annoying if you want to play the game without Breaks. The Music feels to short in longer Missions)\n\nPerformance: 9/10 (is very good but can drop a lot in Maxed fights!)\n\nFAZIT: 9/10 (well made game and worth the price if you don´t own! already)","July 7, 2015","true","71.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

So the map is separated in sectors like just 4 to. 20 or more.\nin each sector you can build a base to collect resources and they all are connected with wormholes.\n\nYou have 3 Factions here, 2 really on energy like in C&C, so no energy no turrets power and slowly production, the other is unique, they need blood banks. Not enough blood and you units start to lose Hit Points.\n\nUnits are like in Starwars Empire at War. So you can build from small scouts to huge Capital Battleships.\n\nThe Unique idea is here you must place fighter and bombers in bigger ships to move them around, like the Protoss Carrier, but you build them in Shipyard, not on the capital ship.\nLots of Corvettes, Gunship and other support ships are here too.\n\nWell best part is the unit limit, to increase this you must get a "Fleet Captain" on a ship, that you can assign ships to him. So you have like limit for 10 units, Assign them to the captain and now you can buy another 8 units and so on.\n\nSo if you loose a Fleet Captain you have like 18 Units and cant buy more units. Because you are with 8 units too high by the limit. Pretty interesting mechanic in my Opinion.\nIn most RTS its just some kind of house that is placed somewhere randomly. Here its you fleet commander. Story is challenging and interesting, the AI is like in Tiberium Wars, the game itself feels like an Space C&C.\n\nYou can by the way choose here the Tech Level like in Red Alert 1 or set the Amount of Start Resources. Like in Starwas Empire at War you can increase the game play speed, yes you have game speed controls here.\n\nFor this game I can put my Hand in fire, an extreme good AAA Indie RTS game.","October 6, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
