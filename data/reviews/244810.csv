The set pieces are wonderful, and you'll find yourself chuckling at the background gags or soaking in the atmospheric cutouts of spooky castles and ancient pyramids.\n\nIt's a pretty standard beat-em-up with a token leveling system in place that grants you more moves, though you might not find the advanced skills as useful as your basic starting countestrikes.  This game's mastery is based around countering your enemy's moves when they telegraph them, and its very satisfying to contunually float when you are able to chain multiple air grabs off of different enemies.\n\nUnfortunately strategies for the levels and bosses are pretty basic, and when you've seen the same lines of text many times in order to get a level's achievements, the story's charm starts wearing thin.  Co-op mode is definitely the way to go, as single player becomes repetitive quickly.  The game is great for a playthrough with a buddy, but is probably too shallow to make getting all of the achievements much fun.","December 22, 2014","true","7.8"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","35","36","2","1"

So, I was predictably excited to pick up Foul Play upon its release. The art style looks fantastic and the presentation (while gimmicky at first) is fresh and creative.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay is pretty shallow. Granted, the brawler genre is not known for its depth of gameplay, but, after running through the first few levels, I can legitimately say that simply mashing buttons is a viable, if not more effective strategy to defeating enemies. While it's amusing enough to try to string together juggles and combos, knowing that I could be blindly smashing keys to accomplish the very same thing diminishes any sense of reward or accomplishment I could have attained.\n\nI really wanted to like this game; it's cool looking, kitchsy, and charming. Ultimately, though, I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Maybe when it drops to around $2.50, it might be worth purchasing. At the time of writing, however, it's sitting at $7.49 during the 2013 Winter Sale. So, this brawler fan must give Foul Play a thumbs down.","December 22, 2013","false","1.5"," 91 of 136 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","91","136","0","0"

In fact, it strenghtens my love for indie developers more than big publishers, developers, whatever. Devolver does it again. After Shadow Warrior being recommended by quite a few people and Serious Sam 3, which despite its flaws did provide me with quite some good entertainment, I got my hands on Foul Play.\n\nWhat I love about indie games is the fact that from time to time you get a game that may look like something familiar but then it throws a twist and after just a few minutes of game time you realize that there's nothing quite like it.\nOn with the first impression shall we?\n\nGameplay wise, despite it obviously being built with a controller in mind, keyboard works quite well. The controls are responsive and you really don't feel at a loss. That being said I don't doubt it's better with a controller.\n\nThe game is presented as a standard side-scrolling brawler with combos, unlockables, skills, perks in the form of charms and so on. Nothing special about that you would think but you would be wrong.\n\nThe art style is what sets it apart from any other game out there. The whole story unravels on stage. And no, I'm not kidding. You and your partner, the game featuring 2 player coop, are actors reenacting a story from a journal that you get to unlock page by page as the story progresses. As such, you always see the spectators, sometimes with a special request, the background scenery being changed and from time to time you catch the actors off-guard or even the janitor at his best.\n\nThe point of each performance is to get the highest score by getting big combos, doing the above-mentioned special requests and of course by not getting hit. What's more interesting is the fact that you can't die. All you have to worry about is the quality of your performance, trying to fill the always present meter and amaze the crowd allowing you to do even more impressive stunts as a reward.\nI hate to finish in a negative manner but I do have some cons to point out. First off, the graphics settings are not there. That I didn't find too bad but, the game doesn't feature 16:10 resolutions. The second and last con would be the fact that the game being created with a controller in mind, all the instructions for let's say combos and controls are only pointed out for the controller even if you are using a keyboard. It's not big of a deal since the game uses 10-12 keys including WASD but a con is a con.\n\nAt the end of this, the verdict would be a 9/10 the above mentioned not being able to affect my experience with the game so far in a such a manner that it fails to provide what you would expect from it. My advice? If you're into old-school sidescrolling brawlers bought into the 21st century this is a must. You could do far worse with 14.99,you could get Call of Duty: Ghosts...","November 9, 2013","true","1.9"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

The story is told like it's a play so you're actually fighting actors in suits. The better you fight the more impressed your audience will be. Impress them enough to gain more stars and to level up, unlocking charms (which grant bonuses) and new moves (those are also fun for replaying levels). It's a charming game, with pretty graphics and enough detail in the characters. Movements could use some work though. Sometimes they're a bit limited, so it makes the game look cheap. Voice overs are nowhere to be seen, except for a few 'hey's' and 'oh's', things like that.\n\nThe music also didn't impress, because I can't remember if there even was music in it in the first place, and if so, if it was any good.\n\nFoul Play is an impressive little game nevertheless and should be played if you're into beat 'em ups or if you have a lot of time on your hands (in my opinion, it's more fun to play in 30 minute sessions).\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","September 21, 2013","true","5.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

While we're performing our play on the stages, we move forward, beating enemies and pleasing our audiences with good performance.\n\nThe campaign is divided into five acts, each acts have five levels, each levels is approx ten-fifteen minutes long, a bit longer if you're into boss battles. The objective is simple, you just need to beat each enemy waves with style - be it by performing chain combos to fill and maintain the meter gauge (audiences' mood). Don't let it get too low or the curtain will close and game over. A bit lacking aspect, though, is that the campaign is incredibly linear - you have no option to do anything else and can only follow the direction the game wishes you to. You can, however, replay earlier stages from main menu to achieve higher scores.\n\nThe combat mechanic is very simple, chaining normal and powerful attacks while deflecting the enemies or throw them against each others. And this what differentiates from Castle Crasher, it offers more lively battles and flexible ala Devil May Cry DMC but in 2D. By chaining you'll be increasing your scores and earns stars that'll be calculated at the end of each level. As you progress, you'll unlock more abilities/perks to use in game. Use these to... chain more enemies. Heh.\n\nAnd of course, playing coop is much more fun than alone. It's hilarious, really, to have a messed up battle on the stages.\n\nGraphic wise I'm incredibly amused. It really is that great - suitable for this game - colorful and innately bunch sense of humor drawn into the art and character designs. Special effects don't distract you from the battles and carefully blend with the stages, movement and attack animations are not sluggish and feel natural. FPS throughout the level is stable enough even during chaotic battle.  Some minus points though, there are no deep customizations like AA or refresh rate and some commonly supported resolutions are not supported. But overall, I'd say the job well done.\n\nAnd lastly, controller support is great - and I expect it so much because this is a platformer. I wouldn't even give the game a damn great review if it had poor support, but this Foul Play is just apt at adapting controller support. Dinput and Xinput are both supported, moreover each buttons can be customized in game. No complaints from me on this aspect really.\n\nFunny thing is, metacritic user score gives this 69/100. Don't listen - it deserves more. A recommended game from me.","March 9, 2015","true","7.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

In this frantic 2-d button-mashing-tastic brawler game with Mr. Pringle and his rogue-like sidekick with a black bandana you go around kick baddies' butts castle crasher style! It can indeed become very repetitive were it not for the clever yet amusing character dialogues/monologues plus ability to deck out your character with special charms unlocked only via challenges presented in most scenes per act.  The challenges themselves can be quite difficult to achieve ranging anywhere from as simple as perform a flawless scene to reaching as high as x200 hit combo in a scenario.  Charms equippe grant special abilities such as giving you extra combo stacks after a successful parry of enemy attack or increase duration until combo wears off under which you must start accumulating them all over again.  Grinding out high combo stack can boost audience mood drastically and also bring you high score multipliers--activating showstopper effect can accelerate this effect and help you reach high stacks faster but cannot be activated too frequently.  Efficiency requires timing the activation at favourable windows of opportunity to facilitate earning high combos and score.\n\nVery good game overall if you fancy castle crasher style gameplay, albeit solo most of the time--online multiplayer is dead.  Despite the lack of a live online community, you can always grab your trusty fellow sidekick to deliver the performance of a century in local co-op action.","June 2, 2014","true","7.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I haven't complete it yet but basically I got the entire idea. It is classic beat'em style game and fun to play with firend online or locally. It is well done in visual aspect, the soundtracks are good, and the gameplay is decent. For 15 bucks, it may not be worth that much but with 75% off sale, I have to say, it is worth that price.\nHowever, being worth 3 or 4 bucks doesn't mean it is flawless. Here come the some flaw.\n1. Maybe or not, the later levels doesn't introduce many new features. It lacks variation. Sometimes you probably feel that enemies are just the same but with different apparences. That is not variation which needs new strategies. It becomes repetitive sooner or later.\n2. Movement/action delay. You will feel sometimes character take too much time on one movement and you have to wait until the movement is finished. Otherwise, you can't do anything during that process. This concept is acceptable however, when you jump too high in the air doing combos, if you miss the target or enemies, they fall on the ground before you do, then your combos are simpy break because when you are doing combos in the air, you have 1. combo attack, 2. stay in the air process to finish. It takes too long for you to get back to ground to continue the combo. So to complete the challenges like 100 combos are really hard since it is easier that movement delay breaks combo.\n3. I was really tired playing this game. Confronting multiple enemies, sometimes time limits, and movement delay as I said above are the reasons that you constantly typing buttons. It either kills your index and middle fingers when using a keyboard or kills your thumbs when using a controller. It becomes a button masher.\n4. I still don't understand how your health point is calculated...None of the indicators on the top screen are clear for me. I just don't get it...\n","March 1, 2014","true","5.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Plus you can play with a friend which is always a pleasure if you like that sort of thing, the game's entirely possible with just one person.

Other than that though, there is a leveling up mechanic (that i missed completely), and the game is just a little too short. That said i did get it for like 90 cents, so its not bad if you just want to have a bit of mindless fun with someone. It will probably feel a little lacking if you spent more cash on this.\nNOTE - if you are visually impared, tracking your position in each level maybe a little tricky due to the art style and contrast. Also the story is told with text bubble dialogue, though you can take time to read  them (they require button prompts to progress). Also some things like the leveling system and level challenges maybe missed completely. Personally i did not know they existed until another user pointed it out to me.","June 22, 2015","false","3.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","4"

It is a short, button-mashing quirky indie game, which I'd rate at <b>8/10</b>.\n\n<i> Music, sound, stuff you hear</i>\n\nBesides a few grunts, there isn't much voiceacting (this is no AAA title, if Sir or Madam would kindly remember). Sound effects are fitting. Yours truly really did find the music to be most fitting and rather pleasing.\n\n<i> Story, characters, setting, visual presentation</i>\n\nBaron Dashforth and his trusty sidekick/apprentice/coworker are demon hunters and real gentlemen in London around 1910. The game takes place in a theatre, where the Baron himself reenacts his life by beating up actors. Most stages feature some kind of visual theartre joke, like one of the stage hands forgetting to leave on time. Of course the Baron speaks like a real gentleman would (which I can not emulate, please accept my deepest apologies). It is drawn in an unique style. To sum it up: They have created an original setting, which fits the game very well and is enjoyable. The story even has a twist.\n\n\n<i> Controls, Gameplay </i>\n\nI played the game using the Xbox controller, and it worked perfectly. (I did not try anything else). You have to buttons to attack, one to jump, one to parry (more on that in a moment), one to dodge. A button is used to activate the combo-boost and one for special attacks you learn later.\n\nParrying is a rather defining gameplay element besides the off-the-mill brawling. When enemies attack you, they do telegraph it, so you can parry by simply pressing one button, there is no tricky timing or anything fancy. This you can use to start your own attack and control the flow of the battle, so it is not reduced to button mashing. In the course of the game you learn different attacks, many tie into the parrying.\n\nThe healthmeter is in fact the approval of the audience: They cheer if you beat up zombies and gargoyles, but boo when you get hit. Combos increase their approval and your score. Also there are charms you can equip, which make combos easier or dying more difficult etc.\n\n\n<i> Gamelength, replayability </i>\n\nIf you would kindly remember, this is no AAA title. I played the game for about 8h, and have seen every stage, level, enemy and attack. There are special tasks to complete in every level, a couple charms and background story to unlock etc, so there is reason to come back - if beating actors dressed as gargoyles wearing a top hat is not enough for you.\n\n<i> Anything to add, before the final bow? </i>\n\nAs I said in the beginning, I would rate the game at 8/10. It is fun, probably even funnier in multiplayer, and the setting is very well crafted. Also I'd like to compliment the fine ladies and gentlemen of Devolver on making a great game about beating up people, without blood, extreme violence or humor based on extreme violance. I am looking forward to an encore.","November 26, 2013","true","7.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However, the game is both tedious and shallow. As someone else said, you can just spam mash buttons and do just fine, and there really isn't a level above that. It looks cool, but thats all it has going for it.\nThe tediousness comes in when you're getting a combo and an enemy randomly moves a pixel too far, and the combo drops from about 1 second of inactivity. Pretty irritating. The last of the game's issues that I noticed are that it thinks that 'difficult' means spamming even more enemies. Perhaps I treasure difficulty too much in games, but I think you should actually be able to die in a fighting game. The mechanic of pleasing the crowd is cute, but it also acts as your health bar in a way—which would be fine if you didn't have a near-constant free super-please steroid.\nIt'd be nice if there was more variety of enemies and gameplay in the acts. In what I played, it was very repetetive.\n\nThe game is 1-dimensional and its not even a good one.","May 10, 2014","false","1.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There is no humour in this game, other than the combat is a joke. I see no difference as I progress through the levels, and the enemies are pretty much the same everytime. I am fully aware of the genre, but even for the genre it's below average.

Castle Crashers had more variety in gameplay, it had a store, progression system and unlockable companions. it's gameplay was better. and it was spaced out pretty well.\n\noverall, i think that's enough negative aspects to base my opinion that after all you should skip this game, unless you can get the 2-pack for 75% off or more.\n\n5/10","January 1, 2014","false","4.4"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

Maybe.\n\n-=TL;DR=-\nFoul Play is a very simple side-scrolling beat 'em up that plays much like Castle Crashers, in the vein of a stage play as acted by the players. Gameplay is focused on performing well by maintaining combos, avoiding hits and completing level based challenges, instead of survival and managing lives/continues/respawns. It's a clever take on the genre that makes for a somewhat interesting experience, but in spite of the description's "rewards performance over pummeling" the gameplay does get fairly repetitive and it's easy to loose interest after a few levels.\n\n-=Presentation=-\nFoul Play is easily comparable to Castle Crashers due to it's art style and simplistic combat - it looks and almost plays quite like a Flash game even though the game doesn't seem to be in Flash. Animation is fluid like Castle Crashers, but certainly won't win any awards. The old British comedy will probably put off some players, not because it's bad, but it's a style of comedy that won't make alot of people laugh. I never felt that any of the jokes were bad or purile, nor did it put me off at all, but I didn't laugh. The game is cartoonish, attacks have that "PISH! POW" as expected and enemies eyes turn into "X's" when they "die" (in which humorously, the enemy actors will be pulled off screen or sneak off screen". Backgrounds gradually fall in the back, as if the props were being managed by an amateur. The director is often seen in the background even on the scene itself, as if he not aware how fast the play is moving. They're all nice touches. The soundtrack fits the theme very well and I do like the menu music, though it's nothing spectacular, it's just good and fits the game well. The game plays at 60FPS, though, doesn't reach my 2560x1080 resolution\n\n-=Gameplay=-\nThe way to win is the complete the level without dropping the "Mood-o"meter" low, which is the visual metric of how well you are performing. You maintain and grow this meter by performing big combos, maintaining those combos, reversing attacks, avoid being hit and activating a "special" that doubles your combo count output. The gameplay is very forgiving: Combos allow a good 2-3 seconds after you last hit for you to continue hitting enemies (making managing the screenspace key), reversable attacks have a near infinite window for you to counter them and if you can't block it, you can easily dodge a good bit out of the way. Staying alive is extra easy and I'm honestly not sure you can die unless you simply don't perform well enough for the meter - you can usually spam a few attacks here and there to keep yourself in the game. There is still a challenge of keeping your combo going, as you can lose it from being hit or not keeping enemies near you to attack, and the game offer various combo, attack and time challenges. This style of gameplay makes the game potentially more valuable for the completionist.\n\nCombat does get a little boring fairly soon. While Foul Play gives the player new moves at a very reasonable pace, it's generally most effective to mash the attack button and/or spam reversals, as enemies constantly attack. There are moments where it's definitely handy to dodge whether to avoid damage or make it to an enemy fast enough to keep a combo going. Some moves are fun, like the Stunning Piledriver or multi-hit air attack, but the gameplay is very repetitive as you constantly slap enemies with your cane and throw them around with the same two slam attacks. There's a second uppercut style attack, but there is really no reason to use it as air combos aren't awarded more than normal combos and doing so can knock enemies out of your range, causing you to lose a combo.\n\nThe game offers Local and Online co-op, though, finding a game seems impossible - I've only seen 0 games in the server browser and that was even when I played the game shortly after it came out. You will likely have to find somebody in the community hub or elsewhere to play with.\n\n-=Conclusion=-\nFoul Play offers a unique and lightly fun experience, allowing players to challenge themselves by completing goals, versus beating up and staying alive. The combat becomes dull fairly quickly and after a while, I became disinterested in finishing the game, even though I was halfway finish and trying judiciously to get this off my backlog. For most players, the $15 price point may be a bit too high for the repetitive gameplay, lack of online players, and potentially non-entertaining comedy. The price seems fair for somebody who would really enjoy this game and expect to beat all the challenges, as that is the arguably the best part of this game - seeing if you can complete them on a game that is very easy, though providing some challenges that might feel just slightly out of reach. This surely isn't a must-buy and you would be missing out on the performance based gameplay, though it's nothing revolutionary. However, the game is certainly not bad and there are many worse games you could buy, but you may feel the lack of value shortly after playing.","June 15, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went into it basically blind not knowing what to expect but this game is really unique. For the most part is a standard beat ‘em up brawler but it has a few interesting twists. The premise of the game is that you’re preforming a show and you need to keep the crowd interested by keeping long strings of combos and getting a high score. This gives the game a large focus on points rather than a health bar. Speaking of health bars, this game doesn’t have one. The combo system is a perfect replacement for a health bar because it makes breaking your combo feel just as bad as losing some health. The rest of the gameplay is really solid with lots of unlockable moves and even an item system. Items provide passive buffs like +3 combo on successful parry and extending the time limit before a combo is lost. The co-op in this game doesn’t feel tacked on but doesn’t add anything either though, I still think it’s more fun to play with a friend. On to the aesthetic. The game has a stereotypical British theme that is hilarious. Even the tutorials for new moves use fancy rhetoric to describe things. For example the grab tutorial “When an unseemly fellow attacks hit B whilst he is signaling his intent. Successful executions should see you grabbing the fellow he the lapels (or whatever seems most convenient dependent on social class and/or species” Really funny stuff. The in game banter between Dashforth and Scampwick is also really hilarious. The art style in the game is really beautiful. Its cartoony with vibrant colors. Everything looks like a stage prop with you being able to see people inside monster costumes and backgrounds and props roll in between scenes. It’s really charming and gives the game a theater feel. The enemies are very diverse you’ll see everything from mummies to giant crab men, all well stylized of course. I really enjoyed Foul Play it was a fresh take on a genre I’m not usually all that into. It’s a charming game with a good story and some really funny humor I recommend it. 7/10","July 31, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be it the janitor slacking off on stage, the guy stuck in a prop or the actors looking to see if anyone would notice if he crawled off the stage.\n\nThe dialogue is very British and it’s not a bad thing. It kind of parodies Sherlock.\n\nThe game play… I highly suggest you get a controller, I played it on a keyboard and my right hand is aching! It’s very retro/old school in terms of killing the bosses, it’s very Mario. You beat the boss using a pattern of moves and you stick to it until he dies. But The silver lining is the combinations and charge attacks you can do, it looks good and feels good!\n\nSo in a nutshell, it's a gem if you don't mind the button mashing and the repetitiveness.\n","July 3, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The feeling of fighting on a stage to entertain a crowd just makes you want to do your very best! The combos are fast and satisfying to pull off and you feel amazing when you discover new moves for the first time and make great use of them to make that combo number rise. Finally we make it to the most amazing aspect of Foul Play, the story. I mean it this game's story made both me and my friend want to just keep going until we made it to the very end. I won’t go into detail to avoid spoilers but the story is just pure bliss. Both my friend and I bought this game while it was on sale but this game is still worth its full price.

Elaboration on why later on.\n\nStory: You control Sebastian Dashforth,who combined with his assistant Scampwick Steerpipe is presenting his life as a daemonologist on stage, re-enacting the main events of Dashforth's last 20 years. Not fearing to go into hand-on-hand combat he and Scampwick are fighting themselves through an lost city of egypt, cursed villages, underwater cities and a london in control of a cult.Fairly generous with the humor and honest (though you may not thank him for it) he will keep you interested to keep playing for a while.\n\nGameplay: You got six buttons that are important for playing, a weak,but fast attack,a stronger, slower attack which can bring enemies into the air or down from it, a jump, a button for improved abilities (which you learn at a higher level),a Showstopper ability granting you double the combo and double the audience approval when you activate it for a certain amount of time, a dodge and a block. The block is the most important of them,since you automatically counter blocked attacks from weaker enemies, letting you combo into them and from them. The enemies attacks have a clear indicator and you have a longer time to block or dodge an attack. You can play with someone else in Co-op and the only downside is that you have a combined health bar but seperated combo meters. You even get some upsides like a combo bonus if you activate showstopper at the same time. Enemies differ from higher health and exclusive gimmicks, like binding you if they hit on mummys.At the end of a level,you can get a charm if you did the challenges and a diary page if you collected enough stars.\n\nAdditional Pros:\n-Replay value to 100% the game and to experiment on different gamestyles\n-Unique Storyconcept and interesting Characters\n-Soundtrack available with the game for no additional cost\n-Attention to detail\n\nAdditional Cons:\n-Low Playtime(any% about 3 hours, 100% 14 hours)\n-Bugs like enemies thrown up into the air won't come down that easily at some points\n-No Wiki\n-No active lobby community,so no random multiplayer\n\n\nAll in all it is worth playing, and if you are a fan of unique concepts,than this game should be yours!","March 8, 2014","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very hard to fail a level because there are no health bars per se. The move list is not as extensive as in other games, the focus of Foul Play however is not to dispatch enemies as fast as possible but to keep your combo going. The rather limited moves you have serve that purpose well.\n\nTwo other minor annoyances for me were the menu structure (if you unlocked a new move during online play, you would have to go back all the way to the main menu - thus terminating your online game - to check what exactly you unlocked) and the fact that the game assumes you have a 360 gamepad. You can use your keyboard for it and it playes well with it, but all the tooltips etc. will only show the corresponding 360 pad key, not your keyboard key. Also you can not bind attacks to your mouse, so you ca not play WASD to move + mouse to attack like you can in many other games.\n\nIf you can look besides those things, you will find Foul Play to be a very fun co-op experience.","March 3, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as one of two characters in the game: Baron Dashforth, an old-timey gentleman-brawler complete with cane, top hat, and a no nonsense moustache who dabbles in a little Deamon Hunting, or Scampwick, his fearless sidekick. The main characters make me feel like a classy badass and the writing is a riot, like quick jabs to the gut from Dashforth's cane.\nWhat impresses me the most about this game is the setting. Instead of the tried and true "mean streets" style of beat 'em ups (Final Fight, Double Dragon, Streets of Rage, etc.) this one takes place completely on a theatre stage, told from Dashforth's perspective of past Deamon Hunting events. All of the enemies are just actors, dressed to fit the role. Whether they're pirates or pale vampires, soldiers or zombie squid, each baddie is made to look like a guy in a costume rather than an actual demon. This includes seeing stitching on costumes and faces through masks.\nInstead of a health bar, players are treated to the "mood 'o' meter" which gauges the audience's (sat right at the bottom of the screen) reactions to how you fight. Building combos, dodging hits, and varying attacks build up the audience even more, causing them to jump out of their seats, celebrate, and cheer on their heroes as they clash with otherworldly creatures. You can't help but feel pumped when the audience is hooting and whistling at your plethora of ♥♥♥ kicking capabilities or when a tiny boy patron, holding the obligatory lollipop, stands up and let's the enemies know that Dashforth is not to be messed with.\nThe level of thought that went into presenting the idea of the game is awesome. All of it is esthetically pleasing and the creators must have put a lot of passion into making this beat 'em up really feel original Grab a copy when you can. You won't be disappointed.","April 16, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a side-scrolling beat 'em up with cute graphics, a funny plot, and simple-yet-pleasing mechanics.\n\nYou play an intrepid  British adventurer and demon hunter and his scamp of a sidekick.  Gameplay focuses on parrying enemy attacks, situational awareness, and making magnificient combos.  As you advance through the retelling of Baron Dashforth's exploits, trials, and tribulations the scenery morphs at lightning speed to set each scene - the game is a play upon an everchanging stage.  The graphical style is reminiscient of Castle Crashers with a dash of Alien Hominid thrown towards enemy designs.\n\nDeveloped and published by Devolver Games, the same studio that published Hotline Miami, Foul Play brings more addicting albeit different strategic violence into the fold with a more chipper and humorous take on plot and design.\n\nThe only downside comes from the combat mechanics getting a little bit stale - it is a beat 'em up, after all.  However, some of the repetitiveness is alleviated by the introduction of new combo moves and charms as you progress further into the game and complete various performance goals for each act.  Charms unlock abilities such as combo multipliers, lengtheners, and more exotic buffs and aids.\n\nI'd recommend this game with two tips for enjoyment:\n1.) Play with a friend - it makes it much more fun.\n2.) Play in half-hour to hour stretches - avoid burning out on the mechanics","November 11, 2013","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is center statge at it's just as good as Arkham, albeit less deep and minus the gadgets. Make no mistake this is a side scrolling button masher but the combat is much more fun than other button mashers since you can block and counter, and the game wasn't designed to eat quarters.\n\nThe art direction and style is unique and cute as the entire game takes place on a stage with a Daemon hunter recounting his exploits to a crowd. The crowd's happiness/entertainment level is your life meter and the actors take on the roles of werewolves, mermaids, and giant crabs to name a few. The art direction doesn't go all the way though with flying enemies conspicuosly lack wires and some of the bosses are just monsters, but overall the concept works great.\n\nThe game works best in small doses and actually isn't a drag in single player.

The graphics are more smooth than Castle Crashers, but still retains the same charm, with all the characters and enemies big enough so that you can see them, but that also sometimes makes it hard to know if you are in the same layer as the enemy. The bosses are both challenging and rewarding, each with their own special attacks. The story is very well thought out, with Scarmpwick acting as a great source of comic relief. The presentation of the game is wonderful, I couldn't find one glitch or error with the game. The music fits well, and perfectly suits the seriousness of some situations.\n\nOverall, Foul play is a wonderful game, and I would reccomend this game to anyone who has played Castle Crashers, and liked it, or someone who likes side scrolling beat-'em-ups. 9/10\n\n","December 14, 2013","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went into it basically blind not knowing what to expect but this game is really unique. For the most part is a standard beat ‘em up brawler but it has a few interesting twists. The premise of the game is that you’re preforming a show and you need to keep the crowd interested by keeping long strings of combos and getting a high score. This gives the game a large focus on points rather than a health bar. Speaking of health bars, this game doesn’t have one. The combo system is a perfect replacement for a health bar because it makes breaking your combo feel just as bad as losing some health. The rest of the gameplay is really solid with lots of unlockable moves and even an item system. Items provide passive buffs like +3 combo on successful parry and extending the time limit before a combo is lost. The co-op in this game doesn’t feel tacked on but doesn’t add anything either though, I still think it’s more fun to play with a friend. On to the aesthetic. The game has a stereotypical British theme that is hilarious. Even the tutorials for new moves use fancy rhetoric to describe things. For example the grab tutorial “When an unseemly fellow attacks hit B whilst he is signaling his intent. Successful executions should see you grabbing the fellow he the lapels (or whatever seems most convenient dependent on social class and/or species” Really funny stuff. The in game banter between Dashforth and Scampwick is also really hilarious. The art style in the game is really beautiful. Its cartoony with vibrant colors. Everything looks like a stage prop with you being able to see people inside monster costumes and backgrounds and props roll in between scenes. It’s really charming and gives the game a theater feel. The enemies are very diverse you’ll see everything from mummies to giant crab men, all well stylized of course. I really enjoyed Foul Play it was a fresh take on a genre I’m not usually all that into. It’s a charming game with a good story and some really funny humor I recommend it. 7/10","July 31, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are somehow interested because of the art style and silliness, I'd suggest skipping this one.\n\nThe good: Super tight controls. Pleasant visuals and audio. Light-hearted atmosphere.\n\nThe bad: Very repetitive. Enemies come in all sorts of varieties, but there are a lot of reskins. Fighting is reduced to button mashing. Gameplay is also extremely easy. For example, the game actually gives you a pop-up over enemies' heads to tell you when the time is right to parry their attacks. And because of how the game mechanics work, as long as you manage to get a good number of combos in there you won't actually die, since pleasing the crowd essentially heals you.\n\nConclusion:\nCastle Crashers is still the go-to game in this genre, at least on the pc and until we get a remake of the glorious Alien Hominid. If you're a rabid beat'em up fan looking for the next fix I would suggest buying this game when you find it on sale.

Yeah, yeah everyone talks about that game but it's a damn good one that's why. Anyway...\n\nI started playing the game with a mate, we grabbed the same foolish mindless goon and beat him into the sky. It was one of the most rewarding things I've done in co-op in a long time. It actually felt like co-op had a good purpose. It changed combat and that's not even all of it.\n\nBy far the best part of the entertainment is playing catch with an enemy with a friend. We would counter-n-grab an enemy and toss him back and forth to each other in order to see how long we could keep it going. Easy with 1 enemy, amazing with multiple!\n\nI wish the game was voice acted as the text is very, very witty and interesting. The issue being there is lots going on in the background worth watching and it can be missed with the text reads. I also feel that if it had voicing to it, it would just add to the value of it.\n\nThere are some things that annoyed me. When you get a new move, it doesn't tell you what it is or the button prompts. I have to "look it up" or randomly get it to work in-game. I also didn't like having to back out of the co-op menu just to use the other menu items.\n\nAnother downside is that it's 2 player only. While that does perfectly allow for both players to be seen at all times and easily control the situation... I do wonder what it would be like to have 3 players or even 4.\n\nStill, it was an entertaining game I hope to finish 100% one day. If there is ever a Foul Play two... I'd buy a co-op pack instantly. I'd mess about in another one of these no problem.\n\n"Always expect... Foul Play".","May 30, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went into it basically blind not knowing what to expect but this game is really unique. For the most part is a standard beat ‘em up brawler but it has a few interesting twists. The premise of the game is that you’re preforming a show and you need to keep the crowd interested by keeping long strings of combos and getting a high score. This gives the game a large focus on points rather than a health bar. Speaking of health bars, this game doesn’t have one. The combo system is a perfect replacement for a health bar because it makes breaking your combo feel just as bad as losing some health. The rest of the gameplay is really solid with lots of unlockable moves and even an item system. Items provide passive buffs like +3 combo on successful parry and extending the time limit before a combo is lost. The co-op in this game doesn’t feel tacked on but doesn’t add anything either though, I still think it’s more fun to play with a friend. On to the aesthetic. The game has a stereotypical British theme that is hilarious. Even the tutorials for new moves use fancy rhetoric to describe things. For example the grab tutorial “When an unseemly fellow attacks hit B whilst he is signaling his intent. Successful executions should see you grabbing the fellow he the lapels (or whatever seems most convenient dependent on social class and/or species” Really funny stuff. The in game banter between Dashforth and Scampwick is also really hilarious. The art style in the game is really beautiful. Its cartoony with vibrant colors. Everything looks like a stage prop with you being able to see people inside monster costumes and backgrounds and props roll in between scenes. It’s really charming and gives the game a theater feel. The enemies are very diverse you’ll see everything from mummies to giant crab men, all well stylized of course. I really enjoyed Foul Play it was a fresh take on a genre I’m not usually all that into. It’s a charming game with a good story and some really funny humor I recommend it. 7/10","July 31, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not because on the graphic or anything like that, but because of the gamplay comcept as well.\nThe game does not really have a life bar, rather have a thing called "Mood-o-meter". It's basically beating people up, mood-o-meter fills, do nothing during combat and/or get hit bu an enemy, loses some mood-o-meter, more mood-o-meter, more points, meaning more stars (maximum 5), lose Mood-o-meter to 0%, Game Over and must try the act again.\nI love every second of this gameplay, espically with one of my budding who we Skype call and play together (He is playing the game first time, and I am playing it for 100% completion).\nThe story mode, while simple, really does make it intresting. Sure, it might be just there for the sake of being there, but I still do like it.\nThe graphic, while cartoony, fits the gameplay and the concept, FOUL PLAY, rather easily.\nHowever, I really do enjoy this game, not because of having fun only, but having fun with friends and finding things rather enjoyable, even if it wasn't intended, Example: Lag in cutscenes.

Foul Play is a side scroller beat ’em up from Mediatonic and Devolver Digital. Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe artwork is great. The characters, the enemies, even the environments. Everything, right down to the smallest detail, was wonderfully well done.\n\nThe game has a campaign with a decent length. It’s not too long and it’s not too short.\n\nThere is a pretty sizable amount of enemy variety. This is always a good thing as punching the same thing in the face repeatedly can grow monotonous. Having a variety of things to punch in the face repeatedly is much better. After all, variety is the spice of life (or, in this case, variety is the spice of face punching).\n\nIf you’re like me, you hate desert themed levels in games with every fiber of your being. Foul Play gets their desert level out of the way first thing. The rest of the game has much less aggravating environments.\n\nThe characters’ dialogue is quite entertaining. It’s always nice to have some comic relief amongst the thronging hordes of enemies.\n\nThe block feature is, easily, the best feature. Not only can you block enemy melee attacks, you can also block projectiles, and send them straight back at the fool who sent it your way. Simply amazing.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI don’t really have anything for this category. Foul Play is genuinely enjoyable.\n\nThe Meh\n\nI felt like enemies were really hard to put down, where as the player character is relatively squishy. Maybe that’s just me, but I don’t know.\n\nAs far as equipment customization goes, Foul Play doesn’t bring a whole lot to the table.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nAs I stated above, Foul Play is genuinely enjoyable. If you liked Castle Crashers or if you like games of that nature, you’ll definitely like this one. If you’ve been looking for something new, go check out FP in the Steam Store. As always, thanks for reading.","October 24, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sinister occult theme of the game is wildly inappropriate for them.  At one point, the main character chants a demonic spell and opens a portal to hell. It's like a retelling of the life of  lunatic sociopath Aleister Crowley, in cartoon beat'em up form aimed at children. Foul, indeed. The actual game play kind of reminds me of a 2D Devil May Cry. Points are scored by stringing together long combos. At one point when the ability to reverse enemy attacks and throw them is unlocked, the game can be beaten by just continuous throwing one enemy at the rest of them until they're all dead. Until then, though, the game was seriously cramping my hand. This is a hardcore button-mashing game. The combat was kind of fun once better moves were unlocked. Other games have done this type of game play much better and didn't have the terrible story to go with it.","December 27, 2014","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I picked this game up when it was on sale, but it is well worth the $15.00 full price. The best part of this game is the local multiplayer; I played this with my brother all morning. The combat doesn't take too much getting used too, but there is still a layer of depth when it comes to getting high combos. There are lots of chellenges that are keeping my brother and I engaged in the game. On a different note, there is actually a decnt story, filled with quirky brittish humor that pushes this game over the top.\n\n10 Top hats/10\n\nThe Queen of England would be proud","May 8","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not very long unless you're maxing out on stars or trying to beat all the challenges. Probably took us 3.5 hours to beat.  Definitely worth it at a sale price.","May 8","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
