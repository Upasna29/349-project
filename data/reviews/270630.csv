Then the credits started rolling. Look up 'disappointing' in the dictionary and it probably shows the title of this game.\nAnd it was pretty good actually. Possessing objects and interacting with them is fun. Especially if you can scare a bunch of people at the same time. The animations and designs are just excellent, by the way.\nAnd sure, the controls for possessing objects could've been much better (a mouse would've worked better, or a 'snap-to' system), and the UI could've been more intuitive but the game was fun for as long as it lasted.\nStill, some extra levels couldn't have hurt the game, they could've even improved it a bit.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","June 9, 2014","true","1.7"," 98 of 120 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","98","120","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/backyoudirtyape/recommended/270630/","backyoudirtyape","Bulbasaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/backyoudirtyape/","235 products in account","Haunt the House: Terrortown  is a charming side-scrolling game, in which you play as a mischievous little ghost. When the night falls, you float from your home in an old clocktower and start wandering around the town, scaring people to death. You can possess objects and interact with them, making townfolks running away terrified.\nThe game has colorful and cartoony graphics that really stand out. Each playable ghost has its own style and signature howling.\nThe soundtrack is fitting and catchy, I really love the North Pole theme.\nThe game includes achievements, and some of them are actually kind of challenging: after many attempts, I still miss a couple of them (those people just won't jump from the window!).\n\nI fell in love with this game at first sight and just bought it without thinking about it twice. It was during its launch week, around a year ago. The game was pretty short back then (there was only the Terror Town level) yet it was so cute I didn't regret my impulse purchase. During the past months the developers have added a tutorial and three more levels for free (Mansion House, Ghost Train and North Pole) including new achievements and new cute ghosts aswell (by the way, the stuck-out tongue ghost is totally my favorite). I'm impressed by the great work they did.\nAs a huge indie game supporter I'm really glad when I find cute little gems like Haunt the House, so I totally recommend this game even at its full price (but it has been on sale during the year on several occasions, so you can actually get it at a lower price).","November 30, 2015","true","10.4"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","37","38","2","0"

Very impressed that everything has its own animation and can be interacted with. Being a ghost and scaring people out is a creative concept and leads to a lot of laughs. There is always something new to discover. The art style is full of love and character.\n\nCONS: The game itself is pretty short. Achievements are finicky, some are simply not working, or have to be jarred by messing with the menu options. AI can act a little wonky, especially if you've been messing with them for a long time, (as you would when trying to get certain achievements.) Not much of a challenge, otherwise.\n\nOVERALL: An extremely cute, family-friendly game that is a safe bet gift-wise around Halloween especially.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsp21/recommended/270630/","dsp21","[J7] Dsp21","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsp21/","350 products in account","A very casual and really unknown game this is. I stumbled upon it on the Halloween Sale and it looked like it could be fun. There's little to no story, and that's good when looking at a simple game like this. In Haunt the House: Terrortown you play as ghosts who possess objects in order to scare people. Your objective is to empty the buildings, by making people leave, or actually making them jump out the windows. You have a meter which indicates the atmosphere of the situation and it goes up by scaring people. While it is going up, you unlock more actions (up to 3) in each object to cause a bigger scare and actually make everyone run for their lives!\n\nSee? Simple as that, but the overall look of the game makes it so appealing for me because of how contradicting it is. Contradicting because you have this really cute ghost, who basically wants to scare everyone away :D\n\nThe game lasts a mere 5 hours, maybe 7-8 for completionists, but rather than that it's a bit short. It seems that new levels are added once in a while though, and that's great. For 5 euro, it's definitely worth a buy if you're in doubt to get it, the casual and cute-looking "horror" game definitely deserves a bit more fame, hence my spooky review! 7/10","February 1","true","8.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/270630/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Haunt the House: Terrortown is in essence a game about playing the man behind the haunted house curtain. As a lonely ghost (or so I would assume, given the story centers around reclaiming the souls of others so as to collect a band of ghost friends...or something like that) it's your job to float around and posses objects to scare the living daylights out of party goers until they either abandon ship (sometimes literally) or out of stubbornness end up dead at your ghostly hands.\n\nThe problem I have with HtH is that there really isn't enough - it - here. It's mechanics are incredibly shallow and inconsistent, largely boiling down to spamming random scares until the person you are scaring finally gets the idea and fleas the scene, which doesn't really give you much of anything to work with. It never feels like you have any real control over anything, as people will run any which way they want often irregardless of how scared they are or where the source of their terror is. It makes actually getting anyone out of the house (or wherever you might happen to be) rather tedious and uninteresting, like you're shooing flies with a newspaper, occasionally lucking out and hitting one.\n\nI guess it's somewhat a blessing then that the game is completable in under 30 minutes, as any longer and I'd likely have dropped it out of boredom, but that then falls back into the issue of there not being much of anything here. It feels like a free game fancied up into something that might resemble a fuller experience, which is pretty much exactly what Terrortown is: a slightly larger version of the original Haunt the House flash game, which more than likely lasts as long as you would want to spend with the game, and is far easier to recommend being that it's still freely available.","October 3, 2014","false","0.9"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","40","64","0","3"

Back then, I was charmed by the creativity that was shown with the concept, one I had not encountered previously, and as such it made the game stand out. Years later, I found it on steam, and played it again, hesitant to see if it stood the test of time. I was pleased however to discover that it more than stands up against it, in fact it shoos it away.\n\nPros:\n- Fun, easy gameplay\n- Cute soundtrack and noises\n- Scaring the ♥♥♥♥♥ out of people with a teddy bear you haunted\n\nCons:\nThe only downside that comes to mind is the fact that the game is much more suited towards left handed players than right. Traditionally, games use the wsad key map for movement, and leave the directional keys alone. As such it's almost an industry standard. However this game uses the wsad keys for interaction purposes, and the directional keys are used for movement.\n\nAside from that, its a charming game that's worth the purchase!","January 5","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I saw this on sale and really just couldn't resist. It has the same flaws as the flash game does when it comes to trying to get the "Spice of Life" achievement (which entails using every spook action on every item). In both versions of the game I really wish there was some tracker just to let you know what you still have left, even if it was a simple counter saying "x actions left." I swear I went through every room in all four buildings (and the holiday expantion) and did every action on every item, but I guess I must have missed something somewhere... Doesn't take away any of the fun away from the core game though.\n\nIt is also a very short game, running really about an hour at most, though trying to get the achievements can certainly push that a little bit further. But if you're looking for a cute little Halloween themed game to pass a little time, I totally recommend playing the game.\n","June 7, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a fun, if short game. You float around as a ghost and posess diffrent items to scare people, and depending on how spooky the house is at the moment, you can do diffrent things. Some of the spooky actions you can do are actually a little creepy (like the spector strapped to a gurny) while others are silly (like making the dino moonwalk). It's a really fun game.\n\nBut it is VERY short.\n\nI wish it was at least a little longer (it's only 4 levels plus one DLC Christmas themed level), or that, at least, the various ghosts saved between playthroughs so I didn't have to unlock my faves each time. However, it being so short does make it something I can play for a half hour to a hour and be done with it, without worrying about being pulled into a long thing. I'll play it for a little bit while waiting for, say, stuff to be done cooking becasue it's pretty fun way to kill some time.\n\nI'm not sure if I can fully reccomend the game for full price, but I got it on sale for half price and feel that was a fair price for it.","June 22, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it is true the main map can be completed in under an hour, people that do that miss out on the humor and the strategy of the game.  Besides, not every game has to be some 40-50 hour epic.  For me, this game is perfect for those times when I don't have a lot of time to play and want something fun I can complete in one sitting.\n\nTerrortown is quite simply a cute little game that features a lonely little ghost searching for what was lost.  It's also one of those rare games that the whole family can play and laugh at.  The developers have also added extra levels at no charge (the new train level is a blast), and continue to support the game in an effort to make it better than before.

You play as a ghost who needs to scare people out of various places by possessing objects with your soul and performing various actions. If you want to get sort of a taste of what this game is like, you can play "Haunt the House" on a flash gaming site like Armor Games. This has about five times the content, with the christmas update from the developers.

Even if you take your time and fool around, you're going to be done in less than an hour.\n\nThat being said, there's definitely replay value in trying to clear achievements, figure out the "secret goal" they hint at in the description, and improve your score. You can try playing with all the different spooks. The art and music are really cute and engaging, too.\n\nThe game definitely has a sense of humor. In the museum, for example, when your spook level is maxed, try posessing the "Eskimo" statue and then choose "Bend." I laughed.\n\nAll in all, it's short but I still feel it's great value for $4.99 and I heartily recommend!","July 3, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole concept is interesting. For once you're not hunting ghosts or running away from 'em, you ARE the ghost and you're out to scare the hell out of everyone. Very nice game in general.\n\nThe major downside has got to be the content. There's like 3 places (if not mistaken) where you can have fun before the game ends. Took me about 30 minutes to finish it on the first ghost (yeah you unlock more later on). If this game has more content it would be a really great game. Perhaps with some variations instead of pulling the same routine on more different places. Challenge mode and story perhaps.\n\nSo I'm conflicted, to recommend or not to recommend. I'm going to go for yes. This game deserve to be known (although pewdiepie covered it I'm pretty sure he got the message through).

I generally bounce between casual puzzle, indie, and dark horror games so I figured this would be a great all-in-one package for that. The art and animation are absolutely beautiful. The gameplay is easygoing and fun, though I'll admit the "button-mashing" feel  gets a little old by the third or fourth level. Honestly since the controls are so simple and the death elements are fairly tame and comical, I'd say this game would be excellently challenging for children around ten or so (at parents' discretion, of course).\nYes, it's super short. Like everyone else I'd love for the game to be longer, or updated with more levels, but even for the price it's a really fun and high quality game.

The whole concept is interesting. For once you're not hunting ghosts or running away from 'em, you ARE the ghost and you're out to scare the hell out of everyone. Very nice game in general.\n\nThe major downside has got to be the content. There's like 3 places (if not mistaken) where you can have fun before the game ends. Took me about 30 minutes to finish it on the first ghost (yeah you unlock more later on). If this game has more content it would be a really great game. Perhaps with some variations instead of pulling the same routine on more different places. Challenge mode and story perhaps.\n\nSo I'm conflicted, to recommend or not to recommend. I'm going to go for yes. This game deserve to be known (although pewdiepie covered it I'm pretty sure he got the message through).

Afterwards, you can play as their ghosts and listen to their various undead calls (for example, the chef has an evil French laugh).\n\nHowever, I do have a problem with the game. It's a small one, but it seems that the AI of the people intruding your home becomes worse when there's less of them. For example, on one of the levels I cleared out a majority of the people, with only two left. These two people took 15 minutes to get rid of, despite the fact that they screamed for most of the time.\n\nBut like I said, it's a small problem that I might be subconciously exaggerating and is definitely worth the price.","December 31, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not that it isn't cute or enjoyable, but there's not enough content to justify the price tag, even at $4.99. There's supposed replay value, but why would you go through the trouble of choosing the other ghosts when there's literally no difference between them? They don't have any different powers, so you're better off just sticking with the default ghost and playing through it once.\n\nTo me, there wasn't enough innovation here. The "hundreds of objects with different powers" get old fast, and not all objects are worth possessing. For instance, the little bottles only spray into the air and don't really scare anybody at all, so if a good portion of your objects don't do much, why would we bother seeking them out? Why not just go for the big ticket items? I could understand if they had interesting animations, but the little objects I'm talking about flat-out don't. I didn't see the big fuss there, and by the end of your first playthrough, it's likely you've possessed them all anyway.\n\nThis game might be good for kids who like repetition and don't mind replaying the exact same thing over and over again, but it could have been great for both kids and adults, and that's what bothers me most. It feels like we got 5% of a game for $5. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","July 11, 2014","false","4.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

They added the classic Mansion (not with all original audio) and Ghost Train which helps even out the proportion of the cost and feel longer to play.\n\nOnly downside I can give is that some of the achievements (posses every object in level, use every spook in level; both in one playthrough) can be rather tedious while a few are challenging (10 jumpers, no jumpers) and require multiple replay attempts (which is what the game was ment for).","November 16, 2015","true","14.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, simplistic mechanics and the brevity of this game make it hard to recommend.

It can be a little frustrating at times because it is not clear how you can scare the remaining individuals out of the house. It's a game for little kids.

You'll finish the game in about half an hour and if the mechanisms of the game don't charm you you'll be tired of it before that.\nA lot of work has been but in the game, each object has its own effects and all, but it's not really enough to make you want to try them all. There are different ghosts you can unlock but they don't do anything different apart from slightly changing the sound you make when pressing S.\nThe controls are kind of unfinished too, mostly I expected controller or mouse support but there wasn't any. It's all done with the keyboard and in a kind of awkward way (you use S to confirm in the menus instead of Enter or space, and D to come back instead of escape).\n\nIf you want some bit of fun I recommend it but only if it doesn't bother you to put 5€ in it.

Luckily, the price is appropriate for its length It does have a certain degree of replayability, even if the gameplay is repetitive and unimaginative. It feels like it only needs a little more time spent on it, and it could truly have been a great game.","November 9, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a large variety of items to posess with unique animations, and it's fun seeing what they do, although the super basic controls make the gameplay very repetitive.\n\nThis game was probably developed with a mobile platform (iphone, etc) in mind. It only took me about 40 minutes to beat the game, so the $5 price seems a bit steep. Luckily I got it as part of a humble bundle. Although it is beautifly animated and has nice music and sound effects You are probably not going to want to pay more than a dollar or two for this game unless it's for your small children who will probably get a lot more play time out of it than I did.","October 28, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's short, I played through it in about thirty minutes, but I found that to be a good length for this sort of game where mostly you just move around and presses buttons to scare people. It didn't drag out so you'd get bored and there was much lovely details in the things you could do in each map. I will not say anything on price as I bought it in a bundle and got it for a very low sum. It is, as said very short so you might want to consider waiting for a sale if you're only going to play through it once.\n\nThe game mechanics are very easy to grasp and it's easy to get started, no long outstreched interactive tutorials. You start the game and within a minute or two and you're off to scare the public into never leaving their house again and possibly killing a few sivilians in the prosses.\n\nThe graphics are nice and I personaly love how they made the ghost. There are many lovely details in how you may scare people, and as the people in the building becomes more scared you get new things to do while posessing an object. The soundtrack is fun yet not overwhelming and drifts nicely into the bacground as you play.\n\nI will warn you that to properly enjoy this game you should have a bit of morbid humor and find joy in spamming buttons. I loved it and will probably play through it again to see if I can beat my previous score.","October 28, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you love indie games, and prefer substance over quantity I highly recommend this game!\n\n7/10\n\nTicklepants","June 27, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cute! Cute! :3\nMajority of the games you are collecting a number of ghosts while emptying out the citizens in the town. But its all better by the colorful art styles and the entertainment put in this. As a ghost, you have a variety of objects to possess which makes it all fun, the more you interact with the more fun it gets.

The music and visuals are totally appropriate for the tone and subject matter.  And the idea of being a ghost to scare people out of *wherever* it is you happen to be is fun.  Each object has its own feel, and they did a decent job about not repeating object animations too much.\n\nThe controls are sufficient for the game -- though even on a game pad they still feel a little sluggish.  That's fine since you don't really need pinpoint precision to get your scare on.  I'd still recommend against playing on a keyboard.\n\nThe gameplay, itself, is incredibly shallow, which is sort of acceptable for about as long as it takes to see each possible scare each item can provide.  The major issue is that you'll have seen each and every scare, on each of the maps, long before you run out of people to scare away.  It becomes an exercise in tedium as you rinse and repeat the same (now) tired scares to people because there appears to be little rhyme or reason as to how long any person takes before they either toss themselves out of a window or finally run out of the map.  Achievements aren't tacked on, but do appear to require more than one playthrough if one is looking for a 100% completion -- and the game just doesn't have enough depth to be worth a second playthrough.\n\nA special nod, here, to the frequency of terrified people who constantly run past the exit rather than leaving the map is in order.  By about the halfway point, their tendency to stay -- despite all the freakish stuff happening around and to them -- simultaneously felt like an artifical extension and also served to break what little immersion there was and drag me out of the game through sheer annoyance.\n\nI'm not sure I can even recommend it for children.  While there's nothing really objectionable here (there's no blood, even with the small number of people who are required to suffer fatal "accidents" or the people whom you might drive to auto-defenestration), the gameplay just becomes shallow and repetitive too quickly and there's little-to-no replay value that might allow me to otherwise justify the purchase.\n\nI would only recommend it as part of a larger bundle, which is how I got it.","April 18, 2015","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're a ghost trying to scare off the living. You manipulate things in the environment to freak people out until they run away screaming. Many of the classic basic horror movie props are involved (mysteriously swinging light fixtures!) but there are also surprises and enjoyably unexpected results.\n\nThe graphics are cute and creepy in a way that's distinctly different from nearly every other cute and creepy game. The stylized design reminds me of antique marionettes from old childrens' books - cute enough to make the horrible aspects less disturbing, but weird enough to remind you that you're not playing a goofy kids' cartoon. I enjoyed making little kids scream and cry WAY too much.\n\nUnfortunately, the idea is so good that you can't help wishing they'd taken it farther. I'm reminded of Jaws - another genius "why aren't there more games like this?" idea that ended up as a good but not great game. I'm also thinking of Spelunky, and how all the different elements sometimes come together to produce hilarious/catastrophic occurences. If Haunt the House had more potental for those kinds of "perfect storm" random interactions, you could play it forever and see something different each time.\n\nSo it takes a short time to see and do all of HtH. Even with the additional levels, I pretty much finished everything but the completist acheivements in a couple of casual hours. On one hand, there's nothing wrong with that - it's a great casual game that isn't loaded down with unecessary filler. I'd much rather have devs do a small game perfectly than try and fail to make it bigger than it needs to be. On the other hand, I was left wanting more... that awesome idea just begs for more.\n\nSo I liked Haunt the House, it's one of those great little games that I know I'll pick up and play every once in a while. But a bigger Haunt the House - with more complex and unpredictable environmental interactions - could easily be one of my favorite games ever.

You're a ghost trying to scare off the living. You manipulate things in the environment to freak people out until they run away screaming. Many of the classic basic horror movie props are involved (mysteriously swinging light fixtures!) but there are also surprises and enjoyably unexpected results.\n\nThe graphics are cute and creepy in a way that's distinctly different from nearly every other cute and creepy game. The stylized design reminds me of antique marionettes from old childrens' books - cute enough to make the horrible aspects less disturbing, but weird enough to remind you that you're not playing a goofy kids' cartoon. I enjoyed making little kids scream and cry WAY too much.\n\nUnfortunately, the idea is so good that you can't help wishing they'd taken it farther. I'm reminded of Jaws - another genius "why aren't there more games like this?" idea that ended up as a good but not great game. I'm also thinking of Spelunky, and how all the different elements sometimes come together to produce hilarious/catastrophic occurences. If Haunt the House had more potental for those kinds of "perfect storm" random interactions, you could play it forever and see something different each time.\n\nSo it takes a short time to see and do all of HtH. Even with the additional levels, I pretty much finished everything but the completist acheivements in a couple of casual hours. On one hand, there's nothing wrong with that - it's a great casual game that isn't loaded down with unecessary filler. I'd much rather have devs do a small game perfectly than try and fail to make it bigger than it needs to be. On the other hand, I was left wanting more... that awesome idea just begs for more.\n\nSo I liked Haunt the House, it's one of those great little games that I know I'll pick up and play every once in a while. But a bigger Haunt the House - with more complex and unpredictable environmental interactions - could easily be one of my favorite games ever.

They nailed the atmosphere with the art and music direction. It gives the feel of a haunted house you'd visit at the fair.\n\nThe controls could still use an option to remap keys since the current keyboard layout felt awkward to me... but there is indeed a good compromise available: using a controller like someone recommended in the comments.
