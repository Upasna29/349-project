"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/35720/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","Imagine a gorgeous, detailed graphical story. A story of goblins, dragons, wonderful lands and gorgeous colour. Imagine a story made of heroes undertaking an epic quest to protect the kingdom from a terrible menace and journeying far and wide. Now imagine that story being brought to life, animated, and you being in control of the heroes. That's Trine 2.\n\nThe artwork is jaw dropping, not because of technical wizardry or the number of polygons it pushes on screen, this isn't a game that will murder your graphics card, but instead the artistry comes from attention to detail. The watercolour feel of the skies, the glorious use of colours and sweeping vistas to sell the graphical novel element, and the heroes and villains, brought to being in near hand drawn detail. Behind this rests a solid, if somewhat generic feeling soundtrack, but a narrator who really sells the atmosphere, combined with solid voice acting for each of the protagonists (and indeed, the antagonists), it helps immerse you in the game and the story as a whole.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are a refinement and improvement over the original Trine, with you switching between heroes on the fly and using their respective strengths to fight and puzzle your way through various environments, however this time it feels much slicker, and much more confident in what it does, there's many points where you'll be scratching your head, only to have the light flick on with a genuine "AH HA!" moment. It's never punishingly difficult, but it's pleasantly challenging. The lack of gore and fantasy nature of the game makes it very family friendly too, older children will get a kick out of the fantasy setting, and adults will no doubt get many of the references. In this it resembles a Pixar film, a comparison I make very affectionately.\n\nDo please check this game out, it deserves your time and attention.","November 25, 2013","true","23.0"," 333 of 358 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","333","358","0","3"

It's like you put your headphones on, ignore everything around you and you're in a new, amazing world, full of things to discover with a facinating nature. The best part about the game is the enviroment, its beyond all other games. The details and animations are awesome. It puts you in the mood for epic battles and doing puzzles like never before. The atmosphere is a drug itself.\n\nDoes have funny achievments actually worth to spend time getting, they're both fun and challenging. You can upgrade your heroes to do even more neat stuff. Also got multiplayer, cooperactive mode so you can play it with your beloved friends. I must say that this game is catchy, not addictive in a bad way, but once you get the hand of it, you really wanna play it alot.\n\nBIG shoutout to the music, it fits the game perfectly.\n\nWorth the money NO doubt.

Just look at the trailer and screenshots! It is exactly as pretty as the actual game itself.\n\nIt is a puzzle platformer with a little bit of action in it. There are a lot of ways to tackle all the puzzles, and a lot of different approach to advance the levels.\n\nThe story itself is quite interesting. The puzzles are interesting and not too overwhelming. The boss fights pose some challenge but not impossible if you get to know how to fight (or just checkpoint-abuse).\n\nThe flexible difficulty settings make this game suitable for different type of player. After you defeat one playthru, you can replay all the stages from the start again with your already-unlocked skills to get past the stages in different way, and to collect the experience vials whereby you cannot collect in your first playthru.\n\nMultiplayer is best played with friends that has almost the same progress to avoid spoilers and trolling.\n\nThe achievements added quite a bit of challenge and replayability if you're going for 100% completion.\n\nMy score: 10/10","July 21, 2014","true","39.9"," 106 of 114 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","106","114","0","0"

You take control of one of three heroes, a wizard, thief and knight, whilst being able to character swap at any time even mid jump.  It's this fluid change from styles in the middle of battle or solving a puzzle that adds another dimension to what could turn into fairly simplistic gameplay. There are times when it doesn't work such as having your thief or knight die and only being left with a wizard who is rather useless in a fight. However there are enough character reviving checkpoints that it doesn't become too much of an annoying handicap.\n\nDespite being a fairly traditional side scrolling platform game it's a truly beautifully made game, in artistic terms it's near perfect. It's this beauty coupled with the fun physics puzzles and quick action that keeps you playing as the plot is non-existent and the voice acting is weak.\n\nThe DLC adds a few new environments such as dusty desert and the inside of a giant worm and whilst every bit as stunning as the main game by this stage Trine 2 has overstayed it's welcome and it's a fairly boring slog through the last seven extra levels. The DLC doesn't add any real new mechanics or gameplay, it’s just more of the same.\n\nSo whilst trine 2 doesn't offer much in the way of innovative gameplay or a great story it's beauty has to be seen.","November 5, 2013","true","28.5"," 73 of 82 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","73","82","0","2"

The game is beatiful, the artwork the colors and design.\nThe way you have to go is linear (to the right),  but to make it there you will find a lot of puzzles and obstacles.\nYou control 3 characters, each one with different talents to learn, and abilities to use. you will need them 3 to get through the puzzles the game presents.\nThe game is not short, it will take you a good time to get to the end. And even if you do, you will not have unlocked all your abilities. After you finish it you will most likely try to complete it on the hard difficulty, and get all the collectibles.\nAfter you find every single collectible item, you will be able to play the locked levels.\nThe most fun I had with the game is playing with my brothers. The online play on this game is amazing, as you will find the three characters at the same time, interacting with each other.\n\nPros: Beautiful game amazing graphics, tricky puzzles that don't get repetitive, as they are always different. Great online play. I recommend it, as it's a very enjoyable experience.\nCons: Sometimes getting through the game to find collectibles can be a pain. The game is not perfect, there are ways to 'cheat' and skip puzzles, specially on multiplayer mode.

The problem is that the gameplay is too simple and too recognizable. Puzzles are basically you levitating stuff to get to shiny balls in the air and if you are aiming for a complete playthrough that is what you are going to be doing the majority of the time, and after a while it gets to be a chore. The combat and platforming works well enough but is hardly challenging and even boring at times. If you have played Trine 1, then there's nothing new in Trine 2 except the visually pleasing looks. If you expect a beautiful standard platformer you wont be disappointed. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470964388 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=475063118 Unlocked all achievements!","July 25, 2015","true","39.9"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","41","48","4","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bVork/recommended/35720/","bVork","bVork","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bVork/","1310 products in account","Trine 2 is a wonderful physics-based platformer. The levels are all well-designed and afford just the right amount of leeway to let the player figure out creative solutions to obstacles. All three heroes that the player (or players - the game has online co-op that works great) controls have unique abilities that can be combined in clever ways to traverse the environments. Sometimes it feels like you can abuse the physics engine to bypass things, but I'm pretty sure most of it is intentional, as the inverse that is often present in physics-based platformers just isn't there: you'll never feel like you came up with a solution that should have worked but got cheated because the physics went wonky. It's just the right blend of physics sandbox and puzzle game.\n\nThe only real issue is the combat. It's super simple, and so long as your warrior is alive, absolutely trivial. It's perhaps best to treat enemies as just another physics toy. Fighting them hand-to-hand quickly becomes dull, but you can pick up enemies as the wizard and see how they're affected by the environment. Thankfully, it's a small enough part of the game that I don't think anyone should be dissuaded by my complaints, especially since respawning at a checkpoint doesn't reset enemies, so you never ever have to go through a fight again.\n\nOn the presentation side, Trine 2 is absolutely flawless. The supersaturated graphics are utterly gorgeous. Every single frame of this game would make an excellent wallpaper. It simply is that beautiful. The audio is perfect, with great music and excellent voice work. And the story is simple but very well written and charming. Everything comes together to look, feel, and sound like a fairy tale.","January 6, 2014","true","13.7"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","34","37","0","0"

The first had been great, the 2nd manages to be better in every aspect, the addition of the coop for example is a resource that matches perfectly with the game.\n\nThe gameplay remains based on intelligent puzzles, but the coop gave another dynamic to the game, there was the addition of new skills to characters, as well as a greater number of enemies, a factor that was limited in the first. Graphically the game is amazing, the art work is one of the finest I've seen, the sound part is also amazing, soundtrack, effects, voice acting. The plot is simple but effective. The Goblin Menace DLC is a good extension to the game and a very good way to prolong the fun, features beautiful and varied scenarios, although it has some minor glitches, but doesn't affect the gameplay at all.\n\nI highly recommend it, especially in coop!\n\n9/10","June 29, 2014","true","17.6"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","2"

Also, you have some battle to go through (against goblins mostly and other kind of monster as well as boss). And to do all that you are in control of 3 different characters in 1: a mage, a thief and a warrior.\nLet me explain more exactly what is all about : in fact, you manage one character at the time but you always have the choice to change during the game as each one have his own strength and weakness. So to pass some of the puzzle you have to use one specific character... but you can make it more challenging and try to only use one character during the whole episode.\n\nThe story itself is not the most original even if it is funny, but is quite interesting to follow and is well tell.\n\nI have not yet try the multiplayer part, but for what I have seen in some videos, you play with  one or two partners one of the hero and so you can help each other... well that could help to pass some puzzle faster and have great fun as well ;o)\n\nSo to make it simple, is for me one of the best platform game of this year (2014)! I don't see the time going and have some difficulty to stop playing. Luckily, there are always a pause between the different chapter (and a quite funny one).\n\n-----------------------------\n\nUn très beau et excellent jeu de plateforme : graphismes et animations magnifiques, très belle musique et les casse-têtes peuvent être plutôt exigeant (pas tout le temps car certains sont plus faciles que d’autres). Aussi vous avez quelques combats à faire (contre des gobelins majoritairement et d’autres types de monstres ainsi que des boss). Et pour faire tout cela vous allez devoir contrôler 3 personnages différents en 1 : un mage, une voleuse et un guerrier.\nLaisser-moi vous expliquer exactement ce qu’il en est : en fait vous allez contrôler un personnage à la fois mais vous aurez toujours le choix de changer durant le jeu car chacun a ses forces et ses faiblesses. Donc pour passer certains casse-têtes vous devez utiliser un des héros… mais vous pouvez vous donner plus de défi en gardant le même personnage durant tout l’épisode.\n\nL’histoire en elle-même n’est pas la plus originale même si il y a pas mal d’humour elle reste intéressante à suivre et elle est bien contée.\n\nJe n’ai pas encore essayer la partie multijoueur, mais pour ce que j’en ai vu à travers plusieurs vidéos, vous jouer avec un ou deux autres joueurs un des héros et ainsi vous pouvez vous aider… en somme cela peut permettre de faire certains passages plus rapidement et pas mal s’amuser ;o)\n\nDonc pour faire simple, c’est pour moi un des meilleurs jeux de plateforme de cette année (2014) ! Je n’ai pas vu le temps passer et j’ai eu du mal à m’arrêter. Heureusement qu’il y a une pause entre les différents chapitres (et vraiment drôle avec ça).","April 22, 2015","true","19.0"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","26","30","2","0"

Imagine being able to leverage your partner for crazy combos, reinterpret all the puzzles in new and delightfully clever ways, and, best of all?\n'Accidentally' drop your partner into lava, drop a box on their head, or smash the platform they're floating on.\nHey, it's what friends are for.\n\n*Co-op is easy to set up, has a decent selection of hosting options, and plays very smoothly.\n\n*Good variety of stages\nStages range from small dungeon corridors, to open city or dungeon expanses, to vertical shafts, to underwater caverns, to skyscapes and more. I never found myself dissatisfied with stage progression.\n\n*Good variety of puzzles\n\n*Good variety of unlocks\n\n*Good, consistant blend of action, combat, puzzling, platforming.\n\n*Very stable (very few bugs and no major bugs)\n\n\nNEUTRAL\n\n*Each stage tends to emphasize the same enemies. Would have been nice if there was more variety and sub-bosses.\n\n*The expansion abilities offer tons of fun new dynamics- but can significantly reduce game difficulty.\n\n*While the stages and enemies have flair and creativity, there's no story whatsoever to speak of. Generally not something that platformer players really worry about but since this is also RPG, I'm going to make a note that's a tag based only in being able to find items to gear your characters up with, and being able to unlock/upgrade abilities.\n\n*Workshop support, but last time I checked, no legitimately decent offerings. The few that look good, tend to have a lot of bugs, like falling into or through terrain.\n\n*The characters are a bit dim. The humor here is definitely subjective, though thankfully, never offensive or intrusive [think mild 'you're so fat' and fart referencing humor].\n\n\nCONS\n\n*The expansion content feels like a clumsy afterthought. If you already own Trine 2, you really don't need to buy Complete Story unless you really want to play the main game again, and try the new expansion abilities in it.\n\n---\n\nThis game is one of my absolute favorite co-op games, and if you're at all into co-op gaming, I can't recommend it enough.\nThe most 'nasty' things are spike pits, carnivorous plants, skeletons, and goblins, so it should be playable with relatively young children, as the game doesn't include gore, frights, or offensive humor.\n\n4.5/5\n\n\nBonus:\nIf you like Trine 2, you may also want to give Ibb & Obb a look- it's a pure puzzle-physics platformer, so a different vibe, but it has good puzzling co-op (and is far more of a challenge for the brain than Trine 2). Do however note that there's a bug that, if not yet fixed, makes the last level unable to be completed for a small number of players.","November 24, 2015","true","16.7"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","28","37","4","0"

It is a really addictive game, with an innovative approach to the platformer genre.\n\nThe main point that makes Trine 2 so enjoyable is that it requires thought to play: you have to solve puzzle after puzzle in each screen, and eventually fight some enemies and bosses. There are plenty of bosses.\n\nAnother nice thing (for me, at least) about Trine 2 is that the difficult increases gradually, but the curve is not too steep: you get a chance to learn how things work in Trine 2's world, and how your powers work.\n\nTrine 2's characters are very well designed, and they complement each other nicely, leaving nothing to be desired.\n\nAll in all, Trine 2 deserves one of those Oscars for games, if there were one.\n\nThe only downside I see in Trine 2 is that some of the Steam Achievements are nearly impossible to get, but that doesn't get in the way of the game at all.\n\nI highly recommend Trine 2.","May 20, 2014","true","5.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The graphics are top notch with great lighting.  The fluidity of the animation and controls are perfect so that while some of the puzzle sections may be difficult at times they are never blamed on the slick controls.  The levels are long enough to be enjoyable and not too long where they get boring.  Each level offers a variety of landscapes and scenery, all of which are beautiful.  The storyline is forgettable, but still sets up a good reason for why you are playing the game.  The three different characters offer very different ways of playing and each offer different ways to solve the puzzles.  Think of it as an action only version of Quest for Glory where each character has a different solution to each puzzle.  The addition of the Goblin Menace, the Dwarven Carverns and now the Workshop has helped expand and continue the gameplay of this fabulous series.  The best part of this game is the multiplayer offering.  Now with online multiplayer, this game truly shines when playing with two or more players.\n\nThe price for this game, when on sale is typically under $4 for the entire complete story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AndreiEne/recommended/35720/","AndreiEne","Mister Jay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AndreiEne/","1900 products in account","The indie games market became a very good alternative for the young game developers willing to step up in their careers. And I’m not only saying this because many of the games I am talking about are truly masterpieces of their genre from any point of view. On the contrary. Fun characters, divine graphics- the starting point for an impressive gameplay. Still, I never would have thought that a sequel was going to animate my screen and I couldn’t have been more wrong about it.  Trine 2 is here, I’ve played it and, since I’m a hard-working guy, here’s a very meticulous review.\n\nSame as the first game, the three heroes, The Wiseman, The Knight and The Thief…pardon me, I meant The “Inventive woman” are united by a magical artifact called The Trine, whose goal is to protect the land from a new threat. Therefore, the inevitable goblin infestation. So, the three characters are up for a new adventure which, unlike the first game, takes a little longer time to play.\n\nIn a very bizarre way, Trine 2 makes me think of Terry Pratcher’s novels, maybe because of its strange atmosphere that I picked up by reading this author’s books. The Universe presented in this title is so subtle that you can only be overwhelmed with its complexity. Even if it is an Indie game that we are talking about, the narrative value can not be ignored since this time, the characters are better shaped by their developers, humanized I might say, from the voiceover’s point of view as well as from the action’s point of view. I will even go further and say that Trine 2 offers a very pleasant story for all ages, even if it’s a 12+ game, precisely because the narration has something to offer to everyone. Nostalgic to say at least! Still, there are some missing bricks to this wall. The key of this story is nice indeed, but the main problem is the poor narrative construction. I think everybody would have been happier if someone would have added some solid touches to this aspect. The motivations are clear, meaning that the land is full of goblins, but the story as a whole concept could have been more complex. Who knows, maybe Trine 3 will surprise me when the time comes.\n\nThe three key-elements that a player must take into consideration when starting this game are : cooperation, cleverness and physics. These elements are as important as the three main characters. Even if, on a regular basis, Trine 2 is a platformer, these elements are very necessary while dealing with a certain level. At the beginning of the game, there is a tutorial to teach you what every character can do. The Wiseman, because he is your starting point, is not the every-day Gandalf that everyone got used to. He is more of a clumsy magician for he has no idea what a fire ball really is. Still, he has his own tips and tricks, he can make objects appear from nowhere, such as boxes, or even make them levitate to get to certain locations.\n\nThe Knight, on the other hand, is the muscled genius among the three characters. Even if he’s not very bright, he’s compensating by his strength, also being the best choice when it comes to a one on one fight with your enemies. Equipped with a shield, a hammer and a sword, he’s the defensive one of the trio. Last but not least, The Thief. And no, you’re not going to break chains or sneak behind your enemies, because her abilities are more rogue-like.\nShe has a hook to reach to certain points otherwise inaccessible and an elastic loop to fight at the distance. What’s truly interesting and new is the way you switch between these characters to complete a level. The puzzles are sometimes so twisted that they really work your cleverness off! But that doesn’t mean there’s only one way to deal with a puzzle. Frozenbyte finally made it with this platformer: the experience is multidimensional, despite of its puzzle-platformer prejudices. To solve a certain puzzle, the player has at least three ways, which is pretty unexpected among the game mechanics that other developers use.\nThe characters’ control is absolutely beautiful. After pressing a key or a button if you’re playing on a controller, the task is immediately registered by your game. This is one of the most satisfying platformers I’ve played since Sonic Generations. No platformer fanatic could ever find a misstep concerning this aspect. The game control is perfect, I would say.\n\nTrine 2 is not only made of twisted puzzles, but also of battle sequences and a handful of bosses every now and then. These fights are meant to break the monotony of a certain level, full of enigmas. Still, the gameplay is so rewarding that the player can use his characters’ abilities to knock down the enemies. And because something had to be done when it came to options, each hero has a set of five abilities that can be improved using the experience points you get. What I find extremely stressful is that some of the abilities you get using this tree are only necessary for a specific level. The player has to reassign some of his points in order to finish a portion of the puzzle. I must say that this procedure is free, so you don’t have to repeat anything to get more experience afterwards.\nOne of the major gains of this game is the cooperative multi-player, online and local, a huge step from the previous game and probably one of the reasons for which we strongly recommend a bundle. Two more players can be added to one session, each one of them being able to control in an active way one of the three characters, which makes the puzzles a lot easier, as far as I’m concerned. That being said, I must admit that I found myself playing this game even for the third time, just because it’s fun to find new ways to complete a level: a very nice move coming from Frozenbyte, although Zon@ thinks they should have done this from the beginning.\n\nWe are finally getting to graphics. Did I mention this is an Indie game that comes from a small studio where are working about 20 people? Well, Trine 2 is a masterpiece of beauty. Want to hear something more spectacular that this? The game engine has been totally reconstructed. The game not only that looks divine, but its physics is very accurate. From the well animated background to the small details , nothing has been left out. And everything is the work of a very small, but talented, team. I know it sounds like I’m trying to get under their skin, but I’m telling the truth. The animations, the flow, the light and all the other elements gave me the impression that I was watching a moving painting. The colours also made a huge impression on me, one I will not easily forget.\n\nThe sound itself is quite an experience. Not only that the narrative part is well represented on script, but the voices and the entire performance of the characters are as authentic as they could be. It sounds just like a very posh movie. The soundtrack is exactly what the game needed to complete the atmosphere: the way it highlights the key points of the game makes your blood rush and your adrenaline keep pumping which turns the whole experience into a sound feast.\n\nIs Trine 2 a good game? I’ve been praising it a lot so yes, it is! It’s one of those games you have to play in order to find out what a creative genius really means. If the first game managed to get my attention, Trine 2 has upgraded to a very high standard among platformers.\n","December 4, 2013","true","4.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

There are three characters to choose from and a ton of collectables in the game.\n\nGood Points\nThe grathics look great with bright colours and amazing visuals, Each level looks diffrent from the last so you wont get bored of the looks.\n\nControls for Thrine 2 are simple and easy to remember, if you dont like using a keybored and mouse then you can use a controller since it has full controller support.\n\nTrine 2 runs very well which means almost any computer will be able to run the game. If your still not sure then you can play the demo to make sure it runs alright.\n\nThere is a bit of replay value, you can can play the game on hard mode or you can try and find all the secrets and get all of the   achievements which arnt so hard.\n\nThe dialogue and Narrators are great and fit in with the game perfectly. Some times they can moke you laugh and sometime they make you think.\n\nThere is a co-op option which is great fun with a freind which makes the experience even better. I would recommend you play Trine 2 with a freind.\n\nBeing able to choose from three diffrent characters is a great idea becasue you wont get bored of the gameplay since you can just swich to a diffrent character. Its very useful to solve puzzles.\n\nBad Points\nThe storyline is... Rubbish. Its a simple "kill the bad guys to save the world from evil" style which has been done so many times and they done nothing to spice it up. You end up not giving a damm half way though the game.\n\nI find the game to be easy, really easy. There are puzzles in every level but you end up solving them in seconds. The enemies are the same from biggining to end and since you level up, it becomes easy.\n\nThe game time is short. You can complete it in about 5 hours if you dont collect or find secrets. If you want to find the secrets and take things slowly then it will take about 7 to 8 hours.\n\nOverall\nOverall I think Trine 2 is a good game which is fun to play with freinds. But its easy to move on to diffrent games. You will most likely end up forgetting about it once you have finished the game. I would recomment Trine 2 if you want to play it with a freind and if you like good looking games. I rate Trine 2 7 out of 10.","July 24, 2015","true","25.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

And it successfully takes a big step forward from the first game in all the positive aspects.  However, not too much was changed, ensuring that the charm achieved in the first game is still prevalent. Like its forefather, Trine 2 is a light game that is easy to digest but offers gripping visuals, a mystical atmosphere, and enticing gameplay.  All of the features of the game are simple in design but intricate in execution.  The gameplay, aesthetics, and narrative all come together to create a whimsical and charming adventure.  I highly recommend this for all gamers to consider; and for fans of the genre it is a sure bet.\n\nKeeping in the tradition of the first game, the best aspects of Trine 2 are the stunning visuals and alluring atmospheric presentation of the setting. Each and every environment you explore is diverse, captivating, and charming. The ambiance really captures the mystical aura of the game perfectly. Trine 2 somehow even manages to feel even more mystical than the first, and also has one of the most immersive 2D environments in the realm of video games.\n\nThe gameplay is light and quick to grasp. Anyone should be able to dive right in, regardless of ability level. But various difficulty levels and a “hardcore” mode ensure that skilled players can still find a challenge. And whether you are playing on “easy” or “hardcore,” the gameplay is entertaining. Trine 2 also offers a decent amount of increased depth to the character development aspects of the game compared to the first installment of the franchise. There are more abilities and items; and more varied strategies are needed to solve the puzzles.\n\nAs a direct sequel, the whimsical narrative is continued from the first game and the endearing trio of characters return. Even though it is a direct sequel, though, the story is quite separated from the original. So it won’t be the end of the world if you haven’t played the first game; but you probably should because it is also fantastic.\n\nAlso the option of playing in cooperative mode adds an additional layer of possibilities, as the unique gameplay of the Trine series is a joy to experience with friends.\n\nSo like I did with the first game, I would say that Trine 2 is worthy of your consideration regardless of your standard preferences. Check it out.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","34.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Indeed, the very nature of the puzzle-solving changes quite dramatically depending on which way it's played, as many puzzles have multiple solutions, and some of these solutions require more than one character to implement them.  An almost perfectly-designed game in every regard, with sumptuous graphics and charming characters and oodles of imagination and, oh my Lord, a STORY!!!  It's all impressive enough to even bypass the prejudice I generally harbour these days towards "lighter" fantasy fare, no small feat, I can tell you.   Guess I should play the first one some time...\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","December 23, 2013","true","19.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aleonymous/recommended/35720/","aleonymous","Aleonymous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aleonymous/","90 products in account","I finished the "Complete Story" version of Trine2, which is an extended version of the regular Trine2. The extra content ("Gobling Menace DLC") is almost of the same size as the original, and it's equally nice, maybe even prettier! It took me about 13hrs to beat the whole game, and it wasn't particularly difficult, especially when you get the hang of it.\n\nGameplayIt's essentially a puzzle platform game, with a bit of action (battles) at some points. You have three characters (fighter, mage & rogue archetypes) that you switch to any time during play; each character has unique abilities that will help you get through the various puzzles you come across. Each level of the game (there are about 20 levels for the "Complete Story") has about 10-15 puzzles to complete, with save/checkpoints every one or two. Most puzzles are typically "get to the right of the screen" type, over chasms or mechanisms or beating foes, and can usually be solved in a multitude of different ways. The puzzles weren't too challenging, and some of them might be a little repetitive, i.e. you could easily go through them using "standard" techniques. There's also hints to get you going, if you're stuck on a puzzle for too long. I played with WASD keys + mouse, and there are also some more keyboard shortcuts; controls were quite simple to learn & master and I encountered no problem. No glitches or weird bugs fell to my attention, and the physics engine of the game was quite robust.\n\nTheme/Graphics/SoundThe story is all set in a fairy-tale world, which some might find a bit "underaged" (as if it's meant for children, i.e. far from "mature"), but I didn't mind that so much. The graphics are ASTOUNDING, computer-made but beautiful, and fleshed in 3D even if the game is essentially 2D. Lighting and other visual effects are particularly well done and there's some pretty animations at the end of each level. There's a great variety of "worlds" you're going to have to go through: from dark dungeons to ice-caverns, to jungles, to deserts, to floating-islands, even to the belly of a giant beast! Each is rendered in a very pretty and unique style. The three heroes (along with the narrator and some other characters) are very well voiced, all along the story and at each level. The music is nice too, although I can't state anything special about it.\n\nMy OpinionRecommended, if you like puzzle-platform games that aren't too difficulty. The graphics are also a BIG plus to this game. You might wanna pass this, if you don't like fairy-tale settings or puzzles :)","September 14, 2014","true","13.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You (as the player) can switch ingame between the wizard, the knight and the thief. All three got their own specialties and you switch characters on spot (so one disappears from screen and is replaced by the other).\n\nI think that the big success of the game is exactly that thing. In an RPG you would have to choose your character/avatar before you even start playing, but here you can create a box with the wizard, climb with the thief and fight the enemy on top of the tower with the knight. I gotta say that it isn't addictive, but it is fun.\n\nSo if you hate playing RPG's because you always regret which class you picket in the very end, than this is an nice adventure you will like. It doesn't last that long, comes at a fair price and is enjoyable.\n\n\n8/10 Okay wizard! You do the ramp in front!

Trine 2 plots a new story and setting that takes full advantage of the developer's creative prowess. This action/adventure platformer maintains its unique perspective on the classic genre and revitalizes to modern standards. Any casual gamer armed with a good controller will find themselves lost in world of Trine given its clever structure, voice-acting and detailed fantasy world. It should be noted that Trine 2 features a downloadable content pack called "Trine 2: Goblin Menace" that is played as a separate campaign.\n\nThe Goblin Menace downloadable content (DLC) is a worthwhile expansion for Trine 2 that unveils a variety of new settings with increasing difficulty. The story is rather simple, but stems directly from the sequel so the plot seems like a true continuation of the original game. Fans of the Trine series owe it to themselves to purchase and play through the Goblin Menace!","November 30, 2013","true","13.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Trine has been that exceptional, and very beautiful 2D platformer that allows you to create your own solutions to the level obstacles ahead.  With Trine 2, not only has the difficulty increased, but it now allows for online co-op where three friends can take control of each of the three characters, creating the new challenge of how to get everyone across the obstacles together.  This is a wonderful game to play with your two closest friends that can also provide quite a laugh when your friends formulate plans that look far too dumb to work and then it actually succeeds.  When you find you or your friends saying, "wow, was I supposed to do that?" you just know a game like this is truly the refresher that the 2D platformer needed, even for people who didn't originally care for the genre.

Be that snow, forest, cave, castle, desert or whatever else, they are all done so well and just look amazing.\nThe characters are pretty distinctive from one another and the story is narrated like a fairy tale, which gives the game more of a fantasy feel to it.\nThe puzzles are interesting and require team work to get through successfully, which makes the game a lot of fun. There’s enemies to kill and bosses to defeat, working together to defeat all evil and save the day!\nFrom what I did hear (which wasn’t much because of the nutters I played with) the storyline seemed pretty decent, and soon after we completed it they brought out DLC as well.

As already introduced in the original Trine you can switch on the fly between three different characters, a knight, thief and wizard (still no fireballs). It is also the basis for the great puzzle system this game offers, and the multitude of possibilities to solve each one of them.\n\nThe balance between combat and puzzle sections leave no room for boredom. And the adjustable level of difficulty gives newcomers and veterans a fair chance to prove their abilities. Furthermore the multiplayer adds some extra life to the game, as the experience is genuinely different.\n\nThe DLC in form of Goblin Menace adds a couple new levels, a new story, and several new skills which will also be available in the original game.\n\nOverall Trine 2 feels more refined than its predecessor and the beautiful artwork in combination with the creative puzzle sections are very persuasive and entertaining. In addition it offers enough content to justify itself as a worthy sequel to Trine.\n\nFun fact: Due to relatively poor sales for Trine 2 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the conversion for the expansion for these consoles was deemed not be cost effective, thus Trine 2: Goblin Menace was never released for these platforms.\n--\n\nMy rating system consists of five categories in descending order of importance:\n\n-	Atmosphere\n-	Details\n-	Puzzles\n-	Story\n-	Combat & Controls\n\nBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading:\n\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).\n--\n\nAtmosphere: A-Rank\n\nDetails: S-Rank\n\n(It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.)\n\nPuzzles: S-Rank\n\n(To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.)\n\nStory: B-Rank\n\nCombat & Controls: A-Rank [with a gamepad]\n--\n\nTo conquer all achievements of Trine 2, you will most likely spend around 40 hours.\n\nThere are several multiplayer achievements, which can be easily obtained with two people.\n\nShould you have any questions about the different achievements, please feel free to contact me.\n\nAchievement difficulty: 6 of 10\n\nCommon:\nSingleplayer [+1]\nMultiplayer [+1]\nDLC [+1]\n\nSpecial:\nTrine 2 Hard [+1]\nTrine 2 Hard II [+1]\nTrine Kaput For Good?

Simply put - it is the perfect sequel. Everything that was great about the first game (refer to my previous recommendation for details) is still great in Trine 2, if not better. Other notable changes include boss fights and the removal of the limiting "magic meter" mechanic of the original. The story this time around is also pretty neat and the same humorous banter between the three characters is on display. The game is extremely fun to play with a friend or two online, but it is definitely also worth playing solo, if that's all you can manage. In summary, Trine 2 is an all-around amazing game, and the price is right too. Highly recommended!","February 14, 2012","true","13.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I find the game to be much more enjoyable to play with two friends, but it's completely fine to play it by yourself too.\nIn Trine 2 there is three characters availible to play as, Pontius the Knight, Amadeus the Wizard and Zoya the Thief. Every character has its own attributes that is needed to complete the puzzles and continue through the levels. In singleplayer mode you can switch between all three characters when you need to, and in coop every player plays one character.\n\nIn the first game your heroes saved the kingdom from an undead invasion, after that the heroes separated and lived their own lives, until now. The Trine warps the trio to a mysterious place that they have never heard of or seen before. The three heroes slowly discover the path out of this mysterious place while someone is observing their progress through a magic mirror...\n\nThere is also a DLC called "The Goblin Menace". If you are unsure if you want to buy this game, I can totally recommend it! I've had tons of fun playing this with my friends, was it laughing at eachothers deaths and ridiculous ragdolls or trying to figure out the puzzles, finding "cheaty" ways to skip the puzzle and try to get to the next part of the level.\nThe DLC adds quite a few more levels of gameplay and an amusing storyline which was very enjoyable!\n\nI recommend this game to anyone! Especially if you have two friends to play it with. And while at it, why not get the DLC and have even more fun?","April 6, 2015","true","11.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

All the majesty of Trine is present, though there are a few changes that are definitely worth giving attention to.\n\nRead my full review (with screenshots) here: http://cheesetalks.twolofbees.com/trine2.php","February 16, 2012","true","41.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The whole premise isn't necessarily original, but the levels you go through are pretty interesting, and it is so enjoyable to plan things out with a friend as you are playing along, accomplishing the puzzles.\n\nSome of them took us a good while to accomplish - some because they were actually hard, and some because we simply missed something and would feel stupid afterwards. But that's why I liked this game so much more than the first, because I had a friend to talk to that gave a different perspective. Neither of us one-sided the game, meaning that both of us were able to give our perspectives on what we were supposed to do - it wasn't like one of us had all of the answers.\n\nFurther, both of us easily assigned ourselves roles: I was the thief, and my friend was the wizard (sorry, knight, you're not exactly that useful unless you're absolutely needed!) and we got through the game in one sitting. Playing the first game got sad because things are much more annoying to accomplish on your own in the puzzles, and I simply don't think it's as fun.\n\nSo would I recommend the game? Yes.

It is the sequel to Trine and was released on Windows, OS X, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on December 7, 2011 and for Linux on March 31, 2012. Trine 2 allows three players to play the iconic roles of a wizard, a thief, and a knight in a simultaneous cooperative mode. A Director's Cut edition was confirmed during Nintendo's conference at E3 2012, and was available via Wii U's eShop on the console's launch day in all regions except Australia and Japan.The Director's Cut edition is Frozenbyte's first self-published title on a console format, although this edition will be released by Nintendo themselves in Japan on January 2014. On October 28, 2013 it was announced via the PlayStation Blog that Trine 2: Complete Story will be coming to PlayStation 4.It was released as a launch title for the PlayStation 4 in North America and Europe. It's the first PlayStation 4 game to support stereoscopic 3D.\n\nTrine 2 is a puzzle platform video game, requiring the player to use the skills of the three characters, Amadeus the wizard, Zoya the thief, and Pontius the knight, to navigate each game level. As with the first game, the mystical "Trine" has bound the three characters together into one common entity, and thus the player controls only one character which can be switched to the other two at any time. Each of the characters has unique abilities: Amadeus can use magic to grab onto certain objects in the game world, and create boxes and planks to be used to get around; Zoya can strike at objects with her arrows, and grapple onto certain surfaces; and Pontius is strong in combat against foes, can bash apart walls, and deflect projectiles with his shield. A combination of these elements is necessary to complete each stage in the game's world.\n\nCharacters have individual life meters, and if one character's meter depletes, that character cannot be used until the next checkpoint is reached. If all three characters lose their life meter, the player must start back at the last checkpoint. Throughout the game world are special magical vials, and for every fifty of these collected, the player receives a skill point, which can be used to gain abilities through a skill tree for each character. These skill points can be used collectively for each of the three characters, and can be traded between them.\n\nTrine 2 also supports up to three players in a cooperative mode. In this mode, each player controls one of the three characters, but all must be unique; three players will be forced to play as Amadeus, Zoya, and Pontius. Two players can switch characters as long as both agree to the swap. If a character dies, the other players can revive the character at the next checkpoint. The skill tree is shared among all characters, based on the hosting player's saved game.\n\nRate: 10/10","June 23, 2015","true","6.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The game is gorgeous and runs very well, but the story is quite meh imo.\n\nStory / Setting\n\nReally wasn't the best part of the game, I'm not into these stereotypical RPG game stories. The characters and dialogues can be fun sometimes, but that's it. Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but I feel like the game doesn't even explain what the Trine is, and the backstory simply wasn't interesting. The content of the hidden chests disapointed me every time, but well, at least I got the achievements that went with it.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game really shines when you're playing with someone, online or localy like I did. It can be fun alone but cooperating with someone makes it way better, wether its for the puzzles or for the combat. The only issue can be the point of view when playing multi, its not always easy to see some areas where things can be hidden, but it might be the same in single player which I haven't tried.\n\nOverall the game is easy, a few puzzles took us a few minutes but that's it. If you really want to find everything in this game it'll be more about looking everywhere than solving hard puzzles. Some entrances can be hard to find. The fact that you can just rearange the skills of your characters made it a bit too easy as well. Same thing with the respawn system, you can die on and on and on and respawn a few meters behind, whereas the enemies keep all the damage you've done to them.\n\nSome achievements are a bit harder and were the only real challenges in this game, but all of them were fun to get.\n\n\nPerformance\n\nWonderful graphics, even for 720p mid quality. it runned at 30 fps with these setttings which was enough for me in a game like this one (no need for high response time or super smooth gameplay like in a FPS)\n\nStyle / Graphics\n\nIt was probaly the best looking game I've been able to play on my laptop. Every map or areas is full of great lightning, creatures, buildings... etc.\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nTL;PL  : Trine 2 est un platformer, et est un des meilleurs jeu coop auquel j'ai pu jouer. Le jeu est magnifique et tourne bien, même si l'histoire n'etait pas très intéressante.\n\nHistoire\n\nClairement pas le meilleur élement du jeu, ce genre d'histoire de RPG stéreotypées sont assez lourdes. Les dialogues et les personnages sont marrants parfois, mais c'est tout. Peut-être que je n'ais pas fait attention, mais je crois que le jeu n'explique même pas ce qu'est le Trine. Le contenu des coffres etait décevant à chaque fois, mais bon au moins ça permet d'obtenir des succès.\n\nGameplay\n\nIl faut vraiment jouer au jeu en multijoueur pour l'apprecier complétement, que ce soit en ligne ou localement comme j'ai fait. Ca peut etre sympa tout seul mais le fait de coopérer avec quelqu'un rends le jeu milles fois mieux, que ce soit pour les puzzles ou les combats. Le seul problème en multi est le point de vue de la camera, c'est pas toujours facile de voir certaines zones à l'ecran, où certains objets peuvent être cachés, mais c'est peut-être la même chose en un joueur.\n\nGlobalement le jeu est vraiment facile, certains puzzles nous ont pris quelques minutes mais pas plus. Pour tout trouver dans ce jeu, c'est plus une question de regarder partout que de résoudre des puzzles compliqués. Certaines entrées peuvent être vraiment difficiles à trouver. Le fait que l'on peut simplement changer les compétences que l'on a assignés aux personnages rend également le jeu un peu trop facile. Pareil avec le système de respawn, on peut mourrir autant de fois qu'on veut et réapparaitre un peu derrière, alors que les ennemis gardent tous les dégats infligés.\n\nCertains succès etaient compliqués et ont été le seul vrai challenge du jeu, mais tous les succès sont sympas à obtenir.\n\nPerformance\n\nLes graphismes sont supers beaux, meme en 720p et qualité moyenne. Le jeu tourne à 30 fps avec ces options ce qui est assez pour ce genre de jeu à mon avis (pas besoin d'un temps de réponse très rapide ou de gameplay très fluide, comme dans un FPS)\n\nStyle / Graphismes\n\nProbablement le plus beau jeu auquel j'ai pu jouer sur mon portable. Chaque map a de supers effets de lumières, et de très beaux batiments et créatures.","August 8, 2015","true","15.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","3"

So, in a sense, levelling up is being punished by making the puzzle elements of the game less challenging. The same can't be said for the combat elements since the game offers two difficulty sliders that can provide a fair challenge to any team, pulling thus the genre shift known as this-is-a-great-platformer-oh-no-it's-a-beat-em-up.\n\nPlot 5/10:\nA scarcely noteworthy plot that should have been better, considering the craftsmanship that went into this game.\n\nCharacter 3/10:\nThe heroes all suffer from caricature syndrome. The Trine is underdeveloped. The woman is what, a queen or something? The goblin king is a baddie. The other final boss likes to kidnap old ladies and suffers from asthma? I don't know.\n\nDiction 7/10:\nThough at some points it can ring false, it maintains qualities suitable to the characters.\n\nMelody 7/10:\nThe only grievance one would have with the soundtrack is repetition. You got yer battle music, yer boss music, yer exploration music, and that's 'bout it, I reckon.\n\nSpectacle 10/10:\nThis game is the absolute definition of beauty. Forget the gradual polycount increase you see in tech demos that add gameplay as an afterthought. Forget the pseudo-artistic vomit that comprises of nothing but dark silhouettes or blocky sprites that preys on the clueless hipster. Here is a very finely crafted and detailed game world that comes alive, despite only utilizing two dimensions of space.\n\nFinal verdict:\nIt's the quintessential 3-way co-op side-scrolling puzzle platformer/beat-em-up on PC.

Much like in the original Trine, you command a trio of adventurers who navigate a fantastical world in a classic rightward direction. Each of the three heroes have a distinct playstyle unto themselves: The Knight is adept at combat and can smash through heavy obstacles; the Thief can freeze enemies from a distance and use her grappling hook on certain surfaces; and the Wizard can conjure blocks and interact with the environment via telekinesis. You can switch between the three characters at any time -- and switch you will. This isn't a game where you pick a class and stick with it throughout the duration of the quest, as you'll quickly realize that each member of the fellowship is essential for completing every level. This is most apparent in the great multiplayer mode, which allows three people to roam the world together simultaneously. Gathering a pair of buddies and huddling around the television is a refreshing throwback to the days when single-system multiplayer was a norm in gaming.\n\nThe main flow of the game gets broken down into three distinct game types that cater to the abilities of each member of the trine. Combat areas play fairly simple, and can be easily completed by switching to the Knight and just slashing through your enemies. Contrary to this are the platforming segments, which grow more and more deadly as the game progresses. Even with the nimble grace of the Thief, you'll find yourself succumbing to the traps of the world on a fairly regular basis. Thankfully checkpoints are abundant, so you'll never be sent too far back. The final type of play involves using the Wizard to solve various puzzles. These challenges delve a bit deeper than remedial physics by forcing you to use levers, pulleys, and counterweights to unravel some of the more advanced scenarios. The game does a great job of divvying out those "aha!" moments before any fun-destroying frustration sets in.\n\nBy defeating enemies and collecting trinkets throughout the world, you gain experience used to level up your characters. Each member of the trinity has their own skill tree that expands upon their inherent abilities. Later on in the game, certain high level skills become necessary to progress -- such as the Wizard's ability to conjure platforms or the Knight's destructive hammer toss. I initially saw this upgrade system as a series of tactical choices worth contemplating, but soon learned that the entire element of strategy was illusory. At any given moment in the game, you can reallocate your skill points to fit the current situation. Max out your Thief to navigate a tricky platforming segment, and then immediately move her points over to the Knight when you go into battle. I understand that the developer's didn't want the player to get stuck at a certain puzzle without the means of acquiring the solution skill, but the whole thing ends up coming off as an amateur cop-out.\n\nHonestly though, seeing the game in motion does a great deal to melt away the any frozen inconsistencies in the fundamentals. I can't stress enough what a joy it is to just explore the lush and imaginative world. While the $15 price tag places it just out of that coveted "impulse buy" range, the game has enough content to warrant the purchase.

There are multiple solutions to every puzzle from swinging accross to making boxes to jump over. COmbat really is not a hidderance and mostly just there to break up the puzzles, which is not a bad thing at all. The game's art asthetics are just gorgous, the backgrounds are simply amazingly detailed, which you just have to be amazed by. There are tons of achievements to achieve if you are into that as well as many hidden objects to collect in each level for the scavenger.\nWhile not necessary a bad thing the game is more of an expansion to Trine 1, with not adding any new elements.

But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else's crime.\n\nI've finally come to realise just how great This game is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront. Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. Trine 2 is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!\n\nIf you said to Hitchcock "as if he'd keep driving" or "as if she'd do that"\n\nhe would just laugh at you and say you've missed the point. This is 100%\nmovieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you'll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone's been stabbed.\n\nIt flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.\n\nA succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann's essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.","December 29, 2013","true","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997788177/recommended/35720/","76561197997788177","Inestimate","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997788177/","252 products in account","This is coming from someone who never played (or heard of) the first Trine and played with a friend on the Medium difficulty. I’ve played it a bit in single player before doing that, and I wasn’t terribly impressed with it.\n\nTrine 2 is basically a playable fairytale; it’s not a very interesting story, but it’s set in a very charming and magical world. The playable cast are the traditional Mage-Warrior-Thief combo, but they each are quite charming in their own way (like the world of Trine itself). Amadeus (the Mage) can create boxes and planks, Pontius (the Warrior) is a great fighter and can use his shield to both fly and protect himself and his allies, and Zoya (the Thief) is, quite refreshingly, an archer with lots of nifty tricks up her sleeves. All three are rather stereotypical: Amadeus is a smart coward scared of his wife, Pontius is a gluttonous stereotypical hero more concerned with food and saving princesses and Zoya is a shifty, greedy woman. Sadly, they don’t seem to really interact all that much during the game except during moments where the player has little (if any) control. It’s a shame because the personalities clash so much that it makes for some fairly amusing dialogue.\n\nI can happily say that while this game is a sequel to Trine, it never feels like you missed anything. Sure, there are some little references to it (as far as I can tell, at least), but it’s a standalone story in its own right. Sure, it’s nothing special to begin with, but it’s refreshing to play a little fairytale instead of this big complex story with multiple plot twists. It took my friend and I about 8 hours to finish the main game (I’ll edit this when we do the DLC) and it never was too hard, though I would recommend playing on Classic and not Unlimited, as that really does force you to work together and not independently. However, I would also highly recommend playing the game with two players instead of three or one for reasons I’ll delve into later.\n\nThis is mainly a puzzle game where you have to find a way to go from point A to point B with all the tools given to you, such as boxes, pipes, fire, portals and more. However, there are a TON of hidden little nooks and crannies scattered throughout the game, and since it’s mainly EXP (because yes, there is a levelling system), it’s actually rewarding in a concrete way. There are also hidden paintings, which are basically concept art, and hidden poems, which are foreshadowing the story. Not necessary, but certainly fun to hunt down.\n\nNotice how I said this is mainly a puzzle game. There are little combat breaks in the game that seem to separate puzzles, which is a welcome addition. However, they lead to a problem within the mechanics of the game and they’re why I can’t recommend playing this with three players (on Classic). To properly explain, however, I have to address the levelling system. It’s quite simple: pick up 50 hidden doohickeys and you level up, gaining a skill point for your account that can be used for either Amadeus, Pontius or Zoya. Amadeus will be able to create more objects, Pontius mainly gains combat abilities and Zoya gains different kinds of arrows that can assist in both utility and combat. As a result, Amadeus will not be very useful during combat, while Pontius and Zoya will be very useful (especially Pontius). The problem here is not quite Amadeus: it’s Pontius.\n\nSee, the bulk of the game is puzzle-based, so Pontius can’t really do much but stand around and wait for the others to clear the way to the next battle. Furthermore, his special ability (breaking rocks and wood) becomes obsolete as soon as Zoya gains explosive arrows, which are much more flexible since a lot of the hidden EXP bottles are hidden up high. Therefore, the player stuck with Pontius (in a 3P Classic situation) would be mostly useless and Amadeus finds himself helpless during battle (he can help, but not as much as the others). As a result, I found that playing with two players, one dedicated to Amadeus and one dedicated to Zoya, led with the most satisfying game experience as we could switch to Pontius whenever needed instead of having deadweight with us. We didn’t even need to get Pontius’ skills until Zoya (for me) and Amadeus (for my friend) had all their skills unlocked.\n\nWhile the game is very, very forgiving (except, I’m guessing, on Hardcore), having lots of checkpoints that fully heal every character as often as you wish, there are still some annoyances (provided you don’t mind how forgiving the game is, which I didn’t). This mainly comes with the few ‘boss’ battles that appear throughout the game. They always take the same form: a big goblin with a massive club. Furthermore, this goblin kills anyone in a single hit and takes a fair bit to kill compared to other enemies, which is quite annoying. Also, I can’t imagine fighting the last boss in single player, though it’s a great fight where, once again, Pontius isn’t very useful.\n\nVisually, the game is actually pretty stunning, being very colorful. Lots of shadows and lighting make the game ‘pop’ and seem alive. You can clearly see everything on the screen even when it’s dark, which I feel is crucial in a puzzle game as the main challenge shouldn’t be finding the pieces, but figuring out how they fit into one another. The music is also very pretty, being very soothing most of the time and kicking up the tempo and intensity when needed. However, none of the songs really stick in your head, instead blending into an immersive soundscape.\n\nThe whole game, being a playable fairytale, has a delightful cartoony feel to it, from the character designs to the story to the sounds and visual design. While the shallow combat seems a little tacked on and only created to give Pontius a purpose, the combat scenes are so short that it shouldn’t be counted as a huge negative.\n\nI would highly recommend this game for 2P coop players and cautiously recommend it for 3P coop players and single players, as I feel the former would leave one player bored (assuming they play on Classic, as Unlimited is simply too easy as far as I’m concerned) and the latter feels like it’s missing something. The game isn’t too hard either, making it perfect for both casual and hardcore players, though it does seem more casual. Nevertheless, it’s a nice little game that’s definitely worth your time.\n\nDo note, however, that the trailer (quite sadly) shows more of the DLC than the game itself. I’ll edit this when my friend and I get through the DLC, but know that it’s like a sequel (or a part 2) to the game; Trine 2 itself has 13 chapters and the DLC adds 7, to give you an idea. Who knows, maybe my complaints are fixed in the DLC?","March 31, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game also features very stunning visuals throughout the entire playthrough. Most of the level backgrounds are impressive and give the platforming layout a nice sense of depth.\n\nHard difficulty is recommended as the various traps can be run through in easy and medium difficulties without taking much damage. In hard difficulty you usually die instantly if you try to run through the traps like a headless chicken.\n\nOnline co-op is available for maximum of 3 players which I highly recommend as every character has their distinctive (and important) roles to play. The character roles also become more apparent when you play co-op as you can't swap between the characters (like in offline) as you please (if you disable the option), but need to work together to overcome the obstacles. Plus, it's always funny when someone screws up and as a result the whole group dies instantly.\n\nThe three playable characters are wizard, knight and thief.\n\nWizard can conjure various metallic platforms to jump on and is especially useful to reach some of the very hard to reach places. He also has a cute wizard's hat which usually flies off hilariously when he dies.\n\nKnight has a shield + sword combo for defence, and to assist the wizard with platform creation he can magnetize the shield. Knight can use the shield to glide through the air like Mary Poppins.\nKnight also has a big hammer which he can use to bash enemies and break wooden objects.\n\nThief is the nimble one as she can use grappling arrows to swing from wooden surface to another. She also has few stealth tricks to confuse the enemies, and can create low gravity bubble which comes in handy from time to time in co-op. In addition to normal arrows the thief can also shoot ice and fire/explosive arrows.\n\nThe levels are scattered with experience bubbles and vials which are used to unlock all the abilities of the characters. In addition the levels feature treasure chests in various secret places which unlock poems and concept art that can be viewed from the main menu gallery.\n\nCheckpoints are frequent throughout the levels. Characters are healed (amount depends on difficulty) and resurrected at the checkpoints.\n\nEnemies are mostly goblins with various equipment like shields, spears and armour. The enemies drop experience and sometimes health pickups that heal every member of the party. Levels also have themed wild life which can both aid and hinder your progress.\n\nAs a negative point the cutscenes cannot be skipped in multiplayer which isn't a problem in first playthrough, but can become tedious if you're planning to play it through more than once in co-op.","March 13, 2014","true","28.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you've played either game in the Shank series, this is very similar but focuses more on the puzzle platforming. The visuals are very, very nice and the backgrounds sometimes mix into the foreground so you do not always expect something to happen. The story, unfortunately, is skippable and doesn't stick; I just played the levels and skipped most of the cutscenes. With that said, the game is fairly short especially if you're doing coop.

The game is visually very good looking. The graphics in collaboration with the atmospheric music builds up a very fairytale like feeling. The puzzles are fun and entertaining (and they can even be quite challenging). There is also replayability as you can collect items scattered around the maps or even try out the levels with your friends online. I found it addicting to collect all the flasks when I completed this game on my PS3 a couple years back.

Don't judge me by my playtime, since I already  play the first one for a decent amount of time, and I must say that Trine 2, stays true to the original while improving every aspect from the first one.  Beautiful graphic and clever , well thought mechanic is the strong point of Trine 2 (also 1).\n\nStory (9/10)\nSince I just play a small amount of time on this game and haven't got at least a quarter of the journey yet, I leave this one mostly at 'pending'. You probably ask why I give it a 9, its solely because of the excellent, bedtime-fairy tale story narrative, the narrator is just plain amazing. And I really look forward for the rest of the story, so far it has an excellent main pot, setting, and pace.\n\nGraphic (11/10)\nFor a 2D side scrolling, Trine and Trine 2 offer a very distinct art style and stunning background, lifelike, and capture the fantasy setting perfectly. The graphic is the first thing that caught my attenttion to this game. I'm not  a fan of 2D platformer with 3D background, hell.. I find most of the background-character combination is just bland and dull, I'd rather play a full 2D platformer. But Trine manages to do it flawlessly. No or really rare platformer treat your eyes  like this. The set pieces are also varied, atleast until now, but I can see the creativity in there, I bet I'll see many more gorgeous places as I go through. It's purely beyond amazing.\n\nGameplay (10/10)\nBalanced, well thought, unique, diverse, and clever. I like on how you solve the puzzle, its not 'linear', with 3 characters available, you can choose a variety of ways to solve the puzzles. The map layout is one of the best layout I've ever seen in a platformer-puzzle game. Also, this game make an intellegent use of its physic. Overall its fun and of course challenging without being unreasonable / over the top. What I meant with "over the top" is in many puzzle game (not only platformer), the puzzle is like..complicated, complicated in a way that its breaking the fourth wall, I mean..when I solve the puzzle, I was like..uhh..really? Trine didn't fal lto that category, the solutions are logical. If I can name other game, it'd be Portal 2, the same unique concept with 'ordinary but creative' problem solving method.\n\nMusic (9/10)\nAnother game which has an amazing soundtrack, when I can say a game OST is amazing? Its when the soundtrack is well placed and help to set out of the mood.\n\nConclusion (9/10)\nApart from the story, its a great game so far, I'm looking forward to find another great places, puzzles, and when the story unfold. Stunning graphic, awesome music, and consistently great gameplay and puzzles are the reasons why I could give a high score on my really early review.\n\nP.S: I probably won't review Trine 1, since Trine 2 is a much improved version of Trine 1, so my review will be the same for both game anyway.","October 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Trine 2 bestow us with spectacular scenarios with ever changing level dynamics that shifts its paradigm with every level, the level of detail immerse you and binds you deeply into the game.\n\nTrine 2 offers gameplay that is far more challenging and enticing than the previous version - Trine2 is a far cry from its predecessor in all the department and completely sets the benchmarks when it comes to 2D side scroller games. The lush , vibrant and detailed environment grasp you and moves you towards it. The Goblin Menace DLC deserves a special mention since it takes the game to a whole new level both in term of variety and features - loaded with new abilities and off the charts looks this is perhaps the best DLC ever created for any game.\n\nTopped with brilliant music that soothes you and gels well with the game dynamics - the highs and low provide a perfect blend with the ever changing moments in the game. The really intriguing aspect of the game is the gameplay - a whopping 20+ hours of normal gameplay is not expected specially from an indie developer which obviously came as a surprise. You can stretch anywhere between 40-50 hours if you gunning for 100% achievements.\n\nAside from few lackluster boss level (which is good but not groundbreaking ) and some minor glitches here and there - Trine 2 is a gamer delight - oozing with beautiful graphics, bright colour, great gameplay with ever changing dynamics and tactics makes the game a must have item in your game library. Here's hoping that the next installment will be even more challenging and gorgeous than ever.\n","October 26, 2013","true","51.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game was able to put my interest into any game that shares it genre. As for presentation, Frozenbyte shows us that this game is more than getting the character from the left side of the level to the right side of the level. Unlike any other games that sometimes can feel like chores playing them, this shows me otherwise. I was literally astonished by the beutiful background and some of the best ambient music in today's gaming.\n\nApart from it's eye candy graphic and artwork, this game packed with the puzzle and gameplay. All of the puzzle that I encounter is not too hard but it requires some brain exercise on figuiring out which way is the best in cracking the puzzle. But, as the game progress, I found out that some of the puzzle can be easily bypassed by gravity field. It is not game breakiing, but it left me some bad taste in my mouth.\n\nIn overall, this game set the bar high for any other games in side scrolling and platforming genre. I have tonnes of fun investing my hours into this game whether alone or with my best friend. Playing coop is highly recomended. If you guys into action fantasy type of game, this game is must owned.","May 28, 2014","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you've played either game in the Shank series, this is very similar but focuses more on the puzzle platforming. The visuals are very, very nice and the backgrounds sometimes mix into the foreground so you do not always expect something to happen. The story, unfortunately, is skippable and doesn't stick; I just played the levels and skipped most of the cutscenes. With that said, the game is fairly short especially if you're doing coop. Preferably played with a controller.\n\nObligatory score: 8/10","May 20, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Trine 2 takes all the great aspects of the original and makes it so much better. With improved graphics, smoother gameplay, better character customization, and more levels Trine 2 is a brilliant continuation.\n\nStory:\nThe kingdom has recovered from the turmoil that struck in Trine. The heroes are being summoned again by the powerful Trine. Goblins have attacked the kingdom again, but who are they being led by. Crown Princess Rosabel asks them to help her rid her kingdom of the evil that if not dealt with will destroy everything.  As you progress you will learn about the Rosabel and her sister Isabel. How did the kingdom change since the last adventure and why did the Trine summon the same heroes?\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign consists of thirteen levels which start off with a brief tutorial as seen in the original and twelve additional levels. The levels are a lot longer than in the original offering more puzzles and secrets. Throughout the campaign you will fight three bosses each more challenging than the last. You will find secret poems, portraits, and more throughout the campaign which make you want to go back and search over again.\n\nGameplay:\nTrine 2 gives you the same characters as the original: Amadeus (the wizard), Pontius (the knight), and Zoya (the thief). Unlike the original Trine there are no real items in this version just the basic experience orbs/jars, health potions, and chests with secrets inside. The skill trees are different than in the first one as well, they offer about the same amount of abilities. These abilities let you conjure more items, and use them in different ways. In Trine 2 you play as one character as a time, but you can switch though them instantly. If one of the characters die you respawn as one of the other two characters nearby. The brilliant combat system allows you to choose how you play the game. You can be hack ‘n slash melee hero (the Knight), a magical spell user (the Wizard), or an archer (the Thief).\n\nResults:\nTrine 2 is an epic platformer that pushes the ideas of original series by combining puzzle solving, hack ‘n slash, platformer, and RPG into a single game. The campaign offers secret items, poems and portraits, which reveal even more depth to the story. The brilliant story combined with beautiful level design and hundreds of secrets creates a fantastic game that does justice to the amazing series. Trine 2 is a game I would buy a full price and offers much more than other platformers, but if you are unsure and can get it on sale then I wouldn’t hesitate for a second.\n\nPros:\n+Character customization\n+Amazing story\n+Beautiful scenery and level design\n+Elegant music and ambience\n+Fantastic combat systems\n+Awesome boss fights that keep you pressed\n+Brilliant voice acting and cut-scenes\n\nCons:\n-Removed items that allowed you to further customize your characters","April 27, 2014","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Trine 2 bestow us with spectacular scenarios with ever changing level dynamics that shifts its paradigm with every level, the level of detail immerse you and binds you deeply into the game.\n\nTrine 2 offers gameplay that is far more challenging and enticing than the previous version - Trine2 is a far cry from its predecessor in all the department and completely sets the benchmarks when it comes to 2D side scroller games. The lush , vibrant and detailed environment grasp you and moves you towards it. The Goblin Menace DLC deserves a special mention since it takes the game to a whole new level both in term of variety and features - loaded with new abilities and off the charts looks this is perhaps the best DLC ever created for any game.\n\nTopped with brilliant music that soothes you and gels well with the game dynamics - the highs and low provide a perfect blend with the ever changing moments in the game. The really intriguing aspect of the game is the gameplay - a whopping 20+ hours of normal gameplay is not expected specially from an indie developer which obviously came as a surprise. You can stretch anywhere between 40-50 hours if you gunning for 100% achievements.\n\nAside from few lackluster boss level (which is good but not groundbreaking ) and some minor glitches here and there - Trine 2 is a gamer delight - oozing with beautiful graphics, bright colour, great gameplay with ever changing dynamics and tactics makes the game a must have item in your game library. Here's hoping that the next installment will be even more challenging and gorgeous than ever.\n","October 26, 2013","true","51.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dark_raven13/recommended/35720/","dark_raven13","Raven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dark_raven13/","309 products in account","Trine 2 is a pretty fantastic 2D puzzle-side scroling/platformer. Don't judge me by my playtime, since I already  play the first one for a decent amount of time, and I must say that Trine 2, stays true to the original while improving every aspect from the first one.  Beautiful graphic and clever , well thought mechanic is the strong point of Trine 2 (also 1).\n\nStory (9/10)\nSince I just play a small amount of time on this game and haven't got at least a quarter of the journey yet, I leave this one mostly at 'pending'. You probably ask why I give it a 9, its solely because of the excellent, bedtime-fairy tale story narrative, the narrator is just plain amazing. And I really look forward for the rest of the story, so far it has an excellent main pot, setting, and pace.\n\nGraphic (11/10)\nFor a 2D side scrolling, Trine and Trine 2 offer a very distinct art style and stunning background, lifelike, and capture the fantasy setting perfectly. The graphic is the first thing that caught my attenttion to this game. I'm not  a fan of 2D platformer with 3D background, hell.. I find most of the background-character combination is just bland and dull, I'd rather play a full 2D platformer. But Trine manages to do it flawlessly. No or really rare platformer treat your eyes  like this. The set pieces are also varied, atleast until now, but I can see the creativity in there, I bet I'll see many more gorgeous places as I go through. It's purely beyond amazing.\n\nGameplay (10/10)\nBalanced, well thought, unique, diverse, and clever. I like on how you solve the puzzle, its not 'linear', with 3 characters available, you can choose a variety of ways to solve the puzzles. The map layout is one of the best layout I've ever seen in a platformer-puzzle game. Also, this game make an intellegent use of its physic. Overall its fun and of course challenging without being unreasonable / over the top. What I meant with "over the top" is in many puzzle game (not only platformer), the puzzle is like..complicated, complicated in a way that its breaking the fourth wall, I mean..when I solve the puzzle, I was like..uhh..really? Trine didn't fal lto that category, the solutions are logical. If I can name other game, it'd be Portal 2, the same unique concept with 'ordinary but creative' problem solving method.\n\nMusic (9/10)\nAnother game which has an amazing soundtrack, when I can say a game OST is amazing? Its when the soundtrack is well placed and help to set out of the mood.\n\nConclusion (9/10)\nApart from the story, its a great game so far, I'm looking forward to find another great places, puzzles, and when the story unfold. Stunning graphic, awesome music, and consistently great gameplay and puzzles are the reasons why I could give a high score on my really early review.\n\nP.S: I probably won't review Trine 1, since Trine 2 is a much improved version of Trine 1, so my review will be the same for both game anyway.","October 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tonu/recommended/35720/","Tonu","Tonttu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tonu/","463 products in account","This is a game for you if you like platforming and lite puzzle solving. The game also features very stunning visuals throughout the entire playthrough. Most of the level backgrounds are impressive and give the platforming layout a nice sense of depth.\n\nHard difficulty is recommended as the various traps can be run through in easy and medium difficulties without taking much damage. In hard difficulty you usually die instantly if you try to run through the traps like a headless chicken.\n\nOnline co-op is available for maximum of 3 players which I highly recommend as every character has their distinctive (and important) roles to play. The character roles also become more apparent when you play co-op as you can't swap between the characters (like in offline) as you please (if you disable the option), but need to work together to overcome the obstacles. Plus, it's always funny when someone screws up and as a result the whole group dies instantly.\n\nThe three playable characters are wizard, knight and thief.\n\nWizard can conjure various metallic platforms to jump on and is especially useful to reach some of the very hard to reach places. He also has a cute wizard's hat which usually flies off hilariously when he dies.\n\nKnight has a shield + sword combo for defence, and to assist the wizard with platform creation he can magnetize the shield. Knight can use the shield to glide through the air like Mary Poppins.\nKnight also has a big hammer which he can use to bash enemies and break wooden objects.\n\nThief is the nimble one as she can use grappling arrows to swing from wooden surface to another. She also has few stealth tricks to confuse the enemies, and can create low gravity bubble which comes in handy from time to time in co-op. In addition to normal arrows the thief can also shoot ice and fire/explosive arrows.\n\nThe levels are scattered with experience bubbles and vials which are used to unlock all the abilities of the characters. In addition the levels feature treasure chests in various secret places which unlock poems and concept art that can be viewed from the main menu gallery.\n\nCheckpoints are frequent throughout the levels. Characters are healed (amount depends on difficulty) and resurrected at the checkpoints.\n\nEnemies are mostly goblins with various equipment like shields, spears and armour. The enemies drop experience and sometimes health pickups that heal every member of the party. Levels also have themed wild life which can both aid and hinder your progress.\n\nAs a negative point the cutscenes cannot be skipped in multiplayer which isn't a problem in first playthrough, but can become tedious if you're planning to play it through more than once in co-op.","March 13, 2014","true","28.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The art work is absolutely breathtaking.  Game play is as you would expect from a side scrolling game but with the added help of being able to switch between 3 different character each with their own unique skill required to proceed through levels.\n\nCo-op is excellent altough character switching may get a tad confusing especially when you get accustomed to a particular character but only for a few seconds.  You will find that you and your co-op buddies will spend most of your time gushing about the vividly stunning visuals.\n\nAbsolutely recommend this one.\n","May 20, 2014","true","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is more than enough to get your attention, but Trine franchise doesn't stop there.\nGraphics, sounds, voice-overs and overall atmosphere in this game are absolutely brilliant. It oozes with "fairy tale feeling", so the end result feels like interactive story.\n\nTo put it short, buy this game (along with the original Trine), because you will enjoy every minute of it!\n","February 9, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Trine 2 takes all the great aspects of the original and makes it so much better. With improved graphics, smoother gameplay, better character customization, and more levels Trine 2 is a brilliant continuation.\n\nStory:\nThe kingdom has recovered from the turmoil that struck in Trine. The heroes are being summoned again by the powerful Trine. Goblins have attacked the kingdom again, but who are they being led by. Crown Princess Rosabel asks them to help her rid her kingdom of the evil that if not dealt with will destroy everything.  As you progress you will learn about the Rosabel and her sister Isabel. How did the kingdom change since the last adventure and why did the Trine summon the same heroes?\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign consists of thirteen levels which start off with a brief tutorial as seen in the original and twelve additional levels. The levels are a lot longer than in the original offering more puzzles and secrets. Throughout the campaign you will fight three bosses each more challenging than the last. You will find secret poems, portraits, and more throughout the campaign which make you want to go back and search over again.\n\nGameplay:\nTrine 2 gives you the same characters as the original: Amadeus (the wizard), Pontius (the knight), and Zoya (the thief). Unlike the original Trine there are no real items in this version just the basic experience orbs/jars, health potions, and chests with secrets inside. The skill trees are different than in the first one as well, they offer about the same amount of abilities. These abilities let you conjure more items, and use them in different ways. In Trine 2 you play as one character as a time, but you can switch though them instantly. If one of the characters die you respawn as one of the other two characters nearby. The brilliant combat system allows you to choose how you play the game. You can be hack ‘n slash melee hero (the Knight), a magical spell user (the Wizard), or an archer (the Thief).\n\nResults:\nTrine 2 is an epic platformer that pushes the ideas of original series by combining puzzle solving, hack ‘n slash, platformer, and RPG into a single game. The campaign offers secret items, poems and portraits, which reveal even more depth to the story. The brilliant story combined with beautiful level design and hundreds of secrets creates a fantastic game that does justice to the amazing series. Trine 2 is a game I would buy a full price and offers much more than other platformers, but if you are unsure and can get it on sale then I wouldn’t hesitate for a second.\n\nPros:\n+Character customization\n+Amazing story\n+Beautiful scenery and level design\n+Elegant music and ambience\n+Fantastic combat systems\n+Awesome boss fights that keep you pressed\n+Brilliant voice acting and cut-scenes\n\nCons:\n-Removed items that allowed you to further customize your characters","April 27, 2014","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Having never played Trine 1, I was able to jump into Trine 2 feeling as if I hadn't missed anything important.  Immediately you notice how gorgeous the fairy tale graphics are, and I have to admit I am a sucker for this style of art work.  At times I find myself stopping play just to admire the stunning art work.\n\nTrine 2  is a puzzle platform game where you can constantly switch among three characters each with unique skills that complement each other -- and that's what sets this apart from other platform puzzle games.  In many cases there are more than one way to solve the puzzle so you can often stick with the character that matches your style.  In addition to puzzles there are semi-hidden chests and orbs that grant you points to upgrade your abilities.  I think finding the hidden stuff was one of the top high lights of the game.\n\nThe game also mixes in fight and boss sequences giving a nice balance between puzzle solving and action.  Thus I found the game more enjoyable than say a pure puzzle platform game like Limbo.  The game includes several achievements as well as a multiplayer mode giving you many hours of enjoyment.  Highly recommended.","October 20, 2013","true","52.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game came out of nowhere and blew me away. My friend and I finished the game on co-op although I had to plow through the last agonizing and infuriating level by myself, but that's beside the point.\n\nIf anyone ever played and loved Lost Vikings on Sega, this game is definitely for you. This Nvidia phys X physics engine is still limited to a two dimensional game but I can see it expanding further. Although this time around the engine can pump out even pretties graphics and textures which I didn't think was possible.\n\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing, it calms down your nerves and makes you forget about all the worries in the world. The author was the one who made the soundtrack for the Angry Birds by the way. The narration is realistic and believable. The game once again feels like watching and playing a fantasy tale. At times, I simply wished to simply run forward and sink in the world of Trine without any enemies or obstacles. I just wanted to enjoy the foreground, the background, the physics, the tessellation particles, etc.\n\n\nAs with the first game, you collect vials and then use them for upgrades. 90% of the vials are more or less easy to obtain, much like in the first game; and there are several ways of obtaining almost every vial. You no longer retain your upgrades and abilities from the first game, so you have to reacquire the old ones as well as obtain only a couple of new ones.\n\nApparently the story takes place a few years after the first game. The awkward alleged womanizer wizard Amadeus is older now and is now a family man. Pontius is still the dumb and fearless fat knight and Zoya is still the same slender thief.\n\nThe trio is quickly reunited for a quest to save the kingdom, again.\n\nThe thief is still my personal favorite character to play. The acrobatics are still rewarding to conduct and you want to pat yourself on the back every time you manage to shoot the grappling hook as you fall to your death and suspend yourself in mid air. The thief will be the one to get most of the vials, artifacts and other miscellaneous collectibles (like drawings and poems) from hard-to-reach areas anyway. However, later on the wizard becomes extremely effective since you are then able to conjure several items and be able to float yourself and the entire party across impassable lands.The physics and the general precision is once again impeccable. The story now introduces orcs as opposed to the same old boring skeletons and other creatures. There are a handful of bosses still and they are fun to battle. The melee system is still as refined as in part 1. You can block, swing, shoot arrows and use the environment to your advantage (for instance dropping a rock onto an enemy while playing as a Wizard)\n\nThe game CAN get frustrating sometimes, especially when you attempt again and again to jump on that ledge or attempt to swing over and get that orb or vial. It's not the fault of the controls per se, it's the physics and the gravity that often prevent you from conducting flawless maneuvers.\n\nThe game apparently also has more replay value than the first one. There are more unlockables and extras this time. Once you finish the game, you can start a new game + and experience some new things, allegedly. PLUS, this time we get online co-op. Yes, thank you very much. Whereas the first game only featured a 2 player offline co-op, someone always had to be the brains and play as the two characters most of the time. Not this time. Now you can play as one of the three characters. You can use either text or voice chat to coordinate movement. I strongly recommend playing this game in co-op mode. It might get repetitive at times, but no puzzle is every the same so there is still enough variety, plus I don't think I saw a single piece of environment being recycled.\n\nIn general the game is quite easy. It does not call for a repeated frustration. There are plenty of checkpoints that will resurrect your dead companions and there are almost always more than one way of overcoming an obstacle.\n\nThe bottom line is that this game makes you regret that the world of Trine is only confined to a video game.","November 27, 2013","true","16.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/35720/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nTrine 2, is a 2D platformer that combines three different heroes into one (if you’re playing single player) or select one hero and work with two or three friends to try to complete the various puzzles in the game.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You are summoned by the Trine (A mysterious Dwarven object), which links a Wizard “Amadeus” , a Knight “Pontius” and a thief/entrepreneur “Zoya” together to save the kingdom. The story itself is put together like a bed time story, very straight forward and amusing to listen to.\n\nGame Play: (note, at this time 06/20/14 – I have not played the original Trine) As has been hinted above in the story section, you can switch between three very different heroes. You can actually complete the levels without switching at all, but generally switching makes solving puzzles much easier.\nThere is a little bit of combat where you need to smash in some Goblin heads, but the most challenging aspect of the game is the environments which are definitely out to kill me. Plenty of death holes in the ground.\nThere is also a quaint leveling system in the game, when you collect “experience orbs” you level up and are given a skill point to assign to a character and ability. By upgrading skills you make puzzle solving much easier and often times dynamic. I’ve solved puzzles with Amadeus’s boxes that I could have done faster and easier the “correct way”. But that aspect gives the game a sense of freedom.\n\nMulti-player:  I had the privilege to play this game with a friend, and let me say this game is amazingly more fun to play with one or two friends. The difference is that if you are playing with others, you are limited to which character you play as. If you’re playing with just one friend, which leaves one free character either of you can switch or rotate with. (For us, it was Pontius… Sorry buddy, you’re good at fighting, not at plat forming).\n\nAchievements: Here’s the basic break down for the achievements: Collect all the things, Find all the things, Do a few special things with each character, then Beat the game on Hard core mode on Hard difficulty, and you’ll have all the achievements.\nThe game has 97 achievements, I was surprised that a game like Trine 2 had so many achievements, but it provided a great deal of entertainment and a fair bit of replay-ability to get the rest of the achievements.\n\nPrice: The price for Trine 2 is $19.99. I played 30 hours (and that will increase as I work on getting the hard core achievements) that is a pretty fair price for how much time I’ve put into it. Good news though! We are in the Steam Summer sale (06/20/14)! The game is on sale right now for 85% off, in other words the game is $2.99 That is a great deal, if you’ve been wanting to play a platformer puzzle fantasy game, now is your time. You have until June 30th to get it at this current price.\nIf you’re still not sure if you’d like to play it or not, you can also download a demo to test out first; you can’t be persuaded anymore than that.\n\nConclusion: I really enjoyed the game. If you’re just looking to relax and play a fantasy adventure game, I highly recommend this game. It was fun to play, not overly difficult however the Hardcore kicked my butt; it’s not something you’ll just waltz through. But the easiest difficulties make the game seem very friendly.","June 20, 2014","true","30.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So much detail in every part of the level.\n\nYou have to switch between 3 characters (rogue/wizard/warrior) to complete different puzzles, and there is an upgrading tree that is simple, but well-done.\n\nThe instructions are very seamless and easy to use (and you even start off in an interative menu screen).\n\nThe puzzles are actually quite challenging, as you have to juggle the abilities of 3 different characters (ex: wizard creates boxes/moves objects, rogue swings around, warrior breaks things). Admittedly, I have had to resort to "cheating" in the form of my friend levitating 2 of us through puzzles we couldn't figure out.\n\nThere are also some very nice tricks you can figure out depending on who you like to play as.\n\nFor example, the ROGUE can shoot gravity arrows that can annoy your friends, slow down animations [remember aesthetics are GREAT], or slow down flamethrowers or those cannons that keep melting you in the face. That being said, the rogue has an improved jump (if it's against a wall/ledge) and the gravity arrow not only increases your ENTIRE party's jump, but also allows you to effectively leave your other 2 friends behind since you no longer need the wizard to levitate you anywhere.\n\nThe rogue can also uselessly latch onto (applicable) surfaces with her swing, and watch as your other members try to solve a puzzle or make it across a gap of wooden supports that are touch-sensitive -  which means that she could also trigger them with said swing right before a warrior's landing, causing him to fall to an untimely death.\n\nThe WIZARD can use loopholes (depending on your settings) to levitate yourself or your friends, and will also be your main character for solving puzzles and dealing with hazards since he is the only character with object manipulation. For example, you might need the wizard to hold a platform above a flaming ground of death. Or you could also pull that log just a little to the right so that your rogue misses her spider-man swing, falling to her death. There are a lot of pipe-based puzzles (for diverting air currents or flames), and the solutions for those are not always cookie-cutter - you might have to bash that pipe to get it to orient the correct way.\n\nThe WARRIOR is your tank/fighter. His shield can negate hazards like flamethrowers, those cannons that melt your face off, and he is basically the person everyone will run to when enemies spawn. Some encounters have several enemies spawn with archer support, and, as always, everyone will run to the warrior for protection. The fighting can become a challenge if you are playing solo (or have moved on ahead of your friends), so levelling up the warrior's skill tree can be useful for survivability.  There are also many obstacles that can only be destroyed by the warrior's hammer (or later, by a levelled-up fire arrow from the rogue).\n\nTrine 2's biggest beauty, however, is the cooperative aspect.\n\nOh man.\n\nI have laughed 5 minutes straight on Skype trying to watch one of my friends (wizard) jump onto a platform but couldn't because of his own conjured box.\n\nI have laughed 5 minutes straight just from 2 of us dying and having to watch the 3rd person march over to a (usually very close by) respawn point.\n\nI have laughed countless times from a mistake from the wizard causing one or more members of the party to die.\n\nI play a rogue.","July 6, 2014","true","10.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ethansight/recommended/35720/","ethansight","ethansight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ethansight/","47 products in account","Let me first just say the obligatory fact that this game is BEAUTIFUL. Normally not something I would think of as a defining quality of a 2D puzzle game, but it... you just gotta play it yourself to see just how amazing this game looks. I suppose because it IS 2D, it runs great on lower end machines while being able to still stay beautiful.\n\nAs far as gameplay, it is a fun combination of puzzle, platforming and combat elements. There are three characters each with a defining set of abilities that work brilliantly together. They aren't complicated, but when put together with the crafty environment it really just makes for a plain FUN game!\n\nI would reccomend getting a buddy to play it with sometimes as well. Maybe we have missed something, but the way the multiplayer seems to work is that basically someone will be able to "drop in" on someone's story and be able to go through it together. This becomes a problem because one of use ends up going back and playing through something again, but it isn't too terribly bad. You find there were different ways to solve puzzles and then have fun trying to naviate with anothe player (and enjoy the scenery of course!).\n\nSo, yes I would reccomend this game! I was doubtful at first, but it has come together to be a very enjoyable game from all fronts. I haven't completed the story yet, but it introduces new mechanics and new environments enough that it dosen't become monotonous.

You can come up with creative ways to solve it with your friend, and the game is just really good fun. The story is atrocious, and I have no clue what it's about, seeing as it says nothing.

It may seem like a "well, duh" feature, but it makes a world of difference over the previous local-only game.\n\nBy building on its successes rather than messing with its entertaining gameplay, Trine 2's simple concept of trekking toward the right side of the screen feels more like an otherworldly adventure than just another platformer. The abilities of your three playable characters - Wizard, Rogue, and Warrior - synergize superbly. Though at times you may feel overly dependent on another character's unique skills, the often misplaced trust you put in your friends’ talent will generally lead to hilarious and unintended successes.\n\nFrequently, the way to figure out a puzzle is to throw yourself at it until you discover a solution. A side-effect of this is death, but thankfully, it’s hardly a penalty. As long as one character remains alive and makes it to one of the many checkpoints in a level, the others are instantly revived. If everybody dies, all progress is saved and everybody is reincarnated at the latest checkpoint. This serves the flow of the game well, because your sense of adventure is never punished; indeed, being practically immortal in a platformer is surprisingly fun!\n\nDon’t expect much from the story; other than giving a reason to run to the right, it exists only to provide context to Trine 2’s challenges and puzzles. The reward for figuring out each scenario is mainly a sense of progression – but it works. Progression could mean accumulating experience potions that grant each character improved skills or new abilities, or it could mean discovering hard-to-reach chests that contain pieces of concept art or a narrated stanza from the main antagonist’s journal. Simply getting to the next level is often reward enough, because this game’s vibrant visuals are stunning.\n\nTrine 2's artistic merit is absolutely jaw-dropping. The title screen alone sets the bar for the rest of the game. (Try starting the game at different times during the day!) Half of my play-time was spent taking in the stunningly beautiful backdrops and set pieces. I felt guilty when I solved a puzzle without fully admiring the obscene amount of effort put into the graphical presentation of this game. The quality is consistently superb - worthy of your attention all the way through to the last chapter - and every shade of the rainbow gets a feature performance.\n\nThe fun to be had in applying home-brewed solutions to solving puzzles with your friends is what sustains Trine 2 until its end. Along with constantly being rewarded with beautiful vistas and remarkably decorated interiors, finding all the hidden goodies will definitely tempt your inner completionist. Although you may need to set personal goals to warrant a second play-through, Trine 2 is a very entertaining game to play over a week with one or two of your friends.","June 24, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike games like Braid and Vessel, there are multiple ways to solve each puzzle. Overall it is a lot of fun, there is a good mix of thoughtful puzzle solving and fast-twitch action and platform jumping. There are three characters with different abilities. Most puzzles are obviously designed for one character, but in a lot of cases you can solve them with multiple characters. It is fun to figure out the "knight" solution to a "wizard" puzzle. Also, there are additional challenges in addition to progressing through the game: experience pickups and chests. You can win extra achievements by getting all the experience pickups and chests for a level. There is a decent amount of replayability, although I had enough playing it through once. There are an obscene number of achievements available for this game, overkill if you ask me. There is a lot of content here, I have played ~19 hours so far without going back to replay any of the levels to pick up more achievements. The background graphics are very pretty and imaginative, althoug they obscure things sometimes. Overall I can recommend this game as a fun 2-D puzzle platform game, with a low price and tons of content.","November 2, 2014","true","35.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, a bit samey.

If you like puzzles, thinking outside of the box, and... bopping goblins? You will probably fall in love with Trine 2 in a heartbeat!\n\nBelow is a list of attributes pertaining to Trine 2, and some personal opinion in regards to how they did.\n\nSTORY: 4/10\n"Feels like it's missing something... Oh, yes! More goblins!"\nI'll give Trine 2 a cookie for being relatively unique compared to most other games. The execution is fine, though the game does leave you feeling like there should be more. Additionally, some aspects of the plot can be seen coming a mile away. Fortunately, there's at least one or two good twists in store. For the sake of spoilers though, I won't disclose them here. The story of Trine 2's is not one to be taken seriously.\n\nOf course, you weren't looking to play this for the story, were you?\n\nGAMEPLAY: 7/10\n"Think of it as a test of manhood. Or mousehood."\nEarning a few extra points for its fairly clever implementation of skills and the three heroes, Trine 2 really lets you play the game in your own style, be it through finesse, sheer force, or stuffing boxes into sacred places they clearly don't belong! If you get stuck at some point or confused, the narrator offers some clues on how to proceed. Compared to most games that babysit you along, this is much more preferrable.\n\nAdmittedly, the controls do take a little getting used to, and even Normal Difficulty can be downright brutal if you're new to the game. Thankfully, a lot of the achievements (if you're OCD like I am) can be obtained without getting your rear end handed to you. Some are possible right at the main menu! *Hint, hint.*\n\nDESIGN: 10/10\n"No pixel was spared."\nTrine 2 is outrageously beautiful. Beautiful to the point of losing sight of your character on the screen! ... Seriously, this happened to me playing it. But that's okay because Trine 2 is a literal slideshow of eye candy and scenic splendor. Rewarding to watch just in its own right. Being able to play in it, let alone interact with it, is an added bonus.\n\nPerhaps the nicest part about its shiny graphics is that you don't have to cash in on your life insurance policy to make a system capable of running it. Even with a simple dual-core PC, Trine 2 runs magnificently at high detail.\n\n\nSUMMARY: 7 out of 10.\nNormally, I detest games that emphasize graphics since they usually have horrible gameplay and/or story about as in-depth as a piece of cardboard. Trine 2's storyline isn't the greatest, but it makes up for it in its unique and fluid style, gameplay, as well as the lovely panoramic scenes the game immerses you into. It's a game that isn't trying to sell you some epic story or brand-spanking new mechanic... It's just fun to play!\n","September 30, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may seem like a "well, duh" feature, but it makes a world of difference over the previous local-only game.\n\nBy building on its successes rather than messing with its entertaining gameplay, Trine 2's simple concept of trekking toward the right side of the screen feels more like an otherworldly adventure than just another platformer. The abilities of your three playable characters - Wizard, Rogue, and Warrior - synergize superbly. Though at times you may feel overly dependent on another character's unique skills, the often misplaced trust you put in your friends’ talent will generally lead to hilarious and unintended successes.\n\nFrequently, the way to figure out a puzzle is to throw yourself at it until you discover a solution. A side-effect of this is death, but thankfully, it’s hardly a penalty. As long as one character remains alive and makes it to one of the many checkpoints in a level, the others are instantly revived. If everybody dies, all progress is saved and everybody is reincarnated at the latest checkpoint. This serves the flow of the game well, because your sense of adventure is never punished; indeed, being practically immortal in a platformer is surprisingly fun!\n\nDon’t expect much from the story; other than giving a reason to run to the right, it exists only to provide context to Trine 2’s challenges and puzzles. The reward for figuring out each scenario is mainly a sense of progression – but it works. Progression could mean accumulating experience potions that grant each character improved skills or new abilities, or it could mean discovering hard-to-reach chests that contain pieces of concept art or a narrated stanza from the main antagonist’s journal. Simply getting to the next level is often reward enough, because this game’s vibrant visuals are stunning.\n\nTrine 2's artistic merit is absolutely jaw-dropping. The title screen alone sets the bar for the rest of the game. (Try starting the game at different times during the day!) Half of my play-time was spent taking in the stunningly beautiful backdrops and set pieces. I felt guilty when I solved a puzzle without fully admiring the obscene amount of effort put into the graphical presentation of this game. The quality is consistently superb - worthy of your attention all the way through to the last chapter - and every shade of the rainbow gets a feature performance.\n\nThe fun to be had in applying home-brewed solutions to solving puzzles with your friends is what sustains Trine 2 until its end. Along with constantly being rewarded with beautiful vistas and remarkably decorated interiors, finding all the hidden goodies will definitely tempt your inner completionist. Although you may need to set personal goals to warrant a second play-through, Trine 2 is a very entertaining game to play over a week with one or two of your friends.","June 24, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a sidescroller alright but in such a way that you have the feeling you are playing a 3rd person game. The game is an absolute gem. There is a lot of detail and the colors and lightning are superb. The atmosphere is amazing. My kids play it together on the bigscreen with two controllers. I must say that if you are not used to controllers this game can be difficult at some points but my kids are flying through the environment.\n\nIt starts easy but as you advance everything on your path will test or kill you\n\nAllong the way can (well must) pick up vials thats give you XP. There is a talenttree for each of the 3 chars you can play with to boost weapons or unlock other weapons or abilities and can be (re)set whenever you want so your chars got the proper tools for the fight.\n\nJust buy this game alright!!!

I really enjoyed the first trine. It's story, music, gameplay, all of it was generally delightful, allbeit short. Trine 2 follows wonderfully in it's footsteps.\n\nHere we find our three heroes not really looking for adventure per say, but the Trine once again find it for them. This time they are taken off to save a world of enchantment and a battle between sisters. In the process they find themselves fighting goblins. There is no reason to argue with story line here, as the story is short, succinct, not complicated, and enjoyable for the game.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Trine 2 builds on it's predecessor, working out many of the physics kinks that were so lauded. The characters do basically the same thing, with the addition of a few extras - the knights glide, and magnet shield, the thiefs special gravity arrow, and ability to hide herself, and the wizards magnetic objects, and ability to trap enemies inside boxes, as well as ability to pick up enemies. All in all, the gameplay of this game is smooth and for the most part without problems. 9.5/10\n\nIn terms of graphics, Trine 2 looks superb. The artists who worked the concepts of this game have done a phenomenal job yet again. The colours, the look, and the increased depth make this side-scroller look even better. The graphics themselves could be a little nicer, sharper, and slightly more realistic in some areas - the characters for instance - but all in all this game is more than pleasing on the eyes. 9/10\n\nMusic in this game is one thing that I really enjoy. The embience coupled with the wonderful sound track is above par. Music is a lost art when it comes to video games sometimes, but Trine 2, like it's predecessor, does an excellent job of creating wonderful atmosphere and putting the right music at the right time. And just add in here, the narration of Trine 2 is just as fun as the first. 9.5/10 (BTW, I'm a music teacher)\n\nCo-op is such a hard thing to get right. It's hard to know when it's too much, or when it's not enough. It's a good thing that co-op over the internet was added to this game. It makes it so much more fun to play that way. The only drawaback to this games co-op is the same as last times, the controller configuration. More often then I would like to admit, the control configurations seem to be out of wack. Responding to the wrong thing, or not working at all. Multiple keyboards is still an impossible task sometimes. The co-op itself is fun to play with friends, but if the work on controller configuration were fixed the co-op would be even more fun. 8.5/10\n\nOverall, this game is wonderful. It can be short, or long, depending on what you plan to do with it. It can be easy, or you can challenge yourself, as I have, to find new ways to beat certain areas. If you find it too easy, put it in hardcore mode, on hard, then give it a whirl. Enjoy the colours, the embience, and try and find a friend to play this game with you. You won't win any major tournaments while shooting dozens of people, but you will find yourself enjoying the fact that you've made it through a game using your brain.\n\nTrine 2 - 9/10","June 30, 2014","true","58.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Never played Trine 1.\n\nThis game is very similar to Little Big Planet, however there is a specific role and abilities each player has. In order to progress through the game players have to use skills in combination. Some levels can be completed with only 1 or 2 players using their abilities in sequence. Other leves require all 3 players to communicate in which sequence they are going to use their abilites. Needless to say it provides lots of fun when things don't go as planned and someone keeps messing up that sequence of abilities.","October 26, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphic and music together create on the player a relaxing magic world feeling that kills any stress (also because puzzles are not hard if done with all 3 characters).\nI loved the irony of the dialogues between the 3 characters that more than once made me literally roll on floor laughing.\n\nNow, the gameplay part. The game is quite easy BUT there are challenges (such as achievements) so that even if the puzzles are easy, they "suggest" what to do to make them harder.\n\nTo sum things up, this is one of the best games I ever played (works on linux too) and I enjoyed every hour I spent on this.

I played 20 min, then switched to some other game I was dying to play after a steam sale, and then forgot about Trine 2.\n\nNever again. I'm so sorry Trine 2. You didn't deserve my neglect. But you were worth the wait.\n\nI seriously love this game. If you like platforming/puzzle games like Rochard, you will love this game.\n\nGranted, I have not finished it yet, but I had to stop mid game to say that I'm seriously impressed. This game offers the beautiful styling of a 2D platformer of the modern genre, yet offers a unique twist. There is an RPG element of leveling a class of character. And you get 3 primary characters to level and play at any given time. With 3 different classes to evolve and switch between at any given moment.... That's a mouthful. It sounds confusing but it's easy once you experience it.\n\nLets say you have an enemy that is best suited to be taken down with brute force. Push left bumper, swittch to my brawler and take them down. 3 seconds later, I have a puzzle that requires some blocks to be moved around. Push left bumber, switch to my wizard. Move those blocks with my magic. 3 seconds later I have an obsticle that requires a finess jump. Push left bumper, switch to my archer/acrobat. Jump over that obsicle.\n\nIt's really just fun. Pure and simple. If you like platformers. If you like modern, rich graphic, puzzle solving platformers, then I bet you will enjoy this game.\n\nI'll update this review after I finish the game... but so far I'm thoroughly impressed.","June 20, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How they are designed, how are the characters abilities, how you can gain completeness by collecting all items and how they improved the fights despite the first Trine. Ah, and of course, its awesome graphics and music. Absolutely recommended.\n\nI really enjoyed this 2nd Trine. Although that fact, since I first played and finished the first one it shocked me that there was no mana and that chests give draws and poetries instead of items that give you POWER OMG. Think about it. In Trine 1 I could summon 7 boxes and 3 surfaces with Amadeus. SEVEN BOXES. Now I only could 4, boxes or surfaces together.\nThough I have to say that the change they made about experiences and habilities compensated this "lack" of awesomeness. (i.e. With the Illuminati Triangle in Trine I completed several levels with my brother, I summoned it and he hooked on it xD)\nAlso they hardened the puzzles and these ones were more tricky sometimes.\nThe art is sublime as always and the music as well.\nI set the difficulty on Difficult, to make fights more entertaining. Indeed they were. Sometimes I died more than a couple of times. Perhaps I should try Hardcore mode. Who knows.\nStill, I also really didn't like some levels. I don't know, for example the Sewers' One. It was all so claustrophobical and I died many times, MANY.\nThe Goblins DLC was perfect, I really enjoyed it (only the Giant Worm's one I hated). So I reccomend to take it as well and wait for a sale to buy Trine 1, 2 and DLC. Or only Trine 2 and DLC.\nAh yeah, another thing I'd like to add, is that in Trine 2 there was finally a FINAL BOSS FIGHT. It was something that I missed in 1st one. That level was going up, kill normal enemies and that's all. Instead of that, in Trine 2 you have a properly final boss fight. It was hard xD","May 10, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phalthrax/recommended/35720/","phalthrax","PhalThrax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phalthrax/","118 products in account","Puzzle games have, like many genres, evolved significantly since their arrival onto home consoles. We can look back on titles such as Adventures of Lolo[en.wikipedia.org] for the NES, and Doki Doki Penguin Land[en.wikipedia.org] for the Sega Master system, it’s easy to see how far we’ve come. Trine 2 is an example of gaming evolution done right; it takes its foundation from the platforming genre and implements many other elements to provide us with art, action, and strategy… with a bit of frustration thrown in for good measure.\n\nWhen starting up Trine 2 for the first time, the first thing that will catch anyone’s attention is the incredibly bright atmosphere. Frozenbyte did a wonderful job of providing the player with visual stimulation in the form of exceptional graphics, bright colors and detailed environments. This is something that is usually not the center of focus for puzzle games, but they managed to make it the most eye-popping aspect for me. I was simply blown away at how impressive the artwork was, and how it created a realistic looking environment; it's an enticing environment that satisfies many emotions. A prime example of this being the level. “Searock Castle,” a level that presents many hazards like any other, but is so pleasurable to the eyes that I often found myself saying, “huh... this would be a nice vacation spot!” Of course, I would ask for the travel package that excluded the protoceratop-sized crabs, circulating flamethrowers and hostile ogre-like enemies.\n\nOnto the secrets and puzzles. Each level has carefully hidden one to two treasure chests that contain either a painting or a poem. Sometimes the chests are in plain sight, and it's simply a matter of creating a strategy to access it. Other times it's in an obscure location that one would never consider venturing. Because of the uncertainty, many times I found myself hacking away at walls with my hammer to see if it was a destructible passageway. Although this may sound tedious, I liked this because it really made me want to explore the level, instead of progressing along like an assembly belt. The puzzles and obstacles themselves are also well done, but an apparently easy puzzle can quickly turn disaster with a simple misclick or a miscalculation of game physics. It puts the players problem solving skills, and patience, to the ultimate test. The keyword here is patience, and I cannot emphasize this enough, because players without patience will find themselves quite frustrated. A perfect example of this is when a player accidentally destroys an existing platform that he/she had previously created, or accidentally moving a box/plank to a location that requires you start over. You know the solution to the puzzle, you know that you can complete it, but you're required to start the entire process over again due to an accidental slip up or a misclick. This is not unique to Trine 2 in any way, as many puzzle games punish the players for a mix-up in controls or accuracy. But for some reason, it felt notably more frustrating in this game.\n\nWhich leads me to my next topic: The controls. I have mixed feelings on the controls. Initially, I was using a Logitech F310 gamepad, which has been my go-to gamepad for years now. The combat and movement felt flawless with the d-pad, and I never once found myself questioning my input commands.However, the analogue stick controls were an absolute nightmare, and I often found myself incredibly frustrated with inconsistent sensitivity, movements that felt random in nature, and collision physics that felt over-dramatic. To prevent further frustration, I switched to a mouse and keyboard halfway through the game. Right away, all of my frustrations subsided, and I felt like I was once again in control of my movements. Perhaps it's the accuracy of the mouse, but the analogue controls felt incredibly inaccurate when trying to be precise. I'm not pinning this entirely on the controls of Trine 2, as it's highly possible that my gamepad is simply not the ideal gamepad for this type of game. But for me, I found that the keyboard and mouse provided far, far more accurate and smooth controls.\n\nThe only moment of overwhelming frustration came during the end of the game, but it wasn't in the form of a puzzle or an obstacle. Well, perhaps it could be considered an obstacle, as I encountered a glitch that stopped me in my tracks. On the level “Icewarden Keep”, the player reaches a part where is a barrage of enemies that flood the area, along with a particularly strong enemy that emerges from a gate to your right... a gate that needs to open in order for the player to progress. Unfortunately, this gate never opened, and this enemy stood behind the gate swatting at thin air. This happened not once, but twice, both times requiring that I restart the entire level. This was especially frustrating since this level, in my opinion, was one of the most grueling ones in regards to difficulty. I did some research, and apparently I'm not the only one who has experienced this glitch. I was relieved when the gate finally opened, but was a bit upset that I had to truck through that brutally difficult level more than once.\n\nThe story is nothing overly special, but it has a nice touch to it. For a platforming puzzle game, one can't expect a legendary tale of sadness, revenge, love and deceit in the realm of Final Fantasy IX. Instead, it's a fairly streamlined story that addresses the subject matter in a linear and chapter-like fashion. Pleasant, but nothing overly memorable.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game to those who are interested in a fluid, obstacle-based platforming puzzler. It's short, but sweet, and a fantastic entry to the genre. I would hesitate to recommend this game to those who may a prefer a bit more action in their games, and those who aren't particularly thrilled by the notion of extended puzzle solving. As I mentioned before, it's a game of patience, and this can be grueling for some. But for some like myself, it's all worth it just to have that sign of relief once you cross the finish line.","February 24, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The story is excellent and the graphics; both character and environment are beautiful.  Dont be surprised if you catch yourself being memorized by the environment yourself.\n\nI will say this is a very linear game and there may not be a tremendous amount of replayability.

The ways in which it's possible to devise scenarios for your own and friends unintended but  ludicrous and suicidal deaths kept us laughing, with borderline hysteria, until 05:00 AM. Works very well as a 2/3 player internet game (worth turning on the unrestricted character choice option) but probably advisable to have a skype call up rather than having to type in problem solving suggestions.\n\nThe craftmanship and the beauty of the scenes, especially where water has been animated is truly astonishing and worthy of a gaming Oscar!\n\n","March 11, 2014","true","19.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is a bit boring and you never really feel connected to the story or the characters, but the scenary is some of the best I have ever seen in a side scroller.  I played the first one, and I'm happy to say that the Wizard has been nerfed a bit.  It is now much harder to kill enemies with his boxes, but almost every puzzle can be solved with him still.  The game play is fun, but not too challenging, and the game is very forgiving since it puts spawn points after every puzzle, or even half way through a long one.  To sum it up, it is a great game to play with some friends and have a good time checking out the amazing scenery, but if you are just trying to find a good solo game with a good story, look elsewhere.","November 25, 2013","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may seem like a "well, duh" feature, but it makes a world of difference over the previous local-only game.\n\nBy building on its successes rather than messing with its entertaining gameplay, Trine 2's simple concept of trekking toward the right side of the screen feels more like an otherworldly adventure than just another platformer. The abilities of your three playable characters - Wizard, Rogue, and Warrior - synergize superbly. Though at times you may feel overly dependent on another character's unique skills, the often misplaced trust you put in your friends’ talent will generally lead to hilarious and unintended successes.\n\nFrequently, the way to figure out a puzzle is to throw yourself at it until you discover a solution. A side-effect of this is death, but thankfully, it’s hardly a penalty. As long as one character remains alive and makes it to one of the many checkpoints in a level, the others are instantly revived. If everybody dies, all progress is saved and everybody is reincarnated at the latest checkpoint. This serves the flow of the game well, because your sense of adventure is never punished; indeed, being practically immortal in a platformer is surprisingly fun!\n\nDon’t expect much from the story; other than giving a reason to run to the right, it exists only to provide context to Trine 2’s challenges and puzzles. The reward for figuring out each scenario is mainly a sense of progression – but it works. Progression could mean accumulating experience potions that grant each character improved skills or new abilities, or it could mean discovering hard-to-reach chests that contain pieces of concept art or a narrated stanza from the main antagonist’s journal. Simply getting to the next level is often reward enough, because this game’s vibrant visuals are stunning.\n\nTrine 2's artistic merit is absolutely jaw-dropping. The title screen alone sets the bar for the rest of the game. (Try starting the game at different times during the day!) Half of my play-time was spent taking in the stunningly beautiful backdrops and set pieces. I felt guilty when I solved a puzzle without fully admiring the obscene amount of effort put into the graphical presentation of this game. The quality is consistently superb - worthy of your attention all the way through to the last chapter - and every shade of the rainbow gets a feature performance.\n\nThe fun to be had in applying home-brewed solutions to solving puzzles with your friends is what sustains Trine 2 until its end. Along with constantly being rewarded with beautiful vistas and remarkably decorated interiors, finding all the hidden goodies will definitely tempt your inner completionist. Although you may need to set personal goals to warrant a second play-through, Trine 2 is a very entertaining game to play over a week with one or two of your friends.","June 24, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was unsure how they could make Trine2 any better, Oh, how I was wrong. Frozenbyte did an amazing job with this new installment of the game. The game seems like art, it's very colourful with amazing background imagery while you're playing throughout the game, and the music fits right in. This is a very pretty game to play and be amazed. The way Trine2 is played is pretty much exactly the same as Trine1 with a little bit of differences, like the skill trees.\n\nCOOP has been a lot of fun with 2 or 3 players. It can get a bit chaotic(and hard) if you're not working together and just missing around.\n\nIf you played through Trine1 and enjoyed it, you will love this game. I would highly recommend picking up this game.","August 27, 2012","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has challenges requiring the use of multiple characters that will remind any SNES fan of The Lost Vikings, but with graphics to match the modern day.  Interestingly, most problems have multiple solutions, even allowing you to use just 1 of the 3 characters to get through whole stages.  On top of that, it has a very forgiving default difficulty in case you're more interested in the puzzles than the adventure game aspects.  By and large, a relaxing game, well worth the time and price.","December 23, 2013","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphic and music together create on the player a relaxing magic world feeling that kills any stress (also because puzzles are not hard if done with all 3 characters).\nI loved the irony of the dialogues between the 3 characters that more than once made me literally roll on floor laughing.\n\nNow, the gameplay part. The game is quite easy BUT there are challenges (such as achievements) so that even if the puzzles are easy, they "suggest" what to do to make them harder.\n\nTo sum things up, this is one of the best games I ever played (works on linux too) and I enjoyed every hour I spent on this. I strongly suggest you to buy it.","October 13, 2014","true","35.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sofproduction/recommended/35720/","sofproduction","[FGT] Solaire of Astora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sofproduction/","478 products in account","A trine is a group of three. It was also a clever 2009 puzzle platformer starring a trio of adventurers, each with specific talents. Lucky us, now we have a sequel, Trine 2, that offers more fun physics-based challenges, more beautiful vistas, and adds online multiplayer to the mix.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Trine 2 is its stunning visuals. Each scene, from forests to caves to lazy beaches, shines with rich detail and startling lighting effects. There is always something amazing to distract you. Trine 2 easily makes for one of the prettiest games of the year.\n\nIf you played the first Trine, you'll find a very familiar game here. Players run from left to right through fantasy spectacles, surmounting obstacles and slaying a few goblins along the way. You have three heroes at your disposal: a wizard that can conjure blocks and platforms, a thief with a bow and grappling hook, and a knight with sword, hammer, and shield. The brilliance of Trine 2 is that it mostly leaves the choice of which hero to use up to you. I love it when a game lets me off my leash and tells me "have fun," -- and that's the kind of game Trine 2 is.\n\nIt does fail to teach the player some important mechanics, though, resulting in slight exasperation when you don't realize a solution is even possible. The wizards platforms, for instance, can be stuck to swinging spiked maces, resulting in a pendulum conveyance. That's really cool, but it would have been nice to get a heads-up before I found myself stuck at the bottom of an ice slope for a little too long.\n\nWhen playing by yourself you switch between the three heroes at will. In a matter of moments you might slash through some goblins as the knight, switch to the thief to grapple to a high platform, then switch to the wizard to move a heavy block in front of a flame thrower. Trine 2 is also very friendly about multiplayer gaming, allowing up to three players to join the adventure either locally or online. I find the game becomes easier this way because you've got more than just one brain working on problems and you can multitask, but it's still satisfying.\n\nThe few boss fights prove slightly disappointing. While visually impressive, they don't require the same thought as the rest of Trine 2. Merely crossing a chasm can be a real conundrum, but felling a giant beast is as simple as giving it a few whacks to its weak spots. I do love the way the bosses are foreshadowed early on in levels, though.","November 28, 2013","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In order to progress through the game players have to use skills in combination. Some levels can be completed with only 1 or 2 players using their abilities in sequence. Other leves require all 3 players to communicate in which sequence they are going to use their abilites. Needless to say it provides lots of fun when things don't go as planned and someone keeps messing up that sequence of abilities.","October 26, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/35720/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Trine 2: Complete Story is an hybrid between a platform and puzzle game developed by developer Froze Byte and follows the adventure of three heroes, Amadeus the Magnificent, Zoya and Pontius the Brave, as they are guided by a mysterious magical entity, the titular Trine, to face a dark plot involving their kingdom. The Complet Story edition adds to the original some tweaks and include the only major DLC for the game, Goblin Menace, for free.\nThe main beef of Trine 2 is about using the unique perks and abilities of each character or combine them as needed in order to advance in the levels you are thrown in: while there are some enemy encounters through the game, they are a rarity and are easily overcame with the trio's basic abilities (even the few bosses featured are pretty straightforward, save for the final bosses, who are more puzzle game fare in nature). Amadeus the Magnificent doesn't have any combat abilities to speak of and is rather fragile, but can conjure crates or move elements of the scenery to help his comrades. Zoya, instead, is a classic rogue character: she can move faster and jump higher than the other two characters, use a grappling tool to swing around on wooden surfaces and damage enemies from afar using her bow and different kind of arrows. Finally, Portius the Brave is a very sturdy, shielded warrior who fills the role of the group's tank against enemies and heavy damage dealer: after unlocking some of his additional abilities, however, Portius also becomes useful during the platforming sections as a support character.\nThe levels of Trine 2 feature several experience orbs you can collect to level up your characters: each level gained unlocks an ability point you can spend in the talent tree of each hero. Some of these unlocked abilities only enhance the skills the characters already posses, while others introduce totally new gimmicks capable of making the later section of the game much easier to handle.\nIt can be argued that one of the main attraction in Trine 2 are its impressive visual, especially for being a side scroller game: all the characters and environments are rendered in great 3D detail and the scenaries are multiple layers to them. The art style also feels rather unique.\nOne of the main novelty of Trine 2 in comparison to the original game are its only features: a party of three players can experience the whole adventure while playing together online, each controlling his/her own character. On top of being a rather entertaining experience, the multiplayer element also makes the game easier to handle and mixing the heroes' powers much more straightforward.\nTrine 2's replayability is a bit scarce: once you've been playing through the whole game and found a solution to all the puzzles and obstacles, the only real reason to come back for a second run is to play with your friends or change your default character. There are also collectables to be found inside the levels (pieces of poetry and paintings/concept art), but finding them isn't exactly a serious challenge.\nThe Goblin Menace DLC is the only additional content released for Trine 2 and follows the story of Amadeus, Zoya and Portius after their great adventure as they try to save Amadeus' wife from an aggressive army of goblins. The DLC doesn't offer any new gameplay elements whatsoever, both in general mechanics and characters' abilities: on the other side, however, it lasts for some interesting hours, has its own story and, if possible, the level design is even more complex and gorgeous than the one from the main game.\nTrine 2: Complete Story is an entertaining game with its own peculiar identity and apparel that I found very enjoyable, moreso if taken on with a pair of friends along the way","June 20, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voice acting is once again superb.  The quirky characters come alive with witty quips, and the narration is excellent.  The highly detailed environments provide a lush backdrop for all the action.  The difficulty is spot on, rarely too hard and never too easy as to cause boredom.  This game is at its best when played with 1 or 2 friends to fill out the 3 character party.  We played it all the way through via 2 player local co-op and had a blast doing it.

Gorgeous art, atmospheric soundtrack, excellent gameplay. The storyline is as almost nonexistent as in the first one, but essentially, Trine 2 sees you back in the shoes of the wizard, knight and thief as you try and find your way through the puzzle/platformer levels.\n\nThe abilities of the characters have been slightly re-jigged, in order to keep the gameplay fresh, but also to avoid the RPG trope where a character loses all the abilites he got in the first game at the beginnign of the sequel! The gameplay still works best with more than one player helping each other out - in fact, perhaps more so than the first due to the new abilities.\n\nIt has, particularly with the Gblin Menace expansion, a great amount of gameplay for the price. The Goblin Menace adds (amongst other things) another crazy boss level, but it's much more down to skill than insanity and pure blind luck like the first one! It still stands in my mind as one of the best examples of a final boss level - it involves using all the abilities and skills you've learnt and working with your co-players in a classic multi-stage boss level.\n\nAll in all, following on from the last one, 9/10 - it's brilliant fun multiplayer with an Xbox controller, but loses the one point for the lacklustre storyline and confusing keyboard controls.","October 9, 2015","true","24.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/35720/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Trine 2: Complete Story is an hybrid between a platform and puzzle game developed by developer Froze Byte and follows the adventure of three heroes, Amadeus the Magnificent, Zoya and Pontius the Brave, as they are guided by a mysterious magical entity, the titular Trine, to face a dark plot involving their kingdom. The Complet Story edition adds to the original some tweaks and include the only major DLC for the game, Goblin Menace, for free.\nThe main beef of Trine 2 is about using the unique perks and abilities of each character or combine them as needed in order to advance in the levels you are thrown in: while there are some enemy encounters through the game, they are a rarity and are easily overcame with the trio's basic abilities (even the few bosses featured are pretty straightforward, save for the final bosses, who are more puzzle game fare in nature). Amadeus the Magnificent doesn't have any combat abilities to speak of and is rather fragile, but can conjure crates or move elements of the scenery to help his comrades. Zoya, instead, is a classic rogue character: she can move faster and jump higher than the other two characters, use a grappling tool to swing around on wooden surfaces and damage enemies from afar using her bow and different kind of arrows. Finally, Portius the Brave is a very sturdy, shielded warrior who fills the role of the group's tank against enemies and heavy damage dealer: after unlocking some of his additional abilities, however, Portius also becomes useful during the platforming sections as a support character.\nThe levels of Trine 2 feature several experience orbs you can collect to level up your characters: each level gained unlocks an ability point you can spend in the talent tree of each hero. Some of these unlocked abilities only enhance the skills the characters already posses, while others introduce totally new gimmicks capable of making the later section of the game much easier to handle.\nIt can be argued that one of the main attraction in Trine 2 are its impressive visual, especially for being a side scroller game: all the characters and environments are rendered in great 3D detail and the scenaries are multiple layers to them. The art style also feels rather unique.\nOne of the main novelty of Trine 2 in comparison to the original game are its only features: a party of three players can experience the whole adventure while playing together online, each controlling his/her own character. On top of being a rather entertaining experience, the multiplayer element also makes the game easier to handle and mixing the heroes' powers much more straightforward.\nTrine 2's replayability is a bit scarce: once you've been playing through the whole game and found a solution to all the puzzles and obstacles, the only real reason to come back for a second run is to play with your friends or change your default character. There are also collectables to be found inside the levels (pieces of poetry and paintings/concept art), but finding them isn't exactly a serious challenge.\nThe Goblin Menace DLC is the only additional content released for Trine 2 and follows the story of Amadeus, Zoya and Portius after their great adventure as they try to save Amadeus' wife from an aggressive army of goblins. The DLC doesn't offer any new gameplay elements whatsoever, both in general mechanics and characters' abilities: on the other side, however, it lasts for some interesting hours, has its own story and, if possible, the level design is even more complex and gorgeous than the one from the main game.\nTrine 2: Complete Story is an entertaining game with its own peculiar identity and apparel that I found very enjoyable, moreso if taken on with a pair of friends along the way","June 20, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This sequel offers a unique fairytale storybook style in contrast to the dark, somewhat dungeon based original. The game feels more open than its predecessor despite removing items and replacing them with sparce non-gameplay influencing collectibles. This game is packed with impressive, long levels and excellent replayability. Players have to be more creative and conservative as puzzle are not as easily circumvented though solving them is more interesting and visually rewarding. This game is well worth buying at a sale (about $5) and has an equally incredible expansion pack (about $2 on sale) that adds a new chapter to the story and plenty of new levels and skills to play with. I truly recommend fans of puzzle games and casual gamers to buy this game.

Even if it can't get any better, such as Trine 2. 9/10 :D\n\nwww.twitch.tv/crescenda","December 23, 2013","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How they are designed, how are the characters abilities, how you can gain completeness by collecting all items and how they improved the fights despite the first Trine. Ah, and of course, its awesome graphics and music. Absolutely recommended.\n\nI really enjoyed this 2nd Trine. Although that fact, since I first played and finished the first one it shocked me that there was no mana and that chests give draws and poetries instead of items that give you POWER OMG. Think about it. In Trine 1 I could summon 7 boxes and 3 surfaces with Amadeus. SEVEN BOXES. Now I only could 4, boxes or surfaces together.\nThough I have to say that the change they made about experiences and habilities compensated this "lack" of awesomeness. (i.e. With the Illuminati Triangle in Trine I completed several levels with my brother, I summoned it and he hooked on it xD)\nAlso they hardened the puzzles and these ones were more tricky sometimes.\nThe art is sublime as always and the music as well.\nI set the difficulty on Difficult, to make fights more entertaining. Indeed they were. Sometimes I died more than a couple of times. Perhaps I should try Hardcore mode. Who knows.\nStill, I also really didn't like some levels. I don't know, for example the Sewers' One. It was all so claustrophobical and I died many times, MANY.\nThe Goblins DLC was perfect, I really enjoyed it (only the Giant Worm's one I hated). So I reccomend to take it as well and wait for a sale to buy Trine 1, 2 and DLC. Or only Trine 2 and DLC.\nAh yeah, another thing I'd like to add, is that in Trine 2 there was finally a FINAL BOSS FIGHT. It was something that I missed in 1st one. That level was going up, kill normal enemies and that's all. Instead of that, in Trine 2 you have a properly final boss fight. It was hard xD","May 10, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played 20 min, then switched to some other game I was dying to play after a steam sale, and then forgot about Trine 2.\n\nNever again. I'm so sorry Trine 2. You didn't deserve my neglect. But you were worth the wait.\n\nI seriously love this game. If you like platforming/puzzle games like Rochard, you will love this game.\n\nGranted, I have not finished it yet, but I had to stop mid game to say that I'm seriously impressed. This game offers the beautiful styling of a 2D platformer of the modern genre, yet offers a unique twist. There is an RPG element of leveling a class of character. And you get 3 primary characters to level and play at any given time. With 3 different classes to evolve and switch between at any given moment.... That's a mouthful. It sounds confusing but it's easy once you experience it.\n\nLets say you have an enemy that is best suited to be taken down with brute force. Push left bumper, swittch to my brawler and take them down. 3 seconds later, I have a puzzle that requires some blocks to be moved around. Push left bumber, switch to my wizard. Move those blocks with my magic. 3 seconds later I have an obsticle that requires a finess jump. Push left bumper, switch to my archer/acrobat. Jump over that obsicle.\n\nIt's really just fun. Pure and simple. If you like platformers. If you like modern, rich graphic, puzzle solving platformers, then I bet you will enjoy this game.\n\nI'll update this review after I finish the game... but so far I'm thoroughly impressed.","June 20, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoyed the first trine. It's story, music, gameplay, all of it was generally delightful, allbeit short. Trine 2 follows wonderfully in it's footsteps.\n\nHere we find our three heroes not really looking for adventure per say, but the Trine once again find it for them. This time they are taken off to save a world of enchantment and a battle between sisters. In the process they find themselves fighting goblins. There is no reason to argue with story line here, as the story is short, succinct, not complicated, and enjoyable for the game.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Trine 2 builds on it's predecessor, working out many of the physics kinks that were so lauded. The characters do basically the same thing, with the addition of a few extras - the knights glide, and magnet shield, the thiefs special gravity arrow, and ability to hide herself, and the wizards magnetic objects, and ability to trap enemies inside boxes, as well as ability to pick up enemies. All in all, the gameplay of this game is smooth and for the most part without problems. 9.5/10\n\nIn terms of graphics, Trine 2 looks superb. The artists who worked the concepts of this game have done a phenomenal job yet again. The colours, the look, and the increased depth make this side-scroller look even better. The graphics themselves could be a little nicer, sharper, and slightly more realistic in some areas - the characters for instance - but all in all this game is more than pleasing on the eyes. 9/10\n\nMusic in this game is one thing that I really enjoy. The embience coupled with the wonderful sound track is above par. Music is a lost art when it comes to video games sometimes, but Trine 2, like it's predecessor, does an excellent job of creating wonderful atmosphere and putting the right music at the right time. And just add in here, the narration of Trine 2 is just as fun as the first. 9.5/10 (BTW, I'm a music teacher)\n\nCo-op is such a hard thing to get right. It's hard to know when it's too much, or when it's not enough. It's a good thing that co-op over the internet was added to this game. It makes it so much more fun to play that way. The only drawaback to this games co-op is the same as last times, the controller configuration. More often then I would like to admit, the control configurations seem to be out of wack. Responding to the wrong thing, or not working at all. Multiple keyboards is still an impossible task sometimes. The co-op itself is fun to play with friends, but if the work on controller configuration were fixed the co-op would be even more fun. 8.5/10\n\nOverall, this game is wonderful. It can be short, or long, depending on what you plan to do with it. It can be easy, or you can challenge yourself, as I have, to find new ways to beat certain areas. If you find it too easy, put it in hardcore mode, on hard, then give it a whirl. Enjoy the colours, the embience, and try and find a friend to play this game with you. You won't win any major tournaments while shooting dozens of people, but you will find yourself enjoying the fact that you've made it through a game using your brain.\n\nTrine 2 - 9/10","June 30, 2014","true","58.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Use telekinesis, gravity-slowing spells, or kite-sails to explore a land run rampant with dangerous traps and enemies.\n\nGameplayIn the game, you play as Amadeus, a wizard who can conjure boxes and bridges to allow you to climb to victory, Zoya, a thief whose grappling hook swings her from platform to platform, or Pontius, whose shield will defend you from even the most dangerous projectilles. You can always switch characters mid-level and combine their skills to beat the challenges you face. Or you can challenge yourself to beat a level using only the skills of one character!\n\nAnd don't worry: there are secrets, collectibles, and achievements abound! Literally hours of gameplay outside of the main story are devoted to exploring this strange world.\n\nVisualsThe graphics are crisp and evoke the feeling of a fantastical world very well. The game itself is 2D, but everything is rendered in 3D. The levels simply feel alive. Trine 2 is probably the most beautiful platformer I've ever played.\n\nVerdictC'mon, get this game.","December 13, 2013","true","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No surprises, but still fun.\nPlot: Personally I don't think plot is that great. It is acceptable, but doesn't add much value to the gaming experience in general.\nArt: Graphics is fantastic - I have tons of screenshot just because it is a genuinely beautiful game.\nCo-op: I finished my first playthru alone and played with friends for several more. Playing alone is perfectly fine (and fun) but the co-op mode just makes it better- casual, funny, and no one feels left out.\nDifficulty: Platforming is not challenging at all. Some puzzle might take a while for the first time if you play alone but in general very managable (and having a few challenging puzzles is not a bad thing)\nReplay value: Acceptable, for collectables, achievements and new possible solutions from different skills. Also just fun to see how your friends play the game for the first time.\nPrice: Slightly overpriced, but absolutely worth it when on sale (and it's on sale fairly often)","April 13","true","39.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They hit the jackpot with co-op MP that set standards in how co-op should look like. "TT games" with their LEGO titles should really look up to how it should be done. Technically this game has no flaws. Kudoz on graphic options and possibility to set limit to framerate to as much as you want to.\n\nStory in game is awesome. Feeling is so tale like and those poems adds to do complete joy. Gameplay wise, I have nothing but the good words.. both Trine 1 and Trine 2.\n\nImagine a game where not only that multiple solution to every problem exists, and creativity wake to try different things,,but a game where actually stuff that can go wrong like "stuck bottle" that happens as a bug, you can improvise to use enviroment and tools on your hand to get it unstuck or picked up even if it seems impossible :) That part is a 10/10 in my books.

The game play is varied largely if you want to fight and have very little use in puzzles be the knight, if you want to be flexible and helpful with both be the archer, and if you want to be the puzzle master id suggest the wizard, and thats where most of the fun comes from playing your way and putting all your heads together for a great time.","February 8","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are many games which look fantastic in Nvidia 3d Vision, but the Trine games (especially 2 and 3) are so good as to be useful for modeling the technology, in my opinion.  Furthermore, unlike many games that work well in 3D Vision and nothing else, the Trine games have additional 3D modes to make the game compatible with pretty much any stereoscopic setup you have.  If you have a modern 3D TV and choose to play this game in 2D, you are doing yourself a serious disservice.  Get an extra-long hdmi cable, if you have to, and attach your computer to your TV!  (Or invest in a 3D Vision setup, if you are a fan of stereoscopic 3D movies and games.)\n\nThe game is oodles of fun with a friend, in both local and internet co-op, with the difference being that the two characters must share a screen for local co-op; netplay has no such limitation, and you can get separated if you are not careful.  That said, I recommend the latter for those who have both options available to then.\n\nSadly, the game has its share of internet MP bugginess, worse than the first game did (but not as bad as the third).  It was so bad that my friend and I (with him in America and me in Japan, both of us with excellent internet connections) were not able to complete the DLC's final boss, which is arguably broken for multiplayer (possibly local MP as well, given the way the boss spazzes out and gets confused when more than one target is available).  So while I must shake my finger at Frozenbyte for not play-testing and bug-proofing the multiplayer more, I cannot in good conscious give this anything other than a thumbs-up, for its combination of appealing platforming, charming characters and voice acting, and jaw-droppingly gorgeous visuals, which really must be viewed in stereoscopic 3D to be fully appreciated.\n\nArtistic Value: 9.5\nFun Factor: 8 (probably lower while playing solo and/or in 2D)\nMy Score: 8.5","April 16","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was totally different, but fun, some replayability due to different ways of solving puzzles, flexible enough to work as both single and multiplayer, and definitely worth the 3 bucks when on sale, I'd even say probably worth the full prize. This is the first I've played of the series and may pick up the 1st and 3rd soon.","April 12","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
