Not hard as in ‘difficult’, but it’s very difficult to explain in just a couple of sentences. But, I hope I can sum it up with just one word: balance. It’s all about balancing the world of your Cubies (the inhabitants) in order to complete the required objectives. And even though I said it isn’t difficult, it actually is. It requires patience and a clear mind. I had to retry the first level several times because I didn’t understand how to properly solve it. Yeah, the very first level. And yes, I did follow the (quite extensive) tutorial. I can hear you laughing already, but honestly I don’t mind. I had fun replaying the same level over and over again.  A good sign if you ask me.\n\nAs I said this game is all about balance. You’ll have to balance the weather while completing the objectives and without letting your Cubies die. Make it too hot and they’ll eventually die from dehydration and/or the heat (but only if they’re outside in the open). You also can’t create any more grain fields because the sun will have burnt it all away. But, you can move across fields that were previously under water. And if you make it too cold your people will freeze to death. You also won’t be able to grow grain because the ground is rock solid. But, they will be able to easily cross rivers (except for ships, of course). These are just a few examples, by the way;  there are tons of things that can go wrong. You have to carefully find the right balance by using a mix of menhirs and churches.\nAlso, your objectives will range from finding treasures and earning x amount of money to having x amount of an item (like grain) and having a specific number of Cubies.\n\nFailing missions is just a matter of 'when' really. It’s inevitable I think, unless you make it your life’s work to understand the game’s mechanics in and out. But replaying missions isn’t all that bad.  Don’t get me wrong; it can definitely get tiresome because the results aren’t always noticeable right away. This is because the game is played in turns. It usually takes a few clicks before you (think you) see something happening and by then it might already be too late. This will sometimes feel unfair and if you don’t have enough patience you should just stay away from this game altogether.\n\nCubesis uses pixel art for its visuals and it looks good. In a window, that is. Full screen mode makes both the text and graphics become blurry. This is because the game was made with lower resolutions in mind. I know that the developer is currently trying to manipulate the game so that it looks a bit sharper and clearer, so it might eventually look good anyway. For now it is recommended to run this in a window.\nThe music is beautiful and fits the godlike nature of the game. It’s rather calming. Your Cubies also have little sound bites that are mostly gibberish, but the sounds they make instantly let you know what’s going on. So a ‘nu-uh’, for example, means that you can’t build there. It’s a good system for when you have to micromanage a lot later on.\n\nThe game is also long. Missions can take anywhere between 15 minutes and 30 minutes, and even longer I think in some of the later levels. The campaign has 13 levels, but after that there’s apparently a second campaign with an even higher difficulty. So completing this game might take you a long, long time. It’s definitely money well spent.\n\nCubesis is difficult to learn and difficult to master. It’s for people that like a challenge and/or have enough patience. It’s not the prettiest game out there, but it doesn’t have to be. It’s deeper than many other games I’ve seen and played. And it feels good and rewarding knowing that you managed to complete a level by juggling with the elements of nature. So, I want to recommend this to all puzzle and (turn-based) strategy gamers who like a good challenge.\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","August 29, 2014","true","3.5"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","0"

Just make sure to keep your expectations in check. Its a slower paced "puzzle" game with a god sim theme, requiring some micromanagement and is not a sim/RTS game. I found this game to be incredibly charming and the developer pulled of the theme as a puzzle game incredibly well. The individual levels are incredibly diverse and can be quite long, so this isnt a game, where you'll finish a level within 5 minutes, but its totally worth digging into.\n\nLower the sea levels to create new paths and create your own Cubie micropopulation!

Your goals may vary, but to acheive them you must balance resources of population, food, coin and stone. Additionally, there are two gods, one who controls the sea level and one who controls the global temperature. So these factors must also be balanced or used to solve the "puzzle" of the map.\n\nControls are simple, mostly using the mouse. LMB is used to select and move your inhabits, as well as building, and you are able to create a string of commands including building and digging. Left-clicking a town that has over 1.0 population will create an inhabitant. Each building or digging action uses up your unit. RMB ends your turn.\n\nCubesis has interface and map elements similar to Populous and Gnomoria. The graphic style is enjoyable to me, but may not impress most. I did have trouble trying to get full screen to work, but windowed mode is fine. Zooming in seems to cause some possibly unintended graphics issues, hard to say if it is intentional or not. It doesn't get in the way of playing, however.\n\nThe fun of the game is in fufilling the objective by balancing all the resources mentioned. If you want a casual game and have an extra $5, I think it is worth it.","August 23, 2014","true","16.5"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","2"

Though I am recommending this game, I want there to be a huge caveat.  You need to really love god games to enjoy Cubesis.  The mechanics are pretty interesting, balancing either having a world that's too hot or too cold with a world that's too wet or too dry, giving you situations like a flooded, iced over, or barren world, but the amount of time and micro needed for the game will probably turn off casual players.  Each scenario can take 30 minutes to an hour and there are a good 10-20 of them.  I...found myself kinda not wanting to play them after I got the basic mechanics down because of how much you have to manage.  Also, the controls are quite clunky, which makes managing them hard.\n\nGraphics, I think, have a nice old school charm, not unlike Populous.  It's what got me to buy the game and though I don't really want to keep playing it, I think it's still pretty good.

I'll tell you right now being a few misions into the campaign, you won't undersand the details of this game had you been able to skip the tutorial.\n\nI would desribe this game as a stategy/puzzle game where you're to come up with the best plan to manage your resources and please(or displease) the gods to successfully complete an objective for each campaign mission.  I briefly explain each:\n\n*Resources - Your resources basically come down to the people, grain, gold, and stone.  You want to usually build a city first because these will keep your population respawning.  You use your population to gain your grain and stone.  This is really the KEY thing you need to understand to really understand this game, your people are a RESOURCE and sacrifice themselves for other resources.  So if you need stone, you have a person dig down into stone, they die, you get stone. As long as you have a city more people with respawn so its worth to sacrifice them to plant builds and get stone(plus less the population, the less people there are to consume grain.\n\n*Gods - There are two gods.  The first, you make him happy by having a higher churches built: to population ratio.  When  you do this and he's happy the water level will lower, when you have more people than churches the water rises.  An example of when to use this is if you need to get across a sea, you make him happy, lowering the water level, allowing you to walk across the seabed.  The Second god goes off of how many shrines you have built.  Having more built will start to cause an ice age freezing everything other, and eliminating them warms things up.  An example of using this is to freeze a body of water to walk across it to get to your objective.\n\nAnd that's the basics of the game!  It is a really interesting and fun game when you understand this and figure out the best way to use it.  It is a bit of a thinking man's game, and honestly I think that's where a some of these short gametime/short attention-spanned reviews come from.\n\nIf you want to try a fun, interesting, and unique approach to a strategy/puzzle game where you may have to think some, definity give it a try. :)","December 28, 2015","true","2.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In practice, it is a lot of guess work.\n\nThe explanations given in the tutorial, though summarized to a precise ratio, do not work that way in practice.  Keeping churches/flowers in match with citizens can slow the gradual rise or fall of waters/temperatures, but never strike a balance.  Having one more/less building can have catastrophic effects.  A few dozen turns in, you will hit a difficulty curve that does not have anything to do with what the tutorial taught you.\n\nAnyone who has played the old "Sim Earth" game and experienced global warming or ice ages due to the placement of one volcano or the destruction of a single CO2 vent, will immediately understand the temperamental and self-destructive nature of this game.\n\nAny detailed explanations in the tutorial or the game world are lost in poor translation.  It is my understanding that English is not the dev's native language.  While that is all fine and well, it leaves me trying to guess at the finer details and mechanics of a game that mostly seems random and temperamental.\n\nOver-all, your influence and choices in the world of Cubesis lose all meaning once the mechanics are taken out of the sterile tutorial environment.  Thrown together into an actual game, players will rely more on guessing or luck since the required information to make good choices is either lacking or vague at best.  Couple that with controls that work when they want to, a camera that likes to only move a section of the screen at a time, and you have a game that needs more work or a very very patient player.\n","June 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","5"

You try to balance your ressources in order to complete objectives. When all objectives are completed you have won the mission.\n\nFrom this perspective the game is quite good, because you need to keep track of your ressources and react accordingly. Otherwise the game is going to punish you hard for that. So in the case of gamplay the game is quite challenging and fun at times.\n\nAudiowise it has to be said that the music is fairly nice.
