That being said, hidden object games can sort of be a hit-and-miss thing for me. There are some really good ones out there, but there are some that don't do a good job at all.\n\nUnfortunately, "Green Moon" is one of the latter. I could not get into this story at all. There's no hint button, like in other HOGs, to help you out when you're stuck. None of the characters are relatable, it doesn't feel like there's any motivation for the actions you perform...how could such an interesting idea for a story end up being such a mess?\n\nLike I said, there are a lot of good HOGs out there, and there are plenty of them on Steam. If you appreciate a good HOG, you'll probably want to skip over "Green Moon," unless you feel like pulling up the walkthrough to find out what the heck you're supposed to do.","May 15, 2015","false","2.0"," 63 of 79 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","63","79","7","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/recommended/359260/","celtic7guardian","Celtic7Guardian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/","1158 products in account","Updated Review - Game Beaten\n\nOriginally, I could not get very far in this game because a key you need to get to the cellar did not spawn for me. After purging the game from my computer and reinstalling it, the key showed up. I don't even know what.\n\nSo yes, I have now beaten the game. That means I can give a far better analysis of all that it does wrong. But first, let's give it what little credit it deserves. Some of the graphics for locations are pretty. What few areas actually have music have tunes that are (mostly) nice. Nothing to write home about, but fair. The game allows you to save and autosaves at important points, so that's good. It also has an alchemical procedure for making potions that is not bad. I like the idea behind it, anyway.\n\nAnd... that's it. Now for all the overwhelming negatives. First, that decent music I mentioned? It barely ever shows up. You instead get to enjoy really repetitive and annoying noises as "music." Heck, some of the noises aren't even accurate to what they should be. For instance, the knife chopping sounds more like scratching on paper with a pencil. And if you eat cheese, enjoy the horrific crunching noise that comes with it.\n\nThe graphics in the wilderness can look nice. Too bad that's about it. The characters you meet take Uncanny Valley to the extreme. The wide grins some have when you help them are particularly disturbing. But other than that? Some of the places just look... brown. A better explanation: they are so dull in color and overall the same color that they are not appealing to look at. The protagonist's inherited house is especially bad for this. And guess what? That's where you spend the most time. Oh boy!\n\nThere is no voice acting. You get to read character dialogue, which normally would not be an issue. The problem is when it is A: horribly awkward (if anyone speaks like these people in real life, I would love to meet them) and B: needs a good dose of proofreading. The grammar is really bad, and the spelling falls flat on its face many times.\n\nI guess that means I should mention the story and characters. The story is nonsensical. Some magic book tells you to bring life to the moon. Why? Because they wanted to. Or something. You don't learn much about these ancestors of yours. They want life to be on the moon, and the unnamed protagonist is on board with this because there wouldn't be a game if he wasn't. The other characters are nameless and act utterly unrealistic. I particularly like the ones who politely greet you and immediately tell you to go away after that with rude words.\n\nAs for the gameplay... that is the crowning "achievement" here. And by that, I mean I have never seen a hidden object game with such bad gameplay. Let's ignore for a fact that I came across a glitch that stopped the game from being able to go beyond the first few minutes of gameplay. Let's ignore that someone else on the forums evidently is stuck because of a completely different glitch. If the game ran completely smoothly, this would still fail on so many levels.\n\nFirst: the items. You can collect somewhere around a hundred of the dumb things. But you can only carry fourteen, because that's realistic. Never mind if those fourteen items consist of huge wheels, rakes, and fishing rods, surely you can carry all that! The limited inventory might be there for a "challenge." If that's the idea, it doesn't work. It's not challenging to go get the items you need. What is it? Tedious. Tedious with a capital everything.\n\nSome of the hidden objects are horrible to find. There is no hint system, and I normally wouldn't care, since I've never used one before (other than to get achievements that require them being used). But if you don't have a hint system, you know what you should have? Indications of what you need to do in the game itself. The magical book sometimes does this, but there is at least one part where the book is like, "Here's a list of what you need. Where are all these items? Uh I guess one is in a cave in a forest somewhere. Good luck with the rest, LOL!" And did I mention there are about twenty different locations to visit? With NONE of them being hinted at being useful until you really start digging around? And that digging around requires our good friend "trial-and-error," something that rarely works and certainly doesn't here.\n\nThe minigames are horrendous, unless you count potion brewing, which is fine. There is one sliding stone puzzle that tends to be really sensitive about mouse clicks, causing them to rotate far more than you need them to. Shooting while drunk is an awful idea and putting it as a minigame here is an even more awful idea. The shooting-down-ships game likes to make you think you know the proper targetting system before throwing you under a rudder (and this comes from somebody who beat it first try). The mirror game is especially bad since it has a bunch of lines showing for possible reflections without letting you see how your configuration would work. And that's without getting into the cooking and fishing games, which are best left unmentioned.\n\nOh, and you can die in this game. Normally you get a warning of it and can use your health spell in time to not get wrecked. That would be fine. But there is one death that is, I am not kidding, an out-of-nowhere JUMP SCARE DEATH. I cannot begin to tell you how much of a "screw you" that is to the player. Better hope you saved recently, or that progress is gone! Before you ask, no, none of the NPCs or your character hints that this might happen until it's too late to get out of.\n\nApparently trading cards will be added. Fantastic! I can't wait to see what the utterly bland protagonist and the awkward-as-heck NPCs will look like in trading card form. I look forward to trading them out of my inventory and never looking at them again. If achievements are added, I dearly hope they are basic ones like "beat the game," because anything else is asking for far more headaches.\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, this game is bad. AMAZINGLY bad. I'm not talking about just in comparison to hidden object games made by big-name companies. The developers have said that they wanted to make a challenging hidden object game and that if the player does not want hand-holding, this is the type of game for them. Well, guess what? I don't like hand-holding. There is a major difference between "challenging" and "utterly nonsensical." This game is the latter. I also like how when the only other reviewer of this game on Steam (at this time) mentioned the lack of hints, the developers gave this reasoning... and then linked them to a walkthrough. There are no words for this.\n\nThis is the worst hidden object game I have ever played, with very few positives to go against the incredible amount of negatives. I am glad to have finished it just so I can take it off my backlog and never look at it again. When I saw a bundle with it, I got said bundle mainly because I was curious about this game. Thank goodness other games came with it, or I would feel utterly robbed for even the $1 (or was it $2?) price I spent on it. Avoid this game like the plague unless you really enjoy absurd gameplay, awful minigames, bad spelling and grammar, boring characters, and nonsensical story-telling. And if you enjoy all of those for some reason, you probably still don't want to get this. If you do, good luck to you, and hopefully you find some good qualities that I missed among all of its rubbish.\n\nEDIT: Trading cards have been added! I went ahead and left the game on for two or so hours to grind them out so I could get rid of them. Guess what? One of the cards is named incorrectly. "Guard" is actually not a guard. That I know this and the creators don't really says something.","February 21","false","8.4"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","43","52","6","27"

King's Quest 1-7? Dominated. Putt Putt? Decimated. Dark Years. World mother♥♥♥♥in Record. Jack Orlando. Let's say, if it was a woman, it'd be spermed right now.\n\nSo when the renowned developers behind the masterpiece that was SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS-City of Fools presented me with a new adventure game placed throughout time and space, even allowing me to venture into the future, I knew I was in for a ride, and this ride was one I did not want to get off of, because that ride was a really good ride, and I spent at least 40 minutes in the shower contemplating what my next move was, and that made really excited to continue, but that excitement didn't last long, because I found that it never ENDED, thus making my adventure in this game...\n\n\ncompletely ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis game was great, but. I'm not gonna lie, I smoked salvia ten or eleven times during my playthrough—it's the only way to truly experience this game. If you aren't ready to reach the levels of cognitive awareness necessary to defeat this game. You squares who play video games completely cobra simply amaze me. I mean, how can you do it? Boring.\n\nAnd let me tell you something, I was a librarian. I know boring.\n\nBut just like learning the dewey decimal system, this game has a steep curve when it comes to mastering the mechanics. Oh, there's an egg in the refrigerator and sand outside? You have combine them to make a sand egg to properly open the basement spider door.\n\nBut for you small-brained, small-bodied, small-legged, small-dicked grass men, this game should NOT be on your list. Because you'll run to your miniature parents crying your miniature tears which will roll down your miniature face. Liliputian homunculi. So this is for you shoe house dwellers. Stay away.\n\nAnd to these tiny hand having, tiny toe having, little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that wrote reviews before me.

Lacks polish is what defines it better. The good: it's somehow fun, you'll mix items together to make potions, you'll cast spells, bend time and space and rewrite history.\n\nNow the bad - and there's a lot! The sounds are awful, music is almost inexistent. The magic transitions are a bit long considering you'll see them like a trillion times. Scrolling thru the inventory is a bit of a hassle and you do feel like a walking general store. Moving around is also a hassle, you click 4 small buttons located around your game screen. But what really kills the game is the total lack of directions, specially at the beginning: you're thrown into a house without knowing what to do at all, so the game starts basically as an escape game. But there's a ton of objects to pick, yet they're all useless as you first have to get to the basement and ultimately to a book which will open up the gameplay dramatically and finally give a meaning to the gazillion items to pick... The player SHOULD be guided direclty toward the basement thru hints or something, instead of being left alone wandering thru a couple of screens, picking up stuff for nothing. They could implement a story telling to do that, to flesh it out a bit. That lack of directions is constant through out the game and you WILL be forced to go look for a walkthrough online to make it out. Pathetic. The first part of the game where you make potions was indeed fun but afterward you're left with a dozen of time and space places, with a trillion items that can all be picked up; and that makes a LOT of possibilities. At one point you'll simply follow the online walkthrough line by line because you will be totally lost... And even so you'll be wandering how the hell you were supposed to guess this or that!\n\nAnother thing I really didn't like was the mini games. They're well done but they're way too long and cannot be skipped. Yes, we're in the 21st century and this game have unskippable mini-games! Amazing. And they're so long, uhhh: the fishing game took me half an hour! Yup, thirty minutes! I almost fell asleep from boredom. Why did I have to fish so many fishes that I could feed an army of cats?! That was useless. The shooting one was way shorter but dreadfull - mostly because you clearly don't want to miss it and be forced to restart it - and thank God I made it from the first time otherwise I would have eaten my monitor.\n\nThe other problem is the 'originality': yes the time & space travelling seems original but not at all in HOGs where it's become common practice, to the point where it's becoming a meme. I played like 50 HOGs games that used time & space travelling as game and story mechanics and I'm pretty sure there's a hundred of other ones I didn't get my paws on yet. The best HOG that used that time travelling trick is a very old one - now a cult classic - called The Mushroom Age; which they seemed to have ripped off but whatever. And same thing goes for casting spells and making potions, dozens of games used that already. Green Moon feels like a yet another rehash, trying to reinvent the wheel but failing at even making it round. Why play Green Moon when there's dozens of games out there that do the same thing but do it better, with a story ark, characters and no inventory management hassle?\n\nI already played 3 hours and didn't even finish it but half of the play time was lost in endless mini games and being lost wondering what to do. So no, I won't be finishing it and no, I do not recommend it unless it undergoes a severe rework/patching. Green Moon as it is now is the Green Stench of the Moon.","February 28","false","4.6"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","17","23","3","0"
