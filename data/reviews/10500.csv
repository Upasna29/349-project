As such, it will not adress basic gameplay that is inherent in all Total War games, such as turn based production and real time battling, but rather will compare Empire: Total War with other Total War titles.\n\nAs a Total War fan, my personal preference goes to this title, Empire. I like most Total War games, but Empire stands out to me. For one, I enjoy the historic time period. For two, it plays the most 'different' from the other titles.\n\nOlder titles, such as the first Rome: Total War game and Medieval II, heavily favour an agressive play style, with a lot of chaotic melees. Later games, such as Rome II and Shogun II, lean more towards a balanced stance between agression and response, depending on how superior your battlefield position and force is.\n\nEmpire: Total War, in contrast, is a game of patience. Instead of charging into melee, the gameplay entails meticulously positioning lines of infantry and laying down volleys of fire. Mirorring the idea of the age, it is the 'gentleman's edition' of Total War. The Fall of the Samurai expansion to Shogun II comes closest to the Empire style of play, with rifle armed infantry and gatling guns, and keeps the option to go into melee samurai charge mode, but Empire remain the only edition (excluding Napoleon: Total War) to favour a line to line exchange of fire.\n\nAnother difference is the naval battles. Granted, later editions in the Total War series incorporate these as well, but Romans or Edo era Japanese boats firing on one another with arrows pale next to the awesome power of a multiple deck ships of the line wailing away at one another. Again, Fall of Samurai introduces ironclad ships that approach this somewhat.\n\nOf course, later titles have more recent, better developed versions of some of the aspects of Empire, and there are some other downsides to Empire. As usual with a Total War title, Creative Assembly has a tendency to leaving things not as smooth as they could have been. Most bugs have been smoothed out after release, as they usually are, but some small problems remain here and there (such as batteries of cannon simply not firing unless directed to do so in a very specific way).\n\nAdditionally, while the battles themselves offer some of the most unique Total War battle experiences, the map campaign improves little on previous editions. Not that this is necessary, because the region based resources and capture cities work well for the entire series. However, there is one significant improvement to me here, and that is that the map spans the most territory of any Total War game. Where Rome II limits itself to Europe and North Africa, and Shogun II is set in Japan, Empire scopes the entire Western dominated world of the Elizabethan age: Europe, North America, Africa and the Indies. The later release Napoleon: Total War does not nearly reach the score Empire does, and its campaigns are focused on smaller scale conquest rather than the world theatre of Empire.\n\nAs for the research system, it seems that the Empire title marks the start of an overhaul, where the series starts mimicing the more traditional 'tech tree' idea that prevails in many strategy games. This is not a bad thing, but it is an addition that was perhaps not entirely necessary. All the more so because sometimes it seems like a shoehorn to introduce the game's traditional late game obstacle. Every Total War game has some sort of hindering mechanic that makes the game prgressively more difficult as time advances. In Empire, research (which you need to keep up with your modernizing rivals) introduces squalor, which makes for an unhappy populace, which makes you either have to sink money into keeping them happy or have to deal with rebellions.\n\nIf you prefer a more agressive slugfest in a game, I would suggest Rome II, Shogun II, or if you don't mind some more antiquated aestethics and graphics, Medieval II.\nIf you like your games new and crisp, the more recent titles are sure to be your thing as well. If you want a more modern game that still uses line infantry and gun batteries, Shogun II's Fall of the Samurai expansion is your ticket.\n\nBut if you want a true, professional standing army of line infantry that knows how to hold under fire as well as deliver it, if you want to be a gentleman general of standing, if you want an 18th century battlefield, then this, my friend, this is the game for you.","December 31, 2014","true","475.0"," 338 of 348 people (97%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","97","338","348","10","6"

This was a hard time for many hardcore TW fans and many were really annoyed with it or still are. This is understand able, because many of the bugs were silly at least, as well some of the patches made things worse but did not improve problems. So players become feeling to be the beta testing object for CA for a still bought, but very bugged game and this is not acceptable.\nEmpire is now running very good, but in combination with Darth Mod which improves the game to a status, which normally should be delivered by Creative Assembly itself in my opinion. I don't know in detail how Darth and his modding team did improve, but the result is only great. For example, the AI was really improved - not that AI becomes a smart enemy in campaign, but the acting was put by Darth into good rails of logical issue. Some things were improved by simple overwriting, for example the masses of merchant ships build by AI insteed war ships with the simple solution to let recruit smaller war ships (up to 4th class) in merchant ports too.\nI played Napoleon very often too and some of the the improvements here are missing in Empire. Napoleon itself is very interesting too, but for me too local and too small as campaign map.\nTo be honest, the following Shogun TW and RTW-2 brought further, very good improvements in game, but these games did not convince me to play further. RTW-2 has for me a very bad graphic and game hub design which did me more annoy as giving fun.\nIn conclusion, Empire is still my favorite TW game and still makes fun after nearly 3,500 hours game time!","December 26, 2013","true","588.4"," 191 of 209 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","191","209","0","17"

When you start, you take control of country represented by a historic monarch during the year 1700 AD. Each turn represents a time of six months giving you winter and summer.  Each season will affect the production and movement of armies/agents. The world encompasses North America, Europe, East Europe/Russia, North Africa, India, and part of the Middle East.  You will have the options to engage in war, diplomacy and trade. Each and every city in the game is conquerable by the armies that you will recruit, train, and lead into battle. The game ends at the year of 1800 AD, by this time you will hopefully have conquered the world through military might backed by a sterling economy.\n\nDepending on the country that you will need to work with different types of governments ranging from a democracy to anarchy. Each has it advantages as well as negatives aspect. Your type of government will affect how other nations in the game will perceive you. Their diplomacy will be altered accordingly. As the years in the game progress the people in it will become older and eventually die. When this happens in a monarch, dictatorships etc. the rulers oldest child will become the next ruler.\n\nAs you progress through the campaign, your nations will need to have its infrastructure upgraded to continue to compete on a worldwide level. Each building you have within your borders will contribute to your nation whether it is economically, scholarly or militarily. Each building has a construction tree that can be accessed through the in game encyclopedia.  Eventually you will need to research new technology to build the next level of building or troops.\n\nEventually you come to a crossroads with a fellow nation. When this happens you will be forced to settle your differences in the field and oceans of the world. You have a wide verity of infantry, cavalry and artillery you can choose to build your navies and armies out of each group is divided into subcategories each with its own benefits.\n\nEmpire is a game that I have enjoyed for a long time.

This particular TW has set its name apart from all the others in the series for a few specific reasons. Being the fifth title in the series and the first Total War game to solely focus on guns & artillery, it had big expectations. However, upon it's release it generally got mixed reception. Many people criticized it negatively, but I believe it to be one of the better Total War games.\n\nPros:\n- Three separate theatres of war\nThe Americas, Europe, India, and four theatres of trade.\n- 11 Major Nations to choose from.\n(All factions playable with mods)\n- The Road to Independence Campaign\nSeparated into four parts, this game mode acts as a tutorial as a general campaign. You found the Jamestown/Virginia colony and expand, fight in the French-Indian Wars alongside Britiain as the 13 Colonies, rebel and fight the British at Bunker Hill, and finally form The United States.\n- Amazing Land and Sea battles.\nFight Land, Siege, and Naval battles. ETW introduced naval battles with the historical, monsterous Ships of the Line.\n- 100 years to play (1700-1800)\n2 turns per year. 100 years. 200 turns\n- Great Historical Battles\n- A Vast technology tree parted into thirds.\nEnlightenment, Economics, and Military\n- Religion is a major factor for the last time in a Total War series.\n[/i]Choose your state and spread their religion to conquered lands.[/i]\n- Revolutions!\nOne of the best features in the game and certainly the most notable. Choose from 3 kinds of government; Absolute Monarchy, Constitutional Monarchy, or dare you be...a Republic? This was the age of many revolutions, and as such, you'll choose whether to uphold the status quo and put down rebellions or begin a revolution against your own nation.\n- Multiplayer Land, Naval, or Siege battles.\n\n-----------\n\nCons:\n- The AI[/b] as in many TW games, is not all that great.\n- Minor bugs & glitches.\n- Unfair rep in the TW family.\n\nDLC- The Warpath Campaign\nPlay as any of the 5 Native American factions fighting amongst themselves and the foreign invaders. This is a mediocre and very difficult DLC.\n- Elite Units (Sold Separately)\nThese include; Elite Units of the West, Elites Units of the East, Elite Units of America, and the Special Forces & Bonus Content\n\nI recommend buying all of the Elite Unite packs. The Warpath Campaign is one of, if not the only Total War DLC that I do not recommend.\n\nVerdict:\n9/10\nThere are probably just as many negative critics of the game as there are fans, but this is truely one of the great Total War games to present day. If you like guns, you'll love this addition. There's so much replay value on this game (hense my hours played) and I really do recommend it to those looking to buy a TW game.

When I feel like some quick entertainment a little Road to Independence is in order.  This is especially fun when you put it on the hardest setting and promptly cream the red coats at Bunker Hill.  Watching them run away is completely gratifying.\n\nOnce in awhile it is enjoyable to sink a Spanish Galleon with an 18 gun sloop.  It's nice to have guns that shoot farther than the big boy's guns.  Layoff in the distance, knock out the masts with chain, and then have at the immobile hulk.\n\nAs far as campaigns, so far I've taken on England, Prussia, Austria, Maratha, and the United Provinces.  The biggest challenge to date was playing the Dutch.  They are badly spread out and there is too much to defend.  However, on the 4th try I finally figured out that the road to success was to simply abandon trying to defend Ceylon.  Milk it for the money while you can, but when Maratha invades it's time to pack up and leave.  There will be a time to come back to get it later.\n\nIf you concentrate on the Dutch army at home, and play aggressively with small armies in the Americas it's possible to make headway in the Americas while you knock out France quickly and early.  This breaks up their American colonies and you can pick them off one by one.  The European army needs to work quickly.  Once France is out it's time to take out Spain.  Those galleons are big and tough and with Spain out, its colonies also break up.\n\nWith America firmly in hand (say 10 or so provinces) and with another 10 or so in Europe it's time to raise that army and go back and take Ceylon.  Maratha is a lot easier target than Prussia and Sweden, and those elephants aren't nearly as tough as they look at first.\n\nI've been playing the current game for a LONG time now.  It's 1783, and the United Provinces control all of India, all of Europe except for Greece and 12 Ottoman provinces, and all of the Americas except for the northern Indian provinces, Quebec, and 8 US provinces.  Austria just fell (Hungary, Austria, and Bavaria all fell on the last turn).  I'm repositioning troops, and will invade Greece with 2 armies.  These will be positioned for a quick attack on Rumelia, while individual armies go after the other two provinces the Ottomans have in Europe proper.  Other armies will fall on the Middle Eastern provinces, and 2 armies will be ferried to Africa to take out their two African provinces.\n\nI'm currently fighting in America with 3 armies, but will transfer armies from Europe as soon as possible to conquer 100% of the world before 1799.  I'm also 4 turns away from researching all technologies, also a first for me.  Great game, I'm thinking of trying either Russia or Poland next.  Not sure I'll ever play the frogs.  It's too much fun watching France get eliminated.\n\nAnother fun thing to do is to defend a fort against forces that badly outnumber you.  Occasionally the computer sends my guys out the gates or over the walls at the enemy, but if you pay attention you can order them back inside so that they don't get wiped out.  Nice to hold the fort at the end of a long battle with all of the enemy units broken and fleeing the field!\n\nDefinitely recommend the game.  I save frequently so can always back up to a prior save if a glitch comes up.  I've found that the glitches don't tend to repeat themselves.","October 11, 2015","true","553.1"," 87 of 96 people (91%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","91","87","96","19","5"

My country, Great Britain, had just been through a century of unparalleled turbulence: an unwelcome joining of Scotland and England; religious strife; civil wars; an executed king; military dictatorship; a populist monarch restored; and the overthrow of a second king. Less than 15 years ago, the hated Catholic James II was forced into exile in the Glorious Revolution and a Protestant monarchy restored. A short, vicious war in Ireland put paid to any chance of a Catholic Stuart restoration. Nonetheless, the exiled James Stuart has sympathisers, the Jacobites, throughout Britain. Despite - or perhaps because of - this turbulent history, Britain is an engine driving the scientific and cultural advancement of northern Europe; turmoil foils creativity.\n\nMy job was fueled by my ambition and patriotism. I was to turn my country, previously fighting internally, to face outwards across the sea. Take possession of colonies in the America's and India. Destroy the French. Create the East India Company. Destroy the French. Take the archiapelago of Meditterannean islands and turn them into naval bases. Destroy the French. Use these naval bases to invade mainland Europe. Destroy the French. Claim global domination. Burn down Paris.\n\nI successfully did this and brought glory to myself and country in a short space of time in the 18th century.\n\nThen I came home and decided to play Empire: Total War, it was pretty good.","July 24, 2015","true","480.7"," 81 of 100 people (81%) found this review helpful 119 people found this review funny","81","81","100","119","0"

It's a good system, smooth flowing and surprisingly good detail in graphics for having so many soldiers on screen at one time. It's focused on the late 1700s around the colonization of the Americas. It allows you to play as multiple factions in a type of free play. It's not an overwhelming story depth but for RTS games they are more for replay ability in my opinion. I've done several world domination games and it never gets old. Play as Britain, France, Spain, Sweden or somewhere else. You choose.\n\nMy only complaint in games like world domination where your goal is to take over the world (obvious right?) you can't play as small factions like the American Colonies. Personally I would like to train them and slowly build them to take over the world but it's not an option. This game thought is a pretty amazing Real Time Strategy and trust me I've play a lot of RTS games and this one is a great one.

I managed to pick it up for £3.75, and seeing the high scores it was achieveing on metacritic on fueled my purchase. And for what it turned out I bought, £3.75 was a steal!\nThe game itself may seem a little daunting at first as you meet the gigstntic map, and play your first RTS battle, but as you begin to gain experience, and attempt to control the world, you pick it up very quickly and easily.\nThe whole turn based strategy map that you control is fantastically done, as you feel almost god-like when peering down at the continents. The AI may not be the smartest, but with a few simple mods, you can almost feel them breathing down your neck everytime you make your move. The Technology tree has to be one of the best I've had the privilege to play around with, as I could instantaneously feel the effects of my chosen advancement.\nThe RTS is the best I have ever played, with the vastness of iit all taking your breath away. Controlling 100s if not 1000s of troops with just a click of your mouse is always a joy to play, and I have taken many screenshots of my epic moments on the battlefield. Like X-com, you'll forge stories foy ur troops as you valiantly defeat a far superior army, or cumple under an army of only 300.\nThe era is also very interesting with the use of muskets. This adds an interesting dynamic to the battles, and requires quick thinking to ensure your men are set up correctly to take down the opposing line. For this reason, cavalry are of upmost importance and requires that little edge to out maneuver the opponent.\nEmpire: Total War has to be one of my most satuisfactory purchases, and has given me a bottomless well of enjoyment, and I would still be playing it if my life allowed me. Nevertheless I find myslef dipping in now and then often to match up against my brother, after a petty quaral.

It has a greatly expanded campaign map, tons of factions, and a much better diplomacy interface. On the downside, the AI is rather difficult, and often borders on(and crosses into...) being incredibly dumb. Battle mechanics are great, with better UI, better graphics, and expanded options. I like the "take cover" selection that allows units to hide in buildings, or next to fences. They handled the change from melee-based combat, with little "ranged combat", to a system with very nearly soley "ranged" combat mecanics very, very well. The addition of Naval Battles is an extrordinary change, as all previous games had the "autobattle" for sea combat(or in the case of med 1, random battles popping up as 'events' against the primarily land-based campaign), and i throughly enjoyed learning how to command such a sea battle. If you're looking for a TW game, or even just a nice game to play, and one that will not be a "short play-through", then i heartfully recomend ETW.\n\n10/10 for me.","July 25, 2014","true","140.7"," 54 of 61 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","54","61","0","0"

These technologies directly affect income, military advancement and building options, fuelling your progress towards modern industrialisation with factories and steam mines.\n+ Decent graphics.\n+ Massive campaign map to play on, including the Americas, Europe and India which results in a lot of replayability and exploration.\n+ Good selection of campaign map agents. Rakes honourably duel other rakes, sabotage enemy cities and carry out assassinations. Religious agents like missionaries, brahmin or imams convert the population, and gentlemen can steal enemy research from universities or speed up technology acquisition in your own.\n+ Real-time tactical battles where you can command up to thousands of soldiers, cannons and cavalry at the same time. Naval battles also feature in this game and they're quite epic!\n+ Realistic diplomacy system.\n+ Good trading system. The 18th century was centered on lucrative trade operations with other countries and this is reflected in Empire: Total War. Export cotton, tea, cocoa and sugar from your plantations to other nations for gold.\n+ Huge assortment of units at your disposal. With the addition of DLC packs (which aren't expensive) every nation has unique units and each playthrough feels different.\n+ Multiplayer mode so you can play battles against a friend if they have the game.\n+ Four difficulty levels that will match a player of all skill levels - very hard is a true challenge!\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Battle AI could be more intelligent.

It is the next installment in the Total War series. Empire: Total War set in 18th century.\n\nEmpire: Total War still retain some gameplay element from the previous Total War, but majority of it were improved and changed. Settlement are no longer centralized, now each province also include minor towns and villages that deal with trade or technology aside from the central settlement. This allow factions to disrupt a province's productivity without assaulting the main settlement. Diplomacy, taxation, and trade have been someway streamlined which means less faction micromanagement. In the previous Total War, governor needs to be appointed in each settlement and each governor only affect the settlement where he present. In Empire: Total War, we appoint ministers to form a cabinet or court to govern the nation, which mean the ministers will affect the whole nation settlement. Also a research tree has been implemented. The way agent works has also been changed. There are only 3 types of agent now, Rakes, Missionary and Gentlemen. For the first time in Total War series, a naval battle has been added where you can engage in ship to ship battle, boarding enemy ships and such. Naval battle is the most epic gameplay in this game. Land battles now takes different approach. You now will command army of musket rifleman who no longer engage in melee combat, and artillery cannons will play big roles in each battle.\n\nEmpire: Total War also has better and improved graphics. Everything from the skies to the ground has been improved. You will see a lot of smoke effect now from the fired rifle and field cannons. Water shaders is the best improvement in the game, makes naval combat more epic. Units animation are more smooth than ever, but still not optimized when they stationed on fort walls.\n\nPerformance of Empire: Total War is good but not really optimized. The game will run just fine most of the time, and is playable regardless.\n\nEmpire: Total War is the next generation of Total War series after Medieval 2: Total War. With improved gameplay and graphics, the game is really good.

I have not only been playing that genre, but I always returned. The first game I ever brought on Steam was "Empire Total war".\n\nI fell in love with this game at first sight. So many possibilities with everything. You are the leader of your own nation. You have total control, which can lead to the rise of a mighty empire or the fall of a small.\n\nKeep good relations with the major nations and keep your economy in check. I myself have played this a lot, so I always play at at least hard difficulty. This will give you a feeling of really fighting for every land, instead of just conquering like if it was a piece of candy in a candystore.\n\nMost of historic games today are about the 20-century, so I really apreciatted this game. It is really cheap now, and even through it is a little old now, then it is still a classic. If you want the graphics and gameplay to fit the new times, then download the mod "Darthmod" to the game. It makes it better than before <333\n\nI rate this game 1933/10","May 11","true","404.8"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","24","25","2","0"

It is more up to date than Medieval II (good game) and playes much better than Napoleon or Shogun II. Shogun II runs badly and has balance issues, whereas Napoleon has few enemies (although those few enemies have large territories.)\n\nYou get to perform research in Empire. I do wish the research tree was larger for Battle and Economic areas. It is very large on Philosophy.\n\nThe units are nice. All three arms of the military, infantry, cavalry and artillery, are equal in this time period and thus all three types of units have a role on the battlefield. Having a good mix of these works really well.\n\nGenerals can be appointed easily and troops can move and attack without generals.\n\nTrading is neat. Diplomacy works well too.\n\nShip battles are cool.\n\nAnyway, this is a good Total War title. I had no problems getting the game to run in Win 7 64-bit.

This game has been patched more than my old pair of highschool jeans, and yet, diplomacy and declarations of war are still seemingly decided by the toss of a coin, rather than the global situation. Increasing the difficulty level doesn't even make things more demanding on the battlefield (The AI has the mental ability of a toddler, even on the very hard setting) but on the campaign map, someone decided that making the game "challenging" on higher difficulties involves every nation declaring war on you at the same time very early on for no reason.  Difficutly should be based around the player's skill level and their ability to complete REALISTIC objectives - Having every nation jump on you like the crabs of a million ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, does not meet this criteria. Furthermore, the only way I'm able to reliably establish trade with other nations is for me to offer the technological equivilent of a thermonuclear weapon, in exchange for the ♥♥♥♥ing wheel. If you're patient, and you enjoy 18th century history and warfare like I do, then please play this game with mods enabled to avoid a headache. Otherwise, play Shogun 2, or any of the previous Total War games as they are far superior to this game.","October 22, 2015","false","925.6"," 64 of 96 people (67%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","67","64","96","12","13"

It's target audience is narrow, but chances are you're interested in this genre if you bothered to scroll down to the reviews.\n\nThe biggest point on this game is that it's time consuming. VERY time consuming. With a schedule like mine you can't get much done within one sit-down, but that keeps making me come back for more, for better or worse.\n\nAs for historic accuracy, I'm moderately educated on the time era of this game, but some events don't really add up. The AI's don't really act in accordance to actual history. For instance, Sweden likes to destroy Denmark within 15 seasons. I've also run into the problem with my closest allies suddenly declaring war on me, even though we're in "very friendly" relations.\n\nAside from those problems, this game has great complete features. The armies and naval battles play out well, and the detail is good for an older game.

It is all about historical gameplay in the 18th century.\nIt is worth every penny and it really deserves its positive reviews.\nIt is time for my own review after I got the last achievement in Empire:\n(My review is based on the game without mods) [v1.6]\n\nPro\n+ Although the game is from 2009 the graphic ist still good\n+ Interesting and nice battlefields: Take cover in buildings, fields, hiding behind walls and fences etc.\n+ Unit detail is good and the animations are well made\n+ Naval battles need a bit exercise but once you know how it works they are great\n+ Huge map (You can fight in North America, a bit in South America, Europe, partly Africa, Russia and India)\n+ Trading routes in South Africa, South America and in the Asian regions to boost your income\n+ There is a Pirate faction (Caribbean)\n+ Fighting with firearms, cannons etc. is a great experience\n+ Huge battles\n+ Units talk to you in their own language\n+ You can place "forts" on the campaign map\n+ Technology research is made in universities and divided in more branches\n+ You can steal technologies\n+ Religion and diplomacy\n+ Weather effects\n+ Native Americans\n+ Armies can destroy important villages etc.\n+ Great sound, ambient music = great feeling\n+ Revolutions (can create a new faction with its own flag etc.)\n+ Historical background information\n+ A high replayability due to the whole feeling of this historical era, captured in this detailed game\n+ Friendly fire!\n\nCon\n- The AI is sometimes gamebreaking bad. It is passive and has a bad pathfinding. Simply, it has often no strategy...\n- There is no multiplayer campaign or a co-op mode\n- Sieges are, how can I say it... boring, nearly everytime the same sh...\n- No general or admiral speeches. I mean, it's an era for heroes and you have nothing to say to motivate us?\n- Generals are weak and have no real skills\n- Although the naval battles are great, I wish they were more polished if you know what I mean\n- Pirate faction unplayable\n- The drummers play always the same "marching" sound\n- I wish there had been partly a real soundtrack with music of the era\n- I miss expeditions in South America and Native factions on that continent\n- I'm not sure but slavery in colonies or in general is not existing at all\n- Diplomacy is good but it really could have been more than what it is now...\n- Friendly fire!\n\nConclusion\nAll in all, Empire is a great game. The 18th century is a fresh and interesting era to play. There is a lot to discover and to conquer. Also, there are a lot of interesting mods to install.

The conquest of Denmark also meant my borders now touched the north sea via recently subjugated Norway.\n\nNow I turn eyes to Poland, who are already at war with my other enemy Prussia, while also at war with Austria, though it seems Austria and Prussia are experiencing hostilities making it a bloody 3 way conflict, something i aimed to turn to my advantage. I figured on taking the territories i needed and then ensuing peace with them so that they can primarily focus on the Germans, and if the Prussians are weakened enough, go for Brandenburg, if not, go for Russia.\n\nAs it turns out, my invasion of Poland did not go so smoothly, as I was engaged with repeated revolts from Patriots who will not settle down to the Swedish Banner flying above Warsaw, who can blame them really? It's land and honour at stake. But this mean't my recovery process for my armies was delayed along with ratifying a treaty for the Poles since I was not so willing to give any tech away. After a while I settled to give some tech away as I knew i wouldn't be bothering with them any more at least on the international stage, but still, even after the treaty is signed, the Patriots are still giving me grief.\n\nAfter a while the Peasants finally accepted that their leaders had abandoned them and now the Swedes were the new authority here. FINALLY I thought to myself, now for the biggies. In my past game I went for Prussia, as they were weakened considerably by the Poles and Austrians last time enough for me to sneak in and grab the prize right from their jaws, however in this game, it was not the case, the prussians were still fortified and given that the Austrians were bogged down reclaiming lost lands by them, I decided to focus on Russia instead...I've taken Moscow before, I can do it again.\n\nSo, initial invasion went well, so it was full steam ahead to Moscow! However it seems the city was too heavily defended for me to to take out due to a nearby army that was stationed outside providing reinforcements, so i decided to lay siege in attempts to starve them to surrender or at least weak enough for me to engage should they pick a fight, after 2 turns however, they decided to engage with a force still strong enough to outnumber me 2:1.\n\nAnd so the battle of Moscow played through, though it did bug me how that I WAS ON THE DEFENSIVE o_0. Don't know how that works out but there, anyways I played the battle out, first i suicide charged most of my cavalary into their own cavalary which had inf and cannon support (not my brightest idea but i figured i could pick their numbers out and their most dangerous for my main force to handle). After a while the Russians ended up doing what it looked like a mass route, who seemed to have all panicked when they were unable to break my defensive positions, along with the fact i was able to slaughter their weakened cavalary with my own inf.\n\nThe remenants of their force was made of 1 cavalary, 1 line infantry, and a bunch of cannons that took positions in a narrow ridge. Had to rely on inf. as my cavs were all dead from my earlier suicide attack I mentioned. So I first charged in with some inf, but were seriously weakened by shrapnel shots from the cannons of my enemy, and even though they reached their positions, ended up routing, my inf i placed on a hill in attempt to pick them off didnt help either as the terrain didnt offer a good enough LOS for most of my men to fire. So after a second attack on the flank, with the enemy occupied with targeting my men on the hill i was able to finally silence those annoying cannons, their remaining cavalary tried to help but with support of other regiments of line inf i was able to force the last of their units to route, and seal the fate of Moskva.\n\nI know it is probably more of a battle experience that belongs in the community forums rather than being written as a review, but i figured that you should read this and get the feels for the scale of the game before buying it, but, don't worry its not too difficult, you should have the rough and jagged parts of it worked out within a day at least i say. I think that is why I love this game, such a scope that ok, may look a bt confusing within the first hours for the newcomers but honestly, you will manage it :), and soon you will be on your own grand campaign to be the dominant 18th century superpower, like my glorious Sverige!\n\n8/10","December 25, 2014","true","279.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

Others have not been nearly so fortunate.\n\nYou'll also want to turn up the difficulty or you will wonder how the whole world wasn't conquered by this or that faction.  In the battlefield the AI is fairly poor despite if you turn up the battle difficulty and is made up for by padding the AI stats.  Still there will be times when the enemy will sit there and be happy to let you blow them appart with long range artillery fire.  I generally autoresolve as I play for the big picture.\n\nThe naval battles are nice to watch but fairly limited in tactics.  Basically you are trying to set up favorable fields of fire but generally I was able to manage favorable engagements on the campaign map eliminating the need for advanced tactics.  Essentially two lines staggered will completly crush their fleet every time.  Unless of course you failed on the campaign layer.\n\nHaven't tried MP yet because I'm an anti-social gamer.   So can't say about that one.\n\nI can see why many think this is the weakest entry in the TW series but not for me I enjoy the original Shogun and Medieval the least probably due to their age respectively.  Namely the much more limited options available.

It had the biggest map in the series to date, with three massive theaters to conquer and several small trade areas ripe for naval control. Diplomacy was massively overhauled, bringing much-needed improvements and making negotiating actually viable for once.\n\nIt also introduced several completely new features, including epic playable naval battles and a tech tree to progress through the campaign, both of which have become staples of the series. The historical battles, while great, are less polished than normal and lack the intro cutscenes that are usually featured.\n\nThere's a mini-campaign included that allows you to play as the USA through four stages of history - Jamestown, French & Indian War, American Revolution, and finally as the USA on the Grand Campaign. It's a special version of the Grand Campaign that starts at 1783 and is incredibly challenging.\n\nThe biggest downside to the game, by far, is that the DLC unit packs are more or less required to have rosters that feel complete. This was CA's first game to experiment with DLC packs and they left many elite units off of the vanilla rosters, to be included in the DLC. If you get the DLC packs, then the game is amazing, but I fear for the experience of anyone trying to play it vanilla.\n\nThe Warpath DLC is interesting, but a rather disappointing expansion campaign when compared to the others in the series.","May 7","true","717.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Empire: Total War, if I am not mistaken, is the first Total War game in the series to introduce gunplay in battles along with user controlled naval warfare. I suggest playing the previous installments before jumping into this game.\n\n\n\nNow let's talk about this game.\n\nYou start off like most Total War games by selecting who you want your faction to be. Depending on who you choose will place you on a certain part of the map. An addition to this game from the previous installments was that it used more than just Europe and a few surrounds areas. Instead it incorportated parts of Africa and North America. You could travel to the different sections of the world on your power for conquest.\n\nThe gameplay consists of the player controlling cities, armies, and special units. Same as other Total War games:\n\n-Cities: Generate Revenue, Can Create Units, Expand Your Empire, ect..\n\n-Armies: Can Conqour Cities, Defend Against Enemies, Build Forts, ect..\n\n-Special Units: Spy For Subertufuge, Assassin For High Targets, Generals, ect..\n\n\nThe main goal is the take over a certain amount of Cities before you hit a designated time period. You can fight the battles over an instant computer generated decision or you can manually control your troops on the battlefield.  Diplomacy can be made with other factions for things like trade, alliances, and much more.\n\nI enjoyed this game for the most part. While on the other hand I would recommend buying the other Total War games. Namely Rome: Total War the original and Medieval II: Total War.\n\nThanks for reading.","December 29, 2015","true","124.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

As like all excellent Total War games I recommend you take the time to play and enjoy it in all of its glory.\nCompared to previous games this one has improved graphics, more complex and in depth micro management and introducing for the first time real time naval battles. What makes this game stand out from the other games in the franchise ( & makes it more interesting) is that you have several major & micro theatres of war. Since the games is set in the time of the 17th century gunpowder units & cannons are a standard sight on the battlefield which may confuse older TW players since the main part of the battle isn't a big mellee charge with an onager or two onager to provide some support but here  its all ranged and contains a lot of artillery supprt. The campaign is a little better than in the previous games because the enemy & allied nations are no longer idly passive. The multyplayer has undergone a welcoming change and contains a ranking system & achivements. One of the differences in the games is also that most nations units are the same and the differences between them are their stats, but this is no big problem.\nOn the overall the game is a great step forward from the previous TW games & I recommend this game to every strategy game enthusiast.\nIn the case that I have forgoten to mention anything or the articlle was too subjective please inform me and I will correct it.\nThank you.","January 17, 2014","true","123.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Almost every feature and design direction taken in Medieval 2 and Empire comes directly from Rome with no alterations or improvements made and while Rome was a great and innovative game the qualities that made it so are no longer unique to the Total War series and Empire suffers because of it.\n\nIf you have somehow never played a Total War game before it can be explained fairly easily. You take command of a nation on a turn-based grand strategy map where you build up your cities and recruit armies. Eventually your enemies will meet up with the armies of other nations and you are thrown from the big strategic map into a real-time 3D tactical battle map where you have direct control of the units of your army as you try to defeat the enemy army.\n\nThe strategic map has perhaps always been recognized as the greatest weak point in the Total War games and Empire continues this tradition. The turn-based model was never made with the same care as the turn-based games of old and this shows when a small army can walk past an army ten times it's size, conquering cities and raiding the countryside with impunity and still get far enough away that the larger army won't be able to catch up with it creating a sort of cat and mouse gameplay that does your enjoyment of the game no favors.\n\nSome improvements have been made over the previous games, most notably the introduction of a tech tree that, while still based on buildings in your various provinces, gives you a more open approach to customizing your nation. The diplomacy is as broken as ever and the AI still seems completely incapable of even the simplest tasks. The AI on the campaign map is so bad that if it wasn't for the ludicrous amount of cheating it does on the higher difficulties you would be winning every campaign in ten turns or less.\n\nThe meat of the game and where Total War made it's name however is the battle map. Gone are the flaws of the campaign map and all that is left is glorious battle with thousands of soldiers at your command.\n\nThe problem here however is one that has plagued the Total War series since it's beginning but is even more apparent now that it's made the jump into Napoleonic line combat. The AI is useless. It's not just that the AI is bad, it's that it cannot perform even the simplest of tasks which makes battles against it so trivial that it's almost painful at times. You would think that the developers would have discovered a way for the AI to maintain a formation beyond the first shot fired but every time it happens, the AI falls completely apart.\n\nThe simplicity and limits of the game engine is also beginning to show as even though your soldiers are armed with musket and bayonet instead of sword and arrow now the battles still play out in much the same way as in previous games. This might be fine for a Rome or a Medieval 2 but Empire tries to emulate a very different age of war and it does not quite meet the standard of that era. Particularly if you've played the Take Command series of games you will begin to notice just how simple the tactical elements of the game have become.\n\nThe battles are beautiful and your soldiers look impressive as they march forward in formation and the sounds are top quality.\n\nIf someone who had never played a Total War game before asked me for a recommendation I'd tell him to get the newest one. Empire Total War might be a better game than Rome Total War but that is only a question of age. The Total War series used to be innovative, now they're just shallow repeats with little to look forward to.","December 6, 2012","true","376.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Overall the Fifth game of the Total War series, this was the first Total War game I have played, and I enjoyed it a great deal. I started off with the tutorial, which covers both ground unit real-time tactics, and naval warfare. Following this fast-paced, easy to use tutorial, I began playing from the Settlement of Jamestown. The learning curve was very easy with this game, and it was surprisingly fun for a turn-based game. Normally, I don't find these types of games enjoyable, but there was something about Empire: Total War that had me wanting to keep playing.\n\nHistorical challenges are available, including several notable historic battles, The Battle of Brandywine Creek, Fontenoy, and so on. Conquest is the ultimate objective of the game and this can be done using not only military units, but Exploration, Trade, Politics, and founding other colonies. You have the option of playing almost a dozen different main factions. Campaigns allow you to play through American colonisation such as Establishing the colony of Jamestown, to the French and Indian conflict, and even the War for American Independence.\n\nI really enjoyed the historical aspect of this game, and also how it is part turn-based and part real-time strategy. I think Empire: Total War does a good job of weaving the two separate game styles together into a seamless whole. I think based off my enjoyment of this game, I may enjoy some of the other Total War titles as well.","June 26, 2015","true","10.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

Of course the undeniable best TW game for me was Rome: Total War the First, which revolutionised the series and whatever genres you might want to identify in the wider title, a game which I have dumped huge amounts of hours into - amounts which grow even to this day by the occasional intense, weekend-long binge.\n\nThat opening paragraph may sound a bit contradictory - to begin with I call Empire the greatest TW title of all, then I immediately state that RTW is of course the best, but I am trying to work on a distinction, here.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that ETW was a perfect storm, if you will, a game which came at just the right time, featured just the right shift in scenery and era, brought in just the right technologies and got just the right feel of UI, interaction and general gameplay. I said before that some qualifiers exist and they do - the game is not a perfect TW title - but it gets certain things very, very right.\n\nTo elaborate then, I start with the game's position in the series. If memory serves (and really how wrong could it get) the game came after Medieval 2 and the Kingdoms expansion thereof and somewhat logically endured an advancement through the ages to the Age of Empire - but it also came at a perfect technological moment that allowed it to be a true quantum leap over it's direct predecessor in many ways. The upgrade in graphics, UI, gameplay (the introduction of smaller settlements and such on the map) and the addition of naval combat - not to mention the introduction of guns, en masse (more on the flaws of this system a bit later) - all went together to make this game feel many years ahead of the earlier titles in the series, and usher in the later era that we are now enjoying.\n\nThe Age of Empire just seems to perfectly lend itself to the Total War idea. Warefare by gun is just that bit more tactical, that bit more impactful and rhytmic. The battles - especially the open battles, far from fortresses and the select range of infuriating consequences to trying to breach walls - have real breadth for elaboration and intrigue...\n\nMy lasting memory of a battle in Empire: Total War occured when my Dutch army, emboldened by the easy capture of Norway from the Swedes, marched on their home province only to be met by all the soldiers that should have been guarding Norway on top of the standard garrison. My army consisted of a general's body guard, two run down groups of Cavalry, and three groups of riflemen - we were up against at least twice that number - and many of those units were perfectly respectable, dangerous foes with little militia riff-raff mixed in.\n\nI had retreated from battle once after blindly commiting my army to a seige and pulling out - but that very turn the Swedes marched out to put me to the sword. Terrified, I put my troops to the rear of my deployment zone, on top of a shallow hill with a small but dense wooded forest crowning it, a vague crescent of extra-steep terrain, halfway from the crest and facing towards where the enemy would come from, and another scattering of trees further down the slope but quite a way off to a flank. I arranged two groups of cavalry - including my captain - in the dense forest, and a third group off to the opposite flank behind the scattered trees, while I lined my riflemen along the top rim of the steep section, as best as I could - the rim wasn't wide enough for one group, let alone three.\n\nThe battle commenced, and a broad force of enemies set off towards my small group of men. Hanging on by the seat of my pants, I noticed a group of cavalry making a run for the flank of my riflemen that was overlooked by the dense forest, and instantly shot out both of my hidden horse groups to intercept the charge, resulting in a very quick sortie between the advancing lines and my steady riflemen. The banner of the enemy horse group flashed, marvel of marvels, and I took that as a sign to instsantly wheel around and send my horsemen back to the dense forest. briefly pursued, the opposing horse group wheeled away at the line of trees under pot shots from my riflemen, but the battle had only just begun as I sent the horses right back out again more or less instantly to counter-charge into the flanks of a huge unit of footsoldiers who had engaged my left flank. In the mean time I had done more or less the same manouver with my other flanking horsemen, breaking into the flank of a group of riflemen before wheeling away for a second charge to counter the opposing captain as they attempted to augment their advancing rifle troops with a charge by the general's bodyguard. The battle would see-saw mightily as my riflemen gamely held the high ground, wheeling this way and that to stave off probing groups of gunners, while my ragged cavalry units darted this way and that, charging, extracting themselves and charging again, trying always to lock units in pincer movements and circle around behind them to force them to flee.\n\nMiraculously, with only medium losses to ground troops and only about 50% losses to my cavalry units, I eventually forced the entirety of the enemy army to sound a hasty retreat, barring their captain! Noting that I only had one enemy left on the battlefield, I threw everything I could at him - all of my remaining horses charged his larger group from two sides,w hile up the middle charged the remainders of my three groups of riflemen, swords drawn, for the kill. A heroic victory was won that day, and with it my everlasting affection for this title.\n\nOf course, as I have hinted at, this is the greatest and grandest of the TW games in my estimations - mirroring the pomp of the setting - but it is simply not the best because of a couple of isolated by serious flaws.\n\nA) Battle Bugs\nSadly, this game suffers from a few bugs in battle situations.\n\nAt one point while I was trying to mop up some pirates in the Leeward Islands my dutch riflemen refused to open fire on pirates crouching behind a wall, despite being well in range and themselves fired upon - a group of natives who I had sent creeping around behind and sprinting along the interior of the wall likewise refused to fight the 'dug in' enemy troops unless I simply told them to run through the enemy position, forcing them to automatically swing swords at them. Likewise a group of horsemen - I love me some flanking - who had circled around the other way had to sweep through and jump over the wall in question, heading for an empty space in the middle distance, in order to finally extricate the enemies from that wall and open them up to uninhibited, bug-free slaughter.\n\nAt another point, funnily enough also against pirates but this time at Port Royale, my troops of the Maratha Confederacy (I was trying to carve out some trade routes in the Caribbean) turned up with five groups of cannon and laid waste to the city walls - but not until I had lots two cannon and crew to invisible walls which forced them to walk in mid air, and this was just a prelude to the catastrophe that would be my attempt to enter into the town through the breaches in the walls - my riflemen just about struggled through in a completey buggy way, as did my elephants and such, but then half a platoon of elephants was cut down by the enemy captain, who despite being the last surviving member of his bodyguard was enjoying some kind of god mode bug as a result of being wedged between the invisible wall of the city gate and that of a section of ruined wall. I ultimately won that battle, but the unmitigated annoyance of trying to seige that settlement put my off seige battles for the remainder of my campaign - autoresolving any town that boasted fortifications.\n\nB) Unplayable Factions\nI must end now, word limit, but the fact that you can only play the 'major factions' available at the start of the game kills my inner completionist.9/10","May 17","true","39.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Albeit released in 2009, the game is not as smooth and polished as Napoleon Total War. There are small glitches here and there, but you sort of learn to work around them. Nothing game-breaking.\n\nUnfortunately, Creative Assemblies has yet to optimize the multiplayer experience. So a lot of games may drop, lag, have cheaters who don't follow rules, and just downright noobs who don't know what the'yre doing and there's not much player-side control over it.\n\nHowever, with its flaws, I still find the multiplayer to be much more balanced and enjoyable than Napoleon Total War. Granted I play native americans most of the time, I find that the factions have many different strengths & weaknesses, and the diversity of playing style and tactics are endless. It's also really fun to ♥♥♥♥ arrogant people off by beating them with mere Axes and Arrows.\n\nI also find the strategy to be much more in-depth than Napoleon. NTW just relies on stretching out lines, artillery barrages, and cavalry charges. In empire you have to be much more selective with how you form and move your infantry on the battlefield and which units to assign to different tasks.\n\nAre the expansions worth it? If you want to play online, definitely as it will keep you in equal balance with other players, although you can still win without them. For single player, not really, as downloading expansions like darthmod will give you tons of interesting added-on units.\n\nI don't have over 1500 hours in this game for nothing. Jump in and play. The learning curve is tough at first, but playing online is a good way to get good fast and blow through enemies both in singleplayer and multiplayer.","May 13, 2014","true","342.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The main thing I like about this game, is the campain map.  technically, this map doesn't have the most settlements in the entire series, but it has the biggest map in any of the games.  You can conquer India, North America and the tip of South America, Carribeans, and Europe.  This gives it a more important feel and that your actions effect more people.  I also love the variation of units for each faction.  The american army had better skrimishers than the English, but the English's line infantry were more regimented and didn't break as easly.  I also love the audio for this game.  I would find myself scrolling up to a single unit and just listening to how well in sounded when he shot his musket.  This is also the first in the series to introduce naval battles that you can play which look beutiful, but can be confusing.  The bad part is that the A.I in this game is some of the worst I have ever seen.  Half the time, they don't even move, and the other half, they just charge at you with no strategy whatsoever.  To sum it up, this game is set in my favorite time period, and besides the cluncy AI, this game does the time period justice.","November 26, 2013","true","47.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

At it's worst, units refuse to move, stop to reform into positions you didn't tell them to, or sometimes even refuse to fire altogether. Thankfully, glitches of this magnitude are rare, but can sometimes be bad enough to cause you to lose battles because your units simply don't follow orders.\n\nOn the other hand, it's the largest Total War game. You can create colonies in, and be actively engaging in wars, across three different continents- Europe, Asia (both Asia Minor and India), and America. There's less faction variety between groups of the same continent (for example, European armies are very similar), but the variety comes in when an army of one continent engages the forces of another. Europeans, Ottomans, Indians, and Native Americans all fight differently.\n\nAs well, Empire takes place in a hugely underrepresented time period. Very few games take place in the 1700's, and Empire does a great job of representing musket warfare. Combat is slower-paced than games like Rome or Shogun 2, and tactics are focused on gaining artillery advantage.\n\nI end by recommending the game, since I enjoyed it, but your enjoyment depends strongly on your interest in the time period, and your tolerance to bugs.","July 7, 2015","true","79.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

It has so many bugs, you'd think of calling your local pest control.  The portraits for the characters in the game are..lackluster.  They didn't even bother to give the people in the portraits a background, at least in my experience with the game.  The Battle AI is absolutely random, having some brilliant moments of high-stakes deployment, but other times losing a battle they should clearly win.  I myself survived a nasty battle, playing as Sweden.  I had four regiments of line infantry, and was attacked by nearly a stack of Austrian militia and line infantry, yet I still won because the Austrian soldiers actually refused to press forward and engage me.\n\nThat last bit is the heart of the issue; this game, as incredible as the potential was for a world-wide, 18th century-based game, it is seriously undercut by the odd decisions that were undertaken. For example, I don't know who's idea it was to make every single siege battle on a city with walls look identical, but that was lazy work.  Even as far back as Rome: Total War, cities had varying shapes and sizes to their walls.  Yet things are identical, here, in the 18th century?  A time marked by decidedly huge differences in everything from one cities' religious tolerance, to troops per unit, to the ideals of the local monarch?  Creative Assembly, please.  We would rather you take longer and give us a better experience, than to hurry up and weaken the magic of your earlier works.\n\nBut, you may be reading this, and seeing that I still recommend this game.  Why is that?\n\nBecause this game does many things very well indeed.  When at 'ultra' settings, this game is very, very beautiful.  Crisp uniforms, detailed smoke clouds from mass musket volley fire, the reflective water on the campaign map.  I find it all very much a step into a new era of Total War.  And the audio is impressive, as well.  The sound of hundreds of men running and shouting in combat, the sound of cannon barrages firing and then the thumping clash of the shells landing upon the enemy, the officers' barking orders, to which a drum plays the command to the men.  As a fan of history, I can't help but find myself fully immersed in the sounds of the battle, despite the lackluster AI ability.\n\nThere is, however, a much larger reason to play this game.  A reason that fits nearly every single game since 2000.  What am I talking about?\n\nModifications.\n\nThe community for this game have made hundreds, if not THOUSANDS, of modifications for this game, ranging from changing the accuracy of the men in each regiment, to a complete and total overhaul of the game...including ridding the game of most of the issues that it was saddled with upon its release.\n\nSo yes, this game is far from perfect.  It does have many issues.  But, in the end, I will gladly recommend this game to any fan of historical affectations, or even simply those of a curious mindset.  Because despite this game not being perfect, it brings enough to the table to keep those that are willing to work through the issues entertained.\n\n\n","March 21","true","723.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

In this era, you'll encounter many strange bugs, frustrating crushes, unfinished mechanics and weak technical support. Additionally you'll play the last hardcore and innovative Total War game in the series. Empire Total War is a broken game with beautiful features. It's story is similiar to Rome 2 Total War.(another warscape game) It was released unfinished and broken. After one year, they fixed some serious bugs and let the mod community complete it. At the end of the day customers had a game with game-breaking bugs and poor AI even efforts of great mod community. Getting back to the game, early modern warfare concept works well and using gunpowder units is entertaining. But my advice is stay away from naval and siege battle features. These parts of the game are still buggy and frustrating after many updates. Campaing map is huge and there are many empires to pick. Unit diversity is satisfaying, especially if you play with non-european empires. European nations fight each other with the similiar line infantry and its upgraded versions. Maratha Confederacy and Ottoman Empire have interesting units to play like war elephants and janissaries. You can combine their melee units with their weak rifleman and try different strategies against modern european armies. Battle AI is terrible but thanks to the early modern warfare concept and line battle tactics which hide AI's meaningless decisions, you can play as if there is no huge problem.(Units are generally static except cavalary) Other features like trade system, goverment management and technology development are well desingned. If you really want to play this buggy game you should get DarthMod to enhance your gameplay.

Of all these games, Empire:TW brought the biggest satisfaction. The game might be getting old now, but it`s glory doesn't fade. Even if you never played Total War games before, this is a must buy for any RTS fan.\nStarting from the graphics. Like said, some time passed since it`s release, but never the less, when put on max. settings it is still beautiful. The sound is done quite well. I enjoy every round of shots made from the infantery, the roar of canons, the thousands of feet marching to the beat of the drum, the hissing of primitive missiles in the air.....\nThe game itself gives you a lot of feautres. The two singleplayer modes let you play as some of the greatest nations of the time, from Prussia to the Maratha Confederacy (the other SP mode let`s you play as the United States on their way to independence). Your job is to form alliances, make trade, conquer areas, defeat your enemies, develop your nation, and if you feel like it, you can always coup the monarchy and establish a republic. The campaign itself is turn based, moving your armies and agents in a pre-set range of movement each season, governing your cities and doing some diplomacy along the way. The battles on the other hand are real-time, but you can change the speed of battle from slow-motion all the way to fast. The map on which you play on is determined by the region you are fighting in. Battles can be either the classical land battles, sieges or naval battles. If you don't feel like doing a battle, but you have good chances, simply click autoresolve (save the battle just in case you get defeated). The multiplayer is also quite good, letting several players play as their favourite nation and setting up their army. You can join your friends and fight bots, do 1v1, or a large scale battle of up to 6 players 3v3.\nWords simply can't desribe the awesomeness of this game, but at least I tried. Buy it, just do it, you won't make a mistake.","January 8, 2014","true","139.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While in a later, sort of patched mode, Empire total war is still an amazing game without any mods at all. People blame Empire for all bad things, but when it comes down to it, Empire TW was the first game with a new battle engine that really had the capability to capture all the glory and death in Europe during the 18th CenturyAD. One of the best parts about it, is the Road to Independence Campaign, or the "America" campaign where you begin as the British in the "New World", and move to rising up and furthering the greatness of the American Republic. Empire TW is truly a great game for those who enjoy American history, and the 18th Century.","December 15, 2015","true","118.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Every single European nation has *Line Infantry* Which are EXACTLY the same skin exept differant colors. The Same uniform. So battles look like a bunch of multi colored clones shooting at each other. Theres also *Regament of Horse* Which almost every European nation has by defult and theres absolutly no differance but once again differant colors. Each nation also has the same ships. There are a few units although that differ. If you want some real differance spend your money on DLC for expensive or Overpowered Units. Theres also the unbalanceness of Empire.

Finally, I feel that it conquering a region shouldn't be a case of simply taking the regional capital, the fact that armies can raid factories and farms etc, as well as occupy them, it should give the option for that nation to incorportate this into their own empire, therefore reducing the size of the region that lost these buildings and also providing more tactical gain. It would make conquering regions much more realistic in my opinion.

I have spent hours upon hours lost in this game world. It was for me such an amazing experience - my introduction to Steam, the introduction of sea battles in the Total War franchise, the historical period.\n\nIt was a step down in some aspects - the "clone" armies vs the unique variations in Medieval II (my favorite Total War to date), the bugs at launch, but the sheer scope and size of it all is absolutely fan-f-ing-tastic. This Total War was the first one that really gave me the feeling of being in control of an alternate history; the leader of a world power.\n\nOne of the things that I miss a bit was the length of the battles. It's sad to go into a game of the wonderful Attila, such a step up from Rome II (which almost brought me to tears at launch it was so disappointing), and have two massive armies decimate each other in 10 minutes. I played Empire last night, 2v2, and the battle lasted 45 minutes. Half-way through the battle my teammate and I were winning, and then the French overpowered my overly aggressive enemy without me noticing while I defended against the Cherokee, and in the last 10 minutes our enemies completely overcame us. Such a lengthy, brutal battle is typical in Empire, while most confrontations in Rome II and Attila seem like 10-minute-long skirmishes. +1 for Empire: TW.\n\nSieges too were a bit disappointing with focus on forts vs towns, but the towns you do get to fight in usually make for exciting urban combat situations.\n\nOverall, not my favorite Total War, but heads-and-shoulders above anything else out there for this time period. Thank you Creative Assembly - you're not perfect, but your games have been my favorite for over a decade.","May 3","true","126.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So guns play a rather large role in this, and because of the era the guns are mostly single shot muzzle loaders. There are also melee infantry, hoursemen (both armed with fire arms and melee weapons) , and artillery of varying caliber.\n\nLandscape is very important in this game because of the surplus of ranged units. Hight as in most games will help your ranged units and slow the advance of melee infantry. Artillery is also helped by being put on hills and the like.\n\nIn all honesty melee is not as important in this game as in others. But melee troops are still very useful. Because most units are ranged a melee unit can very quickly destroy their moral or the unit in general. But this goes the same both ways because of the ranged unit being well ranged. So melee are best for ambushes or holding walls.\n\nOne of the cons i mentioned above is that moral seems really fragile. Units can brake in a mater of SECONDS. This would be ok if it was mere cannon fodder but even the most elite of units can be broken after one or two volleys of fire then at other times they charge though no problem. The moral system seems unstable and inconstant.  -1 point\n\nAs mentioned above all the factions are relatively balance because they share alot of units with small changes. The only faction that is at both a disadvantage and an advantage is the Indian nations. Because they are over all more stealthy they are good for ambushes, they also have better melee units from the start of the game, but their range is a lot lower then the European nations.\n\nThe online is very laggy if more then two players are involved. This is rather common in total war games. So unless playing 1 on 1 online or playing though LAN i would recommend not putting your hopes into online -.5 points\nA small complaint i also have is the lack of online campaign. Many other total war games both before and after have this feature.\n\nAs mentioned above the unit to unit comparison is very rock paper scissors. But many strategy games are like this and with proper strategy and high ground advantage it can be changed.\nso because you can counter it I think it evens out.\nso over all i think it is a 8.5/10","April 16, 2014","true","18.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","3"

Empire is quite different from the other games in the series because it allows Naval Battles! On this unique experience, you control your army on the 7 seas, versing A.I. or real people online or locally. It can get quite intense, as your ships may flee if damaged, but there are also contreversol wins!\n\nThe game also allows you to (as I mentioned earlier) to play online with friends, or random people. The problem with online matches though, is that if your internet is bad, you must drop from the game. This can lead to frustraion from the opposing player. You can also do quick Naval or Land matches (Although, finding a game in the quick section is difficult.) You can team up and join an alliance in online matches too! They are quite intense! I prefer playing with friends, 'cause im so good at the game and I beat them :3.\n\nThe Total War Series has never been known for graphics, but I have to say this game suprises me. My favourite part is seeing my men run into my enemy and watch the battle. You can see them have little battles with eachother! It looks quite realistic, as after the batttle you can see all the dead men that have fought.\n\nOverall this game is meant for RTS players who enjoy a good online battle. This game is simple to manuver and comprehend. This is my favourite out of the Total War series (personally.) Overall, It definately fed my hunger for a good bloodbath and RTS game. I give it a 8.5/10!","June 23, 2014","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiberiusbrain/recommended/10500/","tiberiusbrain","ImperatorTiberius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiberiusbrain/","94 products in account","I completely recommend this game. It's already a few years old, so I would advise to wait for a sale perhaps... but considering that I have spent that many hours on Steam playing this game (and many hours off-Steam as well), even paying the full price does not mean you'll feel ripped off. You're not only buying quite a lot of game with your purchase, you're also buying the best single-player experience any Total War can bring you.\n\nTotal War is a series that combines the most massive and spectacular battles you will find in any game with the building and managing of an empire in single player. In multiplayer it's the best game of chess you can have. This particular Total War is set in the early Modern Age (1700-1800), and for the first time includes line-infantry with muskets as the backbone of an army and not a melee unit, which makes for a unique Total War. In this era, the European countries were involved in a lot of wars with eachother while they conquered several continents and established trade routs with most of the rest of the world, and I do not know of any other media that encompasses that much of this era like in Empire: Total War.\n\nFrom my point of view, this is the last of the true and classic Total War games. I have played every Total War (including Shogun) and my favorites are Rome 1 (not rome 2, absolutely not rome 2) because of the way it represents the classical era, Empire because I am personally very interested in this era as well and it is unique in the ranged combat with muskets and I love Shogun 2, because it simply has the best multiplayer. There is also a stand-alone expansion of Empire about the conquests of Napoleon, something I had been anticipating for many years, but I didn't like it enough. It's too limited. I also don't appreciate a lot from the medieval era in general. It's chaotic, it's too religious/christian, there is no progress, there is death, decay, famine and the plague and Medieval Total War games represent this fine, I don't like it.\n\nWhy do I consider this the last Classic Total War? Well, Total War is a game that, as you play, can teach you stuff. Like in Rome1 you learn that clear glass was invented, in Empire you get info along the way about what happened in the 18th century and it was a lot. In fact, the only good description I can find about my 'religion', Secular Humanism, I found in Empire Total War. This is also the last Total War in which the campaign map is open, you can send your armies where you want and you're not stuck in corridors like in the latest installments. However, it is the first Total War to include a tech-tree and naval battles (and naval battles were very spectacular in this era!).\n\nThe 3 continents you can explore with armies and conquer are Europe, North and Middle America and the Indian sub-continent (you can walk from Western-Europe to India if you please, or sail around Africa). There are also a few trade regions to conquer using just the navy: the east coast of South-America, the west coast of Africa, the strait of Madagaskar and the East-Indies. Every region has it's own feel and it's own enviroments, cultures, empires and people.\n\nThe units you command are also unique for each culture. Yes, warfare was a lot about standing in lines facing eachother firing lead balls back and forth and then reloading for quite some time, the native americans for instance are better equiped for guerilla style battles combining melee with light infantry equipes with muskets or bow and arrow. Along the tech-tree you unlock new units to build and command, artillery changes from simple big cannons to a whole specrum of weaponry. Ranging from mortars to puckle-guns (rapid fire musket, very early machinegun) and stuff in between. Cavalry also comes in many flavors, dragoons that melee on horseback but function as line infantry dismounted, full melee cavalry and the cavalry even gains horsedrawn cannons as technology is invented. And the ships! Oh man, imagine the big ships of the line with over 40 cannons on each broadside, 2 lines come within eachothers range... just crank up the sound to really loud!\n\nLike most Total War games, the game has improved a lot because of mods, Empire is no exception. Even for new players I would recommend to install and use at least Darth Mod, which can be found in the Steam Workshop. More units are also available with mods, but I'm not sure which one to recommend. But the Darth Mod really improves the ai and the feel of the game.\n\nEvery Total War has it's own features and it's own feel to it. Personally I find this installment the best in single-player of the entire series. I have had some really tight battles in the campaign. In Empire it is possible to position your men in some buildings, so making a last stand gets it's own feeling to it. Your men firing from the windows at incoming soldiers while your lines of infantry try to hold the lines in front of that building, untill the fight turns melee when the bayonets are pointed at eachother.\n\nAnd I haven't even mentioned the historical battles that come with each Total War, you can reenact battles that actually took place and with a historically similar setting and armies to command. Pitching you as Washington vs the Brittish and many others. There is a demo available here on Steam, in it you can play at least one of these historical battles and get a glimpse of what is in store for you when it comes to battles, but if you like games like Civilization or RTS games like Age of Empires and you haven't tried Total War at all, you will love it!","January 31, 2014","true","245.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This particular Total War is set in the early Modern Age (1700-1800), and for the first time includes line-infantry with muskets as the backbone of an army and not a melee unit, which makes for a unique Total War. In this era, the European countries were involved in a lot of wars with eachother while they conquered several continents and established trade routs with most of the rest of the world, and I do not know of any other media that encompasses that much of this era like in Empire: Total War.\n\nFrom my point of view, this is the last of the true and classic Total War games. I have played every Total War (including Shogun) and my favorites are Rome 1 (not rome 2, absolutely not rome 2) because of the way it represents the classical era, Empire because I am personally very interested in this era as well and it is unique in the ranged combat with muskets and I love Shogun 2, because it simply has the best multiplayer. There is also a stand-alone expansion of Empire about the conquests of Napoleon, something I had been anticipating for many years, but I didn't like it enough. It's too limited. I also don't appreciate a lot from the medieval era in general. It's chaotic, it's too religious/christian, there is no progress, there is death, decay, famine and the plague and Medieval Total War games represent this fine, I don't like it.\n\nWhy do I consider this the last Classic Total War? Well, Total War is a game that, as you play, can teach you stuff. Like in Rome1 you learn that clear glass was invented, in Empire you get info along the way about what happened in the 18th century and it was a lot. In fact, the only good description I can find about my 'religion', Secular Humanism, I found in Empire Total War. This is also the last Total War in which the campaign map is open, you can send your armies where you want and you're not stuck in corridors like in the latest installments. However, it is the first Total War to include a tech-tree and naval battles (and naval battles were very spectacular in this era!).\n\nThe 3 continents you can explore with armies and conquer are Europe, North and Middle America and the Indian sub-continent (you can walk from Western-Europe to India if you please, or sail around Africa). There are also a few trade regions to conquer using just the navy: the east coast of South-America, the west coast of Africa, the strait of Madagaskar and the East-Indies. Every region has it's own feel and it's own enviroments, cultures, empires and people.\n\nThe units you command are also unique for each culture. Yes, warfare was a lot about standing in lines facing eachother firing lead balls back and forth and then reloading for quite some time, the native americans for instance are better equiped for guerilla style battles combining melee with light infantry equipes with muskets or bow and arrow. Along the tech-tree you unlock new units to build and command, artillery changes from simple big cannons to a whole specrum of weaponry. Ranging from mortars to puckle-guns (rapid fire musket, very early machinegun) and stuff in between. Cavalry also comes in many flavors, dragoons that melee on horseback but function as line infantry dismounted, full melee cavalry and the cavalry even gains horsedrawn cannons as technology is invented. And the ships! Oh man, imagine the big ships of the line with over 40 cannons on each broadside, 2 lines come within eachothers range... just crank up the sound to really loud!\n\nLike most Total War games, the game has improved a lot because of mods, Empire is no exception. Even for new players I would recommend to install and use at least Darth Mod, which can be found in the Steam Workshop. More units are also available with mods, but I'm not sure which one to recommend. But the Darth Mod really improves the ai and the feel of the game.\n\nEvery Total War has it's own features and it's own feel to it. Personally I find this installment the best in single-player of the entire series. I have had some really tight battles in the campaign. In Empire it is possible to position your men in some buildings, so making a last stand gets it's own feeling to it. Your men firing from the windows at incoming soldiers while your lines of infantry try to hold the lines in front of that building, untill the fight turns melee when the bayonets are pointed at eachother.\n\nAnd I haven't even mentioned the historical battles that come with each Total War, you can reenact battles that actually took place and with a historically similar setting and armies to command. Pitching you as Washington vs the Brittish and many others. There is a demo available here on Steam, in it you can play at least one of these historical battles and get a glimpse of what is in store for you when it comes to battles, but if you like games like Civilization or RTS games like Age of Empires and you haven't tried Total War at all, you will love it!","January 31, 2014","true","245.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Spanning over about 1/3 of America, Europe and India.\n\nBecause of the huge scope you get a staggering 20+ factions in game minor and major nations. With a nice number of them been playable and with the hack or two you can play as them all.\n\nThe amount of nations means this is more of a challenge but the combat can be a bit stale. Unlike past game it’s all guns and odd melee combat as really, gun combat is simple with only a few tactics needed to give a clear victory.\n\nThis is the main down-turn of the game, the best part of the game has to be its small micromanagement system and upgrades for regions on the map and not in the city is a great addition, sometimes later in the game managing all this is hard but non the less rewarding to the dedicated player.\n\nHuge map, plenty of factions and plenty of lands.\n\nDownside: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ diplomacy, a little bit overbearing for the average player.

With almost the whole world as your playground, you are able to build or destroy empires that cover enormous areas.  Only a world on such a scale can truly capture the impressiveness of your achievements, helping you match the greatness of empires and kingdoms now of by-gone years.\n\nThat said, more up-to-date TW games have better battle mechanics and physics.  The battles themselves, whilst visually stunning, might sometimes leave you scratching your head as to why a perfectly placed unit didnt do what you hoped it would.  Things like line of sight are not as obvious in Empire.  The AI is probably as good as any other, although that isn't saying much.  Programming competitive AI in TW games must be a nightmare and is therefore going to always be a weak spot open for mass criticism.\n\nOverall, despite the short comings described, the feel of Empire is arguably unique in the series.  It is one of the few games these days which isnt 'finished' within 10-20 hours.  You can still be playing this game after hundreds if not thousands of hours and seeing new experiences and creating new narratives (if that's your thing).","December 1, 2014","true","684.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The Age of Sail is captured very well. The "Encyclopedic" notes describe many everyday details of the time, and are written simply and to the point. Adapting to the tactics of the age is required -- trying to play Empire like Starcraft will result in defeat. Suffice to say that there were logical reasons why the armies of the day formed firing lines, and Empire made me understand them. There is a wide range of nations to choose from, and all require different approaches. Empire should be stable, but the AI suffers from mental instability, in battle and especially in the campaign map. Modding is practically a requirement, and I always mention Darthmod in that context.","July 22, 2013","true","307.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a good game, but not without several problems.\n\nEmpire: Total War, set in the 18th century, is a game I reccomend to the player who likes the idea of massive, 18th century-style land and naval battles. The game also has a very large campaign map, including India, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. There's also a lot of colonialism involved as well, so if you like all of these things I mentioned, you'll probably like this game.\n\nHowever, don't expect multiplayer to be a fun experience. It's still active, but there aren't many people playing. There's a good number of players here that will mistakenly or purposefully break the rules set by players hosting their games. Even hosts will break their own rules.\n\nYou also need to consider the fact that there are many players on here that have adopted the use of specific units that are simply OP, which therefore ruins the historical atmosphere of this game. Historically, most 18th century infantry were armed with highly innacurate guns, so they gathered in very large formations and fired at each other. They were called line infantry. This type of warfare was in no way meant to prolong the life of an individual soldier at all. The entire point of this type of fighting between infantry units was to use overwhelming force and numbers of troops and firepower to overcome the other side, which meant that line infantry would have to have some serious discipline and toughness. You'd rarely ever take cover, and if you were in the front lines, your slim chances of surviving the battle depended on how fast you could reload your gun and if you could make your shot count before the other side did the same thing you were meant to do.\n\nNow, you'd think line infantry would be the staple unit on this game, and therefore they'd be pretty effective in this game. However, their historical use as the essential staple unit for 18th century armies can easily be rendered useless on this game with just three types of units: Riflemen, skirmishers, and light dragoons.\n\nThe sad fact is that on multiplayer, the only three types of effective ground units that have any form of effectiveness on this game are the three units I stated above, aside from artillery. You see, the problem here is that skirmishers and riflemen have guns that can shoot farther than the muskets used by your line infantry, and they are unfairly accurate, meaning that your line infantry will be dropping like flies just trying to close the distance to take on the skirmishers and riflemen. They also reload their weapons incredibly fast. This is in no way historically accurate, because the guns used by lighter infantry forces at the time, no matter how far they shot, were still incredibly accurate and would have taken a long time to reload. Not only that, but we're talking about guns that weren't easy to aim with.\n\nI could understand how lightly armed riflemen and skirmishers could give line infantry some serious trouble in, say, a bunch of forests, but they are so overpowered on this game that they can easily take out line infantry on an open battlefield.\n\nThen there are light dragoons...\n\nLight dragoons are soldiers riding on horseback, equipped with modified muskets that have shorter barrels. Therefore, they'd be less accurate, right? In real life, yes, but in this game? Wrong. Would it be easy reloading these guns on horseback? No, because muskets need to have the projectiles loaded with ram rods, primed, blah blah blah, shoot, repeat. It's difficult enough to do all of this while standing on your own two feet, but on horseback? That's bound to take longer.\n\nLight dragoons can be incredibly dangerous to line infantry due to their superior speed, and because this game has overpowered them, every single soldier in a unit of light dragoons fires his gun, even the ones in the back. None of the troops in the front ranks of the dragoons die, and for some strange reason, a good number of the shots fired hit their mark. Sometimes, This means that you'll be having large numbers of line infantry dying all at once, which can cause a morale shock.\n\nSo unless you make rules against the use of light dragoons and skirmishers on the games you host in multiplayer, you'll be seeing these units being used on a constant basis, throwing all of the great historical accuracies of 18th century warfare out the window.\n\nNow that's been explained, I should tell you about a few problems with other aspects of this game:\n\n1) Despite the fact that Empire has a very large campaign map, you will be disappointed to find that almost every single battle map looks the same. Same texture, same everything. Yes, some buildings will look different depending on what part of the world you're in on the campaign, but you will quickly realise how bland the atmosphere of the maps are when you fight battles. Building detail in towns is also severly lacking.\n\n2) The AI is incredibly dumb at times, so dumb that the developers decided to buff up the stats of the AI's units to compensate for their stupidity in the higher difficulty levels.\n\n3) Individual troops in your army lack spatial awareness when they enter buildings or defend/attack fort walls in a siege battle. It's a horrid sight to see at times. Troops just move through each other in a frantic motion. Path finding on walls is also terrible.\n\n4) Some sound effects for this game are awful, especially for muskets. For example, when a unit of line infantry fire a volley at the enemy, you only hear a 'poof' sound. These are primitive gunpowder weapons. They should be noisy and make a loud 'bang' when fired. Instead, the muskets used by your line infantry sound like fake guns used for movies in Hollywood.\n\n5) You won't hear any general's speech before battle like you used to in Rome I and Medieval II.\n\n6) There isn't much voice acting. You won't get to hear any voice acting at all when you initiate diplomacy, and the few bits of voice acting that you do here on this game tends to be subpar.\n\n7) Melee combat between infantry units looks decent, but not amazing. The combat animations are too drawn out and look more rehearsed than realistic. Some of the combat animations are so terrible drawn out that everything looks unrealistic.\n\n8) Because of the way the death animations work on this game, cavalry takes forever to take out a routing unit. Many times, an unnecessarily long combat animation has to be so terrible drawn out that it takes longer than needed for the cavalry to take out the routers. It'd be more convenient if the cavalry just swing their swords at boom, the routing units die faster.\n\n9) Artillery units can be glitchy, even in multiplayer. Sometimes, they won't fire their guns no matter how many times you order them to.\n\n10) On the campaign map, the AI controlling Britain, the United Provinces, and France tend to ignore India for some reason, so almost every single time you play this campaign, the Marathas end up becoming an OP faction.\n\n11) There are no marching tunes with fifes and drums on the battlefield for any of the factions. This feature should have been implemented by the developers. I can understand that some players might find them distracting, but an option could be made to just turn off those marching tunes in the game.\n\n12) Naval battles can sometimes be a little glitchy. Ships will sometimes move unnecessarily slow even when you order them to move faster.\n\nThis game can still be enjoyed despite all of these problems I mentioned. However, the it will never be as great as it could have been. There are, however, a few mods for this game that you can use to make this game more enjoyable. Keep in mind that the mods are, unfortunately, not supported for Steam as there is no workshop.","June 2","true","197.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

Unless\n1) you get this very very cheaply.\n2) and you have a zen-state mind where you just accept the the fact that 'you hit caca and caca does not hit you'. You need to loose all hope to begin with. Frustration leads to anger, anger leads to... well you know.\n\nPrepare to constantly save and have a huge library of saves as sometimes without any warning 1-3 of your latest saves just becomes corrupted so you need to go back quite some time to be able to resume your game. Sometimes losing 5-10minutes of progress is a lot.\n\nAnd before trying any mid-to-large sized battles you must exit the game and restart it just to ensure you have max memory available as the leaking kills the game soon. (4gb 32-bit win 7 here but according to forums it does not matter much)\n\nAutomatic quality settings is a must - not because of FPS - no no thats so pleb. for this game AQ is a defensive measure against crashes. Oh yeah, want to know what my secret sauce for getting both this game and Shogun 2 to work better when it's time to 'get real' and fight a big battle? put gfx settings to lowest. You MIGHT actualy be able to complete the game + save it (without corruption). It does not hurt though to have the will to play the same battle 2-5 times if it crashes.\n\nCheers. and here i just laugh at the idea of buying Rome 2. Never going to happen with any games based on this engine.\n\nAnd to all of those people who have never been hit with these problems: good for you, the sun light shines on you but i don't want to know anything about that. I just don't. TW support  forums, the official and the unofficial ones are places where hope of getting things fixed goes to die.\n\nI love this game to bits as can be seen by the hours clocked on it but playing it sure requires nerves of steel. I have never gotten even close to completing a short game. NOT EVEN CLOSE.  I'll put a thumbs up sign here next to this review so i dont get too much apologist comments. i dont want to hear them.

I loved the details that went into the rendering of units, technologies and especially the accuracy of how those techs were used on the battle maps.\n\nNaval combat is a particular love of mine.  I am a history major and love maritime history as well.  Being able to actually control the ships in line combat looks amazing,runs smoothly usually and is so much fun!\n\nIf there is a real problem it is the AI.  Diplomacy makes no sense really when a nation like the Maratha Confederacywill declare war on England for no reason that I can see.  In battles sometime the AI will move troops for no reason, it makes the battles a lot easier at times but does loose a bit to the challenge factor.\n\nOver all Empire is my favorite game in the series and I hope everyone has a change to play.","December 31, 2014","true","209.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Das Spiel machte sehr lange sehr viel Spaß und steht seinen vorgängern in nichts nach. Die vielen Neuerungen, die es bei den Vorgängern (RomT W oder Medieval 2 TW) noch nicht gab sind nicht nur eine willkommene Abwechslung für alle Fans der Total War Reihe sondern sie machen das Spiel auch wesentlich anspruchsvoller und komplexer. Da fällt es dann kaum noch auf das ab und zu die Grafik beginnt zu flattern, einzelne Einheiten im Kampf an einer Wand hängenbleiben wodurch das gesammte Regiment nahezu handlungsunfähig wird oder der Kampf in zeitlupe schneller abläuft als mit normaler geschwindigkeit weil das spiel in dieser zu stark rukt (selbst auf PC´s die die Anforderungen übertreffen). Das einizige was den Spielspaß wirklich schmällert sind die Abstürze und teilweise nicht ladbare Speicherstände.

No difference in uniform design unless it's a special unit that belongs to a certain country (Example: Death Head Hussars from Prussia) Every single line infantry, artillery crew, cavalry, grenadier, almost every light infantry unit has the SAME design but different coloring. Examples: Russian line infantry get green with red and France gets blue with white and the Dutch get blue and orange. No uniform design variety, I think they got lazy or just didn't give a ♥♥♥♥.\n\n2) Compared to artillery in Napoleon Total War the artillery in this game is almost so useless it'll make you cry.

This is a RTS fans dream come true!\n\nLet me hit the highlights of this game:\n\nThe graphics and sound effects make it feel as if your actually in an 18th century army. When I get off the game, I sometimes feel as if Im getting out of a time machine, bringing myself back from the past, back to the present.\n\nBuilding and researching takes a little figuring out and can be confusing, but you'll see things as you play. Completing the tutorial will also help.\n\nOn the Grand Campaign, it is CRITICAL you begin recruiting, and researching military stuff immediately. The easier the setting, the lesser the AI will attack you, but they'll come. My favorite faction is Prussia. However, when you first begin the Grand Campaign, there is a ton of factions. Even factions you cant choose from. Usually, around the fourth turn, Prussia and Austria declare war on each other, because they are close to each other and hostile towards the other. So, whichever faction you choose to be, be warned: the factions that are your neighbors are most likely to declare war against you.\n\nOnce you enter battle, your given time to setup your troops. If your using cannons, it is VITALE you set them up before the battle begins. They setup into firing position slow and can be moved slow. Very realistic, so it takes away any annoying feeling.\n\nYou will need to build navies. Those can be extra challenging. The cost of a single ship is extra high, so building a huge navy is slow. Its also pretty hard to have multiple huge navies at the same time. Although most helpful, usually its best to build a navy when your ready for use.\n\nNaval battles are probably the most difficultest battle. The ships sail slowly. The AI usually starts in a single line, and spreads out, slowly, encircling your ships. These battles vary in time length, usually depending on who has the more battle ships. A variety of ships helps.\n\nIn the Grand Campaign, they also have notes mentioning historical events, such as Captain Kidd being hung, the start of circus's and much, much, much more.\n\nWhen I tried an online multi player battle, I was in RTS gamers heaven. No matter the AI, playing against an opponent who thinks, is 100 times better. Especially when you win.\n\nOverall, if anyone likes history, strategy, thinking, or strategy games, this game is for them! 100/10","June 19, 2014","true","138.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I cannot lie! I like this game\n\nA few of my friends have said that they are unimpressed by this game when considering the other additions in the Total War franchise and mainly due to the broken A.I. I however find that in my experience the A.I. hasn't been to hindering, the cavalry have been utterly overhauled as underwhelming, even on the charge my best cavalry can get ruined charging the enemy line formations.\n\nBut for me this is ok, it reinforces my reliance on artillery and infantry using cavalry just to chase down enemies on the rout or in desperate circumstances hitting one flank of wavering enemy.\n\nI only find one thing to be infuriatingly broken. Trade ports and having your trade routes raided via sea. no ammount of navy can prevent this, and a single boat being able to raid so much is ridiculous.\n\nThis does not take from my enjoyment of this game however.\n\n10/10 very fun taking india with green jackets!","July 11, 2014","true","411.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The AI is absolutley atrocious, when you engage in a seige battle, for example, the enemy will at times not attack you, as you sit in your fort unable to do anything and have to wait for the battle timer to run out, and well, if you dont have any battle timer set, you better hope you saved the game before that battle so you can get lucky and win with an auto-resolve.  Thats another thing, the auto resolve, it works just fine on land, but it is completely unusable in the water.  You get a decent chance of winning the battle, however you will suffer massive casulties.  For example, if I were to win a naval battle using auto resolve, I would have lost 3 of my Ships-of-the-Line, to a fleet of merchant ships, which is completly unrealisitic.  I should probably start talking about the good stuff, first off its FUN, like really fun, like really really really fun! Especially if you are a complete history nut like myself.  For the price of 20 bucks its awesome, I never bought the expansions, never thought it was neccassary the game is just fine without them and not worth the extra 15 bucks in my opinion.  Highly reccomend, great for price, the only thing is that Napoleon Total War, the newer installment has much better graphics, and less effective muskets, which coresponds to the time period quite well. Napoleon is less broad however, focusing only on Europe, no American or Indian theatures are availible. Hope this helped, if you can get around the bugs then you will learn to LOVE this game. BTW, you need a powerful computer to run it at max settings.","November 22, 2014","true","300.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I saw the game and said "Hmm, looks cool".  I downloaded the demo, and spended about a day, playing each mission.\n\nThen i bought the game. It was amazing. Commanding my first empire was a blast, conquering Indian Tribes, and sailing to the Americas, discovering new lands. The AI wasn't the best, so I took a break and downloaded Darth Mod.\n\nThen, I jumped back straight onto the game with Darthmod UC. Then I started my 2nd Empire. I realized how better it was, and much more challenging. I kept Darthmod, because it improved graphics, and AI. Then I got used to the game. I decided to begin a bigger Empire with much more enemies. I started focusing on Economy and it really helped. I got trade and towns up. I got so much money, that I made a huge army. I felt so good.\n\nThats when the colonies decided to declare independance. I got pretty mad, so I discovered I could have relations. Know I knew alot of the game. I was ready.\n\nI sailed with my allies to the new Americas. There, the war with the Rebels lasted 3 Years in-game. I had a blast battling. I gave some land to my allies in the Americas to avoid rebels. I took the Americas back for myself then. After I had conquered most of the Americas, I decided to move into uncharted land and waters. I found tribes, and made allies, and made new enemies. I was amazed by the game. I conquered many new lands, and made many enemies.\n\nMy empire became power hungry, and I fell apart. I was so happy, and I enjoyed myself. Just next time, hope to lead a more successful empire.\n\nIf your looking for a game like this, buy it. The AI is not the best, but there are mods that fix the game. The modding community makes some cool things\n\nRating 9.8/10\n\nAWESOME GAME!","June 7, 2014","true","61.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also,the cavalry units of the enemy aren't just ordered into a wholeunit of pikemen,as they are now in Rome II..In Land battles,the infantry is,as in realisitc circumstances too,the Fundamental might of any army,providing the highest power,the most dynamic combat and abilities,and- of course-taking the most casaulties..As historical correctly (which is not the use in this game,as you can see as soon as the game starts,such as Sweden for example,is suddenly allied(!) with russia,during the time of the great nordic war,such as Great Britain can be played in 1700 (Founded in 1707) etc.), the Infantry regiments are mostly formed out of 160-200 Men,armed with muskets. The musket firing distance is also very realistic,and goes up to 70-100 meters at maximum,if fired by the line-infantry..Some units,armed with rifles,not with muskets,are useful by up to about 120 Meters in this game..Of course,any circumstances in battle are also taking influence onto the fighting spirit of the soldiers,which could also be enforced by elite units nearby,such as the general staff..Rainy weather causes Malfunctions of the muskets,because of an ineffectivity of gunpowder etc..It's a very time intensive,but then again,a great game,even despite the fact,it's not historically accurate at all.\n\nDepending on,which era you want to play in,i really recommend this game and its successor,which is ,,Napoleon:Total war´´.","April 23, 2014","true","278.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Voice acting is EXQUISITE.\n\nIf you are multilingual, try playing one of the countries where you know their language.  The Tutons speak German, the Indians speak (what?  Hindi?), the Britians speak English with a British accent, and the Americans speak with an American accent.\n\n- The tactical battles are very good.\n\nThis might also depend on what AI difficulty you choose - but at a normal difficulty tactical battles are interesting.  They might even be considered the core gameplay of the game, and avoiding them with autoresolve means far worse outcomes than playing them yourself.\n\n- The quotes during loads are interesting reading\n\n- The way the world is divided adds a new mechanic (instead of having one contiguous map)\n\nThis adds some confusion, but after understanding it the mechanic adds an extra dimension to the gameplay.\n\n- Economic system is good\n\n\nCons:\n\n- By now most TBS games have a consistent UI at least where outstanding tasks are concerned, but not Total War\n\nIf you forgot to move that unit who's been sitting idle for the last 3 turns - it's your fault.  You should have gone and looked at a book or something.  Or you should play Warlock or Civ or Fallen Enchantress or Endless Space because ALL of those games handle this exactly the same way with a list in the right column.\n\n- Don't let the campaign turn you off.\n\nIt's not a great campaign, but at least there is one.  The downside is the campaign hides some of the goodness the game has to offer, and there are confusing moments at the very beginning where the tactical battle makes no sense.  [Not a good time to confuse players.  Devs, I recommend "never" as the best time to confuse players.]\n\n- Sea battles are just too realistic (which translates into boring)\n\nI know I know... "It's realistic!  We went to some naval museum or whatnot and got accurate reproductions of these ships and the physics blah blah blah..."  We don't care.  Well I don't anyways.  Can't you put in a realism slider?  I'm used to ship handling like in Pirates!  And this is WAAAAY too slow even accelerated.\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAlso, you can't really tell which of the various countries might resonate with you, so don't get turned off by the first country you try to play.  I played Britian for a while, and then on a whim switched to playing India and loved it.  The best way is to experiment.\n\nIn all it's a satisfying game.\n\nIf you aren't absolutely sure it will play on your systme (and some people have seen crashes), then try the demo first.","June 15, 2014","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in all, the game has many new and unique options never seen in gaming before, and I'd recommend trying it out if you like strategy games.","June 22, 2014","true","57.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also,the cavalry units of the enemy aren't just ordered into a wholeunit of pikemen,as they are now in Rome II..In Land battles,the infantry is,as in realisitc circumstances too,the Fundamental might of any army,providing the highest power,the most dynamic combat and abilities,and- of course-taking the most casaulties..As historical correctly (which is not the use in this game,as you can see as soon as the game starts,such as Sweden for example,is suddenly allied(!) with russia,during the time of the great nordic war,such as Great Britain can be played in 1700 (Founded in 1707) etc.), the Infantry regiments are mostly formed out of 160-200 Men,armed with muskets. The musket firing distance is also very realistic,and goes up to 70-100 meters at maximum,if fired by the line-infantry..Some units,armed with rifles,not with muskets,are useful by up to about 120 Meters in this game..Of course,any circumstances in battle are also taking influence onto the fighting spirit of the soldiers,which could also be enforced by elite units nearby,such as the general staff..Rainy weather causes Malfunctions of the muskets,because of an ineffectivity of gunpowder etc..It's a very time intensive,but then again,a great game,even despite the fact,it's not historically accurate at all.\n\nDepending on,which era you want to play in,i really recommend this game and its successor,which is ,,Napoleon:Total war´´.","April 23, 2014","true","278.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Voice acting is EXQUISITE.\n\nIf you are multilingual, try playing one of the countries where you know their language.  The Tutons speak German, the Indians speak (what?  Hindi?), the Britians speak English with a British accent, and the Americans speak with an American accent.\n\n- The tactical battles are very good.\n\nThis might also depend on what AI difficulty you choose - but at a normal difficulty tactical battles are interesting.  They might even be considered the core gameplay of the game, and avoiding them with autoresolve means far worse outcomes than playing them yourself.\n\n- The quotes during loads are interesting reading\n\n- The way the world is divided adds a new mechanic (instead of having one contiguous map)\n\nThis adds some confusion, but after understanding it the mechanic adds an extra dimension to the gameplay.\n\n- Economic system is good\n\n\nCons:\n\n- By now most TBS games have a consistent UI at least where outstanding tasks are concerned, but not Total War\n\nIf you forgot to move that unit who's been sitting idle for the last 3 turns - it's your fault.  You should have gone and looked at a book or something.  Or you should play Warlock or Civ or Fallen Enchantress or Endless Space because ALL of those games handle this exactly the same way with a list in the right column.\n\n- Don't let the campaign turn you off.\n\nIt's not a great campaign, but at least there is one.  The downside is the campaign hides some of the goodness the game has to offer, and there are confusing moments at the very beginning where the tactical battle makes no sense.  [Not a good time to confuse players.  Devs, I recommend "never" as the best time to confuse players.]\n\n- Sea battles are just too realistic (which translates into boring)\n\nI know I know... "It's realistic!  We went to some naval museum or whatnot and got accurate reproductions of these ships and the physics blah blah blah..."  We don't care.  Well I don't anyways.  Can't you put in a realism slider?  I'm used to ship handling like in Pirates!  And this is WAAAAY too slow even accelerated.\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAlso, you can't really tell which of the various countries might resonate with you, so don't get turned off by the first country you try to play.  I played Britian for a while, and then on a whim switched to playing India and loved it.  The best way is to experiment.\n\nIn all it's a satisfying game.\n\nIf you aren't absolutely sure it will play on your systme (and some people have seen crashes), then try the demo first.","June 15, 2014","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Guns don't make the game less exciting, as some argue; instead, they require a change of tactics. Playing in the colonial era can actually be quite fun.\nThe graphics are an improvement, though they aren't great, but in this kind of game, I prefer gameplay over visuals. The gameplay is great - the world is gigantic, there is a new building system that makes building multiple structures simultaneously possible, there is a technology and philosophy research area, there are gentleman, naval battles where you can actually control your ships (I don't enjoy these much, though they look nice), there is North America and some of South America, and India (which we only got a glimpse of in Alexander!) There are many playable factions, and you can even unlock the American Indian factions by purchasing the Warpath DLC (this, again, requires a drastic change in strategy from the main ETW game, so buyer beware; it's probably also the only DLC worth buying, and only for a few bucks). Oh, and there's also the good ole US of A, which can be played in a campaign tracing the nation's development from a few settlers in Jamestown to an independent but vulnerable republic at the turn of the century.\nA few cons: the game is a bit glitchy, battles usually take place in boring forts that all look the same instead of cities, cannon have limitless ammo (could be a pro), game can get slow with the sheer number of factions at the end of every turn.\nThe game came out very unfinished, but it's been polished up and is now defnitely worth buying for any TW fan.","June 12, 2014","true","159.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can play this game in many ways like a Civization game with the campagin map but. It was A LOT of replay value since if you choose to play as a different nation they have comepletley different play styles, units, and diplomecy which makes two play throughs of Grand Campagin completley different. In combat however is where it really shines. The strategy is SO in depth about how to deploy your units, when to deploy your units, and what formation is extremly fun. It is also EXTREMLY detailed as you can zoom in and clearly see your units individually and watch them fight. My favorite part is to look after a big battle at the battlefield where you can look at all of the bodies bc they dont despawn and you can see where they were deployed and how bloody was the combat it is amazing, However the diplomecy can be annoying with the AI and they are kinda dumb but all is forgiven if you choose to go on hard and play the battles yourseld because that is where the focus is.\n\nIf you are new to the series this is one of the most realistic RTS games out there. I have seen on the Military History Channel a show called Deceisive Battles I believe it was called and they used Rome: Total War to simulate the battles with amazing accuracy. This game came out later than it\n","December 21, 2013","true","248.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Mainly because of the AI, in a game were alliances and diplomacy are so essential, you'd think the AI would be great. Its the complete opposite. Allies won't help at all, city states that are allied to you at the start of the game drag you into wars with super powers you can't possibly win and if you break the alliance you lose ALL your allies, and everyone will hate you and go to war with you. Another thing, navies. Navies are very key to the game (as you can imagine) but sadly its very very hard to build one. You start off with no navy to speak of, while other countries (Spain, France) have many fleets. You can try to build a navy, but before its big enough another nation will come along and destroy it. Finally my last issue is up keep of armies. The game is called Total War for a good reason, you are always at war on multiple fronts (which is annoying as you have to put all your money into war and you can't improve your nation). Which means you will need multiple armies, which is hard at the start because your allies wont help and you will get bankrupt, your troops will leave you and you will get overrun. I have played this game alot (I got the game on a disk before I got it on steam hence the measly two hours on record) and have won world domination on hard difficulty. This game is playable but it will be one miserable ride.\nHowever this some moments can be quite good, like when thousands of your cavalry charge down those damn rebels. And when you look over whole continents that belong to you. And when you finally crush filthy France and Spain for constantly hindering your progress.

If buying this game in the year 2014, you'll find that most of the bugs have been fixed and you can play a pretty smooth game. I've played this on Xp and 7. I personally found the other TW games to be slightly,, better. But again that does not make this bad. Think of Chocolate Ice Cream being your favorite and this game is Vanilla. It's still good just not the best.\nThe sea battle's are insanely fun for some and horrid for others, but with the ability to just auto fight them, problem solved. I find the game lacks serious depth but that seems to be a problem that TW is just following and getting worse at. Diplomacy is pretty much a fail as is using religion. As a matter of fact this is probably the worst in the franchise but that's not saying much. Playing as India or Russia is a great fun challenge that's refreshing and different.\nIf you're a fan then yes this is a no brainer if you're new to this genre and this franchise, I'd recommend Medieval 2 or Shogun 2/Rome 2, any of the 2's I guess first but really you can't go wrong here.","February 26, 2014","true","335.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Those who find the 18th century interesting will obviously find a lot to love here but those uninterested may move on fairly quickly.\n\n8 musketballs out of 10","December 20, 2013","true","264.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The AI is absolutley atrocious, when you engage in a seige battle, for example, the enemy will at times not attack you, as you sit in your fort unable to do anything and have to wait for the battle timer to run out, and well, if you dont have any battle timer set, you better hope you saved the game before that battle so you can get lucky and win with an auto-resolve.  Thats another thing, the auto resolve, it works just fine on land, but it is completely unusable in the water.  You get a decent chance of winning the battle, however you will suffer massive casulties.  For example, if I were to win a naval battle using auto resolve, I would have lost 3 of my Ships-of-the-Line, to a fleet of merchant ships, which is completly unrealisitic.  I should probably start talking about the good stuff, first off its FUN, like really fun, like really really really fun! Especially if you are a complete history nut like myself.  For the price of 20 bucks its awesome, I never bought the expansions, never thought it was neccassary the game is just fine without them and not worth the extra 15 bucks in my opinion.  Highly reccomend, great for price, the only thing is that Napoleon Total War, the newer installment has much better graphics, and less effective muskets, which coresponds to the time period quite well. Napoleon is less broad however, focusing only on Europe, no American or Indian theatures are availible. Hope this helped, if you can get around the bugs then you will learn to LOVE this game. BTW, you need a powerful computer to run it at max settings.","November 22, 2014","true","300.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Campaign map is huge though, good for darthmod or empire total factions (I think thats the name of the mod). Multiplayer is eh kinda dead and a bit broken, Extreme range rifle units, Nuclear howitzers, And Light dragoons that are more accurate than infantry... But if you get good you will ignore these things. Although i dont think the game is worth it at 20.00$. Buy Napoleon Total War if you like multiplayer. Its 15.00$ With a bigger online community left thanks to Youtubers like robinhoodgaming, and a bit smaller but more detailed campaign map. Darthmod also works better on Napoleon Total War.

After being tempted and pushed to try this title by one of my friends, I decided to sit down and give it a go. And I love it. Micromanaging an Empire, building up Units and conquering lands along with huge battles and drawn out sequences make this a tactician's wet dream. This is the first Total War game that I have ever played and sat down thoroughly with.\n\nI am not disappointed.\n\nOn the other hand, I was informed by many that [Darthmod] improves the game substantially, so I have never truly experienced the "Vanilla" version of the game (one which is untouched by mods and 3rd party fixes). I love Darthmod and ETW, both compliment one another and with the whole new addition of extra units and better A.I. this really vamps up the game as a whole. See the end of the review for more links on where to download Darthmod.\n\nI do, however, admit that ETW does suffer from its fair share of bugs and broken game issues but do not let that detract you from buying this. It's a great title. I have purchased all the DLC for the game too and the extra units are *very* much worth it. Heck, even game changing!\n\nA great title, yet sometimes awkward to play due to strange A.I. behaviour and crashes due to... well, we all know that Total War games since Empire are buggy and unfixed.\n\nOverall score: 8/10 (it'd be a lot lower without the mods I've added :p)\n\nDarthmod v.8.0 on ModDB.\n\nI would highly suggest you download this mod via Torrent! It's a lot faster and easier to obtain, I find ModDB's speeds too slow. Be sure to seed back to atleast 90% for everyone else who wants the mod too!","October 27, 2014","true","436.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So my main objective was trying to gain land without the threat of being mass murdered, I did many other attacks on smaller nations such as the native americans and indians (not racist, but they are really weak) and gained quite a bit of land as well as keeping hostilities in Europe, all happy and friendly. I gained quite a bit of power as I built my armies, gaining more and more elite soldiers along with maitaining my budget, as well as with keeping up with the new technology (like your hip parents try to do). I was doing more than fine now and rekted everyone in North America leaving only me and the 13 colonies, which was now taken over by Britain. I didn't want to start a war equalivent to what a modern-day nuclear war would look like, and would rather avoid turning my ETW into a Fallout game.\nAnyway, back on track, I rekted North America and went back to home sweet Europe. After a few turns, a war broke out between Hannover and Westphilia and I happened to be allied with Hannover. You'll know Westphilia is directly east of France if you play the game, and so I was basically about to crush another metaphoric pebble with my big French boot. So I go and send about 1700 men to besiege it, and another army of about 1500 just in case anything went wrong against the 1600 Westphilian men defending the capital, and proceeded to crush them sustaining barely any casualties other then a small light infantry regiment retreating. Well, I successfully commited genocide wiping them off the face of the Earth and laughed when the "A Region Has Been Defeated" message appeared. I was in a good mood for obvious reasons, and decided to generously handed over the Westphilia territory to the monsters who started the small Holocaust. Hannover. Everytime I play this game I will remember that mistake. I gave them the territory and was slapped in the face with the harshest words ever spoken in the 1700's, "We accept the trade, but don't think this will make us think any better of you!"\n-_-\n\n10/10 IGN\nWOULD COMMIT GENOCIDE FOR UNTHANKFUL ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S AGAIN","July 21, 2015","true","83.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Those who find the 18th century interesting will obviously find a lot to love here but those uninterested may move on fairly quickly.\n\n8 musketballs out of 10","December 20, 2013","true","264.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Das Spiel machte sehr lange sehr viel Spaß und steht seinen vorgängern in nichts nach. Die vielen Neuerungen, die es bei den Vorgängern (RomT W oder Medieval 2 TW) noch nicht gab sind nicht nur eine willkommene Abwechslung für alle Fans der Total War Reihe sondern sie machen das Spiel auch wesentlich anspruchsvoller und komplexer. Da fällt es dann kaum noch auf das ab und zu die Grafik beginnt zu flattern, einzelne Einheiten im Kampf an einer Wand hängenbleiben wodurch das gesammte Regiment nahezu handlungsunfähig wird oder der Kampf in zeitlupe schneller abläuft als mit normaler geschwindigkeit weil das spiel in dieser zu stark rukt (selbst auf PC´s die die Anforderungen übertreffen). Das einizige was den Spielspaß wirklich schmällert sind die Abstürze und teilweise nicht ladbare Speicherstände.

Das Spiel machte sehr lange sehr viel Spaß und steht seinen vorgängern in nichts nach. Die vielen Neuerungen, die es bei den Vorgängern (RomT W oder Medieval 2 TW) noch nicht gab sind nicht nur eine willkommene Abwechslung für alle Fans der Total War Reihe sondern sie machen das Spiel auch wesentlich anspruchsvoller und komplexer. Da fällt es dann kaum noch auf das ab und zu die Grafik beginnt zu flattern, einzelne Einheiten im Kampf an einer Wand hängenbleiben wodurch das gesammte Regiment nahezu handlungsunfähig wird oder der Kampf in zeitlupe schneller abläuft als mit normaler geschwindigkeit weil das spiel in dieser zu stark rukt (selbst auf PC´s die die Anforderungen übertreffen). Das einizige was den Spielspaß wirklich schmällert sind die Abstürze und teilweise nicht ladbare Speicherstände. Dennoch ein gelungenes Spiel.","April 26, 2011","true","188.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my opinion even though it is a little older, it's one of the best strategy games to date. You can easily get lost in it for hours upon hours as evident from my 230+ hours spent on it. In all that time I have not won a single campaign on the normal world domination setting. Now this either means I'm a complete ♥♥♥♥♥, or this game is very challenging as any strategy game should be. I'm personally hoping for the later...\n\nThe downside to this game however, is the time it takes between turns. Even when you have the "show computer turns" setting checked off, it takes a good 5 to 8 minutes, or at least it seems for it to go through all the A.I. turns. This is very annoying, and it does suddenly crash once in a while, so it's best to always remember to save.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to any true strategy game lover!","April 11, 2014","true","282.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the community had been asking for this for ages. So, I'm glad it finally came to be.\n\nGameplay wise. The battles are fun weather it be a massive battle for control of a nations capitol or a small skirmish to harass an enemy force. The campaign map is massive in size and would take ages to fully conquer (Most I ever got was 75% or so). Two things I dislike about this game is the A.I pathing and the A.I. politics. When it comes to pathing its okay and I get it can be hard to do with units made up of a hundred men but when of these men get stuck trying to walk through a cart its brutal. For some reason when one guy gets stuck the whole unit looses the ability to move, shoot, or follow orders properly. Then the politics. The computers are down right awful at times you can offer then every cent you have for one piece of tech and they'd decline.\n\nOther those two details its a great game. The massive scale, the awesome battles, the variety of units, the tactics, the maps, the world map all work together to make a great game.","July 7, 2013","true","265.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like the other Total War games it has a mix of a turn based campaign map where you build up your Cities, Towns, Infrastructure and strategicaly move your troops. Real-Time battles from Open Fields and Seiging Forts to Sea Battles with fleets of heavy first rate ships of the line.\n\nStill the game has issues but they can be looked past, because who doesn't love conquering enemy nations with several "stacks of doom".\n\nPros :\nGame looks great on high graphics settings.\nSound is Great.\nGreat Ship battles with a veriety of ships.\n3 different Continents to conquer - Americas, Europe and India.\nLarge open fields to fight on with large army's.\nHistorical Battles.\nAble to save presets for troop selection (Multiplayer and custom battles).\nDifferent victory conditions.\nMultiplayer, though you don't really see any games on it any more (luckily all the achievments are soloable against the AI).\n\nCons :\nDiplomacy needed alot more work, AI can be completely stupid when it comes to the negotiations asking for rediculas things.\nAI on open field battle needed a bit more work, but its not really noticable here when your having fun slaughtering them all lol.\nThe battle results - Heroic victory etc displays wrong.\nPoorly Optimized for AMD Graphics cards because its sponsored by Nvidia.\nKill 1 million enemies Achievment... ugh this is 1 boring grind, 400+ hours and I haven't hit 200k kills yet.\n\nMy advice is to wait for when it's on sale but it's still too good of a game to wait for that :P","March 5, 2015","true","514.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was unsure whether the radical transition in technology would still offer gameplay I found interesting which is why I put it off for some while.  The RTS battles are indeed completely different and took a while to get used to but the learning curve itself was very enjoyable and it doesn't take long to get used to the different fighting style.\n\nThe large campaign map, while daunting at first, is the perfect next step in a TW game and there is great satisfaction to be had in nuturing a faction from humble begginings to a mighty empire.\n\nThe sea battles are very fluid and surprisingly realistic for The Creative Assembly's first attempt (I have not tried Napoleon TW, not sure how the two compare on this front).\n\nMy only issue with Empire TW is that there is a step away from the intricate historical detail shown in previous titles.  Rome TW and Medieval 2 TW were both very educational in a passive, subliminal kind of way.  It was almost impossible not to learn about the time period and this is something I loved.  Empire TW does not have this to quite the same extent (still above and beyond most other strategy titles) which is not likely to be an issue to most as I imagine most aren't even interested in this factor (maybe I need to get out more?).\n\nAnyway, this game is an impeccable title in a brilliant francise.  I picked this up together with Shogun 2 TW in an offer around £7 and if this is available for a price under £15 it is well worth it.  Even if you are not a fan of startegy games, picking this up when on offer is an absolute must.\n\nOh, and try Rome TW and Medieval TW as well!

After all this time, Empire never fails me. It has had a buggy release, a bumpy start... but I've not played the same amount of time on any other Total War game. Why? Because Empire: Total War has an immense replayability, lots of factions, a great modding community with a large variety of mods, a whole century to play in and half the world as a map. It's a game you'll come back to. I know the Total War fanbase is often divided in those that favour melee like Medieval, Rome... and those that have a soft spot for the muskets. I'm with the latter, but give it a shot. It's a versatile game.\n\nAlso, I'd like to recommend Napoleon: Total War, but where it excels in graphics and gameplay over Empire, it lacks replayability. I, for one, shall always return to Empire for a couple of extra hours of fun. Be it now, or in days or weeks, I'll play this game.\n\nTo end, I'd like to underline the fact that the uniforms of this era are made to outfab the opponent. Yes, that's right, no plain, boring khakis for this man.

I was unsure whether the radical transition in technology would still offer gameplay I found interesting which is why I put it off for some while.  The RTS battles are indeed completely different and took a while to get used to but the learning curve itself was very enjoyable and it doesn't take long to get used to the different fighting style.\n\nThe large campaign map, while daunting at first, is the perfect next step in a TW game and there is great satisfaction to be had in nuturing a faction from humble begginings to a mighty empire.\n\nThe sea battles are very fluid and surprisingly realistic for The Creative Assembly's first attempt (I have not tried Napoleon TW, not sure how the two compare on this front).\n\nMy only issue with Empire TW is that there is a step away from the intricate historical detail shown in previous titles.  Rome TW and Medieval 2 TW were both very educational in a passive, subliminal kind of way.  It was almost impossible not to learn about the time period and this is something I loved.  Empire TW does not have this to quite the same extent (still above and beyond most other strategy titles) which is not likely to be an issue to most as I imagine most aren't even interested in this factor (maybe I need to get out more?).\n\nAnyway, this game is an impeccable title in a brilliant francise.  I picked this up together with Shogun 2 TW in an offer around £7 and if this is available for a price under £15 it is well worth it.  Even if you are not a fan of startegy games, picking this up when on offer is an absolute must.\n\nOh, and try Rome TW and Medieval TW as well!  Good day!","May 2, 2014","true","65.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Conquer, annihilate and rule as you build up your nation and its armed forces, trying to stay one step ahead of your adversaries both technologically and economically. Change history, why not make a Swedish colonial empire? Or a Russian North Africa? Perhaps conquer India as Prussia, all of these are scenarios which you can play out in Empire: Total War.\n\n\nThis is my all time favourite strategy game, and for the absolute ultimate experience, it should be played with DarthMod.\n\nThe game is not without its faults however, the campaign AI might declare war on you even though you have excellent relations with that particular country, the battle AI isn't always the smartest. Regiments won't fire unless every single man has fallen into formation, if even one man is stuck behind a tree a hundred yards away and the enemy is marching on them, they will not fire unless the last man is present in formation.\n\nAll in all, if you like this era of history or even have just a slight interest in it, then I recommend this game strongly.","August 5, 2014","true","250.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But the community had been asking for this for ages. So, I'm glad it finally came to be.\n\nGameplay wise. The battles are fun weather it be a massive battle for control of a nations capitol or a small skirmish to harass an enemy force. The campaign map is massive in size and would take ages to fully conquer (Most I ever got was 75% or so). Two things I dislike about this game is the A.I pathing and the A.I. politics. When it comes to pathing its okay and I get it can be hard to do with units made up of a hundred men but when of these men get stuck trying to walk through a cart its brutal. For some reason when one guy gets stuck the whole unit looses the ability to move, shoot, or follow orders properly. Then the politics. The computers are down right awful at times you can offer then every cent you have for one piece of tech and they'd decline.\n\nOther those two details its a great game. The massive scale, the awesome battles, the variety of units, the tactics, the maps, the world map all work together to make a great game.","July 7, 2013","true","265.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is very instructive, but this is very hard, too, especially at the beginning. But when you learn how to play, you can't practically stop playing.\nCampaign is very entertaining and interesting. You can choose empire from year 1700, and do whatever you want. You can raid trade routes, wage war against other countries and conquer them. You can develop new technology, make massive army/navy and upgarde buildings like farms, for examble.\nYou can play Battle, too. This mode is only for battles against CPU or other players. You can develop your tactics in war and get the great feeling of massive victory.\nI recommend this game for players who are interested in Strategy games. This is elite of Total War -series and all Strategy games. Price of this game is suitable. If you like Strategy, you can play this practically 100+ hrs, so 19,99 € isn't big price. And if you are interested in, buy all DLCs. They are so cool and make this game even better.\nThank you for reading, hope this helped you if you weren't sure, do you buy this or not!\n4,5/5","April 19, 2015","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Campaign map is huge though, good for darthmod or empire total factions (I think thats the name of the mod). Multiplayer is eh kinda dead and a bit broken, Extreme range rifle units, Nuclear howitzers, And Light dragoons that are more accurate than infantry... But if you get good you will ignore these things. Although i dont think the game is worth it at 20.00$. Buy Napoleon Total War if you like multiplayer. Its 15.00$ With a bigger online community left thanks to Youtubers like robinhoodgaming, and a bit smaller but more detailed campaign map. Darthmod also works better on Napoleon Total War.

Mainly because of the AI, in a game were alliances and diplomacy are so essential, you'd think the AI would be great. Its the complete opposite. Allies won't help at all, city states that are allied to you at the start of the game drag you into wars with super powers you can't possibly win and if you break the alliance you lose ALL your allies, and everyone will hate you and go to war with you. Another thing, navies. Navies are very key to the game (as you can imagine) but sadly its very very hard to build one. You start off with no navy to speak of, while other countries (Spain, France) have many fleets. You can try to build a navy, but before its big enough another nation will come along and destroy it. Finally my last issue is up keep of armies. The game is called Total War for a good reason, you are always at war on multiple fronts (which is annoying as you have to put all your money into war and you can't improve your nation). Which means you will need multiple armies, which is hard at the start because your allies wont help and you will get bankrupt, your troops will leave you and you will get overrun. I have played this game alot (I got the game on a disk before I got it on steam hence the measly two hours on record) and have won world domination on hard difficulty. This game is playable but it will be one miserable ride.\nHowever this some moments can be quite good, like when thousands of your cavalry charge down those damn rebels. And when you look over whole continents that belong to you. And when you finally crush filthy France and Spain for constantly hindering your progress. There are good moments and the tears, pain and self harm make it worth it. So maybe you should give it a go. I'm just some kid with too much time on my hands what do I know.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7/10","May 18, 2014","true","22.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It can run on low end computers too, so don`t be worried that you will have problems. This game requires strategy. This isn`t another Call of Duty Game. Because if you use Call of Duty tactics, those brave horsemen on your team will be lying dead on the ground in no time. SO whatever you do, think logically. (e.g. Bringing ranged soldiers into close quarters combat). If you like startegy games that pay off for every action that is sucessful, I think this will become a great addition to your Steam Library, like it is for me :)\n\nHappy Gaming!","June 29, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do It, Now).\nInfantry and naval combat is done very well and is always enjoyable. The DLC is , however, a little bit useless and it could be given as an unlockable for completing the campaign for that nation, in my opinion this would enhance the replay value a lot.\n\nPros,\n+Great combat\n+Traversing the game world on mighty campaigns is amazing.\n+Taxes and Construction are easier in this game which means you take less time faffing about with tax and more time killing your fellow man\n+More brutal and gritty than others in the franchise\n\nCons,\n-Graphics could be better (but this can be forgiven as it came out in 2008)\n-A.I is poor in some aspects (e.g Troops sometimes will not follow orders and prefer to be shot in the mouth or have their stomach slashed open by a bayonet)\n-Lack of Assasins charging through my ranks and then murdering my general with a tomohawk (Disappointed).\n\nFinal Verdict,\n\n9/10  Great game and the pros definately out weight the cons. Would buy again.If you like Rts games then this is a must buy. Happy to have spent nearly 2 full days playing this game.

This game is very instructive, but this is very hard, too, especially at the beginning. But when you learn how to play, you can't practically stop playing.\nCampaign is very entertaining and interesting. You can choose empire from year 1700, and do whatever you want. You can raid trade routes, wage war against other countries and conquer them. You can develop new technology, make massive army/navy and upgarde buildings like farms, for examble.\nYou can play Battle, too. This mode is only for battles against CPU or other players. You can develop your tactics in war and get the great feeling of massive victory.\nI recommend this game for players who are interested in Strategy games. This is elite of Total War -series and all Strategy games. Price of this game is suitable. If you like Strategy, you can play this practically 100+ hrs, so 19,99 € isn't big price. And if you are interested in, buy all DLCs. They are so cool and make this game even better.\nThank you for reading, hope this helped you if you weren't sure, do you buy this or not!\n4,5/5","April 19, 2015","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

So my main objective was trying to gain land without the threat of being mass murdered, I did many other attacks on smaller nations such as the native americans and indians (not racist, but they are really weak) and gained quite a bit of land as well as keeping hostilities in Europe, all happy and friendly. I gained quite a bit of power as I built my armies, gaining more and more elite soldiers along with maitaining my budget, as well as with keeping up with the new technology (like your hip parents try to do). I was doing more than fine now and rekted everyone in North America leaving only me and the 13 colonies, which was now taken over by Britain. I didn't want to start a war equalivent to what a modern-day nuclear war would look like, and would rather avoid turning my ETW into a Fallout game.\nAnyway, back on track, I rekted North America and went back to home sweet Europe. After a few turns, a war broke out between Hannover and Westphilia and I happened to be allied with Hannover. You'll know Westphilia is directly east of France if you play the game, and so I was basically about to crush another metaphoric pebble with my big French boot. So I go and send about 1700 men to besiege it, and another army of about 1500 just in case anything went wrong against the 1600 Westphilian men defending the capital, and proceeded to crush them sustaining barely any casualties other then a small light infantry regiment retreating. Well, I successfully commited genocide wiping them off the face of the Earth and laughed when the "A Region Has Been Defeated" message appeared. I was in a good mood for obvious reasons, and decided to generously handed over the Westphilia territory to the monsters who started the small Holocaust. Hannover. Everytime I play this game I will remember that mistake. I gave them the territory and was slapped in the face with the harshest words ever spoken in the 1700's, "We accept the trade, but don't think this will make us think any better of you!"\n-_-\n\n10/10 IGN\nWOULD COMMIT GENOCIDE FOR UNTHANKFUL ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S AGAIN","July 21, 2015","true","83.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The map covers more of the world than any of the others and lets you conquor India, the Americas and everything inbetween. Combat is easy to get into but also strategically satisfying. However, it is not without its problems. The main one for me being balancing issues between different factions where some can have far superior late game units to others. The agent system is also inferior to some of the newer games like Shogun 2. Despite these issues, I still love the game. Being able to take control of a nation and make it a global empire is very satisfying.\n\nHere's a list of some of the awesome things I was able to do in my campaigns:\n-Turning Sweden into the world's most powerful country.\n-Making the Ottomans colonise America.\n-Fight off pirate fleets in the Caribbean.\n-Amass enought wealth to buy land from other empires.","December 27, 2013","true","462.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have played quite a lot of this game over the years and i have throughly enjoyed myself and still do, i always end up coming back to this game time and time again. The theatre system really helps to make your empire feel huge as it stretches several continents. The combat can get a bit boring at times when your troops just stand there exchanging fire but there is much more strategical depth to it then that. The variation of units isn't bad and with the DLC and mods there is a lot of unique units. I feel that this game has a lot of replayablity because every campaign is different and there are soo many different ways you can approach empire building, there is also a lot of depth into unit research which add new formations and equipment to you units which can change the way you play. This is one of my favorite games of all time, i definetly recommend this game if you have enjoyed any of the other total war games. But if you have played napoleon total war you might find some things lacking like having client states and less ship variation but having theatres really makes up for it in my opinion.","February 26, 2014","true","430.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the second Total War game I've played, I put a few hundred hours into Medieval II so I won't be comparing it to any other TW games.\n\nCampaign Mode: 8/10\nBattle Mode: 7/10\nNaval Battle: 8/10\nLand Battle: 6/10\nSoundtrack: 9/10\nMultiplayer: 5/10\nOverall: 8/10\nI would definitely recommend buying this if you’re a fan of strategy games however I would wait until it’s on sale simply because of how damn buggy it was. I had my first save game corrupted after about 50 turns and after that I had numerous crashes and bugs. The AI was pretty brutal on the campaign map but almost laughably easy to fight against in battle modes, there were numerous times where I could fight off armies numerous times larger than my own simply by letting them charge and eat my canister shot.\n","December 20, 2015","true","80.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It can run on low end computers too, so don`t be worried that you will have problems. This game requires strategy. This isn`t another Call of Duty Game. Because if you use Call of Duty tactics, those brave horsemen on your team will be lying dead on the ground in no time. SO whatever you do, think logically. (e.g. Bringing ranged soldiers into close quarters combat).

It requires deep thinking an strategic moving or just rushing the enemy, the choice is yours. However the fact that this games multiplayer is not suited towards Mac users greatly angers me and I think that the developers should introduce a cross over for multiplayer for both Macs and PC's.","May 19, 2015","true","74.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
