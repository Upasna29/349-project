But I actually tried to find a solution to this by *reading*. There are many topics regarding this problem if you just take a few seconds to look.\nI followed the steps from this topic: https://steamcommunity.com/app/102820/discussions/0/648814845292513057/;\nAnd I can now play my game.\n\nNow. To anyone who have yet to play this game: This is a very intertaining game, if you like the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this genre! I personally love this game and find it incredibly entertaining. There is a lot of things to do and a ton of funny content. Though note, that this isn't like The Sims 3 -- not quite, at least. It is more challenging in some ways and makes you play with different Sims though the quests. Getting the Pirates and Nobles DLC is highly recommended, as it adds more quests, expands the world and adds more NPC's, more clothes and traits.\nThe only bad thing I have to say about this game, really is that you cannot "birdview" the houses nor can you rotate around the house and that if your Sim's path is blocked, it will not tell you what blocks it's path. That being said. This game is so much fun and if you -- like me -- have played the series since the very first The Sims game, then don't let yourself miss out on this one! :)","July 27, 2015","true","325.2"," 203 of 229 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","203","229","12","3"

You will never run out of things to do. Yeah its a pain in the butt to install but its totally worth it and I am here to help.  I read through the comments before purchasing to learn how to install it. I had a lot of difficulty considering I had to read through them all comment by comment and still couldnt get it to download because some steps were left out.\n\nSo heres what I did.\n\n1.- Download the sims from steam.\n2.- Open your sims download through steam and write down your registration code.\n3.- Go to https://www.thesims3.com/register.html If you dont already have one.\n4. Create a login, password, username.\n5. Go to https://www.thesims3.com/registeragame.html and type out the code provided from the steam download.\n\nHeres where it gets fun.\n\nFor users who dont have an origin account you must then go to https://www.origin.com/en-us/download\nDownload Origin [which is basically EA'S STEAM]\n\nWhile that downloads go to-\n\nhttps://signin.ea.com/p/web2/create?execution=e2005779475s1&initref=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.ea.com%3A443%2Fconnect%2Fauth%3Fredirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.origin.com%252Foauth%252Flogin%253Flpu%253Dtrue%2526ru%253D%252Fen-us%252Fdownload%253Flogin%253DWyIiXQ%253D%253D%26locale%3Den_US%26display%3Dweb2%252Fcreate%26response_type%3Dcode%26client_id%3Dlive.origin.com#panel-splash\n\nAnd creat a login.\n\nOnce logged in and Origin is completely downloaded open it up and find 'My Games' section.\nSo now heres where I got super confused while reading peoples comments.\nYou should see the sims there. Everyone here was saying to right click and choose repair but that option is not available at this point yet.\nWhat you need to do is go into your computer and find the steamapps file.\nCreate a folder on your desktop and copy all of the sims files to that folder.\nOnce fully copied, deleted all files for the sims in the steam apps file.\nRestart Origins\nOnce Origins is reopened go to 'My Games' once again and the sims should still be there.\nYou either have install the sims option or if you try to right click now you should have the repair option.\nDo which ever is available.\nI downloaded the sims and then repaired it and ran it perfectly well. In fact I am running it as I type this review.\nI hope I didnt miss any details but if I did, feel free to add me and I can help you out.\nOh one small details is that while running the sims through Origin, it will not display on steam that you are playing it. Thats the only thing I dont like.\n\nAgain I will say this game is amazingly fun good for all gamer types and levels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shalmendo/recommended/102820/","Shalmendo","Shalmendo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shalmendo/","415 products in account","This is a game that I both enjoy, and dislike simultaneously. I enjoy it because of the great medieval theme involved here, and the creative way you add to your kingdom, make new characters, and some of the fun interactions and capabilities of the characters.\n\nWhile this game is a nicely themed re-envisionment of the Sims franchise, it does have some downfalls. The main one being it's not as free and open as the Sims franchise has been known for. The only time you get to actually play the game, is during a quest. The quests provide nice motivation for your characters, like saving the town, thinning the thieves, or maybe hunting down the source of all those goblins. But you must make progress on your quests or a magical constable comes and arrests you and puts you in the stocks for a few days. I found this kind of rediculous and immersion breaking, as well as completely negating the whole 'free and open' style the Sims had from the beginning.\n\nYou are not free and open to do what you like in this game, you must progress on the quest or have consequences. The basic needs have also been twiddled around, there are less of them, and the personality trait system has been truncated. The character motives now affect how well you can succeed at anything you attempt to do, and also affect quest progress and success/failure. It's actually difficult, and somewhat dissatisfying to try and balance the needs, daily living, and progress on the quest simulatenously.\n\nIt does, however, have it's charm and is still an enjoyable game, which is why I still recommend it. The primary purpose for this review is to give people information they need to make a better informed buying decision, knowing that this game is far more structured then the rest of the franchise is. With this in mind, if you are looking for the classic Sims experience in the Medieval era, this is not your game. If, however, you would enjoy being faced with puzzles, challenging quests, and gradually building up your kingdom through questing and careful management of one (or more, depending on the quest) character's lives, while still progressing regularly on the quest as much as possible, then you will find this game interesting. This game seems more directed at people who want less open and free style gaming, and are more interested in adhering to their chosen quest line and taking on the challenge.\n\nThe decision is up to you, it's still a good game, just not quite in the way the rest of the Sims franchise is. I personally haven't found myself playing it as muc has I thought I would, I keep finding other games more interesting, but I do enjoy it when I get around to playing it.","January 13, 2014","true","22.4"," 138 of 165 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","138","165","5","0"

Although the sims don't age, it really doesn't take away from how fun the gameplay actually is. There will be parts where you get overwhelmed trying to manage more than two sims and their responsibilities. But if you played any of the original sims games, then that should come as no shock. I absolutely recommend also getting the Pirates and Nobles expansion pack for more items, decor, etc. It really just improves the game and makes that much more better~","May 19, 2015","true","106.7"," 50 of 55 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","50","55","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/venomblood4/recommended/102820/","venomblood4","Azor Ahai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/venomblood4/","140 products in account","I'll right a review that might actually be helpful for you, let aside that half of the sodding negative reviews are mainly because of Windows 8. EDIT: It says in the descriptions "OS: " and proceeds to list the only OSs you can use, you butthurt ♥♥♥♥♥ (not saying this to the reader, just to the people who are complaining because they didnt read the bloody description).\n\nI havent played this game in a while but I'll try to remember the most I can. First off, if you have Windows 8 go play Europa Universalis IV or Crusader Kings II, two empire-building games that are by far some of the best of the Grand Strategy Genre. (TL;DR version below the wall of text. I do however advise everyone to read that, for I put some things in there that I left out of the wall of text)\n\nNow that we can actually start, let's begin. This game is alright. Not the best, it has its faults; the fact that you have to diplo-annex other nations and you cant take them by force, being the biggest drawback. Otherwise, it's a very nice experience for a Sims game, bringing in a concept that I wish were in the Sims 3: Religion. Most people would complain their little asses because of it, but I find it a very alluring concept, especially for a game that allows you to be a King with no explanitory cause. I also quite liked the fact that you can assign a council of jobs to your Sims, and switch between them and your king during missions. Bringing up missions, however, is something I myself had a little problem with. Throughout the entire game, you HAVE to switch between Sims during missions until you get a Free Play mission, of which I usually just cheated straight at the beginning. Playing the missions without my own Sim, I found myself being bored out of my mind at the linear pathway, which just doesn't work for a Sims game. Also, theres a wide variety of customisation for your castle and kingdom.\n\nSorry if I left anything out, because its been a few months at most since I've played the game. Overall, however, I would recommend the game, especially if youre one of the die-hard Sims players that simply do not get bored at not shoving sims into small confined boxes and then leave them there to die, like most people who play the Sims do. I dont use an arbitrary scaling system for games, since they simply shouldnt have them. But if I did, I'd say itd be around a 7 or 8 on a 10 scale.\n\nTL;DR Version\nPros :\n-Customisation\n-Religious System\n-Wide variety of regions to explore\n-Isles you can discover and claim for your kingdom\n-Kingdom Council system and overall pretty cool mission ideas\n-Parents eaten by a whale trait\n-You can build up your town using the peasants taxes, or use them to your own greed\n-Law making system\nCons :\n-Linear story\n-Limited Annexation of other Rulers\n-Draconian system of missions and limited freedom to do what you please\n-It's EA. Theres probably microtransactions for the style of silk you want.","October 24, 2014","true","36.9"," 83 of 107 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","83","107","10","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/c00lizz/recommended/102820/","c00lizz","c00lizz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/c00lizz/","2086 products in account","The Sims Medieval starts you off with a Patrick Stewart sounding voice telling you that you are the Maker, the god of these lands and your task is to influence and control the inhabitants of your world to great success. The unfortunate reality is however that you are not the god of your Sims, the game is, and the game does not want you to do things it doesn't tell you to do.\n\nMedieval has all the aspects of a regular Sims game. You mold your characters appearances and dress them. You build their homes for them and guide them through their daily lives of both the mundane and the extraordinary. All of this has been toned down significantly however. You only have limited tools to shape your Sims with, their wardrobe is fairly small. The houses are all presets and you have only a few items with which to decorate them.\n\nIn The Sims Medieval you create Heroes rather than ordinary Sims and besides their usual capabilities each Sim also has a profession which defines their lives and goals. The Monarch for example will have to write laws, hold court and occasionally hunt a boar whereas the physician will have to collect leeches, heal the sick and cure the lame. Each day you are given new tasks to complete and failing to do so will hurt your Sims focus and could lead to all manner of dreadful things happening to your game.\n\nIn a regular game of The Sims you might have to go to work or have other daily responsibilities that need to be completed for the good of your Sim and in Medieval these chores have become the focal point of the game. Each campaign lets you pick from a number of available quests, which quest you select decide which hero or heroes you get to play with and both the overall campaign as well as the individual quests take place on a timer creating a very hectic feel to it all. Should you tarry too long, complete the quests inadequately or just spend too much time making friends with the locals you may fail the campaign and be forced to start the whole experience over from scratch.\n\nEach campaign is a self-contained adventure and at the beginning of each one you have to create your heroes all over again devoid of any skills or friends they might have had in your previous campaign.\n\nPlaying through Medieval in general feels much a like the daily chores on which the game seem to focus so much of it's attention. Everything is repetition and completing a quest only gives you a momentary relief because you know that come the next campaign you will have to do it all over again.\n\nA little respite is gained from the various choices you get to make, both at the beginning of quests and during the course of completing them. A powerful witch has encroached on your lands, do you send your Monarch to marry her? Your Knight to slay her? Or your Wizard to steal her power? And once you begin you have a number of key events throughout the quest that offers you different options as how to proceed although not all of them leads to different outcomes. All of this adds a nice little buffer in between you and the chore of knowing you have to do the same quest multiple times throughout your playthrough however much of that respite is lost when you realize that you are not going to defeat the Dragon that threatens your lands, you are going to send your Knight off to do it and then he'll send you a postcard back telling you how it went.\n\nGraphically it is much the same as the Sims with a pleasant cartoony look to it. The sounds are dominated by the usual cute Sim gibberish and are equally enjoyable.\n\nAll in all The Sims Medieval is a nice idea that gets mucked up by some dreadful execution. If you are the kind of guy that can't get enough of taking out the trash and doing the dishes then this is probably the game for you, for the rest of us, it is a game to avoid.","June 5, 2013","false","179.4"," 91 of 129 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","91","129","3","1"

I'm not down-voting this game because it doesn't live up to my standards, I'm down-voting because I cannot get it to run due to my CD KEY's being invalid and this has something to do with DRM. It is a sad day when you are an avid Sim fan and cannot play one of the games you have always wanted. Steam should remove this title from the store since it no longer works.\n\nUPDATED REVIEW: 16/04/2016I have fixed the problem by taking Skully’s advice. I have also created a guide to help those users whom still want to play the game, but use the Steam Overlay.\n\nGAME FIXESSo I took Skully's help and it seemed to work. Register your game on the Sims 3 site and then uninstall the game from steam. Go to origin and install it there. To use Steam overlay simply add a non-steam game as origin.exe.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=659251679","December 24, 2015","true","0.6"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","27","36","2","7"

Quite easily! EA has released a patch. All you need to do is take the serial key you get from steam and download Origin- You can put in the serial key and download it from Origin- Patched and ready to play!\n\nNow about the actual game- The normal Sim player might not like this title, its different than the normal game in that you can't just play willy nilly. You accept quests and go through that quest as the hero's you've selected! To me it comes across as a 'choose your own adventure' type quest system where you go do different objectives and get to chose between different options at different points. This can have huge impact on the quest- Heck- Even the HEROES that you pick for the quest will have a influence! Some quests can be completed using Say- your Monarch and the Knight. While the same ques can be completed using the Spy and the Wizard for a totally different quest line.\nThis adds more depth and replayability to the game I belive.\n\nDo NOT come into this game thinking its Sims 3 with mediveal influences- No. Its its own type of game using a simmilar interfase and interactions, but it plays much differently. I've gotten several friends to play this game and once they've gotten past the fact that its not Sims 3 they have all loved it.","June 23, 2014","true","32.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The Sims Medieval is similar to the regular Sims play however building is different. You cannot add to the castle or other building but instead you navigate through quest in order to unlock new locations.  I also like how it has implemented some of the terms that would have been used during this time (like complimenting a women’s ankles). Very nice game to play and relax.","June 29, 2014","true","16.5"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","27","37","0","1"

But... I did find that if you run the TSM.exe in the game files the game will boot and run perfectly. No needing to mess around with CD codes, uninstalling and reinstalling or loading through Origin. I had this game when it first came out and I've wanted it again for a while, and I really enjoy it...  So if the only thing putting you off getting this game is the fact that Windows 8 onwards doesn't agree with it, just try this, and if it doesn't work you can always get a refund... Running the .exe worked for me,  and it is how I told my boyfriend to try and run it and it worked for him too. If you really want the steam overlay in game just add the .exe as a non steam game to your library.","December 24, 2015","true","0.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

I didn't read the reviews about the lack of ability to use this game on steam since I didn't need reviews to know I wanted this game. It seems back when he got it, the authentication still worked so when I saw it on sale and purchased it for myself I didn't think anything of it. Upon doing so I realized the game is basically broken on steam and you have to use origin. If I wanted to use origin I would have bought it directly from them. Refunded the game, uninterested in using anything other than steam. I'm not even mad at steam since its EA that won't update and support their own games (shocker). Though I do think steam should write there on the product page that this is the case. It was a hassle trying to figure out why it wouldn't accept my product key.

I absolutely love that game, and I wish I had it on Steam so I could share a true hearted review of that.\n\nThe Sims Medieval is somewhere between the two games and it also stands on its own. The Sims don't vanish into rabbit holes (most of the time) but the character creation reminds me more of the Sims 2 then anything else. You play a rather large group of sims, never all at the same time, but sometimes you do play a chunk of them at the same time sometimes. You are a Monarch, Bard, Blacksmith, two religous leaders, Knight, Doctor, Wizard and Spy. All made to fit YOUR NEEDS. Your monarch can be a grumpy stick in the mod, or something akin to a court jestor. You want the Spy and Wizard to get married and have babies? You can totally do that as well.\n\nI thought the game was going to be a homage to the Sims 2, if anything... But I was wrong. Its different. It stands on its own two legs as a fun game thats quest driven. Before you start the game you pick what quest you want to do. Fight off invanding frogs, find a genie, locate a missing child, whatever you want to do really. Each quest effects how other countries see you and how your citizens act around the kingdom. A country with high intellgience is more likely to be invaded by war mongering countries. A country with high defense is more likely to attract some unsavory characters who think they will be safe there.\n\nDepending on YOUR actions the kingdom gets shaped and molded.","March 4, 2014","true","38.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

I always enjoy playing it but I always feel limited. I love city builders, simulators and rpgs. And while this does simulate medieval life (+ magic and usual sim jokes and puns) it doesn't hold up on the city building and rpg side. Each new building has to be placed in an area already specified by the game. You don't get to build the buildings either, they all have a predefined shape. You do get to decorate the inside though and thats good.\n\nRPG wise, each sim can go on "Quests". Which allow you to level them up in their job (You create sims for a job as opposed to creating a sim and choosing a job) and unlock Legendary traits (which replaces the negative trait of your sim, although you could replace a positive trait if you really wanted). To play the game, you must choose a quest and a sim on the quest, then you are locked in until you either succeed or fail. The quest is split into tasks which you must complete, which can feel rather drawn out at times. However these quests do start to feel repetitive, especially when the same quest can occur multiple times. You'll eventually find yourself playing the same quest over and over again in an effort to build up the most RP(points required to build new things around your kingdom) and raise kingdom stats.\n\nI do like the stat system, being able to view how educated/healthy/cultural/protected your kingdom is, is interesting. Although, I can't find a purpose behind it. They don't seem to contribute to anything, there aren't any obvious negative effects to having low stats.\n\nI do like this game, its adventurous and shows that developers are willing to try new things and I feel this should be encouraged. While this game wasn't a roaring success in terms of gameplay or popularity, it was still entertaining. If you're looking for a casual game that doesn't require a lot of thought, get this. If you're looking to start a sprawling metropolis or raise a family, might want to try one of the other sims titles. (Sim city/The Sims).","April 2, 2014","true","9.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While I'm welll aware this game probably only appeals to a very select number of players (those who enjoy the Sims games and rpgs), it still has a lot to offer in terms of gameplay. The customization, and freedom that simmers have come to take for granted, is very limited, but the storyline is actually kind of entertaining. If you're looking for an open world medieval themed game then you will be disappointed, but as a fan of rpgs and the sims, I had a lot of fun.\n\nSecond of all, I would like to address many of the technical concerns surrounding this game. At least in my case, this game did not work through Steam. I did some desperate research trying to get it to work, and someone recommended installing it through origin using the serial code. I tried to register the game through Origin as a last ditch effort, and it worked. Origin told me to register through the Sims 3 store (which doesn't make sense because it's NOT a Sims 3 game). I put in the serial code through the sims 3 website, and the game was downloaded to the Origin library, I have also heard that the game does not work on Windows 8 operating systems, but I can't verify if that's true because I don't have windows 8.\nI would not recommend buying this at full price (considering the possibility of technical difficulties). As of the date of my posting, this item was on sale for $3.39.","December 26, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is little reason to play this game if you like choice in your sims games. There are forced duties, which tend to take over alot of your time in each day to complete. These duties can be short, quick things to archaic or time consuming. (Blacksmithing for instance; where you have to go out mining resourves, return to your forge and create an item.) There is ZERO house building, none. You get a basic template, are allowed to change the walls and add furniture. Most of which have no purpose outside of being decorative. This would be fine if it were not for the fact that there were actually items that did allow you to distract your sim but there is no need in this game as you are expected to be an automaton devoted to nothing but your sims job and quests. This is a bad, bad game with alot of promised that was shrugged off by EA and deemed a failure because people got fed up with having their hand held and given a blinder. 34/100 for me, if you like on-rails day to day life simulators in medieval times? Go crazy, this needs a modding community to make it playable for me.","February 23, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Sims Medieval adds quest and task-based gameplay to the sim shenanigans you'd expect, looking at this game. You don't build houses on lots anymore; This has been replaced with customizing various things in the kingdom such as the throne room, wizard's tower, tavern, etc. Furthermore the households you control have been switched out with 'heroes' such as the King, Wizard, Knight, etc. that you control while questing. Aside from doing storyline quests, you have daily tasks that differ from character to character to keep the kingdom running.\n\nAll in all it's pretty neat for what it is, and I would reccommend it, if it worked.

Go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves you inbred ♥♥♥♥♥, learn to read the ♥♥♥♥ing requirements and then complain about the ♥♥♥♥ing product. ♥♥♥♥♥.  Not that i support big gaming companies, they are the ones that literaly destroy the titles we love every year, but  what is right is right. Besides windows 8 is for ♥♥♥♥, so steam should be asking a refund from your families for you being born. on with the review....\n\nSo i encountered a game  called guild commander, where you get to build your own guild get heroes and send them adventuring, but it had a 2-3 hour playtime maximum once you get to undestand the mechanics and besides the guild everything you did was theoretical,meaning you just clicked on options and things happened on your numbers. interesting enough for stoner tbs freaks like me but small. so i went to a psychiatrist to discuss my problem and he recommended i give a try to the sims medieval. ME? SIMS? What am i some kind of of girly man? hah!\nTo my everlasting shame he was not only right, but i had so much fun with it i don't want too cuddle with my girlfriend anymore, but i rather send my king to cuddle with my sorceress. Long story short, i never liked the sims, trying to live a life i already live in a virtual enviroment is a NO-NO for me. Before i continiue i should mention that people with windows 8, can't play the game and it's long abbandoned by it's creators, EA is it? LOL anyway, TSM works very differently than the sims, it has kept basic mechanics for socializing ect, but after that is more of a village manager, you build your throne room and bed chambers, create you sim-monarch and you start your daily monarchy duties while adventuring hunting, fighting, exploring, discovering, and doing quests in an rpg manner. after each mission you get to build something new at your castle and create the sim that is gonna run the building. Knight for the barracks, smith for the smithy, bard for the tavern ect. after that you choose what quests to do, choose the avaliable hero to it and the manner of approach.  Love the soundtrack, camera feels icky at times and the front view of the buildings can get frustating,  there are some glitches that can ruin your save, like after you do or build something or sometimes make a choice your sim can't get anywhere from ehre he is, there is a way to use the ea testing cheats though and fix that (it worked for me when my knight could not walk anywhere, i shift-clicked and teleported him 5 m away and then he could walk like normal). Overall it's a very relaxing medieval fun-time game that i can't wait to fully explore.

However, Origin will not let you enter the game code. It tells you to enter the code on the Sims 3 site. The Sims 3 site however, does not have the correct interface to enter the code. So if you buy this game on Steam you will end up with a game code you can't use, and a game you can't play. This review is not over the gameplay as I never got that far. It is a warning to people to save their time and money and not buy this game on Steam.","December 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

A regular sims game is this: 1.get a person 2. get a house 3. Do whatever you want. This game is not that you must make choices that will affect the end game just so that if you want that goal then you have to start al over again. After you buy your house you can have 2 seperate sims as one as a police officer and one as a burgalur.

The Quest system is fairly fun and the fact you only have so many points to spend on quests and need to use a little bit of stratagy to acomplish your Ambitions adds a nice layer to it. It's also a great game if you enjoy having multiple Sims to play with.\nIf your into the character design aspect you'll enjoy the fact you can change the costumes of the NPCs if they are in the same building as you are.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe down side is that sometimes what you need to do to occomplish something is not as obvious as the game seems to think it is. I highly recommend that when it asks you if you want to read more about something you do so and find a good wiki for the game and keep it handy in case you get stuck.\nThe game can also be a hell of a time sink because it dose not feel like it takes as long to do the quests as it really dose. Though the fact it dosen't feel that long might be a plus.\nAnother thing you might find a bit  vexing is that you only have a side view of the rooms you can decorrate. Though you do get use to it after a bit.\n\nUltimately I'd say give it a try. If you are weary of doing so wait til it's on sale and then try it out. Or find a friend who has it and see if it's for you.","January 18, 2015","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only needs that you really have to worry about are hunger and energy.  Everything else gives either buffs or debuffs.  You don't have to worry about going to the bathroom periodically, for example, but doing so gives you a buff.\n\nThere's a number of fun minigames in the form of crafting and performing medicine on people...  And different professions have genuinely different mechanics.  Your wizard, for example, can learn and cast spells...  Your merchant can sail the world trading cargo for profit...  While your physician can brew up healing potions and slap leeches on people.\n\nYou don't actually get to build your own structures.  You pick a clinic and it just drops in-place, pre-built.

The Quest system is fairly fun and the fact you only have so many points to spend on quests and need to use a little bit of stratagy to acomplish your Ambitions adds a nice layer to it. It's also a great game if you enjoy having multiple Sims to play with.\nIf your into the character design aspect you'll enjoy the fact you can change the costumes of the NPCs if they are in the same building as you are.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe down side is that sometimes what you need to do to occomplish something is not as obvious as the game seems to think it is. I highly recommend that when it asks you if you want to read more about something you do so and find a good wiki for the game and keep it handy in case you get stuck.\nThe game can also be a hell of a time sink because it dose not feel like it takes as long to do the quests as it really dose. Though the fact it dosen't feel that long might be a plus.\nAnother thing you might find a bit  vexing is that you only have a side view of the rooms you can decorrate. Though you do get use to it after a bit.\n\nUltimately I'd say give it a try. If you are weary of doing so wait til it's on sale and then try it out. Or find a friend who has it and see if it's for you.","January 18, 2015","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can ignore the quests if you so choose to. I thought leveling your kingdom, acquiring new buildings and heroes, whom all have unique abilities, was a really fun process.\n\nOverall, what I believe to be the game's strong points might be considered turnoffs by others.

I put her in the stocks, then through eggs at her. It's good to be the king.\n\nIf you've played Skyrim wishing you could design your house and your spouse then this is your game.\n\n9/10\n\nThe lost of words stuff:\n\nI'm not going to lie, getting this game to run was a total pain but absolutely worth it (installation tips below). I think it took me maybe an hour but omg. I have literally dreamt of this game, and wow, it delivers. To install, you just need to download and run origin, sync any existing Sim accounts and/or create an Origins account- annoying but doable. Don't even bother downloading via Steam just want until Origin is up and running and then enter your product key from Steam.\n\nWhy I love it. If you've played Skyrim wishing you could design your house and your spouse then this is your game. And it's awesome. I'm not going to say it's perfect but it's a really, really good game. It's very large so you can definitely see where there made some cutbacks in game mechanics, but it's pretty bug-free. I've found a few and had one major crash in about 12 hours of game play.\n\nAlso, it might have been 12 hours of straight game play because I fell in. I got home from work and started playing at 4:30 pm. I put the game down at 4:30am, and felt like I could have kept going. I think I spend about half the time running through the missions and about half designing because I can spend an hour designing a new character.\n\nThe character design system is almost flawless. I've found one problem with eye color that can really muck things up. It's annoying but I can live with it. Also it does do a weird thing with my saved eye shadow. But the fact that I am discussing my saved eye shadow color- says everything. This was always one of my favorite things about the original Sims and I still love it. I have spent 5 minutes, maybe more, debating my chin. Don't even get me started on how long it takes me to pick a hairstyle.\n\nChoosing their persnalities is great, and when you get to see them in practice, it's amazing. I designed an friendly, earthy herbalist (who needs her own cures more often then she manages to sell them) for my egotistcal but dedicated king. I got to play a mission where he wooed her, and it was perfect. She was perfect. They're now happily married and have had so many kids, I've started sending lesser ones off into the world.\n\nWhile characters don't age, they can die (for real) in missions, so I'm going to have to pick one of their offspring as an heir. There's a boy who's playful but vain and cruel and there's a girl who inherited her mother's gentle spirit. Decisions! Decisions!\n\nAbout all the side characters. On the one hand, I love designing all these people, but all these people have jobs. My favorite to play is the king, because his job is so easy. But some are really difficult to figure out at first, and really demanding! I've started skipping the ones that are too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ (f*ing leeches) and then trying to sleep through the guilt. Sometimes though it's really hard to figure out what these daily missions want from you. There are help pop-ups everywhere, so I can't figure out why you don't get one when you start playing a new character, to tell me how to trade my wood.\n\nSometimes the main missions can be a real pain the ♥♥♥ and really complicated too. My herbalist was constantly pregnant and to complete her mission she needed to have a drink, but I wasn't allowed to drink because I was pregnant. Goddamit.\n\nOh, another thing, if you marry into the royal household, your life kind of sucks. The king can order you to make dinner but you can't order the servants to do that. Your stuff is still over at your other place, so you're always running back and forth. Also, you're still doing your day job, while pregnant/nursing, and runing the big missions.\n\nI could honestly keep going, but I just wanna go play.","September 5, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestly, it gets a little slow from time to time and character management can be just as frustrating as the other titles in the franchise. Regardless, I enjoyed playing this game, it was fun, the minor combat system added into the game (dueling) is enjoyable, increasing your characters abilities is fun, and I really enjoyed the small diplomacy system added into the game (wish it was expanded upon).

The official workaround currently from EA is to set your computer back to 2011 and install but this workaround seems to no longer work for Windows at the time of this review (Feb 2016) and apparently never worked for Mac.\n\nAs of now the only option is to download Origin, uninstall entirely from steam and register the given codes to play the game through Origin. I didn't want to do that as Origin has already lost an entire account with games on it due to a "." in the email I used to register. However after several years I am redownloading the client just to try and get this game to work.\n\nWhile this is no fault of Steam's I do wonder why Steam is still selling a game that won't work on their platform. I also suspect that EA isn't working on fixing this issue despite their claims of "standing behind their games" because anyone who purchased from Steam has to either seek a refund or move over to their platform which suits them perfectly.","February 22","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music and the teture are amazing. I wish there was something like it with more options for building, political drama, political influence, historical (based, though the name Medieval is severely misleading. It should be Renaissance.) I wish, I truly wish that they would remake it or just make a new game similar and yet better than this one. It breaks my heart...","January 11","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That would be awesome as well!

You can buy it via Steam and get it working via the Origin client. Still a good game but not worth the hassle through Steam. Really frustrated by this change.\n\nOriginal review:I love this game but do NOT buy this game if you want another typical Sims game. Buy this game if you want something new, but still the Sims. If you buy it knowing that you will hopefully enjoy it as much as me! Be sure to get the Nobles and Pirates expansion as well.\n\nThis is a quest based game. You have a certain number of sims and each has a job in the kingdom. You only control the sims that are actively participating in the current mission. If you take too long to complete your mission you lose points that you need to progress. But with practice you will learn how to keep the missions on track while still getting the most time free playing with your sims. Plus there's a free play mode you can unlock as well.\n\nThe personalty traits you can choose for your sims are great and have funny results, it means each play through is a bit different. I actually get more attached to my Medieval sims than to my Sims on the main Sims games (1,2 and 3!). They really have a story and their actions affect the whole kingdom, they're quirky and live interesting lives.\n\nIf you enjoy killing your Sims in interesting ways normally, you may be surprised and find yourself, like me, doing anything to avoid killing them in Sims Medieval. You get attached, you put a lot of work into helping them stay alive, life wasn't so easy in the dark ages!\n\nFrom hunting, fighting mystical beasts, unfurling plots, healing the sick, torturing people for information, learning to craft, selling your wares, converting the infedels with love or fear, being a good monarch or an evil one. The people will love or hate you. You'll have to pass laws and negotiate your way into friendly benefecial alliances with other territories by befriending their leaders.\n\nThis isn't an open world where you freely create. This is a world where the buildings are auto built for you, you just get to choose which order they're built in. At first I was disappointed by this but found later that it allows you more time to focus on your actual sims, you can change the decor in their homes to match their personalities if you want, it's always fun to decorate for a modest, greedy, fear mongering and religious or pirate king/Queen, there are enough options to keep things interesting.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to the open minded!","January 30, 2015","false","153.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
