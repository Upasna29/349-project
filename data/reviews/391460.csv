It does seem like a csgo knock off but does provide some decent graphics and gameplay. However, this game has some major flaws. The biggest one of all was the non-stop hacking. In every channel, i ran into at least 5 different hackers who killed my teamates and I, who were at different parts of the map. with a knife while they were at their respawn point. Another thing that was common was the constant head shots from the respawn point. However, that wasn't the nail in the coffin for me. What was was that one of the ADMINs named "plasma" joined our game and started hacking as i had described in my past sentences. After he killed me for the second time (within  5 seconds and across the map), he had typed in the chat saying, "I am sending a virus to your computer." and then my computer completely froze. I had to unplug my computer, rip out the battery, and finally decided to reboot to see if anything came up. Thank God nothing did show up. However, due to these events, i have uninstalled the game and have told my friends to do so as well. For those of you looking to download this game, ABSOLUTELY DO NOT unless you want a potential virus on your computer!!!!!","October 13, 2015","false","33.0"," 223 of 263 people (85%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","85","223","263","54","22"

Place in a large bowl with cold water.\n\nIn a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne pepper, and Old Bay seasoning. Whisk in the beer until the batter is completely smooth and free of any lumps. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Note: The batter can be made up to 1 hour ahead of time.\n\nDrain potatoes thoroughly, removing any excess water. When oil reaches 320 degrees, submerge the potatoes in the oil. Working in small batches, fry for 2 to 3 minutes until they are pale and floppy. Remove from oil, drain, and cool to room temperature.\n\nIncrease the temperature of the oil to 375 degrees. Re-immerse fries and cook until crisp and golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and drain on roasting rack. Season with kosher salt while hot and hold in the oven.\n\nAllow oil to return to 350 degrees. Lightly dredge fish strips in cornstarch. Working in small batches, dip the fish into batter and immerse into hot oil. When the batter is set, turn the pieces of fish over and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain the fish on the roasting rack. Serve with malt vinegar.\n","March 14","false","0.1"," 257 of 313 people (82%) found this review helpful 313 people found this review funny","82","257","313","313","14"

And if you were wondering, this is NOT a pay 2 win game! There is a shop in the main menu, but the only things you can buy are badges and skins which are only cosmetic features for your soldier. They do not help you gain an unfair advantage unlike most free 2 play FPS games. Every gun you cam get is earned through getting kills, which award you with in-game cash to buy better guns. My tip to get more kills in this game is to: 1. By a SPAS-12 shotgun at the very start of the match -> 2. Kill enough dudes until you can afford the AK-47 -> 3. After you buy the AK, kill more dudes until you can afford the maximum 100 point body armor. 4. Now that you have the basic needs, you can continue killing until you can afford an AWP or LMG -> 5. Repeat same steps in next match. This tactic works best for me and it's helped me improve my game a lot (With this strategy, I get over a 2 KD average each match). Another piece of advice is to just hip fire, don't bother aiming down the sights unless you are holding down a choke point or using a sniper rifle. Spraying and praying will kill people ALOT better/faster than ADSing. Trust me. Oh. Also, if you meet some good/skilled players along the way, ask them to friend request you. If you have a massive team of good players, you will just rekt the ♥♥♥♥ out of ALL the noobs that try to fight back. Overall, this game is really worth a try. Like most reviews I've seen, this game is like a CS and CoD hybrid. So, is you're a fan of either these games, chances are, this game will be a ton of fun for you. But, if you don't like it, just delete it and no harm is done. Besides, the game is only like 200 MB, so it doesn't take up much space anyway. That's about it for what I have to say.

This is just a CSGO knock-off, when I say this I don't mean just gameplay I mean like entire maps from CSGO were taken and reskinned. I know for a fact I at least saw Dust II. The maps are half the size they should be, its just a bloodbath. My last game I went 50-17 (KD) with just a sniper. The spawn protect is broken. They get protected just as long as Deathmatch on CSGO only in this game they keep that spawn protect even while moving and shooting. How did I determine this you ask? By shooting 3 AWP shots in the chest and they don't go down. That's not all, if someone gets behind a crate they can see you clearly and all you can see is the tip of their head. It's near impossible to hit them considering the guns shoot wherever they want in the general direction your shooting from. This game is also riddled with hackers, either that or some people are piggybacking off their local McDonalds wifi. 5 minutes in and you know weapon damage is broken too. For example the AUG does the damage of a sniper. The AK 47 should be more powerful than the AUG.

It's good when you want to have some FPS fun, but without all the complex or complicated stuff from major games such as CS and CoD, which this game clearly is heavily influenced by. Just join a game, buy a weapon and kill! Each frag grants you an amount of money, so you can buy better weapons.

I do enjoy it, it's basically CS meets CoD, which is kind of a...Bad thing, I guess?\n\nYou can buy stuff with the money you get after killing people, pretty much like in CS. You can get better weapons, armor, grenades, lots of stuff like that. Also, lots of weapons from counter strike games appear here, which is a plus.\n\nOn the other hand, it resembles CoD, mostly because there is almost zero recoil when you aim down the sights and enemies are bullet sponges. BUT, this game doesn't allow you to go prone, so that's a big ♥♥♥♥ing plus over CoD.\n\nMusic is meh, controls are standard when it comes to FPS games, so there is not much to complain about that.Guns are re-skins at the moment, which kind sucks. Just pick the one with the most ammo and the best iron sights.\n\nSo far, this game is midly entertaining, albeit kinda generic, gameplay wise. You can buy all the weapons in the game without having to use real cash, which is amazing, so it's definitely not P2W. For an early access F2P game, it's not as bad as I expected, I expected something ♥♥♥♥♥♥ like Tactical Intervention.\n\nAlso, I dunno if it's just me, or the game itself, but there's LOTS of lag spikes all the time, even in US servers. I dunno what's this all about. Also, it's extremely easy to spawncamp, spawns are mostly small spaces with two entrances, just put players on each exit and farm kills. That definitely needs to get fixed. I've seen games where one of the teams can't even get out of the spawn, at all. It's fun when you are on the camping team, but if not...It's pretty damn frustrating.\n\nAlso, what pretty can kill this game...Sometimes, even if you play on servers close to you, the game's got a serious problem with lag. And with sometimes, I'm talking about 8/10 servers you try to access. When you find a good, not so laggy server, you're all set.\n\nSo far, this game is a mixed bag. I do like it, but it gets stale after a while, plus, if you are expecting something extremely good, you will be dissapointed. Just give it a try, see for yourself, it's free to play after all.","August 28, 2015","true","6.0"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","33","45","2","2"

I have a lot of issues with connecting to servers and most of the time I get audio errors which cause all my sound in game to be delayed.\n\nThe core mechanics of the game could use a lot of work as well. The price of some of the guns are very steep compared to how much you earn per kill, enough so that if you want one of the better sniper rifles you will be running around most of the game with a pistol trying to kill people with AK's and shotguns just to try and afford it. However some of the most powerful weapons are priced extremely cheap. The Spas hits like and absolute truck (argubly overpowered, you can snipe with it) and you can buy it as soon as you get in the game. The price of some of the guns also causes you to be stuck with whatever gun you buy the entire game.\n\nThe movement feels very floaty and you never really feel like your character is touching the floor as well as the aiming just feels off at times. Characters often bug out and will run through walls or completely disappear. What I have ran into a lot has been seeing enemies who appear to just be running, they are not aiming at me at all and don't appear to be looking at me, just to have my character randomly die from them.\n\nThere are a ton of bugs in this game at the moment and it really feels borderline unplayable. However with that being said the game is in early access and it's clear to see what the developers are trying to do with the game. There are a lot of small things in this game that I think they're doing well. It's a simple design, the game doesnt feel cluttered and over complicated. The idea of a kind of CS meets CoD type FPS is intriguing and one that I think could be executed well with the right team behind it. I'm going to recommend this game even with it's faults under the assumption that the developers really put the time in to cleaning the game up and improving on it, It's very rough around the edges right now but the potential for a really fun game is here.","August 27, 2015","true","5.6"," 41 of 59 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","41","59","6","0"

Guess which one Warmode is? First off: Warmode is about as generic of a shooter as you can get, it features the bland, old formula of Terrorists VS. Counter-Terrorists that we’ve seen a million times now. It features a generic cast of weapons from M4’s to P90’s snipers, shotguns, etc. etc. You’d be forgiven in thinking that this game doesn’t sound all THAT bad, I mean come on, it’s just sounds like some generic shooter dreamt up by some Call of Duty fanboy who payed a moderate amount attention in his 11th grade computer science class to learn the basics of coding enough to get a copy of Insert Generic Game Engine Here to make a first person shooter, but the real meat of this game is in its mechanics, or lack of. This game has about THE most broken mechanics I have ever seen in a shooter, and I’m not talking about “Promised game-changing mechanics are clucky and gimmicky”, no. I’m talking about the fundamental parts of what makes modern FPS games tick are broken and glitch. All guns for some strange reason the same accuracy spread, you can iron sight while reloading, this doesn’t even matter, because iron sighting doesn’t help much regardless, the KNIFE has accuracy, so you basically have to be standing still in order to knife someone, sometimes you randomly die without any mention of who killed you, or how you died, and that’s just scratching the surface of how broken this game is. The maps are too small to have any meaningful firefight, with the exception of one map, two of the maps are still in block out with placeholder textures spewed everywhere, the spawn protection gives no indication of when it where’s off, leading you to empty full magazines into the opponent, only for him to notice your presence and promptly take you out like he’s God or something, and on occasion, you are flung into the air like you’ve been scooped up by a magical, invisible, tornado, only to return to the ground unharmed (Because of course this game doesn’t have fall damage). Overall, you’re better off making your own shooter than to play this peace of crap excuse for a multiplayer game.","May 1","false","2.8"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","26","33","10","0"

Some of them are literally aim maps (which exist in cs only to keep you from being distracted, not because the textureless aesthetic is good).\n\nAs far as I can tell, all the servers are in russia, so if you're in the states or probably even europe, prepare for lag. A lot of it. In particularly bad servers, you can even kill yourself by walking into your own knife stabs. Yep.\n\nThere is only one game mode: TDM, instant respawn, first team to 150 kills.\n\nOther reviews talk about cheaters, but I haven't seen any myself after about 3 hours of games. I went to see if there were any hacks available, but they were all outdated and/or patched. There may be more on a russian site I simply can't access, since it's probably more popular there, but on english sites there seems to be no interest in cheating on this game. It's not like you need to cheat, anyway- everyone is trash, and if you use even a semi decent weapon, you can easily top the scoreboard. Seriously, no one is good at this game. If they're complaining about a hacker, it's probably just someone that's more than a silver 2 on cs.\n\nInstead of an anti-cheat, there's a kick system which bans the person from the server for a few hours if it succeeds. That's terrible. I had several attempts to kick me today (which didn't succeed) for simply doing well or getting a good kill spree. Still, another hallmark of a terrible shooter.\n\nThe guns feel awful, everything is flaccid, bugs are rampant, TDM is boring, etc etc. There's a lot wrong with this game. it surprises me anyone even thinks there's something good about it.

Hurt my eyes. Plus if you're prone to epileptic seizures be aware. Happened after I changed my graphics settings. It could have been my graphics card overheating, but I highly doubt it. See my screenshots if you're curious. For that reason I would recommend restarting your game after changing graphics, as it appears to fix the problem.\n\nIf you've ever played F2P shooters like Project: Blackout and the like, this is basically a simple version of that. Buy guns with accrued cash as the game progresses. Don't lose your guns when you die, like you do in CS. 1 game mode, 4 maps.\n\nI like this game because it offers the quick bang for your buck I want in shooters, and runs very well on lower end computers.\n\nYou may be used to early access games being optimized poorly, but I am able to get a solid 60+ FPS almost constantly at low and 1440x900 rez. Even with the textures set to low, the game still looks good. No need to complain.\n\nYes, some of the game is in russian, but only non essential parts. I'm sure this will be fixed with time. Currently there are no paid features enabled, which I like.\n\nIf you enjoy shooting virtual enemies just cause, I would recommend this game.

But you only need to play one or two matches to see what this game is really about. So theres not much to this game, so that means there are lower chances of the game being bad, right? WRONG. Even for a free game, the developers still manage to screw up most of the game aspects. The graphics arn't any thing special, even on max. I can say i've seen worse, but not much worse. All thats left is the gameplay. The gameplay is really the most important part of a FPS. So I thought the user reviews are may be wrong for once and maybe the devs could redeem themselvs with some good game play, but...no. They couldn't. The most important and valuable part of a shooter they get wrong. There is nothing stopping players from spwan trapping and killing players. Speaking of killing, the weapons in the game are some of the most unbalanced guns in a game i've ever seen. The gun you start with is a Glock 17. That gun should be able to put holes in people the size of people. The next cheapest gun is the Ump45. Again we see a great gun portrayed like a nurf gun. In game I've, Not joking here, put almost ENTIRE clips into players just be killed by a "underpowered" piece of crap. Over all the game really isn't that bad. If they fix these few problems the game will be playable, but untill then, its just another game giving free to play games a bad name.","January 1","false","5.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I understand that it is best to build an online multiplayer community by having the game free but I would say atleast make it a dollar. I would even pay $10 to $15 for this game. It still in early access when I make this review, and sure there are a few bugs and tweaks that should be made such as how people abuse the spawn protection, but overall it is a fun game that reminds of Counter Strike 1.6 except you can actually aim down the sights. If any creators are reading this the hitboxes and the spawn protection need to be tweaked and decrease the contrast, and maybe make it a $1 game if you don't want to have it too expensive because I would definitely buy it even if it was $10 or $15. The money would support the creators to make the game better and it would make the community less toxic and have it mostly of people who actaully want to have fun with other people.

Let us get started, gentlemen.\n\nHere is an example of a casual online shooter. Yes, I have just said casual. If what you seek is competitive gameplay I just can not recommend this game to you.\n\nSome thoughts on visual and technical sides:The biggest advantage of this game is that its system requirements are unbeliveably low.\nThe graphics are matching the requirements though, so do not expect miracles.\nStill, models of characters and weapons look polished.\nThe game on my Q8200 paired with 9800GT 1 GB is very smooth, but sometimes very annoying laggs appear on the map Pripyat (I do not know whether they are an optimisation flaw or server capacity issue.)\nGameplay experience:The only existing gamemode is team deathmatch called skirmish.\nGameplay is very dynamic thanks to small maps and 8 vs 8 player cap.\nOn the other side it often ultimately leads to spawnraping chaos, people running around with knives etc.\nLet me visualize how small the maps are - a sniper camping at the end of your path can be mostly reached with a grenade or quickly killed with any AR.\nThere are many different weapons divided into classes such as Pistols, ARs, SMGs, Heavy etc. (You will not find any informations about their damage or rate of fire though.)\nHowever, you mostly stick with just few of them as their poor iron sights (i.e. FAMAS), blinding muzzle flash covering half of the screen that simply makes continuous fire and aiming unreliable or overall poor performance (Pistol and SMG issue mostly.)\nThe damage system is somewhat strange, headshots instantly lead to death no matter which weapon you are using and how much armor you have. You often need a couple of chest shots to kill an opponent and enemy legs are made of titanium, so forget about getting someone from 100% to 0% by shooting at his legs. People that score headshots benefit, that is good, but at the same time this often leads to ridiculous situations where glock randomly beats an AK-47.\nThere is an item-shop, but only cheap visual effects can be bought there.\n\nThe biggest flaw of this game so far? Hackers, yes - and I am not talking about good people as you will meet many of decent players easily reaching K/D over 4.

That's right, weapons are earned by In-Match money, similar to Counter-Strike. The only thing purchable on the store are badges and masks for your character.\n\nGameplay is fast paced, aim mechanic is a mix between the Dynamic Croshair from CS and Aim-Down-Sights from CoD, wich makes this game pretty unique and fitting to all kind of FPS players. But, lacks of in-game tutorial, wich is simply a screen with all the button layout, wich for efortless players wanting to play the game right away is a bit overwhelming.\n\nIn conclusion, the game needs a bit more love by the developers and players, it's not a bad game, it's not horrible, it's not the best FPS but it's fun, playable and can run on Low-Class PC's.

Well, as an early access FPS and a name like Warmode I was expecting to play a Warface rip-off but was pleasently surprised when I jumped into a game when it wasn't. Yes it looks and feels like the disabled child of counter-strike and CoD 4 but as it is Warmode is pretty solid. I always like playing these new FPS's especialy early access as it's always nice to see a game develop and improve with age. Killing enemies in Warmode sure is fun as you can repeatedly shoot a guy in the groin for a good 3 seconds with an AK47 and he can finish you off with a swift kill to the head with his pistol but then again it feels good to kill a guy with your pistol whilst he shoots you in the groin for a good 3 seconds with an AK47. Playing Warmode took me back to my halo 3 SWAT days where headshots really do matter. No p2w aspects, if you want you can pay 99 cents for a little tiger mask if that's your thing.\n\nPros:\n- Weapons are solid and balanced\n- Instant respawn\n- Guns Look cool\n- Great time killer\n- System friendly\n\nCons:\n- A few bugs (Tells me I have a grenade when I don't, sometimes killstreaks carry on after death)\n- Maps are teeny weeny and very few\n- no collateral. once your bullet hits an enemy it's gone.

Guns actually have recoil which makes you have to take your time on your shots. When starting just get the deagle and then save for the Aug and you're set to go. Go for headshots. Once you master the guns you kill easily. Only problems I have is servers lag which makes the players skip around the map. Once that's fixed I can see this game going far. Its F2P so can't complain. Nothing about this is p2w because you gain money from kills. The more kills you get the more guns you get during the game.

The game although brand new is amazing, It's sorta a mixture of call of duty and counterstrike, but with a few less features, although this game is good there are some bad things to it that im hoping get fixed when the debugining begins.\n\nBUGS AND THINGS I DONT LIKE ABOUT THE GAME\n\n-Some guns are just way to powerful to be fair (Friggen heavy weapons and sguns).\n- Aim down sights are basically useless, all guns are rediculously accurate standing still and while crouching, all you have to   do is aim below the head because after you shoot 2 bullets when aiming down sight, all the other bullets are landing above the crosshair.\n-Knifing: although its very strong (people running arround knifing the crap out of people). It is sorta buggy, if you knife someone it doesnt allways register.\n- teamates allways soaking up the freaking bullets ( Stand infront of you while you are killing someone ). The bullets end up in the teamate litterally standing infront of you and not in the enemy, it gets annoying.\n-The BattleField4 Hit reg. Bullets dont register as a hit when you want them to.\n-Some maps are way unfiar, when it comes to base ♥♥♥♥. Spawning in the same area for the entire team every time is a problem, although the temp invincibility is good, its not enough.\n\n\n\nOk so that is the things that i find an issue in the game that should need fixing.\n\n\nTHINGS I THINK THE GAME NEEDS.\n\n-Bullet penetration please???? PLEASE!\n- Make it harder somehow?, I avarage about 50-60 kills a game (1/3 of the kills needed to win). while the rest of my team is usually slacking, and I dont baserape either.\n- Make ranks do something. Im level 7 right now and i havent gotten anything for it, the levels should do something.\n-Change the damage of some guns? Please?\n-Different gamemodes, TDM gets boring...\n-I'm pretty sure if you get arround 10 kills you earn the same exp as someone with 50 kills, More kills should give you more EXP.\nRanking system, so you can see how good other players are,\n-ingame KDR\n-More maps?\n-Objectives please?\n\nSo i would give this game a solid 9/10. Hope to see this game shine.\n-Please Devs read this :D","August 29, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I was expecting it to be kind of a joke of a game. Luckily, I was super surprised.\nThis game is fun as hell. I had a blast playing this. The game was lacking music though which made it too silent.\n\nThe controls for this game so far I would have to say are pretty damn good. Graphics could use polish, but it's early access so it's doable.\n\nIt's not pay to win, the paid content seems to be cosmetic only from what I could see. The game mode I played was called Skirmish and it was fun stuff.\n\nI recorded when I was first trying out the game so if you like first impression videos check this out.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DCT2-BiBpdk\n\nI would recommend this because I had lots of fun and it is free to play.

The game has some issues with lag(at least on US servers), but the gun play is fun and fast paced. Much like in Counter-Strike, you save up money to buy weapons at the spawn. There are a decent amount of them so far, and I hope to see more added in the future. This game also isn't pay to win at all. The only real money you can spend is on cosmetics. Bottom line, give this game a chance. It may have a long way to go before it's complete, but it's still quite enjoyable as a timekiller if nothing else. The game is pretty small(under 300mb at the time of this review), so space shouldn't be an issue for most.

You could say it's likes CS:GO and I would agree but it's on a whole other spectrum of absolute excitement and fun (CS:GO is too don't get me wrong). It's also great to team up with a friend or two, go on a server and do 80-11.

It's Targetwod2 Playz. This game is a must play for any FPS fan who doesn't want to spend a lot of money. I liked this game alot but there were a few issues. 1) Lag reduction is needed. If you check out my video of this game youll see why. I have played games with better graphics and more going on at the same time and have not experienced this bad lag that often. 2) Graphics need to be worked on a little. They are good, but could be improved. 3) Bug fixes are also needed. As seen in my video as well, people could shoot through parts of the landscape. I think that's about it for my recomendations.

Is this something you hope to feel in the near future? For me, Warmode was that and more. Before Warmode I was sad, depressed, and alone. After years of being laughed at in CSGO I was about to uninstall Steam. I left my friends my uninstall note, when I recieved a message of light and hope - "get warmode ♥♥♥." Since then, I have become immersed in the amazing teamplay, unique guns, and well polished maps. The economic system scales incredibly well in Skirmish matches, and the guns are so well balanced that it appears as if years were taken to get them just go. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I would pay 60 dollars for this because this is an AAA release at heart.\n\n","October 4, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

You get to play as the Red or Blue team and you objective is basically to kill the other team members more times to win the match.\nIn the end i would say it's a good game to spend 30 mins or even 1 hour playing but it gets boring easily as there are no enough maps so far (12 maps until now) and they all are too small but can't complain as it's still an early access so i would give it 8/10 and i hope that the devlopers will add in level editing so gamers can make their own maps like Nrmih.","January 4","true","5.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

The game is buggy sometimes, and i find myself dying because i jumped onto a pole. However, it is fun. I've found that most of the negative reviews are because there aren't any servers, maybe it's the location? I always have at least 5 servers I can join and start playing. The game is fun to play sometimes when you're tired of tryharding in csgo, or even cod. If you are any good at csgo, you will find yourself at the top of the leaderboard everytime, most of the players are pretty bad. Overall I would rate 7/10, fun to play sometimes, just to mess around, you wont find yourself playing this game over 100 hours, there isn't enough content to keep anyone satisfied for that long.","April 8","true","8.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It is just abit laggy and frame rate issues on some of the maps. The problem is as it is the game will not draw back players and this game that the developer(s) have made does however have potential to be a great multiplayer shooter but needs what I have put below would get 10/10 easy if these were changed.\n\nHere are just a few things 6 things for the developers should consider to improve the game and also get loads of players playing their game.\n\n1) Fix the frame rate issue runs just about smoothly but certain maps and games is abit hectic. The players hub looks dated just make it more interesting.\n\n2) Targeting arrow and the shooting in the game needs tweaking abit so it is smoother sort of like call of duty games. Running around and shooting feels abit random and you shooting is abit  hit or miss when it comes to targeting the enemy and the yellow flash coming out of weapon thing is bad get rid of it and this would make this element of the game much better.\n\n3) Better balance of weapons and when level up level should be able to buy improved parts for each weapon e.g sniper scope, laser scope, silencer, shock grenades, ammo carry limit parts, some modern weapons, or classic ones. Also armor and helmet upgrades and be able to change the colours of them.\n\nAlso attributes should be concidered and be capped to a ceratin level so is fair to other players e.g. speed, accuracy, agility, damage taken, amount of ammo you can carry, number of weapons you can carry would feel like the players are progressing.\n\n4) Maps are interesting but could be more varied e.g water ones so you can go under water, swim mechnic, bushes, sand, street, urban areas.\n\nn regarding places to hide and use for cover and for strategy is okay but their is no game play mechanics which you can use to your advantage and your group and of cource the enemy can use it also e.g cover mechanics behind walls, a low wall surface, box and also should be able to kneel behind it and use the zoom in target left mouse and aim and duck this would improve the overall stategy element without being to complicated. Also duck and crawl on floor for sneaky approachs and use the knife or to throw a grenade for a stealth ko would be a good idea.\n\n5) Clear enemy detail on map marks where the enemy is e.g red for enemy, blue for friendly can be abit confusing since suits are all the same colour make it so one team is blue and the other red.\n\n6) Should be able to smash windows, some enviroment damage, better detail in maps e.g cars, ruins, hotels, mansions, airport, dock some themed places.","August 26, 2015","true","11.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game is buggy sometimes, and i find myself dying because i jumped onto a pole. However, it is fun. I've found that most of the negative reviews are because there aren't any servers, maybe it's the location? I always have at least 5 servers I can join and start playing. The game is fun to play sometimes when you're tired of tryharding in csgo, or even cod. If you are any good at csgo, you will find yourself at the top of the leaderboard everytime, most of the players are pretty bad. Overall I would rate 7/10, fun to play sometimes, just to mess around, you wont find yourself playing this game over 100 hours, there isn't enough content to keep anyone satisfied for that long.","April 8","true","8.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I experimented with it and when I was aiming at an enemy with my iron sights right on the person just to see all my bullets flying up in to the sky shooting the roof of the building. So you might as well just shoot from the hip.\n\nIf you get shot in the head with any gun pretty much,you'll fall over dead every time,so if you run across a hacker.aimbotter there is gonna be no way to exactly even be able to get enough time to even kill them,besides the fact this game has a spawn kill element in it,\n\nThough on the bright side,at least it isn't P2W and you get a large variety of guns,but you just need to be able to get plenty enough kills to earn the money in order to have the guns you want,as my personal favourite is the ASVAL.\n\nSo despite the lag and spawn kill element,the game can be quite fun and possibly have potential in the near future..so I guess I can recomend it,I atleast had a lil bit of fun on the game.\n\n","August 26, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

My hands down favorite feature of this incredibly immersive gaming experience known as warmode, was how easy it was to uninstall, i mean, it was the click of 2 buttons, and it saved me from countless keyboards that i would go through, because of how laggy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game was. I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to laugh and maybe commit suicide. It's only fun because of how bad it is, until you let it sink in that you've spent you're life raging at this incredible piece of art work. Play this game.

The only few downsides to this game are the lack of european and/or british servers and  the lack of controller support.  I really like the concept that each match you need to purchase weapons with currency you gain from killing enemies, the only downside is the fact that everyone starts the match with 2000 and that defeats the point as you have enough to purchase a weapon. There also needs to be a party aspec in this game so you can join a party with your friends and start a match.

I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:\n\n10/10\nBUY THIS GAME.","September 22, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It does not have decent graphics and weapon recoils are pretty much non-existence, but jumping into the game and messing up with enemies did bring me a lot of joy. This is a F2P game so do not expect it has AAA title's quality. Ingame store is pretty much useless since you can have access to all weapons in game and all you need to do is to accumulate money by killing enemies. There are only masks and badges in store and they won't affect statistics whatsoever. Check this out if you want to kill some time or find some free games to dig in.\n简体中文：毛子做的游戏，挺有意思的。虽然画面不咋地而且武器后座力基本不存在，但是进游戏去虐虐歪果仁还是挺好玩的。毕竟是免费游戏所以不要期待它会有3A大作的质量。游戏内商城基本就和没有一样，所有武器在初始时都已经给了，你要做的就是在游戏里杀人赚钱买好枪。商城里只有名片徽章和面具，然而这些并不会影响人物和武器属性。如果想打发时间或者找点免费游戏玩的话，这款游戏还是挺好的。","October 17, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I experimented with it and when I was aiming at an enemy with my iron sights right on the person just to see all my bullets flying up in to the sky shooting the roof of the building. So you might as well just shoot from the hip.\n\nIf you get shot in the head with any gun pretty much,you'll fall over dead every time,so if you run across a hacker.aimbotter there is gonna be no way to exactly even be able to get enough time to even kill them,besides the fact this game has a spawn kill element in it,\n\nThough on the bright side,at least it isn't P2W and you get a large variety of guns,but you just need to be able to get plenty enough kills to earn the money in order to have the guns you want,as my personal favourite is the ASVAL.\n\nSo despite the lag and spawn kill element,the game can be quite fun and possibly have potential in the near future..so I guess I can recomend it,I atleast had a lil bit of fun on the game.\n\n","August 26, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:\n\n10/10\nBUY THIS GAME.","September 22, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It does not have decent graphics and weapon recoils are pretty much non-existence, but jumping into the game and messing up with enemies did bring me a lot of joy. This is a F2P game so do not expect it has AAA title's quality. Ingame store is pretty much useless since you can have access to all weapons in game and all you need to do is to accumulate money by killing enemies. There are only masks and badges in store and they won't affect statistics whatsoever. Check this out if you want to kill some time or find some free games to dig in.\n简体中文：毛子做的游戏，挺有意思的。虽然画面不咋地而且武器后座力基本不存在，但是进游戏去虐虐歪果仁还是挺好玩的。毕竟是免费游戏所以不要期待它会有3A大作的质量。游戏内商城基本就和没有一样，所有武器在初始时都已经给了，你要做的就是在游戏里杀人赚钱买好枪。商城里只有名片徽章和面具，然而这些并不会影响人物和武器属性。如果想打发时间或者找点免费游戏玩的话，这款游戏还是挺好的。","October 17, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The only few downsides to this game are the lack of european and/or british servers and  the lack of controller support.  I really like the concept that each match you need to purchase weapons with currency you gain from killing enemies, the only downside is the fact that everyone starts the match with 2000 and that defeats the point as you have enough to purchase a weapon. There also needs to be a party aspec in this game so you can join a party with your friends and start a match.

I like the maps its just the fact that enemy teams can camp in your base and just kill each person that spawns in I think a way that they counter this is by adding a feature so when you spawn in you are invincible for a certain amount of time so that the enemy would just waste bullets instead of gaing many kills.","September 19, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:\n\n10/10\nBUY THIS GAME.","September 22, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It does not have decent graphics and weapon recoils are pretty much non-existence, but jumping into the game and messing up with enemies did bring me a lot of joy. This is a F2P game so do not expect it has AAA title's quality. Ingame store is pretty much useless since you can have access to all weapons in game and all you need to do is to accumulate money by killing enemies. There are only masks and badges in store and they won't affect statistics whatsoever. Check this out if you want to kill some time or find some free games to dig in.\n简体中文：毛子做的游戏，挺有意思的。虽然画面不咋地而且武器后座力基本不存在，但是进游戏去虐虐歪果仁还是挺好玩的。毕竟是免费游戏所以不要期待它会有3A大作的质量。游戏内商城基本就和没有一样，所有武器在初始时都已经给了，你要做的就是在游戏里杀人赚钱买好枪。商城里只有名片徽章和面具，然而这些并不会影响人物和武器属性。如果想打发时间或者找点免费游戏玩的话，这款游戏还是挺好的。","October 17, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The only few downsides to this game are the lack of european and/or british servers and  the lack of controller support.  I really like the concept that each match you need to purchase weapons with currency you gain from killing enemies, the only downside is the fact that everyone starts the match with 2000 and that defeats the point as you have enough to purchase a weapon. There also needs to be a party aspec in this game so you can join a party with your friends and start a match.

It's hilariously bad.\n• 4/5 of the servers are Russian, the rest are US.\n• Hit detection is 3/10.\n• 90% of the time, melee attacks won't work. The hit detection on them is almost nonexistent. You can swing at the same person 20 times and never get a hit.\n• Shooting anywhere other than the head is pointless. It takes way more shots and headshots are 1-3 shot kills depending on weapon and range. When not aiming for the head, it's actually possible to use an entire magazine and not get a kill.\n• It always comes down to a spawn trap. Spawns in this game never change, so the good team just camps the opposing team's spawn until the game ends.\n• You can easily stack teams, because you're allowed to switch mid-game.\n• Grenade throwing and physics are bad, but manageable.\n• Mid-game weapon buying works similarly to Counter Strike. Enter your spawn and press B to buy a new weapon, grenade or body armor. You can be shot at and die while doing this.\n• Graphics, animations and just everything in general looks straight out of 2005. Minimal effort.\n• VAC Secured, but that's not going to stop the inevitable flood of hackers from a bad free-to-play game. All it would take is a headshot aimbot and the game's dead.\n• Some of the weapon sights are really bad. Famas, for example, fills half the screen while you look through a keyhole. Snipers don't even zoom in and their default zoom isn't much further than any other gun.","August 31, 2015","false","1.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

It plays alot like Counter-Strike, you only get weapons by killing other players and getting points. But the problem lies in the fact that the servers are so laggy you cant ever get a kill. not to mention aiming seems to be slightly off when you use your aim down sights. there is only 1 U.S server and for the most part my connection to each server remained crap. Now dont get me wrong, i did enjoy some of the matches. but its hard to denie this game has alot of flaws that quite honestly are un-exseptable. The maps feel bland. you can see obvious choke points and sections where most players are going to be. but these highly populated areas are the only place there tends to be any action. Spawn camping is another big problem. if the enemy team has more players you can bet your gonna get spawn camped.\n\n-=Sound=-\nThe game tends to be glitchy at times. the guns also dont sound all that amazing. the music you here when you start up the game is nice. but after that is all guns. and thats fine...if the guns were nice to hear.\n\n-=Community=-\nWith this being a pure online based game i have to adress community. the community is....there. but its not booming. i havent seen too much "hacker" name calling while in a game as of late. but when thegame was first released, it was somthing you saw alot.\n\n-=Free or Pay2Win=-\nThis game does feature a store so the dev can get alittle cash dollar. but theres no guns,ammo,or anything that would make it pay 2 win. what is there is slight cosmetic gear. such as face pain and masks.\n\n-=Graphics=-\nThe graphics are not anything new, exciteing, or all that special. but they are not the worst. i can deal with the graphics if the gameplay is good.\n\n-=Final verdict=-\nThis game is fun, and with more work could be great. but at its current state i just cant reccomend it. the only way i would recomend this game is if there was some way to host your own servers/games and let others join. that would atleast help with the god aweful conection quality of the current servers.\n\nThe Final verdict is a 3.75/5.0 (okay)","September 22, 2015","false","3.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Despite everyone's review after playing about 12 minutes of the game..thats all you pretty much need to make an opinion of this game. Graphics are good for 250MBs and gameplay really feels like Call of Duty. One thing that surprised me was how accurate the hit detection is, however the illogical lag makes you struggle to get a kill. Also, about the hit detection, it seems that they made the head hitbox about 70% of the player model, any kill you get almost always gets you a headshot. Weapons feel and look good however some weapons definitly need to be nerfed or require a bigger point requirement. Spawns are also a problem, you can pretty much tell where they will spawn and there is no spawn protection at all so you can probably get about 150 kills in just about 20 minutes. In the end, this is a shooter that has a lot of potential and definitly requires attention.\n\n6/10\n\nPros:\n-Accurate hit detection\n-Looks decent for 250MBs\n\nCons:\n-Spawns need work\n-No spawn protection\n-Over powered weapons\n-Server lag","September 19, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I have to say that this game is a rip-off of CS:GO but lacks the depth like planting bombs and such. I only played this game because a Steam friend of mine parted with his sanity and played this game so much that he changed his Steam name to 'WARMODE KING'. I wrote this review to save you from such dark actions.\n\nBecause this is a PC game Graphics are everything, but this game does not deliver in this respect. It resembles a potato on methamphetamine quite well. The objects and environment are of low quality and the textures are sub-par. The animations aren't horrible but they take to long to complete, for example i might go to shoot an enemy but they are already dead and i cant see this because the death animation takes to long to finish.\nThe maps are terrible and arent very detailed, with few static environmental objects. They also lack complecity and are far off something such as CS:GO.\nTo be honest i cant be bothered writing a review for this game its not worth the pain and regretful gameplay. Just save your life from a slow death from this game and just buy CS:GO.\n\n","November 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It Is truly free to play, only things in the shop are Payday style masks. Graphics are kinda dated, but if less lighting effents get me 120 fps, i think is a good trade.\nGuns are the usual deal, Ak-47 , SMGs, M4a4, snipers etc. There are some balance issues, shotguns deal almost no dmg, and most smg insta-kill on headshot. Weirdly, most guns have almost no recoil when using "iron sights", but a lot when using "hip fire"\nThe game has an in-match shop like Counter-strike, but you keep your weapons and armor between lives (you buy armor once, you spawn with armor everytime).\nThe only game-mode i saw was Team-Deathmatch, but the devs say they will add more.\nMaybe not the best free shooter out there, but with a colorful artstyle, a fast paced gameplay and a really fair f2p model, i have no problems recomending... what was it caled again?

First oof, this game has the biggest copy of any game I've ever seen in my life. On the map "factory", anyone who has played on Dust 2 in CSGO for more than 30 seconds will be astounded as to how much that map was put into this one. Everything other than B Tunnels, B Site, and Mid are in this map, with covers in nearly the exact same locations. This is ridiculous and I found it quite funny but if I want to play Dust 2, I'll play it on a game that actually has a decent net code. The hit detection is also crazy however that can be expected due to the fact that this game is in early access. Either way, this is a free game and it is only 250mb so why not download it, hop on with some friends, and test it out, because I found myself having plenty of fun still.","September 22, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

That means things will change, they will implement things better, add new things, make it fun, ya know? I put only 3.6 hours into it and i already find it quite fun. Let me break down the game a bit and what I think are the pros and cons of this game so far:\n\nPROS:\nGreat graphics for an early acess! They are amazing for a free to play shooter!\nGameplay is fast-paced, very fun.\nThe gun selection is quite nice, although some, like the AK47 and the AUG need a bit of balancing.\nCONS:\nThe teams can get out of balance incredibly quick. it could be a 3v1 and I have seen games as far away as 5v2. Although I have seen some good players, they aren't that good.\nThe semiauto shotgun is a bit op, as it does a lot of damage from a farther range you are used to.\nThere is only one game mode at the moment. Even though it is still an amazing game for early access, one game mode puts me off a bit.\nMost of the weapons you can get a tapshoot kill with, which is dissapointing, because i would rather have only a few weapons that that can one hit kill, which would mean balancing out all of the assault rifles, and balancing up the smgs.\n\nAll in all, a great game for early acess. Recommend it for experienced gamers. Great job WARTEAM!","August 30, 2015","true","22.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The servers suck, the UI is trash and the community is whining about hackers all the time (most of it is just lag from my experience). The guns are ridiculously op, the spawns are broken, there are angles that provide immense advantage (others players can't shoot you), there is no need for iron sights. However, I had loads of fun playing this game. Headshotting from 2km away with a pistol is satisfying. The game is really small in size and for the time being it is truly f2p. I like the point system to buy guns but I think you should be able to gain points over time. Also more options should be implemented (FOV slider for example). The game needs a lot of work but it has the potential to have something going for it as far as I am concerned. Overall, I thought the game was fun and I could oversee the flaws. I recommend it if you want to pass some free time. In the future I might revisit it and maybe change my recommendation but for the time being this game is fairly fun.","August 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Only they selling is just "A" skin.\nSkin that I mention is "Skin" of a gun, "Emblems", and of course "Masks."\n\nThats it? Thats what you can do on the Microtransaction? Super useless piece of item and dare to sell at $0.99 each?\nSo its complete useless Microtransaction, so how about the game?\n\nIts a 2 Gamemode only, Skrimish, and Elimination.\nSkirmish is similar to Team-Deathmatch, only this here, is a bad Skirmish game, Elimination is idk vs idk Counter-Strike rip-off. Balancing Team is complete stupid and frequent unbalanced team.\n\nGuns are just a Ho-hum guns, everything looks pale and boring to shoot, it feels weird when shooting something, and its not like other shooting games, where you found it "fun" to shoot at, here is zero fun. I didn`t enjoy at all, P90 why u too nub to shoot, Shotgun, why u too op, M249, why u 1 shot kill player and why super expensive to buy? Why, all weapon damage feels imbalanced and i didn't find any favorable gun that i like to use. Except shotgun, which is super effective.\n\nServer is only in 3 "Channels", where player need to join the channels room to play, but I found out this is very familiar.\nIs this a developer from 3D Blockade?\nServer was laggy, have super buggy state of art, super buggy of poor net code. For me, at least on Asia. I probably realized this was hosted on Russia. Right. I also died by myself, is that poor net code for me?\n\nHackers, yeah. It has, but is it hackable without ban? Yeah. No one give a damn about banning a person. You can`t even kick player, is it majority of the player who vote will win? No, no one will win if someone "vote" no on purpose of gaining winning. Ban VAC? Who gives a ♥♥♥♥, no one get ban.\n\nGraphics are just meh, but sound design is awful, its like they fked up the whole sound library. There`s no voice actor or any voice from this game, there`s no Hit detection where you getting hitted by enemy. Its like incomplete release.\n\nAnd lastly, did I mention the game have "Leveling" system... talk about the "useless" leveling system ever created? You gain EXP by winning a game. So what it does for EXP? Nothing. Yeah nothing. Zero functionality in EXP. Except unlocking skin which requires you 0.99$ to buy????\n\nSeriously this game, even though ppl recommended this game, I despite everything this game yet to offer. Even though its Free, you may thinking, Free is the reason why you set "Yes" as a good game, unfortunately, like me itself, I feel like I need to play other game instead. I say a lot of free games like Blackshot is even better than this, even a game like Crazy Shooter Online is 20 times better, this game isn`t. Its just a garbage game.\n\nThere`s nothing to offer, there`s nothing that can redeem enjoyable, there`s zero factors of entertaining yourself, there`s zero communities, there`s zero calories and fats that can be burn on this game, mean factor of losing fats is no longer exist in this game and you can't even excersice on this game. I just can`t, I just wanted more biceps for playing a Shooter games. In the end, games sucks. Go play other free game instead.\n\n(2/10)","February 18","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has unique features and has good graphics for a free game. In fact, I would say that this is a pretty awesome FPS game and I usually hate FPS games. But notice how I said WOULD... Thats because although the game is there, the most important things for an FPS game to have aren't! What I mean by that is half of the time your bullets damage an enemy and half of the time they don't. Also the assist system is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that I cant even comprehend it. But my favorite flaw, other than all of the maps being as big as my bathroom, is the random suicide deaths. I'll just be standing there and out of nowhere I die and it says I was killed by me. Now I cant for the life of me figure out what is causing this, it's just completely random.\nI really hope that this game is in its beta because it is so close to being a great game. All the game makers need to do is add a North American Channel for servers and fix the major bugs involoved with causing damage, the assist system, add larger maps, and fix the kill system. I would recommend that you try the game for 30 minutes tops and then delete it. I feel that you will agree with me that this game has potential, it just needs some major fixes.","November 19, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That means things will change, they will implement things better, add new things, make it fun, ya know? I put only 3.6 hours into it and i already find it quite fun. Let me break down the game a bit and what I think are the pros and cons of this game so far:\n\nPROS:\nGreat graphics for an early acess! They are amazing for a free to play shooter!\nGameplay is fast-paced, very fun.\nThe gun selection is quite nice, although some, like the AK47 and the AUG need a bit of balancing.\nCONS:\nThe teams can get out of balance incredibly quick. it could be a 3v1 and I have seen games as far away as 5v2. Although I have seen some good players, they aren't that good.\nThe semiauto shotgun is a bit op, as it does a lot of damage from a farther range you are used to.\nThere is only one game mode at the moment. Even though it is still an amazing game for early access, one game mode puts me off a bit.\nMost of the weapons you can get a tapshoot kill with, which is dissapointing, because i would rather have only a few weapons that that can one hit kill, which would mean balancing out all of the assault rifles, and balancing up the smgs.\n\nAll in all, a great game for early acess. Recommend it for experienced gamers. Great job WARTEAM!","August 30, 2015","true","22.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is very broken in alot of aspects but its early access which HOPEFULLY means its being worked on, right?. I get so used to hearing "early access" that it pisses me off. Early access IS for games that are being actively developed and for some players to get a tase of the action before the full game releases and at the same time the players help the devs by finding glitches, bugs, exploits etc. for the devs to correct. Early access IS NOT an excuse for a broken game..... It IS NOT for a bunch of idiots who dont know what they are doing to release a broken piece of ♥♥♥♥ for people to download and play for 20 mins before getting bored or pisssed which ever comes first... Spawn killing, knifing(broken), unbalanced weapons, modders, framedrops etc. pick your poision, these are a handfull of the many issues this game has. I doubt this game will be fixed.... like EVER. but I wouldn't mind eating my words on that one. until anything big changes my review will stay unchanged.","January 25","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That means things will change, they will implement things better, add new things, make it fun, ya know? I put only 3.6 hours into it and i already find it quite fun. Let me break down the game a bit and what I think are the pros and cons of this game so far:\n\nPROS:\nGreat graphics for an early acess! They are amazing for a free to play shooter!\nGameplay is fast-paced, very fun.\nThe gun selection is quite nice, although some, like the AK47 and the AUG need a bit of balancing.\nCONS:\nThe teams can get out of balance incredibly quick. it could be a 3v1 and I have seen games as far away as 5v2. Although I have seen some good players, they aren't that good.\nThe semiauto shotgun is a bit op, as it does a lot of damage from a farther range you are used to.\nThere is only one game mode at the moment. Even though it is still an amazing game for early access, one game mode puts me off a bit.\nMost of the weapons you can get a tapshoot kill with, which is dissapointing, because i would rather have only a few weapons that that can one hit kill, which would mean balancing out all of the assault rifles, and balancing up the smgs.\n\nAll in all, a great game for early acess. Recommend it for experienced gamers. Great job WARTEAM!","August 30, 2015","true","22.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
