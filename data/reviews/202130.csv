"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terrean/recommended/202130/","Terrean","Terrean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terrean/","625 products in account","Humorous Dungeon Keeper like game.\n\nPros\n- Good beginning story - lord of the pit to sidekick of a loser\n- I love stories from the perspective of the bad guys\n- The demon, your champion, really does grow to be a bad ♥♥♥.  You get served very easily towards the beginning, but at the end you've reclaimed your lord of the pit status\n- Session skill tree.  Points are earned through almost every action (i.e. killing heroes, crafting items, raiding, etc.)  You unlock new branches of the skill tree mostly through exploration/side quests that can be interesting\n- Squad combinations can lead to good bonuses (plus to crit, defense, etc.) encouraging the player to mix and match\n\nCons\n- Storyline grows weaker throughout the game\n- Clunky controls (i.e. assign worker to repair room, but game doesn't auto assign him to then work it).  Launch Game vs. Load Game between stages - if you hit load instead of launch it takes you to your last saved slot instead of the next level - why is this even on the page?\n- Camera - cut scenes frequently have you looking in a different direction super zoomed in\n- Ladders - the attempt to keep you on your toes while you accomplish main and side quests.  Decent concept, but they happen at regular intervals and with your ability to teleport yourself or squads directly most any where, this becomes zoom out, find ladders, teleport squads, and go back to what you were doing\n- Traps play almost no role\n- Almost necessary to play with Priests and Overlords\n- Runes disappearing?  Played the entire game through and still had some empty rune slots.  Some would show unlocked at the end of a successful mission, but not appear on the next mission.  Not sure if they were meant to be passive, but could not find a way to view them\n- Demon upgrades - no way to preview before selecting so be warned!\n- Session skill tree.  Mentioned above as a plus.  Unfortunately, if you want to build a ton of traps, summon a horde, equip your squads to the teeth, etc. you'll only get so many points for each route.  What this means is that you're going to build x number of rooms, build x number of traps, equip x number of minions, craft x number of items, dig x number of tiles, etc.  I really felt like this was the major failing of the game.  I picked the exact same skill tree items for about 3/4 of the game.  This pigeon holes you into the same rooms, same units, and same path to victory again and again.\n- Difficulty.  I play most games on normal expecting to have some challenges, but not pull my hair out.  If your demon dies, he respawns about five seconds later and you can teleport him right back in.  The only way you die is if they destroy a treasure room?  It is strange.  My demon died quite a bit in the beginning, but I was never in danger of losing a stage.  This makes the game a total grind.  I'd recommend bumping it up if you expect any challenge.\n- For a humorous game, the jokes were really hit and miss and mostly miss.\n- Voice for the demon is good when you're still a little imp, but really needed to change after you reclaim your stature.\n- Ending was just strange\n\nOverall, if you like the genre then you might give it a whirl, but I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it.","December 28, 2014","false","32.1"," 97 of 104 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","97","104","5","3"

Work at a boring, mundane desk job. All the rooms have a preset lay-out and size taking away some of the dungeon building creativity.\n\nThen you go adventure, but your minions are hungry so you have to send them back to the dungeon to feed them, by the time they arrive back at the battle they are half-way to hungry again.\n\nThen the ladders apprear.  The annoying ladders they say are needed for "balance". Maybe to balance out the boring micromanagement between ladders and hungry minions, but adds little to nothing to gameplay.\n\nThe game has received almost no updates or attempt at fixing the game-play at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/202130/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Impire is a real time strategy game developed by Cyanide Studios. The game was released in early 2013 on PC.\n\nGameplay in Impire is heavily inspired by Dungeon Keeper. You are in control of a demon, and you have to build your own dungeon, with a large amount of rooms to build and modify however you want; along with building tunnels connecting all of the rooms together, you can create some really interesting dungeons.  The action in Impire is based around having squads of other demons, these squads consist of four demons, and they operate as a team, think of them as like a 4 man group out of an MMO, you want to have a tank, a healer and some damage dealers.  You are able to unlock new demons using the talent tree, which interestingly resets at the start of each level, allowing you to only spec into what you really are going to need for the objectives. Impire also has another game play element, called Raids. This function allows you to send your squads of minions on mini raids to other dungeons in order to gather treasure, materials, or complete side quests – this is nice addition but can sometimes be forgotten about if you aren’t careful.  The raids require no human interaction other than you telling the squad to go and start it.\n\nThe graphics in Impire will again, remind you completely of Dungeon Keeper, they just have a more higher resolution look to them. The UI in Impire can look daunting upon a first glance, but the game has a very good tutorial mission which explains everything very clearly and you’ll be navigating through the menus with ease after completing it. It would have been nice if all of the buttons came with a tooltip though, so you can just remind yourself as to what some of the lesser used buttons do at times without having to just click it to find out.\n\nThis game is fully voice acted to a pretty high standard,  the game is narrated very well, units are all voice acted. The game has quite an abundance of cut scenes with multiple characters, which can sometimes become an annoyance when you are in the middle of a fight, but some of the dialogue is quite funny so you can sort of take it with a pinch of salt there.\n\nImpire gives the impression that it is a hard game, but in reality, you really have to be bad at the game to fail. The only way you lose a mission is if one of your treasure rooms is destroyed; I never saw it get destroyed once in my entire time playing this game.  Playing the game on the hardest difficulty may make it more of a challenge, rather than a grind; but I would of thought the medium setting would have given some sort of challenge.\n\nSo far I have put about sixty three hours into Impire – the story mode is split into five chapters, each has about five or six missions to them; you can sometimes spend an hour on each level,  this game has a serious amount of content to offer. Not to mention the multiplayer mode (something which I didn’t experience so will not comment on).\n\nI did have one technical problem whilst playing the game – it can be played on all resolutions up to 4k which is nice to see; however even on the lower resolutions, you will notice quite a bit of stuttering on the cut scenes when the camera angel changes, it just looks janky but if you can ignore that you’ll be fine.  The game has a wide variety of graphical options so you can customize the graphics to match your rig very easily.\n\nIn summary; this is a brilliant Dungeon Builder game with a huge amount of content on offer. Fans of Dungeon Keeper should definitely be checking this game out.  The price of £14,99 may be considered high for some, but given how many hours I have put into this game, I am going to highly  recommend it.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Regardless of its lukewarm to cold reception, I found the game to be fun to play as a squad based RTS with some light base building. Essentially, this game was what Dungeons was shooting for and missed. So if you felt like Dungeons was terrible, but found the ideas intriguing I'd definitely recommend you load up Impire and give it a spin. It's not a flawless game by any means, but still manages to be a humorous, challenging, and moderately fresh way to kill a Sunday afternoon.","February 22, 2014","true","3.2"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","36","53","0","0"

It could have been oh-so-much more.\n\nThe Good\n* Its like a MOBA-Squad based Dungeon Keeper\n* Its Ardania (I'm a big fan of the Majesty franchise)\n* Characters are pretty awesome\n* Dialog is great... although the demon's voice is slightly annoying\n* Pretty nice graphics overall\n\nThe Bad\n* Dungeon Keeper clone is not Dungeon Keeper\n* Pre-Fab rooms cut down on customization. Training room, for example is a fixed size. Can't be expanded or made into a different shape\n* MOBA-style RTS is a poor replacement for the Simulated Life (individual monster AI) of Dungeon Keeper\n* Squad-based RTS is tactically uninteresting. Its mostly "Oh A go attack B"\n* Pretty-much the same strategy can be used over and over again endlessly with no variation. This becomes grind-tastic quickly because this game has a billion levels.\n* Decent graphics, and humorous dialog seem lost on ingame movies with game assets close-up (no high-poly models) who's mouths don't even move. They took the time to do good writing, and make a great engine, but didn't consider high-poly models for close-up briefings and cinematics? WTF.\n* Controls feel sluggish and dull\n* Hero ladders are extremely annoying and grindy.\n* The need for constant teleportation should have informed the game-makers that something was wrong with their gameplay. Perhaps they should have made it so you didn't have to ninja over to hero ladders and perhaps make garrisoning better so you don't have to constantly shift frontline troops back for hero invasions.\n\nI give this a 6.5/10, which is barely a passing grade, but is still a passing grade. I had fun, even though there's really very shallow in terms of tactics or strategy. The same things work over and over again. Most units don't even need to be used. But the Dungeon Keeper nostalgia and cute dialog put it over the top for me.\n","February 16, 2015","true","63.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

No control over building at all, it is all cut and paste. This game is so far from anything remotely good it hurts. Yes we expected a Dungeon Keeper type game, get over it, that is what the customers wanted and it was not even close. Even attempting to look at it from a different point of view as a stand alone game not compared to Dungeon Keeper will leave you disappointed. This game is all about puting down a few predetermined rooms and leading your minions to a fight then to kitchen, a fight then the kitchen... it almost feels like this game doesn't even need me to be involved in order to play it.","May 15, 2014","false","1.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The campaigne has 4 chapters with 5 mission each and takes all together ~20hours. Sometimes the jokes during the missions are too bad but if you like the kind of humor used in Grotesque you should also like this one. At least there are two ends of the game, so playing again isn't a bad choice.  Your main character, the demon Baal-Abbadon, has three specs (Support/Melee/Caster) and all three are play- and enjoyable.\n\nThe grafic isn't up-to-date but there are many lovely details if you look at the little demons or the underground rooms.  The whole game can be played in coop and has also some mulitplayer parts. There you have to protect NPCs, raid some enemy camps or to fight of endless hordes of heroes.\n\nSome negative aspects are the low variation of missions and the missed chance to improve the experience outside of the dungeon. But I had many hours of fun in Coop with this game, so anyone interested in RTS should have a look at it.\n\nLast hint, it plays like a mix of Majesty II and classic RTS games.","December 11, 2013","true","64.2"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","1"

The imp is voiced by a comedian I really like but the gameplay is kinda meh. There is very little customization of the dungeons, more like a rts where you build one of each type of building, size and doesn't matter and placement barely does. The ai currently is very...odd, the minions will not eat or attack things automaticly witch means you have to micromanage them to a stupid degree. Combat itself could be more tactical, while the diffrent types of units matter some, what really matters is how you place them in a group, 2 archers a melee and a mage, 3 mages and a melee, or so on, but for the most part it feels like you just build your best units and horde what ever is attacking you or that you are attacking. I was hopeing that the game would improve after it came out, but so far the developers have added and fixed basicly nothing...","April 16, 2013","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It's a game in the vein of Dungeon Keeper, and the early-mid 90's dungeon management games that spawned afterward.

It is definitely worth it.

I would not recommend my friends buy this game just yet. Its release has some pretty annoying bugs, balance issues and micromanagement/interface problems. But I do see a lot of potential and I think the problems are very easy to address IF the devs see it the way  see it and are going to change it.\n\nThe game is not a Dungeon Keeper clone, though it will spark up some fond memories of that game. You are indeed the manager of an evil dungeon and you summon a healthy variety of units which can level up and be upgraded and you can place traps and so on. But the strategy layer is very shallow. You have one room to grow muchrooms, and you can send your units on these simple raids to acquire materials and treasure, which comprise the 3 commodities for building units, upgrading and building rooms.\n\nThe rooms are fixed size and shape which is a bit sade, you cant just build a giant storage room for example, but add more of the fixed size storage rooms instead. Digging tunnels is really just for connecting rooms, you dont mine anything.\n\nThe dialogue and story in the game is really fun though, which is what you can expect from the guys who made Magicka.\n\nI do find it fun to play and I myself do not regret buying it but I am pretty hard core on these kind of games, I can tolerate a lot to get this sort of gameplay :)\n\nKeep in mind the game only saves your progress on Steam Cloud, so make sure you have that enabled!","February 16, 2013","true","22.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

A lot has improved since then and now in 2015 its much more stable and quite playable.\n\nThere are still bugs apparent, but they are generally minor.\n\nSome of the more controversial game designs now come with a couple of different toggle settings ie ladders, fixed ladders and no ladders. Aggression can also be toggled in multiplayer and runes are now available to offset the other common gripe of keeping ones minions fed.\n\nThe largest problem with this game is still its UI and the way that so many simple things need user input in a needless but tedious manner, user micromanagement replaces the basic ai outside of combat (which the user has no control over).\n\nOther gripes include disruptive and non immersive cutscenes that trigger throughout the levels pulling one away from their current set of actions. A clunky corridor and room placement design which offers no second chances even in the design phase of placement. A drop in Co-op that only saves the Hosts progression and offers only a partial co-op experience with players unable to share resources or enter each others domains in times of need making it feel more like single player with mutual objectives. And a mutiplayer aspect that is relaint upon pvp modes (in a very quiet community) with no ai or bots. (Edit: Our experience of the only co-op MP mode Survival was flawed by all but one player being bugged and stuck in their own dungeons, unable to access the global area even after the peace countdown had expired.)\n\nThis game is another that would benefit from a maybe button as its quite solid in its current state it's just not that enjoyable... which is a personal preference.","November 6, 2015","false","43.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The gist of the game is helping Baal to gain his lost powers and to terrorise the surrounding land of Ardania in the ol' "Evil is good" sort of way.\n\nYou start each level with a handful of workers and Baal, building up your dungeon with pre-laid out rooms and creating/summoning units to form squads to go raid for materials/gold/food and to defend from hero invasions from the front and/or ladders (With the addition of choosing random/fixed/no ladders, thank god!).\n\nThe game can get tedious and rather monotonous as the general tone of each level is essentially build up dungeon, build up troops, raid, rinse and repeat until you're strong enough to go into the main part of the level. The main part of the level is usually the same (With an ending "Boss" of sorts) however getting there can change from level to level. The most part is the same, however on some levels there are some puzzles which can be somewhat challenging to start with.\n\nWith the patches that were released since the release of the game, it seems to be a lot more stable compared with release. Fortunately there doesn't seem to be as many crashes/problems/bugs which was ultimately frustrating for those that first had the game as there isn't a save game as such.\n\nOn the whole, I enjoyed the game. Sure, it gets a bit repetative but I enjoyed the cheesy humour.\n\nTL;DR - Not a successor to Dungeon Keeper but is loosely influenced by its atmosphere and humour. Game can get very monotonus and tedious but is fun at times. A lot better than what it once was on release due to bug fixes.","June 9, 2014","true","80.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It feels a lot like Dungeon Keeper in the way you play, but with less diversity in HOW you can build.  So...it's enjoyable, albeit less so.  The game does have the dark humor that DK did and it pulls it off well.  The set up for how you gather resources in the game is pretty neat, but it gets repetitive quickly.  Your enemies are equally neat, but repetitive.  It's worth a few bucks and the fact that it DOES have co-op functionality certainly makes it better, but as a single player game, it gets boring quickly.\n\nIt gets a 5/10 from me.

All in all, if they had made it so you could make rooms any size you wanted it might have been better. The static rooms while offering neat and unique animations were a terrible waste of resources.

While the story is nothing special and almost linear, it is commendable that this is done flawlessly. The voice acting is on the spot, at least for the main cast. Micro- management has never been this much fun, since well… ages (in my opinion). Impire keeps you busy and interested from start to finish. Complaints about repetitiveness of the game might be founded, but I think it is more of a matter of preference. It is true that there are a couple of imperfections that should (and could be easily) addressed. The lack of grunt noises and the inability to be able to re-check the mission goals, are flaws that can be frustrating at times. The biggest imperfection is perhaps the lack of information when it comes to upgrading units. A micro-management oriented game is not as pleasant to play when the necessary information is missing.\n\nBut in the end Impire is a captivating game, unique characters and funny dialogues are more than enough to recommend it to everybody. A herd of (almost) impervious, impertinent, imps are waiting to serve their overlord. So what are you waiting for? You’re supposed to be on a highway to hell!","December 28, 2014","true","35.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","1"

Impire looks like a decent-enough clone of Dungeon Keeper, but it is sufficiently unique in most respects to be its own game. This is both good, and bad.\n\nThe good side of things is how Impire handles dungeon management. By zooming out or pressing a hotkey, you’re given a flat top-down view of your dungeon. Here, you can queue up units, build rooms, order upgrades and place traps. Units, like minotaurs, vampires, imps, warlocks and such, can be put into squads of six. Squads in turn can be moved around as a single unit, and coordinate their attacks. A well-formed squad of a tank, some ranged casters, a healer, and a general damage-dealer, are highly effective at handling almost any situation. Ladders may randomly appear in your dungeon, bringing adventurers that’ll try to destroy things. You can build things like a Tavern that lure adventurers in and gets them drunk, making them weaker, but it’s not really necessary.\n\nYou are limited in exactly what types of units and rooms you can build initially, and here is where things get idiosyncratic. As you complete set objectives removed from the main mission objectives, you earn DEM points which can be placed into a Diablo-esq skill tree, which resets each mission. If you want minotaurs for this mission, you may have to sacrifice gaining some spells, or a type of room, etc. It gives the genre a kind of build-order strategy, which isn’t bad, but it can rub you the wrong way. Squads can be sent off on raiding missions using an overworld map, which removes the squad from your dungeon for a time. If they succeed at the raid, you gain much-needed resources, as a dungeon is not entirely self-sufficient. There is no ore to mine, like in Dungeon Keeper.\n\nThe game can be played cooperatively over network or Internet, up to four players, or competitively if that’s your thing. The cooperative mode works well enough, each player gets their own dungeon, and each dungeon has it’s own entrance into a kind of common battle area where mission objectives are usually located. The plot is amusing, in a 90s video game kind of way, and while it innovates where it counts, Impire fails in the areas it needs most.\n\nFor everything Impire does right, with its own spin on the dungeon management genre, it gets equal amounts wrong. This is the type of game that’s best bought while on sale, and only if you really want this kind of thing.\n\nBonus: Is this Majesty’s Ardania?\n\nYou are correct, sire! Impire takes place in the fictional fantasy realm of Ardania of the Majesty series. Much of the design, how things look and act, are direct nods to their counterparts in Majesty. The plot even involves you playing as a subservient demon in the employ of the son of a certain Scottish-sounding Advisor...","September 22, 2014","false","10.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Talent system for your main character. Humor. Great room design. Armor/weapon upgrades.\nThe bad things: There is absolutely no AI in the game. Your creatures stand around doing nothing. They don't go eating when they are hungry nor they go training. Fights are meaningless you don't feel involved. There is no challenge in the game and there is nothing to do.

The idea that you don't only need to use heroes bodies for loot, but also prisoners to earn you treasure or put into a big machine when crunches them into points is also interesting, but again wasted in this game. I got stuck on the level where you were under a time limit because upgrading your units is incredibly costly, especially as you don't make materials, you just steal them from another place which costs time and units. Not ot mention many of the jokes aren't funny. They're kid funny, but nothing really made me laugh out loud in hilarity. No...I'm afraid this game falls waaaaay too short of trying to be a dungeon keeper clone. I suggest a much better one like Evil Genius or A Game of Dwarves.

The graphical style and detailed overworld are quirky and creative but are ultimately overshadowed by the slow placed and repeitive gameplay. A major downfall is in its lack of flexible micromanagment and preset room layots. Players are also prevenetd from changing preset room layouts at the start of each new map which limits creativity and needlesy increases difficult as the treasure hold is always placed close to the entrance (where enemeies enter to plunder your dungeons treasure). Imire does provided a wide range of unique creatures and a interesting team combo feature, rewarding creative team combinations. The storyline also contains interesting aspects. Overall the agme is satisfactory if you want a casual play but is no Dungeon Keeper 3.","December 25, 2013","false","31.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtgibson/recommended/202130/","jtgibson","jtgibson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtgibson/","820 products in account","I think this game received an awful bum rap for what turned out to be a good effort at taking the Dungeon Keeper minion game style and turning it into something a little more unique, with some effort to make the game less about operating progressively harder dungeons and more about following a quest line -- it can conceivably be thought of as an underground version of Overlord, albeit with a crappier avatar and point-and-click strategy-RPG style combat instead of action-RPG combat.  That said, it's still not a top performer.\n\nWith an absolutely atrocious and unimmersive lobby system that tries to convince people to play co-op, it's really hard to get into and play.  Realtime strategy co-op is almost unheard of -- it's almost always TvT, free for all, or 1-on-1 adversarial.  By attempting to push the boundaries, they came up with a great idea but of limited utility to the typical fan base.\n\nThe graphics are very good, for an independent title from a now increasingly un-independent publisher, and the subtle touches are all fantastic.  The main problem is that the gameplay itself is somewhat kludgy.  It is quite obvious that the developers intended to make minions move around the dungeons on foot and then got bored of how long it took, so they added "ladders" which spawn heroes inside your dungeon, and the ability to teleport to avoid sitting around waiting for your minions to navigate.  Speaking of teleportation, their pathfinding is pretty poor for a game with astoundingly simple prefabs that should be a cakewalk for an A* algorithm with well-selected nodes.  A lack of waypoints and patrol routes and other RTS staples really makes the game into a micromanagement fest, which is so unfortunate because it would have taken so little time to improve upon the basic accessibility features to make the game more playable.  A little bit of effort in streamlining the back end would have made the content and gameplay itself massively entertaining.\n\nImpire can really be thought of as an experimental effort to break from the standard and to introduce a whole whack of new gameplay features.  The problem is not so much the ideas as the lack of conceptual integration: it's like a giant smorgasbord where people forgot to keep things consistent, so you have the Chinese dumplings right next to the tray of Louisiana dirty rice and adjacent to a tray full of nachos with chili con queso.  All three are bloody well delicious, but they just don't go together.\n\nThe game gets better as you go on, but it's such a slog through the early levels that it really makes you wonder whether it's worth it, and even then, better is a relative term.","March 11, 2014","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Feed monsters, defend base from heroes, go do main quest for 2 minutes; repeat. You are pretty restricted when it comes to building your base and without detroying random ladders every 5 minutes, traps are useless because heroes can drop in anywhere.

You just send a squad a of units to raid it.  There is no more interaction then that.\n\nAfter you make your basic dungeon which is virtually identical every single game, you enter "the maze" which is a zone next to your dungeon.

All you do is go with a group of units killing things and then collecing or clicking on quest glowies.  That is it, and that is every single scenerio.

The design makes it charming enough to see what it has to offer... only to find yourself doing the same stuff over and over. There is something to be said about games that let you play the bad guy and enjoy yourself doing it. However... there isnt enough to do to in Impire to make full use of the consept.\n\nThe Units and Dungeon rooms are delightfully creative. I personally enjoy the abominations. menacing and yet strangely cute... part of me would want one as a pet if it wasn't for the toxic spit. Game design is Impire's strong suit. Its fun to make a your evil lair and then see it all at work.\n\n\n\n-PROs-\nThe characters are quirky and delightfully Evil. Delivering "saturday morning cartoon bad guy" levels of villainy to the story. Its nice to be the villain every once in a while. Impire is a relaxing game to cool off and fool around with at the end of a long day. Just relax and slay a few Heros...\n\n-CONs-\nThe slow and unengaging gameplay. Raiding for supplies or loot is dull, repetitive, and offers nothing to the game experiance. Most fights can be broken down to "Send units into problem until WIN happens". Little to no strategy. Lack of content and uneventful multiplayer make this game have little replay value.\n\n\nIn the end, I would give this game a pass... but only by a little. There is nothing wrong with what the game offers, But that being the case, Impire doesn't offer very much. Unless you are looking for an easy RTS/Dungeon builder for your 10 year old, or a nice little game to toy around with, then better off looking elsewhere for a better "Play the villain" game.","January 28, 2015","false","17.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Luckily it was my second playthrough, so I already finished the game.  I didn't play dungeonkeeper a lot so I wasn't stuck to that concept. Don't be fooled by my hours ingame. Many of them were replays due to bugs.\n\nEven after the patch it seems to be quite buggy (or some may be features, I honestly can't say). But the problem of this game is best described by Baal himself "oh how tedious". The game seems bent on ruining any chance of having fun. Managing will mostly be clearing ladders, feeding your peeps, killing heroes that enter your dungeon - rince and repeat. In between you might be able to play the game ... a bit. There is some fun to be had in the cutscenes, though they get old really fast and you'll be waiting them out at the end. The graphics don't help, though I liked the rooms with the imps running around doing what imps do. Building an optimal dungeon would be nice, but there are usually fixed rooms in the way. The units are ok, but there just aren't enough. Halfway in the game you've seen them all. *spoiler* I highly recommend going with Velvet so you can play with some other units even though the differences are small. Units might respond to your commands but 50% of the time they decide what to do, damn smartypants Trolledons! In the chaos it's hard to click anything anyway so it might be for the best. Some corridors I couldn't enter until I carefully maneuvered my camera in just the right angle and by them "heroes have entered your dungeon".\n\nIt looks like the game got stuck in beta. Even after the patch there is no load button. Only one save game (which after the patch still gets corrupted). And the ladders omg the ladders, who thought that would be fun? Yes, I played most of the game with the 'no ladder' setting but still ... do you like commercials during your favorite movie? Of course you do!\n\nMaybe some day with a lot of player input it might be a nice game. Until then, be sure to spend your money and time on another game.

I ended up making it mid-way through the 2nd chapter and gave up. It's a micromanagement hell. There were several things that frustrated me with the game, here they are:\n\nCombat\nMicromanagement of your troops is non-existent. Healer getting mashed? No quick way to pull him out of battle, hotkeys are terrible. You end up just teleporting all your squads in and letting it resolve itself. When the fighting is over you have to teleport your troops to the kitchen to feed them. Feeding them refills their "aggression", if the unit's aggression is too low, they suffer combat penalties. Doing this over and over is mind-numbing.\n\nStory\nPainful. I can't believe I sat through those cutscenes. Voice acting is mediocre, the slow pacing and grade-school writing make it even worse.\n\nTech Trees and Resources\nYou basically get points for each achievement in the dungeon (e.g. Killing a hero, building 2 traps, building 10 traps, raiding a village, etc). Those points unlock buildings, units, unit special abilities, etc. The problem is having to do that in every single map make it especially painful. Most of the tech tree items are worthless--All you need to do is make a beeline toward some combat units (tank, healer, damage-dealer) and some key structures (to do things like upgrade armor).\n\nResource gathering is another pain point. While the idea of sending squads to raid nearby villages sounds cool, it ends up being a major chore. The map sucks and you are limited in the number of squads you have, yes more squads are unlockable but you already have most of them them tied up in combat to advance the storyline. (And you have all your troops in combat because: read above, combat sucks).\n\nHero Invasions Annoyances\nSo you've started on a new map and all your troops are tied up gathering resources or fighting to advance the story. Now you have random ladders spawning across your dungeon to slaughter your workers. Traps? Traps are worthless. Another ladder...great. Teleport troops over, wait for fighting to finish. Teleport to kitchen to feed your troops, then teleport your troops back to where they were. More ladders? Wash, rinse, repeat.","January 2, 2014","false","5.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The one good thing about this game is the, uh, voice acting? And I guess the squad system.\n\nNow, to get a full idea of just how bad this game is, I want you to go play Dungeon Keeper 2 if you haven't already. Awesome game right? Most of your time is actually spent working on defending the dungeon and building it up. Most of the other qualities of micromanagement (while still available to you for the most part) are pretty much taken care of. Impire goes in the complete opposite direction. Most of your time is spent microing your forces, sometimes for no obvious reason. To make matters worse you aren't given any keyboard shortcuts so what should be a 10-20 minute map will stretch into a 60 minute match of you having to replace fallen minions that shouldn't have died, training them, and feeding all of your units (almost individually).\n\nUnits low on aggression? You'll need to order them through a menu to go get food (context or squad). And if you have 15 units in the same situation? You'll need to individually tell each one to do the same. And you'll have to do this repeatedly throughout a single game. Which leads to simply ordering units into squads and never utilizing a full force (because it is a waste of time). And if you do go with extra units, if you want all of them to follow the leader? No matter how you do it, you'll need to tell each and every single one of them -individually- to follow Baal. And if you die? You have to repeat the whole process. They can't follow other units (IE, a vanguard squad) or do other things that might make sense.\n\nAnd the story? The adviser and Baal are just whiney. No, they aren't funny. I could tell there were moments where the developers were trying to make me laugh, but . . . It just fell flat on its face. Paradox, hire Teamfourstar next time. They know how to write (and voice) comedy. And the story just isn't worth it.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, this game does seem to have some good qualities buried underneath the clunky menus and terrible micromanagement. They just aren't worth your time and effort. Which is sad since this game was obviously inspired by Dungeon Keeper. If you like the ideas behind this game I suggest you sit down with Dungeon Keeper or, if you really don't mind wasting hours learning how to play it (it will be worth it), Dwarf Fortress.","May 20, 2015","false","5.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So this makes any layouts kinda blah.\n\nThe outdoor raids are boring, unless you like watching timers.\n\nAdventurers raiding your dungeons are annoying period.

I'm saying, having played DK's 1 and 2, this game is kinda winning. If you're familiar with DK you're familiar with this game and much of the mechanics are the same but slightly more polished. You have more direct control of your minions and less controll over the layout out and size of your rooms. Tactical combat improvment in exchange for more building constraints. Seeing how much combat you'll be doing in this game, this is a good trade-off.\n\nWhere this game shines though is in the characters. Baal and company have some rather charming personalities that grew on me. The humor is on the nose and the game itself rather challenging but in a more casual way. A good buy.\n\nPROS\n* Likeable characters\n* Well polished mechanics\n* Plenty of room for experimentation\n\nCONS\n* Loading time is horrendous.\n* Micromanaging becomes tedious at times.\n\nAll in all i liked this more than I liked DUngeon Keeper. though it suffers the same problem as other 'Evil'  games.  And the fac that you're supposed to be evil kinda takes the joy out of it. Besides there doesn't seem to be much you can do to really be especially evil. To quote a funny man. It's the difference between Lawful EVil and CHaotic Evill one's a job and the other's for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.\n\nTrythe demo first though I do not think you will be disappointed.","November 6, 2015","true","69.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

It is not a follow on to dungeon keeper, which seems to be why there are some negative views. Your dungeon is your base from which you can go and kill things. The main plot of the story is that you have been summoned by this weirdo to become ruler. There is no more plot than this, which makes for good simple fun :-). The controls take a little getting used to as there is a fine line between left mouse click and click and hold, which can be frustrating. It would be nice to have afew more choices in the game.
