The reaction of the bat mechanics with the ball physics is surprisingly accurate, so much so that in a very short time I was able to aim and direct my shots. Really hope that there are some more updates to this project, and potentially an expansion of the pitching mechanic so that I can play real life baseball scenarios with runners on base, certain pitch count scenarios, etc.","April 14","true","0.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It could use a bit more instructions that you have to point the bat into the sign in order to change the pitch type. When you do go to press it, I seemed to go a bit outside of my bounds to press them.\n\nIt's a very nice game though!","April 16","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The physics in this game are incredible. I spend about 20 mins in this before going into other games. Free to boot! I will deff use this in my demo line up for my fam/friends. Feels very natural and I would love to see where this goes in the future.","May 18","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's simple, like most vr games, but has great physics and works near perfect. The controls work so well it's hard to tell if there is actually any room for improvement, when you hit the ball if feels natural, and you can self pitch or tee. The devloper added an option for a pitcher but currently you cannot select the button. I would gladly pay for a more polished version,","May 10","true","0.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","1"

I was showing off too friends and we all had a great time taking turns destroying the playfield. I wasn't sure how much I would like this becuase you cant feel the ball when you hit, or even feel the weight of the bat, but you quickly forget what it doesnt have and get absorbed in what it does.\n\nStrangely your brain makes up the realism, and the game seems to take on a life of its own. Really shows the potential of sports games in VR!","May 26","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics in this are great. The control you have with ball placement is shockingly consistent with real life. A full blown batting sim - facing pitchers of different calibers in real situations - would be awesome - and the bat/ball physics in this game are good enough already to do just that.","June 3","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
