"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DickShoeMcGhee/recommended/209710/","DickShoeMcGhee","아빠는 왼쪽","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DickShoeMcGhee/","119 products in account","REVIEW ON GAME:\n\nI first started playing WoI after about a month or so afters its release, before that, I had been an avid BoI player. I came back to WoI for a little while and noticed that a lot of the issues I had beforehand were fixed. These were mostly text issues, but there were also some dramatic game changes as well that veterans of the game will notice rather quickly.\n\nTL;DR - The game can be rewarding if you enjoy games that baby-feed the everloving ♥♥♥♥ out of you. Game rating is at the bottom.\n\nWar of the Immortals is a fairly decent dungeon-crawler-esque themed game. There's your standard stuff: instances, PvP, and a story line that can be followed through the "Scenario" type quests the game offers you. Where this game shines and fails in is the gear aspect and in the leveling portion. You're essentially hunting for gear, which is to be expected in any sort of RPG; the problem lies in the fact that you level too fast to let the gear sink in. There are just too many ways to level up quickly in this game. During the "tutorial" segment (the parts of the game that take place before the player recieves his/her first set of GG at level 45) you're essentially doing one quest per level up. And on top of that, the game doesn't offer that many difficult quests. Scenario quests are mostly gathering or killing certain enemies. The player is spoiled with rewards every 10 levels, with the exception of mid-game levels (80-90) where the player is rewarded every 5. At level 50, one of these rewards is an item called a "Rock of Trials" which is specific to an instance that is also unlocked at level 50, called the Paladin Trials. At the end of the instance, a Rock of Trials can be used to open a rather large chest that gives the player a massive amount of EXP. I personally ran this instance the second I hit level 50 with my Slayer and used a Rock of Trials at the end. Needless to say, I instantly jumped up 6 levels. You're given 10 of those rocks, mind you. I believe a level 60 reward is an item called "Ominous Orb" which is practically an instant level-up; the player is given 10 as well. The game also incorporates 1.5x and 2.0x experience through their respective stones which warrant half an hour of the depicted type of experience bonus. Leveling only slows down after around level 90 or so. Where is this a problem, you might ask? Gear is layed out as such: Tutorial gear would be anything warranted before level 45, where the player runs through Magnetos to seek the first set of GG. This gear includes Greens; yes, this game has a gear colour system, albeit, a fairly mediocre one. Golden Gear is mainly used by PvE enthusiasts, and are earned through other instances such as Specter Island (lvl. 60) and Evernight City (lvl.75) for example. After level 45, your next set is earned at level 60. THERE IS NO GEAR IN BETWEEN THESE LEVELS. Soul Gear is much more difficult to achieve, and therefore, much more valuable. It used to be mainly for PvP only, but has seemed to have adapted into an all-around set of gear that can be used for any situation. After you recieve your set of  level 45 GG, you level fairly steadily until level 50, and before you realize it, you're a level 70+ with still a few pieces of level 45 gear. Get in a guild, find a legion, and run instances together to trade for the pieces of gear you need to stay on track. It's almost impossible to obtain gear on your own, the drop rates are low enough as it is.\n\nCharacter customization is fairly limited. Most of the classes aren't gender locked, with the exception of the Enchantress. That being said; however, there aren't very many facial options or hair styles (the hair colour is also locked to the style which is pretty annoying). Perfect World HAS the technology and resources available to further their character customization. Perfect World International was released in North America on 2, September, 2008 and offered a larger variety of character customization features. Nothing too astonishing, but there's a clear difference in character customization if you compare the two.\n\nThe other issue I have is with the buff given to players in the level 40-100 range. This buff is called We Believe In You and it is the, by far, the most annoying thing that could possibly be given to players. It upgrades at levels 46 and 61, and lasts for 4 hours. If the extreme leveling wasn't enough, you'll love this. The buff grants a bonus damage to all monster types by "X", and gives "Y" mana and 1 rage every 5 seconds. It's honestly the worst thing ever. As if the game didn't hold your hand enough. What's the point in doing the kill quests if I just kill everything in one hit? That's not fun, nor is it challenging. If I could make any changes to this game, it'd be this:\n\n- Harder bosses and enemies\n- Stricter leveling (I've seen people that can hit level 120 in about 2-3 weeks)\n- More character customization\n- Better animations\n- More gear in between levels\n- Larger maps, bigger hubs and larger amounts of hubs\n- More instances, and make the existing ones more of a challenge. I DON'T want to be able to solo them without issue.\n- Replace the Awakened Lineage feature with a skill tree system. Your class should be your CLASS, not CLASSES. The Lineage feature is just a choppy clone of dual-speccing.\n- Clean up the game, for Christ's sake. Just because a few of the text issues were fixed doesn't mean that all of the issues are.\n\n\n\nREVIEW ON COMMUNITY:\n\nIf you can get in a guild or get friends together, you should be fine. The forums are dead, but there are still a couple of loyal fans that still log on. Chats are flooded with trade offers, and other than that no one seems to want to really do anything anymore.\n\n\n\nRATINGS:\n\nGame: 6.5/10 - If you enjoy a challenge, this is not the game for you. If you're more of a casual player that just wants to enjoy a dungeon-crawler with some friends without much stress, go on ahead and download it. I can see the appeal, but all in all, it could have been better.\n\nCommunity: 3/10 - The once promising player base is becoming barren, and the forums haven't been active in months. This may be due to the probationary period that PW has enabled on their forums, limiting newly registered players from creating threads. The guilds I have been in are fairly strict on dailies and often kick players for not participating on a dailty basis. I'm shocked that there's enough of a player base to even say that guilds still exist.\n\nOverall Opinion: War of the Immortals can be fun at times, especially since the classes are all fairly distinct from each other, but the developers severely impacted their standings by making their leveling system, and the game itself, far too easy.","January 7, 2014","false","76.4"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","37","48","0","0"

Some quests are pretty similar but only few. Starting the game might be boring but when u reach higher lvls (50-130) the fun part starts.\n\nThe quests are mostly very rewarding in terms of money and xp. Also there are many daily events where to gain xp and money from including the famous "quiz bowl" which is everyday at 9pm CET.\n\nI recommend this game for all you mmorpg fans out there who are tired of monthly fees, and for those players who are just looking for a casual way to spend time. The character design and everything is awesome imo. This is just my opinion but give the game a try. Im sure you'll enjoy it !","January 1, 2014","true","161.0"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

I love a challenge, and a good grind, and always like to see mechanics and gameplay features that branch beyond the genre.\n\nI invested less than an hour into the game, but I'll give you my firsthand experience as objectively as possible.\n\nThe game looks flashy, but dated looking.  Character and monster design look like a lot of effort went into them, but the lighting effects are a bit overdone.  Map designs are very well done and have a heavy western RPG feel to them.  The game lacks antialiasing, so once you zoom into the characters, you see blocky edges that really shows how dated this game's design really is.  High level character design is over the top, in an almost costume jewelery looking fashion.  There must be a ton of gear in this game, as it seems like you get upgrade after upgrade rather quickly from doing quests.\n\nThe Music feels epic in it's tone, but as I listened to a few of the map themes, I got the feeling of dischord and off-the rails digital symphonics that just didn't sound right after a while.  The combat sounds were mid level, but I found myself wanting to shut the game off after 15 minutes as the over flashy combat lighting and redundant grunting attack sounds began to quickly assault the senses.\n\nCombat feels clunky, poorly timed, and a bit underdone.  Compared to other games the archer's gathering animations were laughable, and the jumping shot attack seemed rather silly.  I'm sure there is more epic looking attack animations as the game goes on, but I'm sure the poorly timed attack motif is something that does not change.\n\nAuto-pathing to each quest took my mind off the actual game world as I delved into the interface. tons of upgrades look to be available, and I mean tons.  I like that kind of thing but I couldn't get past the combat to really give this game a try.  Royal  Quest is still doing it for me since August 2014, however I thought I'd give a few other Steam MMO's a try.\n\nIf you want some easymode auto path autoattack gaming, you can appreciate this game for what it is, but I personally can't.\n\n","October 31, 2014","false","0.6"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","22","36","0","0"

War of the Immortals reminds me of really good mmorpg game 2moons/Dekaron. It even have done few things better like fight with bosses - I think those are more effective in this game. Still, that doesn't make game a better from 2moons/Dekaron or even worth playing. Even tho I don't need much from game from this genre, War of the Immortals still fail to entertain me. From beggining, you more run around from place to place, from NPC to NPC, than actually fighting and when you finally do it, all you get is exp, with almost no stuff drops. Not sure how it's later but at earlier game you level up rather fast - few monters combined with few quests will get you next level. Also, I'm not sure how active this game is - I was the only one at beggining areas (still saw some people in city) but main chat is focused only on "<item name> offer". Not much fun if you ask me. Still, you are better trying War of the Immortals yourself - it's free to play, so you can try it and have your own opinion. Who knows, maybe you will play it for much longer than I did. This review only means that this game failed to catch my interest for longer time.","January 29","false","2.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

This is a P2P. But if you look at it, aren't MOST MMOs?\n\nI am a casual gamer, which basically means I play the game with whatever gear I get by questing. For the most part, this strategy serves me well for this particular game. I've clocked 15 hours of gametime and I'm at level 60.. And I haven't spent a penny. Now the temptation is there, of course, but the items that are available only to paying players are mostly vanity items to essentially show off you're a paying gamer.\n\nThe gameplay is straightforward. There are no maps to memorize; you click your destination and you are automatically routed to it, walking (or riding your mount) through brilliantly designed landscapes.\n\nAt first glance this game reminded me of WarTune and League of Angels. The moment I stepped into the game I was proven wrong. It's better. Having been a lifelong fan of MMOs, I finally found one I can call home.\n\nTL;DR: Kick-♥♥♥ game. Pay if you want to, but it's not required. You level fairly quickly if you're dedicated and other gamers are quick to help you if you get stuck. Definitely worth getting.","May 31, 2015","true","64.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Firstly I have to say this is one of the most repeative but yet rewarding MMOs out there.\n\nYou have 9 base classes ranging from your typical ranger/warrior/mage/healer and sub-categories.\nWith locked races and non-locked male/female gender. What is unquie about this game is the\nbotting service in the game, which has auto-potting system and exp stones gathered from cash shop or rewards from your class quests. A Pet system with a % chance to capture a pet based on its level & stats and skills based on the charater statics such as melee/magic/range. Depending on the class you are playing. it is wise to have a Tanking pet or DPS pet & a unquie mount pet for your class.\n\nPlayers are to do mainly, daily dungeons and quests everyday it resets and you get gold +exp and craftable items and rewards for leveling up. It has a simple & yet fun way of doing daily quests from guild stuffs harvesting crafting & dungeon crawling. It also has its usual generic quests apart from the dailys which isn't much. Most of these quests would last you about 3-4 hours on average after you get to lv70-80 onwards. Where story quests are mostly nonexistent at this point.\n\nIts fun with the aspect of being simple & relaxing game. I must warn you it gets very repeative though those daily dungeoning & completing repeative tasks to level up it can get a little boring but its awesome when you know the max level of this game is only 120 and in 100 hrs you can easily get to lv 100. The main aim is to hit lv 120 for the PVP aspect of this MMO where the true fun lies in.\n\n\nI do recommand you getting a guild, its very essential in this MMO the sooner the better. Unless you have at least a group of 4-5 friends.\nThis MMO has a quick end game mostly aimmed towards pvp. Too busy or just too lazy to to grind, this is just the MMO for you. A MMO, more rewarding to play with a group of friends or to burn some time off your miserable waking life. xD\n\nFinal Vedict: 6/10\n\nUpdated: 26th Nov 2013","December 19, 2012","true","93.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

MMORPG gameplay meets diablo. Point, click, sit back and watch. (with typical eastern mmo junk like leveling up 5 times in 2 minutes from the same spawns)\n4. Perfect world pay 2 win\n\nTrust me, dont waste your time downloading the game, and then downloading the 20+ patches.

THATS if you want to pay money. Its not pay to win as some have said but it helps if you have the good gear. I myself refuse to pay and just spend my quest coins on buying zen (as in fake money) or doing questionairs that give you promo zen to add to your accounts. OR I just don't bother and go around with my F2P stuff.","September 8, 2014","true","505.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of levels, dungeons, mobs, items, weapons and classes to play a huge storyline, where you can do it several times without getting bored, and there is a huge amount of content. I used to play it with friends and made a few characters, because the first levels are easy to pass, after 80 gets complicated, and it starst to get repetitive, so every now and then, I reinstaled it to level up one or two lvs more. It isn't worth it to play it anymore, the community is dead, and if you don't have a party, you can't do dungeons, so if you don't have missions, you can't level up, and without them, you don't get xp or armor or weapons. There is only a percentage of players, but they are more than lv 100, and they do it with friends, that's why, I don't recommend this game, or at least for now, in cause of the community. 4/10","December 22, 2015","false","79.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
