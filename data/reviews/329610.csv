I feel like we haven't had one for years and RBI Baseball comes close but its so insanely buggy that its close to unplayable.\n\nI've played RBI for just a few hours, here's what I've seen:\n\n- Can't throw\n- Online opponent can't throw\n- Player I'm controlling starts running off the field\n- Outs not recognized\n- Hit-by-pitch not recognized\n- Pop-up catches not recognized\n- Mercy rule not honored\n- Throws going to the player\n\nI'm not looking for a dialed in, well balanced, baseball simulator. I like the arcade feel of RBI, but the bugs are making it a real challenge to play and I can't see myself putting some serious time in with this game because of them...\n\nThe good news is, they've already patched the game once, maybe we'll see more patches shortly to address some of the playability issues. I do like the feel of the game has potential and it is a baseball game I want to play.

It's a retro style Baseball game with an arcade feel to it. The graphics are decent; not over the top, and not bad either. It's good to see an MLB game on the PC.\n\nPositives:\nA Baseball game back on the PC\nWorks with a Logitech Dual Action Controller, however some of the controls don't match up; hit is button 1, bunt button 2, steal button 3 (and direction).  All of those controls are easy to use though. :)\nPitching and hitting are fun\nSeason mode with stats\nChoice of 162 games in a season, 82, or 51. (Yes season mode appears to work now so far. the relief pitcher bug is now fixed. :)\nMLB rosters\nSounds of the crowd are pretty good, they cheer when they should; sounds cool when someone hits a homerun as well\nGames can be played in a reasonable amount of time. I lost 6-2 in my first season game and it lasted around 45 minutes. It took me 1-2 exhibition games to get used to the controls, but they are pretty good.\n\nMinus:\nFielding is a bit tough at first, but you can set it on assist which means the fielders do the fielding and you do the throwing if needed.\nGraphics could be better\nNo Myplayer, and no trades.\nMouse control in the menus (or at all) isn't supported; have to use keyboard or gamepad.\nThere are a few bugs I ran into like a pitcher fielding the ball in the 12th on the mound, and he couldn't throw or move. This only happened once so far though.\n\nOverall:\nPick up this game if you want a decent MLB game, and you want to support PC sports games.","April 30, 2015","true","25.5"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","31","39","4","0"

It's simplistic and very casual, you can just pick up and play, other than getting timing down for hitting it's easy to play.  If you are an older gamer you'll appriciate the throw back to old sports games.\n\nThe bad  -  The game just isn't anywhere near the standard sports games have been held too far years.  Lack of options, lack of customization, lack of multiple seasons.  While these things were common place back in the the early 2000's when games were limited, those limitations don't exist anymore.  The graphics are kind of meh, that normally doesn't matter in sports games but the player animations are rough, they glide rather than run.  Also it seems to have quite a few issues with fielding on line drives...\n\nGenerally speaking, Super Mega Baseball is a far superior product, which is only held back by it's lack of a MLB license.  I'd only recommend this game if you're a massive hardcore fan of throwback games.  Even then it's a tough recommendation because the game just isn't very fun to play..\n\n","October 25, 2015","false","0.6"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","28","34","2","0"

As a kid I put so many hours into those games, studied the stats and never blinked once. This is nostalgic.\n\nIt doesn't compare in any way, shape or form to the MLB games of today as this was made to feel old school.\n\nThe graphics are basic and the gameplay is VERY fast, which I love. You can play a 9-inning game in 20 minutes and there are no cut-scenes or replays in between plays or innings and that is just fine with me.\n\nThe menus are very clean and easy to navigate. I didn't expect to have the rosters update and stay current with the actual MLB clubs, so that is a very nice touch.\n\nI am playing with an XBox controller and the controls are not perfect. I swear I'll press right on the d-pad to throw to first base but the ball will go to second. Frustrating, but I can live with it. Hitting is very straight-forward and easy. Pitching can be challenging but it is nowhere near as difficult as fielding (atleast for me). I can't catch a fly-ball to save my life. I find it very hard to judge where the ball is going to land.\n\nAnyways enough about me. This game is a lot of fun and it is highly recommended for baseball video game fans of the early to mid 90's. I plan to put many more hours into this game!","April 30, 2015","true","100.7"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

I have an occasional graphics bug where weird lines go through the playing field, etc. Quitting the game, then opening the game again and continuing my game in progress fixes the issue.\n\nI love this game for what it is. I work in an office 50+ hours a week. I like being able to play a quick game here and there. A game can take as little at 20 minutes. Hitting and pitching is pretty easy. It definitely reminds me of the classic nostalgic games I played growing up. It reminds me of the baseball games on Sega Genesis with more recent/modern graphics.

This is not meant to be an in-depth sim like The Show, just a fun, two-button game where you press a button and hope your pitcher yanks one over the wall. You're supposed to leave your starter in for all 9 innings and laugh when he can't get his 4 seamer above 60mph, but still strikes out the side anyway.\n\nMost negative reviews I'm seeing missed the point. This game was meant to be even simpler than Ken Griffey Jr. Baseball for the N64 back in the late 90's, and I think it's done that. Although that game will always be the best baseball game of all time, RBI feels much the same.\n\nI would have liked a more intuitive UI. We can't play local multiplayer without two 360 controllers, which is a pain. Feels a bit underdeveloped / rushed.\n\nI hope the success of this game will spark development of a cross-platform PC baseball sim (such as The Show or something similar) where people can be more competetive and in-depth.","April 30, 2015","true","8.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","15","19","4","0"

All in all it is a playable game and it does have some of the old arcade feeling and gameplay, but overall the game is a let down and just feels empty and cheap. Now with Steam refunds there is no risk in buying it and trying it out, but you will probably want to wait till you see it on a 75% sale.\n\nPro:\nIt's a baseball game on the PC\nIt does have some of the old arcade feeling\nOfficial teams and season\nUpdated roster and stats (if you care about that)\nThe menu's with player stats etc in between games does look good, very big contrast to the  graphics in the game\nCon:\nThe game feels static and empty (as an unfinished game with missing features and details)\nAll players have little to no animations. Specially no idle animations\nMinimal controls and the control response feels slow and you can't rebind the controls\nThe game constantly gives you control over the wrong fielder when you have to catch a ball and the overal positioning of fielders is really lacking (cos they are static standing AI statues up to the moment the ball goes into the field and you don't have any control over their general fielding positioning)\nAI fielders stand on the same spot when they do a (foul) catchball. You see 3 AI standing (clipping) inside each other. Looks like one guy with 6 arms\nUnder par graphics and generally low detail\nThe scaling of the stadions are way off. Tiny miniature crowd, huge dugouts, unrealistic tribune size, etc\nNo stadion speaker, no sports commentary (a huge miss and makes it really lack atmosphere)\nNo adjustable camera for batting and pitching and both pitching and batting is done from the batter perspective (home plate)\nAll player models look basically the same, even the star players. They are all the same length, thickness, etc.\nWhen you start a game after the loading screen you are immediately dropped into the game as a batter. The first throw from the pitcher is literally within 3 seconds after the loading screen. No (birdseye zoom in or seeing the batter walking up to the plate) camera intro, no nothing.\nThere are some more things I could place in the con list, but you get the idea.\nSimilar conclusions in a video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVaHTo_XflQ\n\n(edit: added 1 extra con/pro point).","July 18, 2015","false","8.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","3"

When you buy the game, you know that it isn't going to be an MLB The Show quality baseball game, but a fun arcade style baseball game.\nI do really enjoy a baseball game on the computer to play, but for how much the game costs, it is not worth it. It needs to polished a bit more, the controls need to be fixed and there needs to be a something that tells you the controls( if there is something besides the loading screen which lasts not long enough to read it, than it needs to be more apparent), and it also needs more content for how much it costs.\nI would recommend this if it was $5 or even $10 dollars but it is a pricey $20 dollars and there are many other things you could get for that money. I do enjoy playing the game when I am bored but that is just me. I really do appreciate how baseball is being brought back to the computer and xbox, but this just isnt good enough.

Also, some of the controls are not as exact as I would like, and there is no ability to dive or slide for a ball (especially grounders, which can roll through the infield just a few inches away from your player).

This is bad because the animation only looks like I've lifted my leg, not made any swing motion\n- sometimes when fielding the ball, I can't throw it.

And the way it is now, I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone. My gameplay can be described like this: several minutes of fun arcade-style baseball at a time, punctuated by confounding, frustrating bugs and glitches. It is fun when it is working properly, but then reality strikes and I wonder why I plunked down $20 on this. I'm a die-hard baseball fan and loved playing PC baseball games back in the day. I used to play a game called Hardball! on my old Mac. And on my old Nintendo, Baseball Stars was the best. I was hoping RBI would be a throwback to those kinds of games, but not yet.\n\nLet's start with the cons:\n\n- Awful keyboard set up with no re-mapping. The controls are unintuitive and irritating to say the least. The right arrow key is assigned to "back" in the menu system. Really? And the mouse is unusable for the entire game, including navigating menus. But for some odd reason, the mouse arrow is still there anyway. Just allow me to map my own keys and use the mouse if I want. Trying to navigate through stats and other menus is really a pain in the @55.\n\n- Pitchers lose stamina very quickly. I'm lucky to get my starters to go 4 or 5 innings before they're tossing 60mph grapefruits (CPU, too). And I rarely use the "fast" or "slow" pitches or the left/right movement.\n\n- Pitchers don't seem to field groundballs. They will be available to catch the occasional pop-up, but a slow ground ball right to them? Nope. Through the legs and into center. EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: the pitcher does get activated for some ground balls, such as a swinging bunt or weak grounder near him. But it's the grounders that are hit right at the pitcher where no attempt is made to field it, even though it looks like he's in fielding position and should be able to make a play on it.\n\n- Something is off with the overall "timing" of fielders, throwing, and baserunning. What I mean is, if I hit a gapper that rolls to the fence, I'll be lucky to get a double out of it, when it should be an easy stand-up double for even the slowest runner. I get thrown out fairly often trying to get to 2nd on what is typically a sure double. Want to tag up from third on a deep-ish fly ball? Good luck with that. It's nearly impossible. Want to score from 2nd with two outs on a single to the outfield? Good luck with that, too. I don't know if the runners are maybe just too slow or the fielders throw too fast.\n\n- Fielding glitches: I've had an outfielder catch a ball and then get stuck in the fence, unable to throw. Luckily, the computer runner didn't advance and eventually the play ended and went to the next at-bat. On one occasion the CPU had bases loaded with one out. It hit a routine grounder to my third baseman which should have been an easy 5-4-3 DP, but when I threw to 2nd, no one was there! The ball rolled all the way to the right field fence. When the CPU is fielding, it makes odd decisions. If I have runners on 1st and 2nd with less than 2 outs and I hit a grounder to an infielder, it tries to get the out at 3rd rather than go for the traditional DP. Even if I hit it to the second or first baseman! Also, with CPU runners on base, a routine grounder near 2nd base bag will not be picked up by the shortstop, even though he's running right over the ball! The second baseman is activated to field the ball, but he's no where near it. Similar scenarios happen between 1st and 2nd with pitcher, second baseman, and first baseman.\n\n- Baserunning glitch: Sometimes, when I have runners on base and I hit a fly ball, the CPU outfielder will catch it for the out, but not throw it in. It's just frozen there. The game will not continue unless I let one of my runners get out. Frustrating.\n\n- Quick-pitching by the CPU. Especially to start the game. If I'm visitor and have first at-bat, as soon as the pitching screen comes on, the first pitch is already on the way! It would be nice if there was a pause before the CPU starts pitching. Even for the later innings, although it's not as quick. But a slight pause would still be nice to get my batter set up or see who's pitching, etc.\n\n- Manual fielding (outfield) is kinda tough! Just when I think I figured out the fly ball indicator and sound, another ball goes way over my outfielder resulting in an extrabase-hit for the CPU. Is that just me? I'm reluctant to turn on the fielding assist because I want to do 100% of my fielding, but sometimes I wonder if the indicator is outta whack or I am.\n\n- Non-responsive throwing direction. Sometimes my fielder will not throw to the base I'm indicating with the WASD keys. For example, I'm clearly pushing W so my outfielder will throw to second, but the throw goes all the way home or to first. Initially I thought I was doing something incorrect, but I've been experimenting with this and there is definitely something else that is wrong.\n\nThe pros:\n\n- Fun gameplay when it works. There is a sense of satisfaction when you time the swing well and get a nice solid hit somewhere. Or turn a tough 6-4-3 double play.\n\n- No annoying replays or cut scenes. I like the minimalist production. Even the homerun scenes are quick and unobtrusive. Most shots of foul balls are cut off so you are right back at the at-bat (although some scenes still follow the foul ball all the way out of the stadium for some reason).\n\n- Can call "time" even when pitcher is starting to throw. This is great because the CPU quick-pitches already, so if he's quick-pitching me to start an inning and I want to pinch hit, I can still call "time" before the pitcher releases so I can put in a pinch hitter.\n\nAnyway, I apologize for the long review. But I feel that discerning consumers want a real, honest review, including details.\nI will keep playing RBI in the hopes that more updates will come along to address these issues. But I can't help but be disappointed that they released a game like this with all these bugs and issues. It's so obviously a half-@55ed port from console and they didn't even bother to test it thoroughly. They're using paying consumers as testers. Not cool, guys. Not cool.","May 4, 2015","false","17.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","0"

This game reminds me of the snes era of baseball games with updated graphics, and even less features than those had.  The game could be decent if the only problem was lack of common features found in all modern baseball games today but unfortunately it isn't.  I really wanted to look past the shortcomings and give this a good review but I can't, too many problems I've never experienced in any baseball game ever.  I only continue to play this because it's the only MLB baseball game on steam, so I deal with.  I can only recommend this game to you if you're in the same position, it's still not a good game.  Just be warned too some people say they lose their season after the regular season ends and the playoff starts, so be warned.\n\nYou get Exhibition, Season, World Series, no playoffs, home run derby, or all star game.  No create a player, you can pinch hit but can not pinch run or sub a fielder.\n\n\nBUGS:\n\nThis game is riddled with bugs, some of them just plain break the rules of the game, some are as follows:\n\nI fly out to left field, think game is frozen so hit buttons and the runners on 1st and 2nd move towards 2nd and 3rd, this gets the left fielder to throw the ball to 3rd, does not tag the runner, then throws to first who doesn't tag a runner either and I'm called out for a double play.  I did tag up.\n\nAgain flew out to left thought was frozen, send runner from 1st and 2nd to 2nd and 3rd, he throws to 3rd then 1st, 1st baseman catches ball while runner is between 1st and 2nd and I'm called out triple play.  I had tagged up.\n\nI didn't know the how to control runners properly and ended a play with two runners on second, he threw the ball to second and both were called safe and they stayed there for the inning.\n\nSome very obvious balls called strikes and vice versa.\n\nShortstop managed to knock the ball down once and it was called an error, which never would have happened after a leaping jump managed to keep the batter from extra bases and keep the ball in the infield.\n\nHad a ball clearly go foul but the umpire never called it and it was somehow in play.\n\nDUMB AI:\n\nI'm not on the hardest difficulty but the AI is till pretty dumb, making mistakes little leaguers wouldn't even make such as:\n\nNot taking the ball to first with two outs.\nHolding onto the ball instead of throwing back to infield/cutoff.\nThrowing from outfield to wrong base.\nOnce threw the ball from the wall all the way to home plate and I scored while it slowly rolled to the catcher.\nSteals after ball crosses plate.\nDoesn't just miss, but starts to swing after the ball crosses plate.\nSometimes will just throw terrible pitches, ball after ball after ball.\n\n\n\nI wish there was more I could say that is good about the game.   The hitting system is cool, it relies more on timing and location of ball on the bat rather than choosing if you're hitting for contact or power or manually controlling if you're going to pull or go for opposite field.\n\nI don't have that many hours in this game but there isn't much else to say except new bugs I'd find by playing.\n\nOh, and the worst part, there is no damn CITGO sign at Fenway.  If they can't get the rights for the CITGO every game always has the sign with some other fake logo on it.  It's symbolic, and a huge oversight.  I'm probably nitpicking at this point but it is the only game I've played that didn't have it :(","February 15","false","6.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

THIS IS A BIG DEAL!!!\n\n---Verdict---\nOverall, RBI 2015 is a fun game to fill that baseball gap, but it is far from perfect.\nIf the bugs are ironed-out over the next few weeks, then it would be a no brainer to buy it. However, the bugs make it very frustrating at times. I have lost games due to AI issues or controller bugs.\n\nEven with its issues, RBI Baseball 2015 is a good baseball game and you should pick it up if you're a fan of classic arcade sports or baseball in general.","May 4, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

The computer cheats worse than ever. There is no possible way to win a single-player game. If you're batting, the strike zone is about 150 feet to either side of the plate. The opposing pitcher sends the ball all over the place, but no matter how far off the plate it is, it's still a strike. If you're pitching, the strike zone shrinks to the size of a dime right over the center of the plate. If by some fluke you do manage to hit the ball it will only go out of play foul or pop up to a fielder. The AI fielding is flawless, no matter where you hit it, the fielder will be right under it. The human fielding controls are awful, if he even gets the ball, the fielder throws wherever he darn well pleases, usually not where you want him to throw. That is, if you can get him to throw at all, usually he just runs around like an 8 year old with ADHD.\n\nGet an emulator and play RBI 3 for the Genesis. It's at least remotely possible to score in that version.","September 22, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

A lot of work. Probably more work than this team has money for.  This game is terrible right now, barely playable for a game that is $20.  If this game were in alpha and say free to try out so that people could give feedback on how to take the game, then it would be alright.  The fielding mechanics are subpar and random at best, when trying to field the ball, you can either be spot on and miss or 5 feet away and catch it.  Hitting makes no sense, as moving in the batters box should have no effect on how the ball is hit. The stamina system makes no sense because starting pitchers can't even make 4 innings.  As of right now, I would not buy this game, as it is not even close to being worth, especially at $20.

This is way to long for my taste.\n-The pitching isn't difficult, but it is a little weird. You can throw normal, fast ball, or an off speed pitch. But you can't control up or down, just how inside or outside it is, and you can move the pitch a good bit, but it'd help if the pitching was better.\n-Hitting is also a little weird. You can control if you want to increase the chances you hit it on the ground or in the air, and obviously the timing matters, but you can't control where you want to hit it too or anything like that.\n\nAnother thing that is bad and weird, but others may not experience is that it runs pretty badly on my PC. I can run most every other game, Total War, Skyrim, pretty much everything at nearly maxed specs, but I had to take this sucker to 640-400 resolution and it's still not running perfectly.\n\nI've heard about other people who's games keep crashing during an actual game, so maybe it's got something to do with that. Hopefully they'll make it more stable.\n\nHowever honestly, the big reason I can't enjoy this game is that I require season mode and I don't have the attention span for 9 innings. If they let a game last 1-3 innings like in Exhibition mode I would play it again.","May 2, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TroublishONE/recommended/329610/","TroublishONE","TroublishONE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TroublishONE/","355 products in account","This game needs a lot of work, period. With that said, the game is almost unplayable due to its  mechanics. The graphics are just terrible, feels like xbox/ps2 graphics. The animations are barely there, which makes everything very awkward in terms of play. And the fact there is only play and youth program, just goes to show that this game is an empty shell.\n\nPitching feel stupidly simple and stiff, and I feel like I have too much control over the ball, making it the biggest issue with pitching . That sounds odd but after the pitch is thrown you can literally move it anywhere to please. It makes pitching boring and unrealistic, it also takes a lot the skill out of the game. Then there is the stamina system. it’ s a lazily slapped on annoyance that makes no sense. pitching in all is just unrewarding. but the batting is by far the worst mechanic, it’s a complete mess. Its hard to see the pitches verticality when up to bat due to the angle of the camera, which in turn makes it hard to tell where the pitch is. In addition, the way the pitch come at you it makes hitting extremely hard to time. Then there is fielding which is extremely frustrating, pop flies are way too hard to catch and I mess up where I want to through all the time (that may be more my fault). Fielding is a joke, its a simple function yet I still feel like its just junk.\n\nThis is the first game I’ve bought from the R.I.B. so I can’t tell if its improved at all from it’s predecessor, but I assume they are making gradual changes/improvements. That’s not enough, This game clearly needs serious TLC. I can’t even tell if their target is an arcade style game or they are trying to turn into something like MLB the show for PC. That said, the idea of a PC game that is on the level of MLB the show is very enticing, and thats why I got this game. I knew it wasn’t going to be at that level this installment, but I bought this to support the developers and get them to keep making this game and improving. But I honestly am still very disappointed with my purchase. The game looks like its an early PS2 baseball game and it plays worse than one. They really need to create an entire engine with way better mechanics/graphics just to make this game fun.\n\nAs you see I’ve been mentioning MLB the show a lot, thats because I feel like thats the market they're trying to get into. But if the developers want to go more arcade, I’m absolutely behind them. I’d like an arcade baseball game, but the issue is they haven’t gone too far in that direction. I feel like its a very basic alpha for a simulation style game (like MLB the show). So unless they try to do something unique with this, or GREATLY improve the experience for the players, I cannot suggest this. This game just leaves me longing for a PC release of MLB the show. It isn’t simulation, nor is it arcade, Its just bad.\n\nAlthough, there is hope. I believe if the devs got their ♥♥♥ in gear and started really trying hard to focus on the gameplay they could compete with bigger companies. All they need is mechanics to start with. That would be an amazing foundation, paving the way for future iterations. Graphics can come later, but things like animations really do affect the overall feel of the game. So they can’t skimp on that.\n\nConcluding, this game is garbage right now. I’d really like it if they show some love for the PC crowd and really dedicated themselves to this. But as of now, I see no effort. It seems harsh, but thats really how I feel when I am playing this game. Don’t buy unless you have extra money and want to support the PC baseball game market. If a developer reads this, know I am rooting for you guys to make this game great, but its not even close right now.","May 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

I haven't seen any injuries and the season mode is simplistic... With that caveat I DO reccomend this game as a fun, arcade style baseball game on PC.  It is a big step behind the console franchises, but if you don't own a current generation console, then at least you can scratch your baseball itch with this budget title...  it's less than $20, and if you play even a shortened season on it (52 games) you will definitely get your money's worth.  It's not great, but it's fun and competent and it seems to be being supported by the developers.  I hope this becomes a regular yearly release and that the management aspects get deeper.  It has a few flaws - no pitch selection (slider, curveball, etc) and the pitchers get very tired quickly (3 innings max).  Fielding is a pain as well...   Also, it helps to have a controller  - I have a 360 controller.    For awhile the game was opening in a tiny box that could not be adjusted, but I think I got that sorted out...  If you can overlook a few bugs this is a great budget baseball title for the PC.","May 2, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I would say it's a waste of 20$. It's a real shame that there aren't any good baseball games available for PC.","October 17, 2015","false","54.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the reason I would not recommend the game to others is because it is simply too buggy in its current state. I have lost 3 games in my season mode in the last two days because of bugs where your fielder would just freeze in place and the only option to fix it is to exit and restart. A fun little game but the bugs are just to frustrating to keep playing.\n\nUpdate- Well after a few months it seems like a lot of the bug issues have been fixed. I made it through the rest of my season mode without anymore issues so I changed my review from a no to a yes.","May 10, 2015","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I tried to play all the menus constently scroll. I can get to the game mode if I smash buttons, but then the players and pitches all move left. (Great if I'm facing left-handed batters who will sing at anything) Ran a keyboard and controler diagnostic, both are working fine. Even tried both with other games and there no problem. Not sure what to try next. Other than that the game looks good, would love to play but can't.","December 23, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
