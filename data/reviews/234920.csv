This did not affect my opinion; I will only recommend games that I like. If I do not like a game, I will not recommend it. Period. View my mission statement.\nREVIEWDyscourse is a choose-your-adventure style story told through the medium of a video game (as opposed to the traditional method of a book).  And that is exactly how it plays.  The story is good, but not great; the true identity of the game centers around its quirky nature.\n\nTechnically: it is an “adventure game.”  But it doesn’t really have the typical features of an adventure game.  There is no inventory, and there are really no puzzles or minigames to be solved.  The game truly boils down to a quirky narrative, where you make choices via dialogue that then have consequences on the ultimate path of the story.\n\nThe depth of gameplay consists of exploring different choices and seeing how they pan out; doing so will allow you unlock all the “stamps,” (read: in-game achievements).  There are various branching-points to the narrative that can be explored; but ultimately nothing drastically different really happens.  The game has a “day-rewind” feature which can be used to rewind the story to certain points and then explore different choices— without having to start the game over entirely.  Nevertheless, you will probably need to restart the story entirely a few times if you want to really see all the different paths and unlock all the achievements.  The feature works well with the quirky nature of the game.  Having said that, I still personally would have rather seen a handful of save slots where you can make your own “rewind” points, rather than being at the mercy of the game’s; but the “day-rewind” feature does help contribute to the overall identity of Dyscourse.\n\nThe peculiar art style, the catchy music, the mumble-language voice acting, the silly dialogue, and the eccentric characters all mesh together and contribute to the quirkiness at the heart of the game.  It is these qualities that make the game enjoyable.  The actual story is pretty bland and played out; but that potential sour point is definitely bailed out by the entertaining style in which it is told.  The idiosyncratic characters and their interesting backstories also contribute positively to the overall experience.\n\nI would say Dyscourse would mostly appeal to someone who enjoys choose-your-adventure narratives and who will enjoy a quirky experience centered almost entirely around storytelling.  There aren’t really any puzzles to solve, and there isn’t really any thinking required.  If that sounds like your kind of thing: check out Dyscourse.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","May 17, 2015","true","7.2"," 59 of 70 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","59","70","0","6"

Done well, it can be really engaging, and provide a lot of replay value in going back and finding different outcomes.\n\nUnfortunately, this one didn't really resonate with me.  On a mechanical level, the game is fine, with frequent decisions (some timed) that appear to have a substantial impact on the narrative.  It's the narrative itself I take issue with -- the characterization is very one-dimensional, with each character serving as a simple stereotype.\n\nA bit of personality shorthand is fine for a short game, but these characters are mere caricatures, where every single line is a repeat of their one overriding personality trait.  It makes the game farcical, which removes a lot of (well, all of) the weight from the decisions; when someone gets hurt or killed, it's difficult to sympathize when everything they've said to that point has been the same exaggerated characteristic over and over again.  Couple this with humor that borders on slapstick and emotional responses that seem sociopathic and it's hard to take seriously.\n\nTo me, for a game like this to work, the decisions have to be something I care about -- the tension comes from wanting to make the correct decision.  Unfortunately, the relative silliness on display here in combination with the flat characters means that ten minutes in the decisions start feeling fairly arbitrary as I click through for my ending.","December 3, 2015","false","0.6"," 63 of 81 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","63","81","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/234920/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nDyscourse is an interactive choose your own story. Literally every single choice you make in this game has a consequence, and most of the time, it ends up being a horrific consequence. The main character is a art college graduate, who now works in a coffee shop. You were in a plane crash while traveling to an art event, and you meet five other stranded survivors along the way.\n\nThe game play is very point and click adventure, only that you can roam around each scene without being restricted to just clicking on interactive objects. This gives you the opportunity to explore this beautifully crafted stylized world that has been created. Talking with the other survivors broadens your knowledge of the crash and their circumstances, you will form your own personal opinions about them, and your feelings towards them will change as you play through the story.\n\nI wasn't kidding about every choice making a difference in this game, selecting a different choice will result in your ending being different to everyone else's. Some of the responses are timed forcing you to make an instinct decision while others you have the time to ponder your choice.\n\nThere is no real difficulty to be seen in Dyscourse, you will finish the game eventually, it's more about playing the game for the store behind it - and it's not just about finishing the game, there are tons of different endings, different story plots to be found in this game. You can play it ten times and still have a completely different story and ending each time. I have only finished one playthrough at the time of writing this review. One run through the story takes about one hour, so given that there are at least another nine to experience, you are looking at at least ten hours of unique content.\n\nAnother technically well made game, zero issues running the game. You can choose to lower the graphical options if you desire, but the game could very well be ran on a potato if you wanted.\n\nNow, excuse me while I have another play through this awesome choose your own adventure game!\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I thoroughly enjoyed combing through each path to unlock the variations of each possible ending. I found myself often looking back in time at least 2 or 3 times per playthrough to find out what went wrong. With that said, a lot can go wrong (and that's a good thing). Small details matter in this game especially if you want to aim for 100% of the achievements. I also want to note that the art style is very easy on the eyes. The characters dialogue is also well-written. Personally, Steve was my favorite out of the group with his bleak outlook on life and his trusty stapler.\n\nIf you want something to compare it to, I'd say it is like a slightly longer and more evolved 'Monster Loves You'. I definitely recommend this game for those who enjoy adventure games. Even if you don't normally play adventure games, this is actually a good starting point for the genre.","March 31, 2015","true","15.1"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","29","33","3","0"

Every moment in the game I feel nervous and eerie and the amount of outcomes and choices are so hearttearing. The characters a realistic and have their pros and cons, there is no one character that is perfect or evil.. which I love because they're not cliche. For instance one guy is super nice but is always paranoid and it gets annoying, one lady is kind but doesnt make the right choice and it a bit of a critic. The timer when you make choices also adds to the tension and is great, after every choice you instantly feel like you made the wrong one which was perfectly done. The varity of deaths are also really cool and it has an amazing amount of reply value, I want to reply it to get every single outcome.\n\nThe middle:\n\nThere is some stuff to say in the middle, the beginning is pretty aburpt and i'm not sure how I feel about it.. it doesnt pull you in the first five minutes of playing and takes awhile. The puzzles are generally simple which is a con and a pro, there was only one puzzle I struggled with and it was unique which was good, so the puzzles are unique but simple. I'm also mixed on the soundtrack, it was good but I feel like if the devs went a little further on the soundtrack it could have improved the game.\n\nThe cons:\n\nI actually dont have a lot of cons, I wish they did voice acting instead of mumbling and exploring your area can be fustrating sometimes because the controls can make it awkward to move around. Sometimes the choices confuse me though, for instance I gave food to one lady one day and didnt give her food another day and then she died from starving.\n\nOverall: Overall this game is solid, if you enjoy games about choices and point & clicks this is for you.  I'd give it a solid 8/10.","March 25, 2015","true","5.0"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","33","41","0","3"

I tried my hardest. I guess the best way to break down my distaste for it would be to list the Pros and Cons.\n\nPro:\nInteresting art style: The game looks fairly nice. It won't blow you away with graphics, animations, or character designs... but the art style itself is a change of pace from what one would typically see.\n\nSoundtrack: Whatever else I may say about this game won't detract from the fact that it has a pretty stellar soundtrack. I always enjoyed what I was hearing in regards to that.\n\nDisky: There is one twist ending that made me kind of chuckle. I'll give that due props.\n\nCons:\nTerrible Characters: I disliked every single character in this game, passionately. For a strictly story driven game like this, that is a cardinal sin. All of the characters were hyperbolic annoying familiars of one character stereotype or another. And since they all spend the entire campaign b--ching, whining, complaining, fighting with each other, and generally failing at whatever task you delegate to them (though there were some successes in that regard), I found it very hard to find any character that I could truly align myself with.\n\nAbsence of Gameplay: Its pretty tough to call this game a game, there isn't really anything game-like involved with it. Most of the time you are crawling through dialog, and in those rare moments when you can control a character, you have an extremely limited range of movement within a restricted area, and your actions are only ever temporarily extended beyond doing nothing into picking up a couple of objects. Once you pick up those objects though, you're done "playing" anything game-like here. Its back to the story. Which would be fine and all, were it not for the above grievance combined with the below...\n\nAbsence of Choices: The game bills itself as a Choose Your Own Adventure style game, and I dig that. But for a game whose focus is on story and choices, you don't seem to have a whole lot of decision points. You make a choice here and there and then spend the rest of the time watching everybody react to those choices. Sometimes, the distance between making a decision on something is so large that I forgot what kind of game I was playing for a bit. Its really like an elongated cutscene. When you get to the moments where you make decisions, most of the time they are pretty milquetoast (choose who finds the water, choose who gets to eat, etc). For a game with interest points far and few between, you'd think they would make all the decisions you would have to make be a bit more.... exciting. I went to look at other story driven mobile games just to compare, because I felt I wasn't being fair to Dyscourse with my expectations. I played a story driven game on iOS where every other sentence my character said was a decision point; I had the ability within the game to completely drive the conversation, and as such, the direction of the story. More to the point, even the minor choices I made felt like they carried more weight; they informed my character and allowed me to respond to situations the way I would respond. It may be unfair to compare to Dyscourse, but for a game devoid of any real gameplay and focusing on story and choices, I could have certainly used more. A lot more.\n\nPetty Storytelling: There were a number of times in the game where the storytelling just felt.... petty. For instance (Spoiler Alert, I guess...), there was a moment I encountered on a mountain where I had found 3 eggs in a nest off of the cliff. I was able to get two of them, but couldn't get the 3rd. With 3 of us in the party, I had to make a decision: who gets to eat these two eggs? Well, one of the dialog choices presented to you is "All 3 of us will share the eggs", which is an easy thing to do with eggs. But then you are told "No we can't do that, you must choose between 2 of the 3" for no real reason whatsoever. Its obviously a Sofie's Choice moment, choosing who will live and who will die. The petty part is, I had made great strides getting to this point in the game without any characters dying, and I was literally on the last night before rescue. There was NO reason for anyone to die other than the game just said "Nope someone's dying lol". What am I playing this for? This was only 1 of several examples within this game.\n\nDull: All in all, the game is just dull. The story is horrendously generic (plane crash, desert island, etc), and none of the characters to a lick to improve on that. As stated earlier, they are all annoying characters. Add to that, they all speak Simlish. Not normally something I would say is a bad thing, but when you have annoying characters in a dull game talking about dull things (do I really care about George and Jolene's marriage?), the Charlie-Brown-teacher-wompwomp effect only helps to underscore the appropriate level of attention I end up paying to the whole thing. Wompwompwompwompwhatever lets move this along so I can get to the next decision point.\n\nShort: Maybe this should be a positive considering my feelings on this game, but for a 15 dollar "game" of nothing, being able to complete it in less than an hour seems... borderline criminal. That iOS game I mentioned earlier provided me a much more robust storytelling and decision making experience at the same length, for free (for the first episode, the 2nd costing about 2 bucks, which is still substantially cheaper than this). Why is this game so short? Its not at all worth 15 bucks for the litany of reasons listed above, but even ignoring all that, 15 bucks for less than an hour of playtime is a steep, steep price to pay. Is this an early access game? No no, that's not a good excuse. I've poured countless hours into Darkest Dungeon and other early access titles. I just don't get it. Maybe the lame, rote, predictable, cliched, boring story just doesn't lend itself to a long lifespan of playability. Whatever the case may be, its a quick burn, so be prepared for that.\n\nEnding: I don't really want to spoil the ending.... suffice to say that if you like looking at corkboards, you're in for a grand treat.\n\nOVERALL: I cannot NOT recommend this "game" enough. I am honestly completely baffled and dumbfounded by the positive reviews its been getting. I don't get it at all, not even a little bit. I can usually understand one way or another how popular games I don't like are at least popular with others. For Dyscourse? Its as much a mystery to me as the island itself.","April 14, 2015","false","3.0"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","33","43","0","2"

There's some funny choices you can make especially in the later stages of the main campaign heh and it is fun to explore different outcomes. Don't feel stressed and feel like going back to main menu to try and reverse your changes on your first playthrough because once your story comes to an end you unlock "Day rewind" so you can just rewind your save to a certain morning and then try different things and see if you can get more of the achievements. Some of them are hilarious like Disktatorship. :P\n\n***NOTE! I don't know why my review doesn't say "Early Access" but it is since the game isn't out yet***\n\nHeyyo, a really neat game by Owlchemy Labs. So far I enjoyed the limited early access... waiting to see what the future holds for this one.\n\nTo extend my review? It's essentially a game of choices. You make a choice and your group either benefits or dies... It's very much like an adventure game kind of like Walking Dead by Telltale games, where forgetting something important or favoring one action over another will have consequences. It's so far very short but very promising.\n\nRight away you'll notice one of the things that sticks out about Dyscourse is the art style. I saw that on the Kickstarter campaign and was definitely interested. If you wanna learn more about Dyscourse? Maybe check out the Kickstarter page. It'll give you a little more info than what I can cram in here. :P\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/owlchemylabs/dyscourse-survivors-choose-wisely\n\nOwlchemy labs has made a really neat game in the past that you may or may not know of.. Smuggle Truck... which was banned from iOS devices lol, so they re-released a version with teddy bears called Snuggle Truck. That is a crazy fun little game about speed runs and trying to prevent illegal immigrants or Teddy bears depending on your version from falling out of the back of the truck as you try to race across the American boarder, or into the Zoo if you're playing Snuggle truck.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/recommended/234920/","fleskesvor","flesk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/","797 products in account","Story and gameplay\nThe story starts off when a passenger of Dysast Air, Rita Locket, wakes up on a deserted island after a crash landing. She soon comes across the other remaining survivors, and together the group of six must find a way to survive; and hopefully make it off the island.\n\nDyscourse is marketed as an interactive choose-your-own-adventure, and after spending some time with the game, it feels like a fitting description. The most prominent game mechanic is the many choices you're presented with, which you respond to by selecting one of two or more dialogue style options. Of these choices, the most basic ones are selecting a group of people to perform a specific task or choosing your next destination, but there are more and different variations on this concept. One is the action choices, which have a time limit and can be triggered by things like being attacked by wild animals or being trapped by fire. There are also other, less frequent types of choices and a few of them are very puzzle oriented.\n\nDuring the game you get some limited conversation opportunities with the other members of your group. I've talked to and started digging into the stories of some, but so far it feels like I've only scratched the surface. It's apparent that care has gone into fleshing out the backstories of the characters, and I'm curious to learn more about them. It's not straight-forward, as the timing isn't always right for a talk, and you might not even get another chance, as death is always imminent on the island.\n\nAs you make choices, the game starts branching out. Often as a very direct and noticeable consequence of your choices, but the effects of an early choice can sometimes take a while to unfold and it's not always apparent what causes certain events to take place. During the first few days the main story branches won't branch out far, and you'll go through the same main events. Though when you get to a certain point in the game, there are three main paths you can choose between, which each take the story in very different directions.\n\nImpressions\nSomething I really like with the game is the day rewind feature. It is available from the menu when continuing a game and gives you a nice visual representation of the status of your survivors, including their injuries. Using it you can step back through all the days you've survived so far and start over from any of the previous days. Note that doing so will overwrite any progress after the point you choose, but if you feel like you've screwed up your current playthrough, you'll get a chance to attempt to improve the situation. I didn't touch this feature at all on my first run of the game, but I used it several times on my second playthrough and I found that some of the choices you make can have a pretty significant effect on which locations you'll see, how the story unfolds, and ultimately who survives.\n\nI have played through the game two times so far and I'm currently on my third playthrough. Getting to the end took me about an hour both times, and the playthroughs were surprisingly different.\n\nAt the end of each playthrough you're presented with a bulletin board with various clippings related to the members of the group. These vary a bit depending on how the story unfolds, and they act as a nice wrap-up of your playthrough. The most prominent element on this bulletin board is the newspaper frontpage with a headline covering the incident, where you'll see character portraits for each member of the group, with a short text describing their fates.\n\nOn the technical side, I haven't had any major issues while playing the Linux version of the game, except that on my first session with the game the desktop cursor remained visible in-game. The cursor was also locked to the center of the screen, something that still is an issue while Alt+Tab-ing out of the game. I haven't seen the cursor in-game on subsequent sessions and opening up the Steam overlay unfreezes the cursor on Alt+Tab, so for me these are minor issues. I have reported this as a bug through the handy in-game bug report form.\n\nConclusion\nAll in all, I'm enjoying the game so far, and though there are some repeated conversations and events, I find that there are still many things to explore. I'm also curious to find a way to escape the island without anyone dying or getting seriously injured; something that has turned out to be pretty challenging so far. The game is not by any means as punishing as the somewhat similiar Gods Will Be Watching though, and should have a much bigger appeal to casual gamers.\n\nNote, this is a small rewrite of a review I wrote for GamingOnLinux.com: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/casual-survival-adventure-dyscourse-is-now-available-our-review-of-the-game.5157","March 26, 2015","true","4.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

And yes, there are a lot of different endings. But does it matter in the end?\n\nLet me just say that the first playthrough was a lot of fun. I carefully chose my decision and there were very major consequences for each of them.\n\nAfter the first playthrough? After, you notice how some of your choices have unexpected consequences that no one could predict, which really makes your choices matter less.  One example was tasking one of my companion to do a menial job, and he overreacts and hurts himself. How was I suppose to predict that?\n\nLastly, while there are different paths you can take, the ending depends on your  previous choices and items you found. That wouldn't be a problem, except, remember that part about the unexpected consequences? Basically, it boils down to luck. You make a choice and get an item A, while the opposite choice would you get item B. Then you choose path X or Z. If you take X, you can use item A, if you take Z, you can use item B. But you can't really predict if you're gonna need item A or B, or even what choice will get you which item. It's like choosing left or right, but if you choose left you get mauled by a bear, and if you choose right, a tiger claws your face. Different endings - check.","January 30","false","1.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The game is interesting in that every decision creates an action and therefore creates a reaction and it's fun to see how that unfolds throughout the game.\n\nThere are numerous endings and choices, but the game becomes extremely repetitive in order to see everything because you are not allowed to skip action-scenes or bypass large chunks of dialog so you find yourself sitting there seeing the same dialogue over and over.

A single playthrough is super-quick (under an hour), but it's pretty obvious from my single playthrough thus far that there's oodles of replayability.

Be forewarned that It's a VERY short game -- each playthrough took me about an hour on average? -- but that's not where its appeal lies. Its appeal is its endless replayability, and seeing what different results you can bring about. This is for people who love choose-your-own-adventure books, and perhaps wanted to see more branching/diverging endings from Telltale Games, or every game with the illusion of choice. Things do change drastically depending on what you do, and I'm still not even sure if I'll ever be able to get off the island with everyone alive. After playing it through enough times, you start to learn what the consequences of each action is, but there's enough variety that I'm still delighted so far.\n\nThere is hardly any gameplay. But if you like making decisions that affect story; funny dialogue; a unique art style; and getting too attached to your survivors as they perish, then you should play this game. There's a few emotional moments, too, as you learn about the other characters: if you speak to them enough and spend enough time with them, you slowly unravel details about their backstories. I still don't really have all of it, despite having played it so many times. More, more.","April 10, 2015","true","4.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The stylish artwork and music will help immerse the player into the struggles of these misfits. Quite a few choices are presented throughout the experience that change how you will ultimately leave the island, and who you will leave the island with (if any even survive). Some of these choices are time-sensitive and yield extreme or abrupt consequences; however, this adds to the replayability greatly.\n\nUnlike VNs, there are no save states, preventing the ability to observe the consequences and redo an impactful choice; however, upon achieving your first ending, you will be presented with the ability to perform a Day Rewind which essentially serves that purpose. There are 3 major endings to discover and death triggers to learn in order to keep your crew alive. The most noble or selfless choice is not always the best one.\n\nA couple random observations I wanted to take note of:\nThe game utilizes stereophonic sound (easily observed using headphones): the music emulates a 3d environment using multiple audio channels.\nAlthough this adventure will take you through multiple environments commonly seen on an island, at any point in time, the screen can seem a little restricting/claustrophobic.\nThe developers seemingly credited every single KIckstarter backer in the ending credits (so much text).\nEverything about the game is really well polished and smooth.\n==== Score ====Although there isn't as much depth as many other choice-based adventures, Dyscourse manages to create a lot of interest into the fates of these characters while moving at a fast pace.\n\nGood\n- 7/10","May 24","true","0.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

AWESOME. I love "low polys"-ish games ( I don't really have a better way to identify the style ) but this one is even better. it's a feast for the eyes. ( I particularly enjoy the nights. IMHO the graphics really shines there )\n\nThe game is extremely humorous. All of the principal characters ( which are 6 ) represent 6 different stereotypes: you have the depressed office worker, the conspiracy theorist, the nerd, the football mom ( she's not a mom, but that's the closest stereotype that I could think of :D ), the cheerful middle aged guy and finally there's the 25 years old protagonist. you will chuckle a lot!\n\nNow on the gameplay, You have really the freedom to act like you want. You want to impress the others as a hero? You want to act like an toxic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? You think the only way to survive is to keep the morale up? You can do all these things!\n\nI'm close to ending my first run and I'll be honest, I feel like I just scratched the surface. Differently than other story-driven games ( I'm looking at out Telltale ) the choices that you make really change the outcome of the story. You don't get just a couple of different talks where a npc is happier or more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at you. This makes the game EXTREMELY repayable.\n\nI can't help but suggest you to buy the game. It's a bit pricey, but the replayabilty value makes it worth in my opinions. It's definately a new and interesting experiment\n\nEach run is around 60/90 minutes long (that's what the devs told me), so you can try a lot of stuff out without having to play a ♥♥♥ long story each time!\n\nIF you want to see all my impressions on video form, feel free to check out my youtube series.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzbpcMCRYjU","March 25, 2015","true","2.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","0"

For such a short game (one playthrough takes an hour), its attention to detail and its ability to successfully flesh out six different characters with very different personalities and with only the most rudimentary voice acting (that's nevertheless really fitting to the whole format) is really, really commendable. The only thing that's possibly 'bad' about this game is that the ending feels kind of abrupt and certain sequences in the game can feel a bit repetitive once you've played through them once or twice, but for such a short game, and a game that's really, really good in every other way, that really isn't such a huge deal.

Play it through completely and you get the rewind ability which means that you can go back to specific days and change crucial decisions, it also more importantly means you can see the depreciation of all the characters as they slowly start to fall apart.\n\nExcellent game, although some of the moral choices not everyone in my household agreed with on my pursuit of a perfect game, but definitely worth a few hours of your time. The newspaper articles at the end are quite interesting too depending on who you save and don't save.\n\nYou also find yourself deliberately leaving certain people into the worst of fates as well, in my case it was poor Teddy, he died a lot for the others...\n\nAlso Disky is an utter Disktator if you let him be...","September 1, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

each with their own unique personalities and wildly different take on events formed the backbone of the series.\n\nThere was Hurley with his “cursed” numbers and Locke with his “blessed” legs.\nSawyer was a conman, Sayid was a torturer and Kate was  a murderer.\nEvery character had a past and a part to play on the island, but why am I reminiscing about LOST whilst I should be reviewing Dyscourse?\n\nWell, Dyscourse is set on a remote island, it starts just after a plane crash and it revolves around a group of very different characters as they struggle to survive the island and await rescue.\n\nSounds familiar doesn’t it?\n\n\nBossy Barista\n\nDyscourse places you in control of Rita, professional coffee maker and amateur plane crash survivor.\n\nShe  also seems to have the uncanny ability to convince total strangers to do what she tells them, which is handy as she quickly sets about fulfilling her unspoken Jack Sheppard  fantasies by taking charge of the group of stranded survivors  and bossing them around with varying degrees of success.\n\n\nDyscourse or Dat Course\n\nYou see, with Dyscourse, events almost never turn out the way you expect them too.\nThe very first decision you're faced with in the game involves two other survivors, some "evil crabs" and (If  you found it in the wreckage) a frying pan.\n\nWhich survivor you try to save from the perilous pincers and how you go about your daring rescue is up to you.\nIf you're armed with the frying pan you have the option of trying to squish the salty nippers into crab pâté, alternatively you could try shouting and waiving your arms around in a fierce display of anti-crab sentiment.\nWhoever you try to save and whatever method you choose is going to change how events unfold.\n\nYou 're decisions genuinely matter here, every choice you make will push the story in a new direction and the story you forge for yourself is what Dyscourse is all about.\n\n\nFireside Dyscussions\n\nThe game itself plays as a pretty simple point and click adventure,  most days begin and end with your band of survivors gathering in your camp to complain about how awful everything is and squabble about  what  the group should do next.\n\nIt's these conversations that form the backbone of Dyscourse as you listen to the bickering castaways and decide who to agree with and who, inevitably, to ♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nYour input will influence the upcoming events in both obvious and subtle ways, assigning tasks and choosing which errands to help out with yourself can lead to some pretty surprising outcomes creating a very entertaining (if somewhat short) story to enjoy.\n\n\nGoing the Dystance\n\nYou're probably going to get through a single play through of Dyscourse in less than 2 hours, maybe a lot less if you're in a hurry, but don't let that put you off, you will almost certainly play this game again, probably more than once, just to see the vastly different outcomes resulting from your choices.\n\nDifferent survivors will live and die, you'll explore different areas of the island, you'll discover  more about the insanely quirky characters stranded with you, I'd even go so far as to say you'll find your second play through a deeper, more fulfilling experience than your first.\n\n\nDystinctive Visuals\n\nThe graphics are as colourful as the characters and they're perfectly functional in their own stylised way, but they're not going to be to everyone's taste.\n\nWhatever you think of the "zany" cartoon graphics they undeniably fit the mood and feel of the title.\n\n\nDysparate Characters\n\nFrom the very beginning Dyscourse feels like your decisions really matter, events can change so dramatically based on your choices that you'll find yourself trying to anticipate what the possible outcomes might be, you'll also grow to like some characters more than others which is likely to affect your decision making process too.\n\nDon't go into Dyscourse expecting a great character driven piece of narrative though or you'll be disappointed, this is an indie game, it's not a Bioware title, for the most part the characters are two dimensional stereotypes,  you're not going to lose yourself in empathy with your fellow survivors, but there is enough depth there to pull you in a little, just enough to make you care who lives and who dies, and just like the island in the TV show LOST, there are plenty of opportunities in Dyscourse for your new friends to come to a sticky end.\n\n\nDysappointing Dyscovery\n\nAs I wrote earlier, Lost was a mind boggling show, the continual mystery of the bizarre events on the island kept everyone hooked, you had to keep watching to try and figure out what was going?\n\nThe sad thing is, it turned out that the writers didn’t know what was going on either; they had no master plan, no outline, and no grand conclusion to tie everything together.\n\nThey were just making it up as they went along, which was very evident in the shows final episodes.\n\nThe same can be said of my first play through of Dyscourse,  the unexpected events and offbeat characters kept me hooked, I had no idea where it was going to end and as far as my decision making goes, I was definitely making it up as I went along.\n\n\nDystilled Experience\n\nHowever, unlike Lost, which went on for far too long and had a controversial (and arguably disappointing) ending, Dyscourse provides a quick fix of Castaway goodness which never outstays its welcome. As for the ending, well, that’s pretty much up to you.\n\nDon’t like the way it turns out? Play through it again and make some different choices.\n\nIt might be a little Island but there’s a world of possibilities waiting for you.\n\nFor the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/dyscourse-review.html","December 12, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/234920/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The island is alive. It speaks to you through the actions of others, gauging your response, judging your actions. There is no right decision to make, because there is no decision to make at all. Your actions are predetermined and irrefutable, masked by choices you believe you are making independently but which only serve to dissuade you from discovering the truth of your fatalism. Every attempt to change your fate is little more than a divergence onto a different path leading to the same place, one you will either reach or die trying to find, death being your only truly disruptive action along your path to being rescued. But alas, the island refuses to allow you to die. Your companions may perish but you, you must live. Without you there is no story, no allusions to choice, no reason to continue moving forward. So you must begin again, repeating your path, altering what you can, performing your duty as participant in the islands grand performance. This, is Dyscourse, a tale of island survival and the folly of static choice.\n\nDyscourse is, structurally, a choose-your-own-adventure book repurposed as a mildly interactive paper-craft narrative experience. You play as Rita, a disillusioned barista now marooned upon a desert island after a fluke plane crash. Joining you are your fellow survivors, each with a personality large enough to support the interpersonal drama at the center of Dyscourse’s narrative. Whether through the ramblings of a paranoid ex-government conspiracy theorist, or the nihilistic reflections of a middle-aged office worker, Dyscourse excels in playing to the eccentric, reality TV nature of its plot, stirring up tragedy and disagreement among its cast so as to better position you, the default mediator, to make “meaningful narrative decisions”.\n\nAs a proof of concept, Dyscourse could be considered a success in how it has managed to craft an adventure in which you have some semblance of control over how the story unfolds. Your choices have a clear, dramatic effect on the overall narrative, and altering those decisions in repeated playthroughs can drastically influence the way that particular story unravels. But for all the ways Dyscourse attempts to make you believe that you are in control of, or at least have an active role in its narrative, it inevitably runs up against the same problem inherent to any game in which perceived player choice is privileged above everything else, that being that there can never be any true choice within a fixed environment.\n\nYour actions in Dyscourse are only meaningful insofar as they serve to position you upon a predetermined narrative pipeline, each decision effectively serving to open and close different paths until you arrive on one which is so narrow as to remove the possibility of choice altogether. You are never truly making a free choice, only deciding where the story goes, and it always has to go somewhere. Decisions in Dyscourse become more and more binary with each new playthrough as the more you understand about how its model of choice works, the more limiting and arbitrary it becomes. Every choice might have ramifications, but those ramifications are always system driven, decisions devolving into immovable numbers with no room to compromise. There will always be only enough to feed two, always only time enough to save three, always a binary choice between who lives and who dies.\n\nOne might argue that choose-your-own-adventure books, as a medium onto themselves, were never about choice but only participation. The point wasn’t so much to change the story so much as guide it, as within a finite number of pages there was never any illusion that you, the reader, could actually alter the words upon them. Choose-your-own-adventures then become predominately about seeing the ways the story can change if you follow different paths, how characters shift and plotlines diverge, as if to preemptively answer the “what ifs” of readers and give them a larger understanding of the ways a particular world and the characters within it function in relation to one another.\n\nIf we apply this way of thinking to Dyscourse its predetermined nature becomes less inherently frustrating, though no less arbitrary. It isn’t unreasonable for Dyscourse to have limits, but how it defines those boundaries often feels intentionally antagonistic for the sake of propelling the player forward. You are unable, for instance, to ever choose not to take action when presented with a choice. Even after building a SOS signal, you can’t merely wait along the coast to potentially be rescued. You instead much follow where the game points you, only getting a say insofar as you can attempt to control who lives and dies. If Dyscourse is wholly about emergent, player driven narratives, it seems odd that so many of the most important decisions within the game force the player’s hand.\n\nGames like Telltale’s The Walking Dead or Heavy Rain work as choice driven narratives primarily because they are framed first as interactive stories. Complete control isn’t expected, thus when the limits of your decisions become apparent they don’t serve to discount the impact you’ve had on the narrative as a whole. Dyscourse in comparison is wholly about the ways in which you are actively shaping the story’s progression. Its narrative is entirely in service to its mechanics, with it not mattering so much what your decisions lead to only that you were given a choice in the first place. This prioritizing of player over plot causes every outcome to feel weightless and inevitable. With no reason to care about these characters the narrative is little more than a checklist of variables. Action A produces effect B; characters X and Y survive in one run, character Z another.\n\nThere is some entertainment to be had in seeing how far you can push Dyscourse’s plot within what little freedom you have to direct it, but the novelty soon wears off when you are given no reason to care what the eventual effect may be. Why should I care if my group is rescued when their survival is merely the predetermined result of each of these actions? Why do I care if I am rescued at all when I have no way to go about doing anything but getting rescued? Dyscourse is a game of choice, but without a compelling reason to find meaning within these binary decisions, I was left with little reason to care about the outcome.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 18","false","3.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

I've played three times (and my sister played it half-way through once.) The thing is, the game lacks tention and can be really tedious--especially afer the first playthrough. The graphics are sweet, but not impressive--its like a children's cartoon. There are far too many points where you are waiting for nothing to happen. Like waiting while your charcter passes out water to other characters--no dialogue, no story bulding, not even something pretty to look at...just waiting. Some of the dialouge is funny, but not the majority\n\nIf anything can be said for it though (minus the first 15 minutes) the choices you make do actually change how the story is told and determine who lives and who dies. Unfortunately, I never felt strongly about any charcter or situation, so all the excitment that should have been in making a choice was lost.\n\nI guess the game is interesting, but not impressive and not exciting.

Depending on what you do, who you side with, and how you choose to survive (or not, as the case may be), you get different endings.\n\nBut you also find out more and more about the people you're trapped with as you go.\nAnd you find out even more at the end, based on who lives and who dies.\n\n$15 may seem kinda steep (and honestly, if it were the equivalent of only one book, it would be)\nBUT\nThere's a bit on the intro screen implying they're going to be making more stories for this as time goes on!\nI think that's definitely a reason to support it.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is smooth. Some parts are slow, surely, but important things are in text that help you make decisions later. And as people start to die and time goes on, you have to make faster and faster decisions, resulting in snap judgement calls that may not always be the best option...\n\nThe animation is pretty, albeit stylized, but I think that's a plus because I like highly stylized games (Binding of Isaac, Super Meatboy, and Don't Starve ring any bells?).\n\nOverall, I'm likely going to be playing it over and over again in attempts to try and get the alternate -- and hopefully find a perfect -- endings.\n\nEven if it's not really your thing, it's a nice game to have in your arsenal.\n\n10/10, would reccommend!","March 31, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Stranded on a desert island following a plane crash, your goal is to help your ragtag band of survivors... well, survive. Virtually every decision you make has its consequences, & you make a LOT of decisions. Friendships are formed & broken, sacrifices are made, people die... people ALWAYS die. But just who, & how many, is entirely in your hands.\n\nNo two playthroughs of this game are the same. That's not to say it doesn't sometimes get tedious to replay, but the achievement system in place is a really good motivator to unlock particular paths. Also you can "rewind" to any day in the story instead of having to start fresh every time you want to change something. It even shows you who died or was injured on each available day, making it easier to go back & "save" characters by making a different choice, if you're feeling guilty. I did sometimes find myself wishing for a "fast forward" button for many of the scenes, though -- things get a bit desperate when you're onto those last two or three achievements.\n\nI didn't like the artwork at first, but it grew on me (the backgrounds are great, but the character designs I'm still not fond of -- WHAT is Rita wearing & WHY does she have claws?). The writing is really entertaining; the humorous dialog combined with the cartoonish style definitely help to keep the mood light, even when you're dealing with stuff like murder & cannibalism. The voice acting is... well, it can be turned off, fortunately. As for the DLC story "Indie Island," it was way too meta for me; I only went through it once.\n\nOverall this is a clever, well-made game which really does hide a multitude of secrets.

If this option was available, I believe that the game would be a bit better than how it currently is. Without the skipping text option, it makes the game feel a bit tedious and time consuming in my opinion. The set path is not really something to dislike though it might be something that people might not like. I would have prefer if the game had a bit of randomness instead of a set choice, but I don't think it would really matter anyways since it's still an enjoyable and entertaining game.","February 25","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Legitmately, I love the writing and dialogue of all the characters but this group must be the most incompitent bunch of saps ever.

After my first playthrough I sat and stared at the final scene, reading all the newspaper snippings, and realizing how much I could have done to change how it turned out. I went into this game not expecting much and was absolutely blown away.\n\nSo here is a little summary:\n\nI woke up confused I searched around trying to find clues. Found Steve and Teddy. My stupid decision led to one getting hurt.\n\nWe went back to camp. I met the others. George and Jolene quickly became my favorite. I learned of there marriage issues and I felt for them. I made a vow then that I would get them both of the island. Which I did, but at much loss of life.\n\nMy first death came when a storm had rolled in. I had chosen to stay in fear that if we left we would have lost the supplies that so many of us got injured for.\n\nI woke up to a flood. Teddy was pinned under a tree with the waters rising fast. I swam out to grab the supplies instead of returning to help.\nTeddy drowned.\n\nWe moved inland, found a cave. And soon found a kitten, which Garrett named Bruce, I had hoped that Bruce would fill the empty whole in my heart where Teddy once sat. Garrett loved that cat to the point where he wanted to give it some of our rations. I disagreed. When I passed out the rations I chose George and Jolene because they seemed to be genuinely good people. Then I went to Steve. And then I thought... Garrett with his cuts and the bump on his head and him slowly becoming insane, he wouldn't be helpful for tommorow. "Since I'm scavenging I'll need the strength." I ate the last ration, feeling guilty immedietly...\n\nThe next day, since Steve wasn't getting along with everyone I brought him with me, I decided not to head back to shore in fear that I would have to come face to face with Teddy's dead corpse... and after a day out in the sun and the sight of seaguls, or vultures... I didn't want to have to relive my guilt. So I went to investigate the trees. Lucky I did because we were able to find valuable food. We spent the night out because it got to late.\n\nWhen we returned I noticed gasses coming out of the cave, seeing Jolene, George, and the kitten I was instantly relieved, but then I thought. Where is Garrett? I thought the game would try to make a joke like maybe Garrett farted and they had to leave the cave... but no, the reality was more dark. The cave filled with poisionous gas and Garrett, sinc e I didn't give him the rations, was too weak to make it out.\nGarrett died in his sleep.\n\nAnd in the confusion we lost the supplies in there too... so Teddy's and Garrett's death has been in vain.\n\nFeeling guilty and angry the next morning I had to come up with a plan to escape. I wanted to investigate the light offshore to honor Teddy after I ignored him and pushed all his opinions aside, only for him to die later that day... But I was reminded that it could have been just a shiny rock and since it was during day it seems plausible... also all three of us being on a raft would most likely be a death sentence if nothing was found. So I chose to head inland.\n\nDuring the long walk Jolene's dark side came to light and I regretted keeping her alive. Hearing her plan to kill Steve made me sick. I refused... but instantly I knew I should have threatened her... I decided to stick close to her side on the next foraging trip. When she approached Steve with a rock. I didn't attack her... I warned Steve, he ran... but unfortuantly right into an old tribal trap.\nSteve was impaled with a wooden log.\n\nI gained George's trust on the matter and we tied Jolene up. Continuing the walk we came across an old tribal camp. I locked Jolene away and me and George lived there for a couple months until one day a helicopter came. I convinced Geroge to help me signal the helicopter. And I deicided to bring Jolene back rather than leave her locked away to starve... She escaped her murder charges.\n\nIn the end  George and Jolene got divorced, George became a professional fisherman. Jolene told her lies about he event to everyone and anyone who'd listen. Even though Teddy had a memorial statue built for him and Garrett got a virtual memorial celebration for him I saw that Steve's company paid his family... but it wasn't even enough to pay for funeral exspenses.\n\nI started at the screen for a good ten minutes, thinking, regretting choices, and just feeling overall guilty.\n\nThis game has taken the expression "Hindsight is 20/20" to seriously. I will play this again and hopefully save my fellow survivors. I just need to figure out how.\n\n9/10, will contemplate life again.\n\nMy only downside to this game:\n\nSome things seems unrealistic to where for example, Teddy wanted help to build a SOS signal... but since no one was helping him he decided to not do it... but how hard is it to line up stones to for an SOS signal? Also the writing in this game is a bit cringy at time with Garrett... it feels like the devs are trying to hard for humor is some areas.\n\nAll that aside this game was very very well done and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to sit back and play a game that actually makes you think. I've not played a game in a while where I had to use my brain... I like this and I can't wait for more :)","April 10, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Only thing that would make this game worth the money is if you replay the game until you have gotten every possible outcome, and no one is going to do that for any other reason than Steam achievements or because you're planning on continuing until you have all the trading card drops.\n\nI was only a bit interested while doing my first playthrough of the main story.\nAnd to be honest, even in my first playthrough of the main story it got a little boring, actually, it got very boring.\nThe game claims to have replay ability but it doesn't unless you're entertained by reading the same lines of text 500 times.\n\nThis game is one of the 'Chose your own adventure' games where almost non of your choices have any impact on the game, even though the game claims that all choices matter. Only some choices have impact, and it's ovbious which ones they are.\nThe game is extremely repetitive and also has a lot of meaningless filler-content.\n\nYou also don't get to make a lot of choices, at least not reasonable ones. If you're stuck on an island, starving and while your scavenging for food and you come across a cat(in the middle of the desert for some reason), are you going to kill it and eat it so you don't die or are you going to let it live and contiune to starve to death? I think the answer is ovbious, yet you're not able to chose that ovbious answer.\n\nThe art style is great, yet the actual game does not hold up.\n\nThe game tries to be funny and silly, it is definetly silly, but funny? No. Neither is it entertaining and after 20 minutes of playing you will start to mindlessly click through the dialog to get to the end.\n\n\n4/10.\nGood concept, horribly executed.","January 4","false","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I'll let you decide who's whom.  This could be fun for 2 or maybe 3 trys to get everything but that's about it.\n\nAnd now the downside.  The story is fun, the graphics are fun, but after 4 hours it starts to get very old as you just try to get the last achieves.  And then there's the price. $17 CDN is a little steep for the 2 hours of fun your going to get and another 2-4 hours of achievement hunting.  I'm not saying it's not worth it, I'm just saying on a $ / hour fun basis there are better deals on Steam.\n\nWait till it's on sale (66%+) or in a bundle.

The story might be Cliche But its "Good Cliche" if that makes any sense. Most people also complain about charecter development and  can Kinda agree because i have had multiple moments where My party just fight each other but thats predictable with the diversity of each and every person all having their own "Life" I suppose you can say.\n\nThe Pros! - To be honest this game has a lot of areas it perfected and i cannot explain them all so here are some i guess.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth at 60fps on my 1.3Ghz LAPTOP! Thats rediculous and how it does that is beyond my knowlege. The second thing i love abut this game is the killer soundtrack, I dont have the delux edition and no i dont have the album but i have listened to all the songs on youtube and they where amazing and defenately made the moment in most dramatic scenes. I also love the charecter development in the game and how polished and perfected it is! Honestly I felt attached to most of them (Except the crazy one) And there is only 8 days. But my favourite thing about this game is the art style. Holy Sh*t does this game look amazing! The "Paper" Style of the whole game is Breath-taking, and the shadows, Oh the shadows they are perfect make my babies.\n\nThe Cons - It was hard but here they are!\n\nThe game is f*cking short as sh*it! It took me about 1 and a half hours to complete this game with two different endings, although i can excuse them for how good it is it still could have been another hour longer at best by adding another week. The charecters die just because of the plot which i found unlikable and i wish they would have lived longer and stayed on the island or something I dont know. I also dont like that even though its free the dlc "Indie island" Is EVEN SHORTER! I counted about half an hour! Thats faster than a bullet train! It is although free so i cant hate or whatever. :/\n\n\nIn Conclusion! - No spoilers here I promise\n\nWould i recommend this game? Yes i would, If it was cheeper. and thats all to say.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foehamner/recommended/234920/","Foehamner","Foehamner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foehamner/","498 products in account","The main feature of Dyscourse is decisions that drastically alter the way the story plays out.  To pull this off, a single playthrough is quite short (a couple hours max).  Fortunately, the decisions are engaging and the outcomes are very different so the replay value is very high and well-worth the time it takes.  I'm particularly fond of the ability to rewind a save file day by day to make different decisions without having to repetitively grind back to the same situation each time.  The game is dark but doesn't go out of its way to make you feel like every decision you make is a bad one, which I greatly appreciate.  Overall, this is my preffered method for doing a decision-driven game.

I spent less than 40 minutes in my first (and likely only) playthrough, and I don't have much desire to replay and try for different endings or more achievements. If you're a collector of those things you may enjoy this game, and I imagine that getting the "perfect" ending (assuming there is one) would take time and effort. That's time and effort I'm just not interested in giving, however. This game is mostly a snooze-fest. I only stayed awake because I had to constantly smash the spacebar. My fingers hurt.\n\nYour choices matter in this game, but they're highly illogical--you won't "outthink" this game. I played to Day 7 and my game then skipped forward to Day 62. Some people had died in the interim, in pointless and ridiculous ways. This game wanted to be a quirky fun comedy, and sadly, it just misses the mark for me. The dialogue is stilted and the options, though they matter, are bizarre and have far-reaching consequences. Also, random panther attacks.\n\nTL;DR: This review is longer than the actual game, and more interesting.","December 10, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

You could try it, well, for cute menus, or the quite unique feeling that talking with anyone always helps. But then the only real value of it comes after many replays. And there's really very, very little incentive to replay anything after you've done.

As the main character, you are set in charge as the alpha decision maker for a group of plane crash survivors.\nYou do this by being presented with a simplistic cost/consequence decision tree that makes it apparent very quickly that no matter your choices, not everyone is going to survive.\n\nHowever, despite it's indie-artistic charm, that's about where the appeal ends. On my first playthrough, I finished the game in about 30 minutes; taking the time to read each dialogue. My following seassion was pounded out in less than 15 as I found myself skipping through the dialogue simply due to lack of interest and the non-existant story. Your fellow survivors all speak in this mumble language (much like in the Sims) which also became an irritant. If there had been actual voice acting, perhaps that would have been enough to encourage one to listen to the dialogue.\n\nNormally titles like this on Steam I would expect to see in the range of $5 to $10. But at $16.99 CDN there is just simply nothing new or interesting enough here to warrant such a high price. Thankfully I picked this title up during a sale at 80% off, otherwise I would have been looking into the refund process.","December 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You play as Rita, a barista stranded on an island with five other survivors after a plane crash, and are put into the position of the group's "leader" in order to help yourself and the others survive.\nLet it be said at this point that I only played the game once, and  I appreciate that its charm would lie in the different playthroughs and outcomes, but I was put off of playing it again after the first playthrough and the extra mini game attached to it.\n\nFirst of all, the storyline is simple and engaging enough. Nothing narratively impressive. The characters are fun and colourful, but a little too archetyped to add any depth to the already relatively shallow narrative. The art style is nice. Refreshing art work, good design.\n\nWhy is the group following the player characters decisions? We get asked to decide for the group, but our character has in no way proven to be qualified to lead. Suddenly being asked to decide for this group of desperate survivors resonated with me as unrealistic and killed the emmersion. We are only in charge because we are the Player.\n\nThe decisions we get to make seem to reflect on relevant issues in the situation. Do we search the wreckage, or build a signal? do we look for food or water? Do we abandon base to search elsewhere? Whilst this issues are relatable and realistic, the outcomes of your decisions do not always reflect the players logical thinking. The game creates issues where in realty, a simple solution could have been found, and as a player I felt cheated by that.\nYou may for example decide to do one task with only half of the group, and the other will, for no particular reason, decide to do nothing all day. These often occuring non-issues result in death and major problems, but the player had no way of knowing how to deal with them better.\n\nCharacters die in these awkwardly created situations. The way the player character and the other survivors deal with this killed the immersion for me entirely. They simply don't care. As the dialogue goes, they might as well have gone: "oh what a shame. Whatever. Moving on,"\n\nThe mini game that comes with "Dyscourse" seems entirely unrelated, and appears to make ridiculous characters out of other indie game developers. Either I missed the point, or it is just bashing other devs.\n\nFor 15 euro, I could not recommend this game. It could have done a lot better with its original idea.","December 29, 2015","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I do feel like this is one those games that is a little over priced at the regular price its offered at. For $15 dollars you get a game that might last you 3 to 4 hours before you have exhausted all the choices in this  game. You can finish the first game in under one hour. I played 49minutes and finished it. I paid $1 dollar on the humble bundle weekly site for this game and 2 other games.\n\nThe trick is you can replay the entire game  to get a different ending. I did like the art and the sound of the game. The problem is the game is short and its price is  kind of on the high side. For the reg. price I really do not recommend this game. Their are just a lot better games out thier that offer more gameplay then this.\n\nThe game feels like a poor mans walking dead made by Telltale games  series without the compelling characters. The characters here are sort of one dimensional. Thats not to say they are not interesting they are but Telltale walking dead series did it a lot better. I also wished the adventure part and the choices you can make were more varied.\n\nI felt like the game could have been a lot deeper then what it is currently. Almost each character has one back story. I felt like the game could have expanded on that and had a lot more of them for each character. I would have also liked to have seen new characters rather then the paltry amount they have in game.  Its always the same 6 characters. It would have been cool to be able to unlock some other characters that you could have join your group in a new game. My opinon is its a good solid game that is over priced for what it offers compared to the other games like this. Namely the walking dead series that is selling on sale for 6 dollars for each season on sale.\n\nI like the game but the price is just crazy high at the regular price.  So Yes I do recommend this game if you can get it cheap.","December 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After the fun first playthrough (about 1 hour), I was not especially excited for a second time through. I did do a second playthrough and feel like I've gotten all I will out of it. So, this is 1-4 hours of gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is some dialog choices along with some very simple puzzle elements. The dialog presents you with some interesting choices. For example, deciding how to divide your party for various tasks or deciding which character to protect from an attacking animal. These choices seem a bit more developed and interesting than The Walking Dead's.\n\nUnfortunately, the results of my choices seemed pretty arbitrary. For example, when I protected one character from an animal attack, the result was that a completely unrelated character got harmed. Similarly, the interpersonal choices had pretty arbitrary and unimportant outcodes. Most of my dialog choices didn't produce any clear effect (something like "Teddy became intimidated" or "Steven suspects that I stole that food"), This made my choices feel nearly meaningless. It didn't  matter whether I was a demanding bully or a selfless enabler, because either way arbitrary things lead to an arbitrary outcome.\n\nI passed an happy hour playing Dyscourse. The game suggests some excellent possibilities for player choice in video games, but it didn't deliver very well on them.","August 16, 2015","false","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Cool concept just wasn't a fan of the execution.","July 22, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The short days (1 day consisted of feeding 2 people and sleeping) and poor story telling deterred me as a player.\n\nAll characters are incompetent and heavily dependent on the player. Likewise, the game relies on really long and pointless dialogue to progress. Never is there a time to get to know the survivors (ties in with poor storytelling.)","April 15, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Well, heres why.\nYou may be suprised to know, I love this game. I saw PewDiePie play it and had to get it for myself. The choices really do matter and really do affect the story quite dearly. For example, there are quite a few character deaths, but they can be prevented with the right choices. These characters that you saved with your choices can stick around til the end of the game, so it isnt a TellTale desicion where the character dies one or two episodes later. With all these positives, what could I possibly be giving Dyscouce a negitive review for? Well, I dont know if its just my computer, but, there is a scene in the game. This scene is quite a good scene, and frankly, I'd love to finish it. So what happens is, I am awoken by thunder and am alerted there is flooding going on near my tent. One of the characters, Teddy, suggests we leave our flooded site, and find new ground. The rest of the group, Steve(If you saved him) Garret(If you saved him) George(if you saved him) and Jolene(if you saved her) attempt to shut Teddy up. You have a choice to agree with Teddy and tell the group to pack up, or disagree with Teddy and stay. Now, I do not know what happens with either, because likewise, each will end up crashing my game with a few simple words "Rita go get a torch". If we stay, Teddy will be crushed by a tree and Rita, the player, will have to go get a torch. When going to get the torch however, my game will crash. Same goes with the other choice. If we attempt to leave, Jolene will tell me to get a torch. My game will crash on the way there. If the creator of the game sees this, please help me and I'd be happy to give you a wonderful review. A review this fantasitc  game deserves. BTW, I have a Windows 7 Laptop. Thank you.","July 16, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","2"

I did lose mostly all of the character ( Only 2 survive 3 if you count the kitty ) W\nat first 2 died with poison gas . Then I let the other sleep in sleeping bag and I slept on the group and I lost my hand Then at the end one died with hunger and the other one got shocked. All that I managed to save are a guy and a cat . Imagined to save them in 10 days ... But I did find the game a bit sad. At some point the game was a bit funny (Mostly with teddy and his conspiracies ). But I did manage to create a liking with some character (I loved George ). I did like the game but I felt like it lack decision. Yes each decision you made effected the game. But I felt their should of been more decisions ...\n\nI do recommend this game as it is fun But I did find that the price was a bit high. But Again that my opinion\n\n(This is my very first review.

Be prepred for lots and lots of lots of deaths and disappointments -- it will feel like your every choice is doomed to failure, no matter how logical or reasonable or COMMON-SENSICAL it may seem. Eventually, however, you'll learn what the game feels you "should" do and then you'll have some fun, learning about the different characters and the secrets of the island, and maybe even keeping a few of your fellow survivors alive.\n\nIs it rigid? Yes, definitely and to its detriment. Is it short? Yup! I played through it twice in under an hour.

During your playthroughs you'll eventually find some new items or paths to further explain the backstories of the characters. The biggest reason I even decided to play this was the art. It's beautiful.\n\nOn the other hand I didn't enjoy the music. It was very repetitive. Also, getting attached to the characters was pretty difficult. They don't try very hard to make you like them. But that's ok.\n\nYour "teammates" aren't very proficient in surviving, so if you want to have something done, SPOILER: do it yourself. Otherwise it'll get someone killed or they get nothing done.

Don't expect anything dramatic like telltale games, but the writing is nice and solid, and the game branches in really different directions depending on what you decide. The characters are not one-dimensional as you can think at first, but in order to findout more about all of them you'll definitely have to go through more than one playthrough\n\nI don't raccomend it at full price though, 'cause it's really short and in 6 hours (minus time I spent afk) I got all the achievements.\n\nUna trama ben scritta che si differenzia a seconda di quello che il giocatore sceglie, non drammatico come i giochi della telltale, ma vale sicuramente la pena giocarlo.

The story of the game itself is necessarily short due to the fact that it is "emergent" but ultimately I don't think I like having 100 different choices over 10 different choices in a more gripping, original story. The story is no more complex than a kids' cartoon, you and some other people are stranded on a desert island and have to survive. It feels more like a really nice looking and sounding tech demo.\n\nEasily worth the amount I paid for it in the Humble Bundle but I don't think I would buy it at full price. The decisions you make are incredibly arbitrary, much like a typical Choose Your Own Adventure book where what seems like the right choice will suddenly lead to tragedy for no reason. With choices like that, it's more like trial and error to get the best possible ending, as you will likely not get it on your first try because it's just so random.\n\nWhile I am sure a ton of work went into the game, it's really more like a mildly interesting diversion than something you would call incredible.","December 27, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the game is pretty much just a choose your own adventure/visual novel. You can move around and interact with one or two items, but otherwise its Click through the Dialogue then make a choice. Click through more dialague and make another choice. Meh. And while you can change your choices by replaying, the game is still way too short imo.

One play through won't take you long (less than 1 hour), but the addicting part is going back and figuring out all the different outcomes; how each individual choice shapes (or doesn't shape) the final outcome. The art style is unique, and gameplay is relaxed.
