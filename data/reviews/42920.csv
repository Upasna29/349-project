Maps. The maps are very beautiful, atmospheric, and very large.  There is lots of Bloom.  The zoom range is very dramatic, and there is lots of space for maneuver.  So much that you will usually have to make use of 2x and 4x time during the maneuver phase of the battles.\n2. RPG aspects and DLC.  There are magical items and other skills for you to upgrade your units, and the DLC has legendary and supernatural units.  I don't mind this, it adds a bit of spice to the game, but some of the historical wargame enthusiast reviewers don't like this aspect as much.\n\nCons:\n1. Campaign is not great.  You basically just unlock a series of maps, eventually seizing Bagdad as Richard Lionheart, and then reverse the process as Saladin.  There are some decisions to make along the way, but they still don't add up to what I would call a 'dynamic' campaign.\n2. DLC units do not appear in multiplayer.  If not for the multiplayer, the game would be a throwaway once you complete the campaigns.  Unfortunately the DLC units are annoyingly absent from the custom and multiplayer battle roster - a pity.\n3. BUGS.  There is a runtime error that has been widely reported, and supposedly this will not be fixed for Win7 64-bit systems.  I played through the whole crusader campaign only to not be able to complete the last battle.  Very disappointing indeed.\n4. Can't save battles.  The battles, being on very large maps, also take a long time (over 30 minutes of real time).  They can't be saved mid-battle.  That is all.\n\nI cannot recommend this to a casual player, but if you really like historical RTS and want a different perspective and style than the Total War series, then you might find this title interesting.","December 4, 2013","false","34.0"," 69 of 83 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","69","83","0","1"

I just finished the crusader campaign in this game (8 hours or so.) I didn't really expect to like this game as much as I have. It's kind of a RTS with no real base mechanics. Sort of like X-Com would be if the battles were fought RTS style with squads rather than tactical RPG.\nAnyways, this company also makes King Arthur which I've played a little bit of. King Arthur seems a bit slower to start, but looks to have more variety.\n\nOh, actually, this game is very similar to Dawn of War 2, another great game. Wait for it to go on sale and get it.","February 13, 2011","true","33.7"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","0"

But apparently, it crashes for many people with a 64 bit PC, so I find that excuse very hard to believe. It's probably more like they won't spend any more time and money going through all the code on this old title just to make it work on some modern machines.\n\nMy recommendation would be to download the demo first (on their own site, Gamershell, or Fileplanet, etc.) to see if it even works on you computer. IF it does, then it's actually not a bad game if you like the real time battles from Total War, with some RPG elements of its own.","October 2, 2015","false","13.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","4"

In Kings Crusade it is the crashing.  In King Arthur 1 its the bizzare campaign design that lets you get 10 to 20  hours into the game before you realize that you did the quests in the wrong order and cant complete the campaign. In KA 2 its the strangely sluggis frame rate even on new rigs and the fact that they made the strange decision to completely gut the kingdom managment aspect.","September 18, 2014","false","24.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

First To Those Who Say It's Broken Or Has Bugs, Shut Up And Learn More About Games Like This. It Isn't Brojen Simply Because You Can't Do The Missions Or Figure Out The Control And Layout To There Full Extent. The Game Runs Smoothly (Powerful Computer Prefered) And The Graphics Are Superb.\n\n2. I Bought The Full Collection Package Of This Game Back In September 2011. Never Had An Issue With It, Loved The Game (Not As Much As Total War Franchise But Still Really Well Made Game). It's A Great Medieval Themed Game That Gives You A Diverse Range Of Various Troops And Factions. Being An Avid Lover Of Games Of This Nature e.g. Total War, etc... I Would Say Its Up High On My List Of Games :)","February 8, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"
