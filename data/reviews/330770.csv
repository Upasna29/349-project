"http://steamcommunity.com/id/negiman4/recommended/330770/","negiman4","negiman4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/negiman4/","58 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI absolutely love the concept of this game. It's definitely tons of fun... for the first hour or so. My major problem is, there's really no diversity in the tracks, aside from them looking different. Each track still plays the exact same way and doesn't change. They feel very.... static to me. There's no real hazards in the levels, and the only way you can pass someone is if you time your speedups right and don't mess up, or wait for them to mess up. But as it stands right now, it's fairly easy to be that "perfect player" that hits all the speed boosts and doesn't mess up.\n\nI don't want to be that guy, but the tracks should be more engaging and dynamic, because they just feel bland. And this is just a suggestion, but why not add some special abilities to the vehicles, and the white aura thingies recharge said abilities? For example, let's say vehicle A's special ability is a minor speed boost, and vehicle B's ability is a knockback, and vehicle C's would be something like missiles that slow down a target in front of you? Something along those lines would definitely keep player retention. Of course, there would have to be a lot of balancing of vehicles to ensure fair play. But that's just it. In its current form, it's a novelty that is fun for about an hour or two. But after that, it becomes incredibly dull. You've got the formula down, now you just need to figure out how to keep player retention, so that people will want to play for hours on end.\n\nI do love everything else about this game; it reminds me of this weird techno-motorcycle game I used to play on the N64. As bland as the gameplay is, the graphics are beautiful. The levels really feel alive, like when asteroids come wizzing past you as you're trying to pass the guy in front of you. I like how you can reverse gravity too, definitely a cool mechanic that needs to be utilized in a wider variety of scenarios. It looks very polished and refined, visually. I will give you guys credit for that.\n\nI'm not a fan of the game's soundtrack, but I can't really complain about it because it isn't that bad. Although I do wish it was more diverse. The soundtrack of any game is what really gets me immersed in the moment. For example in an RPG, where epic music plays on a huge boss fight with the choir singing and whatnot, and makes your hair stand up like you know you're about to have a great time. Soundtracks that can give me goosebumps like that are usually automatic likes for me. I like the techno theme this game brings, I just see a whole lot more potential than what's being presented. Throw in some dude shredding an electric guitar or something on one of em, or perhaps a solo violin segment on one of the levels with a more serene atomosphere, give it some flavor. Or who knows, maybe you can come up with something even more crazy that ends up working really well. But most importantly, a memorable track should have a discernible melody. Maybe that melody could be the game's leitmotif or something. Just some suggestions. I'm no expert.\n\nI realise this is still early access, which is why I'm writing this at all. Hopefully my thoughts will reach the developers this way. I'm going to not recommend this game for right now, simply because it feels sort of bland. But there's plenty of room for improvement. Spice the gameplay up a bit! Good luck!","March 7","false","2.5"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","50","56","0","6"

It's a crowd pleaser and something I can show that is actually interactive and a game. Lately I go to work and I start to fantisize about what kind of VR experience I want when I get home... I keep choosing the DEMO of Radial-G. The thrill I get out of the speed of this game is addicting. I finally caved in and bought the full game (early access) and I am not only not ecstatic  I did... I'm freaking out how much they have already improved it! It's F-Zero come to life! Anyway... I'm going back into VR.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kh4osX/recommended/330770/","kh4osX","khaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kh4osX/","1188 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGreat game, sorta like F-Zero except instead of being on a flat 2-dimensionalish track, you are on a round snake like track which you are free to move and rotate around.  Sorta think of a monorail which you can move freely around.  Unlike a standard racing track which you may slam against a side wall or guardrail, you are able to rotate freely around the track, allowing for a huge amount of racing space.  This creates a need for "driving" skill since unlike a traditional raceway there tends to be very little bottlenecking where you can fight aggressively against your opponents.\n\nInstead, you have to focus on maneuvering around the track, dodging slowdown shields and trying to hit every booster you can, in order to get your highest possible speed.\n\n\nIn it's current state, the game is very fun and feels polished, but there are few tracks and ships to choose from, which is to be expected from an early access title.  Due to the lack of "content" at this point, the races can become very repetitive.  As the game updates however, we should expect to see more added content, adding for a more unique experience each race.\n\nIf you are looking for a racer in which you can immerse yourself, and spend hours playing, look elsewhere for the moment.  If you are willing to take the slight lack of content built on top of a quality core and give it a test drive, this is a great title to look into.\n\nI personally look forward to keeping up with updates and trying out the new features as the game becomes more immersive with features, and hope others are willing to do the same.","December 14, 2014","true","2.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarcusTones/recommended/330770/","MarcusTones","Noah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarcusTones/","44 products in account","To the developers: I don't want you to be discouraged. VR is going to change the world, and I want skilled, creative developers to build a name for themselves from the start. This is just my opinion, and if you passionately disagree, then do what you think is best.\n\nTo the consumers: I understand that the market is small, and as such, VR games are relatively more expensive. That said, I still think $25 is too much for what this is. The tracks/race mechanics feel dated, the music wasn't gripping, and as a result, it just couldn't compete against the rest of my VR library. When I got in, I just kept asking "Why am I even trying to win?" Sure, to unlock the next levels (and ultimately the locked ships), but it felt like the game was wanting me to experience something beyond a simple arcade racing sim. Like it was telling me it had a backstory, when none was present.\n\nFor example: Price aside, this is just the importance of music. Holopoint, a VR archery game, is pretty simple and light on content, but the music is extremely complementary to the experience, making it a ton of fun. Granted, if they charged $25, I'd probably pass based on the content, but they didn't. They sold themselves as an arcade-style game, and they delivered on that very nicely.\n\nRadial-G's art direction was very nice, and the ships and cockpits were nicely detailed. With some changes, I could see myself rebuying this one for sure (suggestions below). It's not a mess of a game, it just feels incomplete in its current state.\n\nMaybe Radial-G is the most amazing game two hours into it, but half an hour in, it wasn't, and as a consumer, I just don't want to wait to find out. I have other games in my library that I'd rather play NOW. If I waited for every game that wasn't fun off the bat, I'd have wasted many hours of my life taking two hours to find out what I could take a half an hour to find out.\n\nWhat I would suggest, based on my own interests:\n1) It would have made it a lot more interesting for me if I got to see the other racers. Weird alien creatures, or seedy criminal-looking characters; something that leads you to inherently like or dislike your competitors based on your tastes, like the F-Zero games, for example.\n2) Music that just caused you to really worry about winning; something that made you feel like you're in an intense movie, you're the hero, and you have to win in that very moment.\n3) Some reason for me to really care about winning. Is there a bad guy who's the number one racer? Or maybe winning races earns me some cash to upgrade my ride and feel more invested in my career (considering how many races there were to unlock).\n\nTL;DR  It's not a bad title, but it just feels like it could use some extra depth for the price.","April 16","false","0.4"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","14","23","2","3"

Didn't like the cylinder track style racing.  Now I have Oculus Rift and now the developer has updated compatibility to work with latest runtime... Radial-G is impressive right from the first game screen where your large ship rotates slowly in the docking bay.  When you go to race, things are equally impressive.  Everything is true-to-life scale. The cockpit looks great and the futuristic scenery is very nice to look at.  Racing is pretty good.  It's a dizzyfying experience with twists, turns, inversions and general high speed racing mayhem.\n\nWas easy to setup control with my Saitek X52 Pro. Controls are reasonably responsive although it would be nice to see an adjustable deadzone control. It feels like there is some deadzone present that can't be removed.  I'm dead set against any deadzone in this day and age.\n\nWhen you play this game with Oculus Rift you really see the future of VR.  Total presence in the game world. Radial-G looks great on VR.  The racing is quite challenging.  I haven't seen any ship upgrade system yet though so maybe that's coming in the future?\n\nThe game runs reasonably well on my GTX 680 in VR.  There is the odd occassional stutter during a race but it's very short so doesn't impact gameplay too much.  This is the nature of early access but overall it's very playable.\n\nI hope Tammeka continue to develop this game and keep the VR support especially as we're very close to consumer Oculus and HTC Vive!","November 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","4"

It has fun tracks, a great environment and works great with the Oculus Rift (DK2 used).  If only other titles worked so seamlessly with it!\n\nIn its current state as of this review, there are 3 vehicles to choose from and 3 different tracks.  The vehicle choices seem cosmetic right now.  The tracks are all in the same asteroid/space setting.  It looks awesome and fits in well with the style.  Races consist of driving along a giant cable with the ability to rotate completely around it.  There are boosts scattered around the cable and depending on the race style, red gates to avoid that if hit, will greatly slow you down.  Races are a chaotic frenzy of rotating to catch boost pads and dodge gates, jumps and avoiding falling off the track when the cable splits.  With the rift, it just feels right and amazing.  It's dizzying in a good way.  Looking around the cockpit of the ship is cool.\n\nSuggestions for the future of the game:\n\n- More race types.  No gates and regular are excellent.  Death Race seemed very limited/short... I'm not sure I would play that mode again.\n\n- A weapons mode or power ups similar to mario kart or the like.\n\n- A no boost (no ship boost, no boost pads) mode to allow racers to really test their skill at navigating the track the most efficient way.\n\nIf you own a rift, you should own this game.  If you don't own a rift, you should still own this game (if you enjoy racing).\n","January 12, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It's easy for new Rifters to pick up but requires a lot of skill to drive it well. You truly get transported to other worlds all while screaming around a twisty tubular alien track. For driving I love Assetto Corsa but the menus take a little juggling. For flying it's DCS but there are issues with minor stutter and also menus. Radial-G is the total package. You fire it up, put on the Rift, and immerse in a really bizarre alien world to race around in. Simple but tons of fun. Again, highly recommended!\n\nOne thing to be aware of, though. I had my joystick plugged in and it had control of Radial-G instead of my game pad. The joystick might be great, but for this, I like the pad. Anyway, if you are having trouble with the controls, try unplugging any joysticks, wheels, or whatever, and see if that doesn't make it all better. I just saw a scathing review where a guy said the controls didn't work. I bet he had something else plugged in and the computer just saw the other controller first.","February 1, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I really the esthetics of the area the main menu is in. I've done the first tournament and a few single races. There seems to be plenty of content to sink hours in until your get enough of the game, the three rigs available at first are enough considering the complexity of the title. On the other hands, you never can have too much choice. Kudos for having a female character. I also like the cockpit view. It though to look at it while keep an eye on the race but assume it was made in consequence. I wish the shield status was easier to see though.\n\nGot confortable within a minute of racing, then felt great, engaged and immersed.\n\nOther notes: I would've liked if driver hands would animate a bit with speed as it currently feels a bit static in the cockpit. Too much movement would be annoying but a little something would be nice. Like a thumb movement proportionnal to the rigs' speed (like how you drive a vtt). I found the use of shield and it's current state a bit unclear.\n\nOtherwise, fun stuff!","April 13","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I actually went through with testing the actual game instead of judging it on its cover, but it still feels the same after a handful of races with a few ships : this game looks and feels cheap.\n\nThe trailer made me think it could be like a not so hard but slick racing game. I had seen previews and hands on online, obviously focused on the VR aspect of the game. Anyone who's ever played a Wip3out game inside the cockpit or Ballistics knows how intense the experience can become with a VR headset. Being a fan of the later, I was hyped, hooked, or whatever...\n\nSo here I am, and here it is.\n\nThe game itself is OK at best. Nothing like a good old face strecher heart pumping techno blasting awesome futuristic suicidal speedy racing game, but... like "OK, that will do for now".\n\nI can't comment on the VR aspect off the game, though I will say that if playing it VR is the only way to make it really enjoyable and unforgettable, that means that we're still in early relationship with VR and once everything sets up, we'll  broke up and part ways, thinking that was a stupid idea to blast 900€ on a VR headset just for "that". Racing games can be awesome and awful for numberous reasons, none of which have anything to do with the existence of a headset on your head.\n\nIf the game is no good without VR, it is no good with it. Again, wait 'till the VR hype calms down, and look at your games for what they really are.\n\nIn that case, we have an OK racing game, with a TERRIBLE menu design, and an overall bad taste/cheap feeling. Like if they had to rush it like hell so that they could meet with VR market deadlines (I suppose that's what happened, it wouldn't be a surprise).\n\nThe menus are bad in that sense each sub-level feels like it has been made by a different person, without considering talking to each other and agree on some sort of plan. Let's overlook the fact that it's ugly (no accounting for taste), it's just obviously lacking polish and design. If you enter career mode, you can choose a ship and the the type of racing (different ingame rules) and go for it, but if you enter single race mode, you choose your ship, then the track... and then here comes another menu, pretty much like a main menu, but inside the track... where you can also change your ship and choose track settings... what the... why isn't it like the other one ?\n\nAnd why on earth do I gain XP points for finishing a track ?! What for ?!\n\nLet's get this straight : if the game was ONLY about racing, like you just press Start and you immediatly start a race and then jump to the next one, without any menu or anything, it would be so much better than this version ! No XP, no clumsy options, no career mode (that I happen to broke/bug exploit just by going back to change my ship), no nothing. Just pure racing.\n\nSince it's a (big) polish issue, I suspect they can still patch it up and work it out, but history shows it won't happen. So in the time being, let's not recommend this game. Play it if you need your fix right now or if you're high up on VR sensations.\n\nOtherwise, don't.","March 28","false","1.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","1"

Back then the game was fairly unstable, but even back then when I COULD get it to run (on a 3 year old laptop built for home use, not gaming) it was really fun. Now I have a powerful gaming rig and a stable build of the game. And it's amazing.\n\nPros:\n\n- The concept is really unique and definitely enthralling.\n- The entire aesthetic compliments the gameplay, as well as being amazing on it's own.\n- This is the first racing game in years i've felt compelled to play.\n\nCon:\n- It's a bit of a nitpick, but still important to list that those who are more sensitive to motion sickness may want to steer away from this game.","October 5, 2015","true","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","2"

None of that bs you find in so many other games.\nI played a bit before using the Oculus to get a feel for the game in 2D as well. And it feels pretty good in either setup.\nBut the Oculus Rift does give you an advantage as you can look around and see what's coming.\n\nThis is THE game I'll be using to demo the Rift to friends and family from this point on.","January 18","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","3"

Reminds me so much of F-Zero from SNES and Gamcube! I'm hoping to see in the near future more ships, and possibly the ability to build your own ships, kind of like the ship building in F-Zero on Gamecube. I enjoy all the current tracks. Very challenging. It would also be great to see additional tracks that are not just cylindrical. Local 2-Player would also be awesome! Again, I love this game in Early Access, so I am very excited to see whats to come! Great job to all at Tammeka Games!

IMO it need some sort of combat so you can activate offensive/denfensive abilities to add some depth to the gameplay. Maybe more tracks that are not tubes but instead have edges you can fall off so breaking becomes a thing you need to do. Falls short of the VR wipeout I hoped it would have been.\n\nNot going to refund, I hope with updates the gameplay evolves.","May 9","false","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The tracks are fairly basic. Just differently twisted tubes with no special features except the backgrounds.\n2. There aren't any power-ups. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you aren't going to have power-ups, there has to be a way to pass your opponent. The only way you are going to pass anyone is if they mess up.\n3. The interface has no mouse control! For a PC game, you should a least be able to navigate the interface with a mouse - but instead they have you use the arrow keys.\nSo, buy this if you want, and maybe in the future there will be things like power-ups and interesting tracks. But in it's current state, and thhe state it looks like it will stay in, this game is definitely NOT RECCOMENDED.","April 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","6","15","2","1"
