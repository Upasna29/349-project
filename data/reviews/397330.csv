I used to play LBA 2 as a kid, so I imagine the original first one, was similar in gameplay and graphics. This enhanced version features higher resolution, widescreen, a zoom in and out funktion, native gamepad support, it works like a freaking charm, I would had never expected ever to play a LBA game again, let alone play the first one in 2015 but with a controller and with way better and intuitive gameplay. This how a re-release of an old game should be, I hope the devloper gains licenses to other old games and gives them the same tread. Thanks for this awesome pieace of gaming history!","October 20, 2015","true","2.6"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","54","62","3","0"

I did play the original many-many times and the lack of keyboard controls shocked me at first, but that shock was gone in about 5 minutes. The game works just fine with controller and even mouse, so it could be a point-and-click adventure.\n\nOtherwise, this is a gem. It still looks and sounds as good as I remember it when I was a child. Totally recommended!","October 20, 2015","true","10.0"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

Movement is mouse driven ONLY unless you have a game pad. The lack of keyboard movement with the arrow keys like in the original can cause many moments of rage, and makes for long work of puzzles that would normally take seconds. If you remember and love this game but lost the disks or just can't get it working on modern hardware, it's worth the reasonably low price. If nothing else it's worth it for the convenience of having it in your Steam library.\n\nI would strongly recommend to the developer that they patch in the keyboard control as soon as possible. It's going to be a showstopper for many.","October 20, 2015","true","5.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","1"

This review has been revised due to post-release changes to alleviate some of my and others concerns.\n\nIt's fantastic to finally see the original Little Big Adventure on Steam! The "Enhanced Edition" now available on Steam contains a port of the mobile version along with the original emulated in DosBox. I really recommend getting this version not due to the mobile port, but rather due to the original bundled herein.\n\nIf you have never heard of this games series before and do not intend on playing the mobile port there isn't much more to say; stop reading now and get this gem! You won't regret it.\n\nThe intended main attraction of this "Enhanced Edition" is unmistakenly a port of the mobile version for Android/iOS and as of writing this retains the controls established for said port. Contrary to the original which is controlled by keyboard alone this Steam version can only be played using either mouse or a gamepad. While not being my preferred way of playing this game the mouse works mostly alright but detracts from the way I feel this game is meant to be experienced. Gamepad controls are severly underworked and bugged at this time, where control of the character is snapped at strange angles.\n\nShowing evidence of misplaced priorities on part of the DotEmu team when porting this game from mobile to PC (read Steam), we can see that the main focus of this release has been a change of the aesthetics. I'm sorry to say but icons look like they've been made by a 12 year old trying out Photoshop for the first time and fails to retain the original feel of the game. The look of the menu have also been changed, having gone from the distinct LBA blue color we know and love to being gray and dull.\n\nNow don't let the two paragraphs above get you down. This game is still fantastic and truely unique, it's a must for any gamer who may have missed it up until this point. Just don't play the "Enhanced Edition" at this point in time and instead launch the original version.\n\nIt's also well worth noting that all DosBox releases of LBA have issue in common with mistimed audio tracks (music) and poor midi quality out of the box. Just make a search for how to fix this on the forum here on Steam or on GOG and you should be home free.","October 20, 2015","true","22.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","2"

The gameplay is great. You can interact with the environment to look for items, talk to people, fight enemies (or even friends, if you so desire) with your fists or a magic ball that bounces around, etc. The game world is very lively; every NPC (and the game has hundreds of them) is voiced, and have at least a couple of lines to say to you. Oh, and the NPCs have their own agendas, which is quite nice to observe.\n\nThe game has a semi-linear progression. The maps are actually big, and you can explore every nook and cranny of them. And you have an entire planet to explore. Certain locations in the game are initially blocked from us until we progress in the story, but after a while, you can go almost anywhere.\n\nThe graphics where amazing in 1994, and even though are a bit dated, still look quite nice today, at least the backgrounds. Everything is colorful, with lots of little details scattered around. The characters aren't very detailed, since they are in (quite ugly) 3D, but are very well animated, at least. The sound department is great. While the voice acting is cringe-worthy, the sound effects remind me of a cartoon, and are very fun to hear, and the musics are great (in CD quality, BTW). Lastly, the storyline is simple to understand, but interesting enough to keep you in the game until the end.\n\nThis Steam version comes in two flavors: the Enhanced version (based on the mobile version) and the original one (bundled with a pre-configured Dosbox).\n\nThis Enhanced port changed a few things. While the original version used tank controls (like Resident Evil), and could be controlled with the keyboard, this version only uses the mouse (and a few keyboard keys to center the camera, open inventory, etc). At first, I was confused, but after 5 minutes, it felt quite good. Just click AND HOLD anywhere on the screen to move, double click and hold to run, click Twinsen and drag to jump or throw the magic ball, etc. It's a bit weird, but manageable. I would rather have the original controls as an option, and I hope DotEmu add them in the future, but the game IS playable as it is.\n\nNot everything was changed for the worse, however. You now have a VERY GOOD zoom feature, and you can actually zoom out a lot, enabling you to see an entire area. Also, the new status bar is very helpful, and the save system that was broken on the original version was revamped.\n\n\nAnyway, its good to have this game on Steam. I recommend for the fans, and for anyone that likes action adventure games with lots of exploration elements. ^^\n\n\nAnd bonus points for DotEmu for bringing the original version as an option too. ^^","October 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"
