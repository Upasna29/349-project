It just needs optimization and bug fixes that's all.\n\nI also just want to say again how great it is that the developers are basically planning on turning this into not just one, but many games for the low price of $1. It's already a TPS & TDS, it's gonna be an FPS really soon, and they're also planning on adding mech modes, PvP modes, racing modes, campaigns that are inspired by other games (first campaign is inspired by DOOM apparently), Raids & Strikes, open world, and soooo much more.","April 24","true","3.5"," 857 of 903 people (95%) found this review helpful 314 people found this review funny","95","857","903","314","47"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neomeinx/recommended/407840/","Neomeinx","Neomeinx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neomeinx/","31 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nInspiring developers working on what is sure to be a great game.\nMan I love Trek. The same developers that made one of the absolute WORST games of 2012 (Orion: Dino Beatdown) are the same developers that have made an early access game that, if I were in the monetary position to do so, would support them all the way through.\n\nThese developers made fun of their own failures and came back with a highly appreciated game called Orion: Prelude. It saddens me that many people don't think of how great these developers are. They got beaten up twice, failing at a game and failing again at a Kickstarter project, but they have shown both times that they will keep trying, and when they do, the result is amazing. These guys clearly show no signs of giving up, and if you're one of devs reading this, I want you to know that there are people who look up to that as inspiration. I wish there were more people like you and your team making games for the world.\n\nAnd now we have a wave-based survival game known as: [ THE ORION PROJECT ]\n\nPROS\n+You are a space man, but not a run-of-the-mill spaceman, you are a spaceman that is sent to eliminate...\n\n+...DINOSAURS! Compsognathus, Deinonychus, Dilophosaurus, Rhamphorynchus, Allosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Triceratops, and Tyrannosaurus Rex!\n\n+ Alien creatures! Dinos aren't the only enemies you'll encounter. Some other baddies you'll run into after the first two waves or so are alien creatures such as the Jeckyl, the Kruger, and the Namor.\n\n+ Robotic antagonists. Every once in a while, there will be a wave where you may have to fight robot adversaries and a boss to get a bonus chest. The names (as stated by user Deligor and my personal in-game confirmation) of these robots are named Bones, a humaniod robot with a blaster, Orbs, the floating drones that fire grenades, and Grump, the large, humaniod robot boss with dual-wielding swords. Trek has not given out OFFICIAL names for the robots, and we have yet to see how they play out in the game's story/lore.\n\n+ An above average amount of classes with unique abilities: Assault, (who has a jet pack), Support, (who can set up a bubble that heals teammates), Recon (who can turn invisible), Pyro (who gets a flamethrower), Marksman (who can use thermal vision), Rocketeer (WHO GETS A ROCKET LAUNCHER), and my personal favorite, Tech (who can place a turret)!\n\n+ Absolutely beautiful graphics. Great textures, great lens flares/lighting, depth of field, and motion blur. This game doesn't look like early access, especially on "super high" settings.\n\n+ Fun online multiplayer. Playing with others online is SO much more fun than playing by yourself on solo. I've played several matches and everyone seems nice (helping new players out, asking and accepting other's parties, etc.), making the online experience all the more enjoyable!\n\n+ XP and Leveling up. Enough is said there. Kill dinos, get XP, level up, repeat.\n\n+ Crafting system. In both solo and multiplayer, when you kill dinosaurs and creatures, they will drop materials that you can craft into things like medkits and boosts. Some are exclusive to crafting and cannot be purchased in the shop.\n\n+ Skill tree. When you level up, you get one skill point to use on each of the three attributes: "character", "weaponry", and "miscellaneous". You need five total skill points if you want to obtain the skill you're working towards.\n\n+ Boosters and consumables. In the game, you can use the Trek (secondary premium currency) that you have bought (or gotten 20,000 through founder's access) to buy boosters in the shop (multiplayer only as far as I know) . The only boosters you can purchase are XP boosters, which are good if you're looking to complete a skill you've been working on. Consumables, such as medkits and shields, can be purchased with the game's easily obtainable currency known as ION.\n\n+ Many things planned for the future! more maps, an open world, no, an open GALAXY, mechs, more classes, more weapons, first-person mode, flying in space to planets and visiting cities in your own STARSHIP, LOCAL CO-OP, MORE DINOS, MORE CREATURES, MORE CUSTOMIZATION just to name a few. So many things are planned that I almost don't believe that these guys can finish it all in a year, yet, knowing these developers, I know they can and will do it.\n\n+ Improved camera movement.\n\n\nCONS\n- Minor bugs and iffy animation in third person.\n\n- They have a "play or pay" system. The game has two currencies:ION and Trek. You are either able to either play normally and earn ION or pay for Trek. The developers claim that there will be no pay wall, and Trek only gets you cosmetic things such as hats, cool-looking armor, etc. I am personally uncomfortable with this because of how many great games have become pay-to-win starting with the dual currencies. You could be buying hats now, but you could also be buying revives and renting OP guns in the future. I've seen paid currency destroy the best of games; free or not, which is why it is a concern I have with all games, especially early-access titles with a plentiful amount of potential.\n\nOpinionated Thoughts....\nI really like these developers. They seem to show no signs of giving up just because of too much negative feedback and failed projects. On a different note, the fact that they added dual currencies so early in development worries me. I feel like they should have waited until the full release, when it's only a dollar. (which would, I might add, be a more effective business strategy). But, if you purchase the founder's access, you get 20,000 bonus Trek, which actually gets you some neat-looking armor and hats (Founder's access event has ended). I have a bad feeling about it. Still, don't let it decide whether you purchase or not.\n\nSUMMARY\nAll-in-all, this is an early-access game that you definitely want in your library. The game is only one dollar and will continue to be a dollar even after the full launch in 2017. If you're looking for an early access title to support or just follow, here's one that will be worth your time!\n\n\nSide notes: So to anyone who has actually found this review, I may or may not be updating anymore because of how much effort it takes me, and everyone else to find my review. I wanted to cover all the details and spread the word about how wonderful David and his team are, but Valve changed the review system. No one's going to take the time to look for the most popular all-time reviews now that the more recent reviews are displayed instead. My time is essentially wasted by them doing so.\n\nThanks for screwing up the system, Valve. Now It's almost pointless to put forth effort on a review.\n\n~Neomeinx","April 27","true","15.8"," 119 of 126 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","119","126","7","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpyRaptor/recommended/407840/","SpyRaptor","Spy Raptor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpyRaptor/","308 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR: Great game but can be boring/repetitive, wouldn't pay full price.\n\nPROS:\n\n+Beautiful Graphics (Pretty well optimized compared to other games, with a 970 I get 50-60fps on Max settings. Although lowering in game settings doesn't hugely impact my frames.)\n+Dinosaurs (Dinosaurs are always awesome.)\n+Multiple Classes\n+RPG Elements (Skill Tree, Inventory/Looting System.)\n+Variety of enemies (Not to huge, but there are still some unique enemies.)\n+Bosses (2 I think?)\n+Side objectives (Still basically a normal wave, but you have to go somewhere to kill the enemies.)\n+Amazing Devs who respond to most users, frequently fix bugs and add content monthly.\n+Fun with friends\n+Nice, Clean Menus\n+Good Music\n\nCONS:\n\n-Music tends to be a bit wierd from time to time (Instantly goes from calm to heavy metal.)\n-Not as fun without friends\n-TL:DR: Very Easy, only difficult on hard or with more friends (more friends = higher difficult I think, not too sure). Even if the harvester manages to be destroyed, you have 3 minutes before it dies and you lose, and it only takes 10 seconds to repair it (Which can be done whilst moving around). If you get downed, you have to kill a few enemies before you die, and if you do, you are instantly revived with full health. You also have infinite lives, with about a 30 seconds respawn timer, which is enough time to respawn and fix the harvester. Also, the Magnum seems to be slightly over powered with good accuracy, kills most enemies in one hit (the bigger guys take a few more), the only downside being the slow projectile speed (on a magnum?) making it fairly difficult to kill the flying enemies. Sorry for the really long point, just felt I needed to point these out.\n-Most servers are American, meaning an AU player like myself would be lucky to find a server with a ping lower than 250. This also makes the gore pretty lame as there is a wierd delay when shooting the heads off. (You can't level if your not online, meaning even solo has bad ping)\n-Some aspects can be confusing (HUD, inventory, crafting) but there are tooltips (Which aren't the most helpful)\n-Only a few Maps\n-Only 2 Gamemodes (They are very similar, one is infinite survival whilst the other is waves.)\n-Although content is being added monthly, as of now, it only takes a few hours before you see most of what it has to offer.\n-All bullets look like slow moving glowing balls (Not a huge con, just not very fond of the style and I dislike how all weapons have the same projectiles, just different colours and speeds.\n\nSome extra points from recent updates and dev blogs:\n\n-Difficulty if much harder now if you play on hard, as the newly implemented level system can make the enemies a much more difficult.\n\n-The Developers where going to discontinue the game in a few months due to the game not as selling as well as they hoped, however the 90% off sale had funded them enough to promise a few more big updates (A 40 player hub to do quests, 2 vehicles, some maps, possibly first person and lots of tweaks to the gameplay)\n\n-Whoever purchasing the game before the game is discontinued and is reduced to $1, recieves all future guardians for free and 20,000 in game credits to buy vanity items (Like Orion: Prelude), those who purchase the game after it is reduced to $1 will have to pay $10 to any extra Guardians and will not recieve the credits.\n\nOverall: 8/10, Needs some balancing and fixing. The Devs are promising monthly content updates (New Map, New Character etc.)\nThanks for reading, any feedback is appreciated.","February 5","true","7.4"," 121 of 139 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","121","139","8","13"

I had made a suggestion in the forum, so I asked about it, and he confirmed that it will be in the next update with some other ideas the community had offered.\n\nAside from this game being oddly fun, I love that there's a group of people working on this game to make it work how we want, while pushing their own ideas further.\n\nMy only critique from last time was that I wanted to jump. Now I can jump, but it's bound to the same key as roll. I'm sure it will be fixed, but I lol'd when I was trying to figure out how to roll again.\n\nIt's not a perfect game by any means, but I still haven't touched my growing backlog of AAA games since getting into Guardians\n\n\n**Original Review - Version 1.3**\n\nI was given this game by a friend for a gaming event, and while I wasn't hooked right away, I kept coming back. Now I'm hooked.

You will shoot, stab, throw grenades, jetpack, cloak, mini teleport and regen your way to victory.\n\nThe current waves are quicker to blast through than what you remember from Orion Prelude and the action is more constant on these smaller maps.  It took me two or three rounds to get used to the game enough to master normal mode, but I had fun doing it, and eventually challenging hard, and even ridikulous modes with friends (spoiler: you won't survive round 1 of redik with a 4-person team.\n\nAfter you have played a few matches online you'll have built up a few points to spend on customising each of the three classes to your personal play-style.  This starts with simple options like do you want to move faster, while sprinting or aiming?  Or even faster recharging grenades?\n\nLater you will get more class specific perks, but these are likely to change.  A fully levelled up recon class could share cloaking with friends, but I believe now that they just suffer less damage if hit while cloaked.\n\nThere is fun to be had playing by yourself, working your way up the ranks to beating hard mode by yourself for the first time.  However the best of the game is having fun against increasing numbers of dinos in a larger team online.\nAll fighting for survival and trying to keep the squad and harvester alive.\n\nNumbers of dinos increase depending on how many players are on the server.  Best example of this was a friend bragging the he and a mate beat the game on highest redik difficulty in 2-player mode.  Then he attempted it in four-player with some n00bs (me!) and... it did not go well haha.\n\nI highly recommend this game.  The enemies are great to fight, and you will have a blast online no matter who you are playing with.

Also, this review will be updated more in the future when more updates roll out and improve the game.\n\n\nPros:\n\n+It's intense\n\n+Fatalities. Yes, you and the dinos can brutalize each other. For instance, Big-T (you know who that is) took a bite outta me, and then i cut a raptor's head off.\n\n+ Nice soundtrack\n\n+ It's good looking (Unreal Engine 4 <3)\n\n+ It's optimized for the most part. Better than most Game's in Early Access.\n\n+ The devs are active on the forums during the day, and respond to questions and feedback\n\n+ Dinosaurs. How could one NOT love a good game about Dinosaurs?\n\n+ You can now switch between Third Person & the usual Top-Down, Isometric view.\n\n+ They'll be updating the game every month with a new guardian, and more content. Maybe more performance optimizations here and there as well. (They're gonna optimize the game further this next patch!)\n\n+ This game now has a decent size playerbase!\n\n+ Slaughter is more fun than ever now. Especially now that the game is a little more popular. They even fixed a bug where the game would suddenly end after like 2-3 waves.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-There seem to be a small bug with the Third-Person aiming. Sometimes as you enter a game, your character will start slowly looking a certain direction. It can't be fixed in-game as far as i know, so to stop that from happening just disconnect from the game and start up a new one/rejoin the server you were in. (UPDATE: This happens when you open and close the Steam overlay)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOn that note, i still highly reccommend this game. It's fun even on solo, but co-op is where the real fun is! If you are gonna buy this game, and you like it, be sure to tell your friends about it. As stated above, it's really low on players, and this game has a LOT of potential to be "The Must own Shooter". If you get it now, you'll also get the full version when the game is finished, as well as the Special Edition coming out sometime next year too.\n\nAnd if you need more clarification about the devs, let me break it down for you.\n\nThese are the same devs that made ORION: Prelude. That game is finished and they aren't updating it anymore. They fixed pretty much a vast majority of the bugs and glitches the game had before and added new stuff in the process. They supported that game for 3 years even if it was released in a terrible state. Despite the criticism that game received at first, they still kept updating it and made it better overtime, which is why the rating went "Very Positive" from a previous "Mostly Negative".\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShQ3GBFI4KQ\n\nThey made a statement in this video they made stating that "Games can't fail, Only developers can." Only a dev like this would have the balls to openly admit their game sucked HARD at first, but then keep working on it anyways instead of ditching it and quitting game developement overall.\n\nThere's something you don't see in AAA developers nowadays!","January 6","true","12.3"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","3"

Light on story at the moment, but sounds like the plan for that will go above what action titles usually have.\n\nMost common complaint from others: "overhead view? They said 3rd person." There's a key to swap at any time, actually. Except in "Orbital Command" lobby, which is 3rd person only. I never had this problem of not noticing, since I always look over keybinds before jumping into a game, usually to make sure everything's how I'm used to it, but sometimes to see nifty non-standard things like this. If you like xbone controller instead of key+mouse, it's even easier since the layout is shown on load screens. Personally I use overhead more often anyhow. 3rd person (or upcoming 1st person) for getting dino attention from long distance, sniping from a mountain top, and mopping up flyers quicker, overhead for run-n-gun while dodging 30 raptors or trying not to get run over by giant sword-wielding robutts with attitude. (edit: the load screen only points to the directional pad for regen gun. Going into controller config, it does list one direction as regen, another as swap view, and another as inventory)\n\nPersonal complaints/concerns: 1. Orbital Command feels wonky compared to former menu-based system of getting into games. I'm sure it'll feel right as the open world and open galaxy modules happen though. 2. List of upcoming features seems overzealous, might bite off more than they can chew. They seem great at coming through so far, just.. wow that looks like a lot. 3. Bit of a wall at item level 400. Easy and normal can't drop higher. Hard should still scale past that point, but I can't initiate higher while wearing full 400. Insane I can start for dropping 450 or even 500, but it lives up to the name. "Redikulous" mode still lies beyond that, but frankly I'm scared how rediculous it will really be after trying Insane for just barely higher drops. Some day though. I probably just need to level up some more, get some more talent points thrown in. (edit: later same night posting this, got in a good group to farm Insane. Got enough ilvl 500 items to hit 483 average. Still can't start a Hard game for 450 or 500, so maybe Hard just doesn't have an 8th and 9th scale?)\n\nNot entirely sure what I got from "Founder's Status" other than a boost on premium currency, but even if coming in late it's probably going to feel like at least a $20-30 game. But with a $1 price tag, because Trek Industries is awesome like that.\n\nWouldn't worry too much about the premium currency either. Looks like it's just for cosmetic items and xp boosts. XP boost have a nice discount for buying more days at a time, and I'm having a blast levelling without them even though I have some currency laying around that I could use. And instead of that for percent increase on kill xp, there's always the xp scrolls gained through non-premium earned currency or crafting, which add a large chunk each time you use one. The wording when some of the new classes were patched in sounds like non-Founders may possibly end up having to buy them, but that still leaves good choice in the basic classes, and they're all balanced enough it couldn't really be called pay to win if that does indeed happen. Which still feels like a lot of "IF". And their official word so far is that it will only ever be for cosmetics (armor, recolor, pet, taunt) and that we will be able to convert the earned currency into the premium one anyhow. And have noticed already that earning in-game achievements earns nice chunks of it anyhow. As paranoid as I get about premium currency leading towards pay-to-win/paywall scenarios, these guys inspire confidence.","May 4","true","110.0"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","16","19","3","2"

I initially played it when it was called Orion: Dino Horde, so I never experienced the horror that was Orion: Dino Beatdown. Guardians of Orion is a completely different game from its predecessors. Prelude was a true FPS, whereas Guardians is a top-down arcade style shooter with a wonky 3rd person option. Guardians was clearly built and balanced around the top-down camera angle, and 3rd person was thrown in as an afterthought due to popular demand.\n\nThe best way to describe the difference between Prelude and Guardians is this: Prelude is to Call of Duty's Nazi Zombies as Guardians is to CoD's Dead Ops Arcade. I hope this clarifys for everyone exactly what kind of game Guardians is.\n\nNow, some people are going to be disappointed that Guardians isn't an FPS, but others will prefer the arcade style shooter. That's just up to your individual tastes.\n\nEDIT: Guardians of Orion will be featuring a first-person mode in the near future. (Spring 2016)\n\nThe core gameplay or Guardians is fun after playing a few matches, but I can imagine it getting very boring and repetitive after a short while. There are currently only 5 maps, 2 game modes, and a day/night option. Considering it is still in early access, I'm sure they will gradually release new maps and game modes, but as of now that is it.\n\nSomething I really enjoy about Guardians is the addition of a skill tree and crafting system. This helps make each class (Assault, Support, Recon. Tech, Pyro) feel much more unique, as they each level up individually and have their own unique skill trees. I have no experience with the crafting system yet, however I think that it will give players an incentive to grind the somewhat limited content in order to craft super cool weapons and items.\n\nI'm honestly a little confused and disappointed as to why they chose not to include either a campaign or a competitive versus game mode in Guardians. Most games draw success either from a compelling story mode, or an intense and addicting competitive scene. It is very difficult to retain player interest with only a co-op surivival arcade game. Perhaps those features are in the works, but if not I can't see myself spending more than 10 hours on this game, unless the crafting ends up being highly addicting!\n\nThe graphics are beautiful when you enter 3rd person mode, so again I'm a little confused as to why they chose a top-down camera angle to build the game around. I'd rather enjoy the graphics froms 3rd person, but it puts you at a massive disadvantage because you can't see flying enemies very well, and the tiny dinos are impossible to spot in the tall grass. Not to mention it is much harder to turn around in 3rd person quickly due to low sensitivity relative to top-down sensitivity.\n\nOne little teeny thing I really wish they would add is a "ready up" feature. I feel the down time between rounds is too long for most rounds, so if they had a voting system to immediately start the next round that would really reduce frustration and boredom, because you end up doing nothing for 10 minutes out of each game (1 minute down time between rounds x 10 rounds). *This feature was added to the game as of build 1.2.1, way to go Trek!*\n\nOverall, I give Guardians a 7/10 because the core gameplay is fun, but replay value is just not there at this point in time. It is on sale right now for $2 and I HIGHLY recommend buying it. However, when it returns to it's normal price of $20, I'd wait until they release more maps and game modes before spending that much on it.","February 6","true","3.0"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","23","33","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drunken_drake/recommended/407840/","drunken_drake","drunken_drake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drunken_drake/","422 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAt the moment I cannot give this game a favorable review.  I've supported Trek and Mr. Prassel in their previous attempts such as Orion: Prelude and such and even bought this game when it came out as Guardians of Orion.  The game was, at the start, littered with bugs rendering it unplayable for many people.  I stopped playing the game early on after Prassel got annoyed with some of the bug reports and basically said the problems were the users' faults and not his (that he basically wasn't going to spend time fixing the issue since it only affected a small portion of the community).  I came back months later after new updates to see if any of the issues were resolved.  Sadly, the game still has a million and one technical issues (including poor optimization for many PCs).  INSTEAD of fixing the issues, Trek and Prassel are pushing new content rather than addressing problems.  A few members of the community have even narrowed down certain problems so that any fix would be easier to spot but there has been no response from the development team whether on the forums or in email.\n\nTechnical issues can be fixed but the lack of response and childish behavior from the development team push this game into a "thumbs down" for the time being.  If things change I might possibly revert that.\n\n\nEdit:  Mr. Prassel's comment regarding specificity to this review shall be obliged below.  I'll try to be as concise as possible.\n\nFirst, regarding technical support.  While I realize that it makes technical support's job easier to know everyone's tech specs, this is almost impossible when a forum is created asking for bug reports (even if it specifies that those specs are needed).  When a person comes to the team with a problem, regardless of how aggravated the team may be, respond simply and with a "copy/pasted" answer such as, "Please submit your technical specifications and we'll review your issue."  Do not just ignore people; that applies to both forum posts and any emails received.  In fact, in a post from Dec 16th, 2015 Mr. Prassel stated anyone couldcontact him with this [a problem in that thread] or any problem at: [won't post the email here].  I and a few others have personally sent emails to Trek and Mr. Prassel but received no response.  Perhaps the emails have been overlooked, sent to spam, etc...  These things happen and I will acknowledge that is a possibility.\n\nSecond, the following threads show various issues that have been fixed and not been fixed to demonstrate that people in this community do care and try to help with the development while providing the necessary details.  Some of the following threads support the developer's claim that it is an issue with user side settings while others are vague.\n\nBelow is an issue with FPS and having V-sync enabled:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/407840/discussions/0/357284131799712598/?tscn=1461612027\n\nThis was an early issue when the game was labaled Guardians of Orion:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/407840/discussions/0/485623406963362059/?ctp=7\n---Developer feedback was certainly present but if one reads into the comments fully you can see that posts were misread by both parties, flamed and petered out with lack of response from the developer.  This perhaps was due to him thinking the issue was solved (at least partially) or not wanting to deal with the situation anymore.\n\nI would have to disagree with the statement in the comment below that states "most reviews state the game is bug free."  More than likely, all the glowing positive reviews don't mention anything regarding the state of play while negative reviews are just the opposite.  In fact, as with any game and application there are bug reports on the official bug report thread constantly posted (some of which are duplicates from different people).  This is not uncommon...the game is not bug free.  One in particular that may have been fixed as of this writing is that breaking down items for crafting parts resulted in similar items being broken down even though they weren't selected.  Just scroll through this thread as I don't feel the need to be more specific than that at the moment.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/407840/discussions/0/485623406950431282/\n\nFinally, an issue that has not received any response albeit it is a rare issue that can be replicated.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/407840/discussions/0/357284131808450023/?tscn=1463073444\n\n****************************\nNotice again that it is not various bugs that would keep me from rating this game higher or reviewing it more favorably but rather how overall behavior is moderated (or not).\n\nFor instance, Mr. Prassel is quoted in Eurogamer back in 2013 admitting to "locking thread and banning users who speak out about Orion: Dino Horde on Steam."\n\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-18-orion-dino-horde-dev-hits-back-at-allegations-of-metacritic-manipulation\n\nMaybe he has grown since then and matured but perhaps he should take his own advice from that article and leave the Public Relations to someone else.  If he can't take any criticism (be it warranted or not) without being too "salty" then he needs someone else to do that.  The most recent one that comes to mind is Mr. Prassel calling someone on steam forums "spoiled and a baby" for voicing his concern about an update coming.  That steam user is also banned now according to that thread.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/407840/discussions/0/357284767253434903/\n\nOnce again, I have no animosity toward the game makers of The Orion Project.  This review will hold its down vote and its specificity (as was criticized of as lacking) and will not change unless I feel it is warranted.","May 14","false","53.4"," 57 of 95 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","57","95","5","27"

However, I did invest money buying copies for my friends pre-price drop, so don't think I'm reviewing it with no money in.\n\nThis game is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. 100/100\n\nThis game brilliantly shines in 3rd person mode. It is truly beautiful and Unreal Engine 4 looks so good. The maps are well thought out and planned excellently. Also, I've never spoken with developers who are so involved in the community. You can see their love for gaming in the quality and care they take of this release. The developers are super dedicated and have carried over their passion from their previous game(s) to this one. The updates are regular, significant, and very welcomed.\n\nSure, there are a few small bugs (sometimes robots sliding like slugs on their stomachs at the ground, raptors flying into the air), but the gameplay, guardians (classes), and the inventory system fully make up for it.\n\nThis is truly an amazing game and I feel everyone should play it. I can't fit all the good things about this game in this review so here are just a couple more. The developers have left in that you're quite protected if you jetpack on top of a rock, however they've made robots that can hit you up there as well as poison pools. It doesn't seem unfair yet still keeps the integrity of the previous game in the series. It is a remarkable balance they've found.\n\nI've played this game since it was in private access, and I must say it's one of the most addicting games I've ever played. Having switched to PC Gaming, this is my version of "Destiny." The loot system seems even better and more fair than Destiny was last I'd kept up with it (aprox. April 2015). I have worked to max levelling 2 of my Guardians so far and am happily awaiting the next release to play with the Marksman Guardian and the new level cap.\n\nI'm also very much looking forward to the strike missions (high level raids) that are planned in the future. This has become a very ambitious project and the developers seem like their going to be able to deliver with all the love they have for this game and their fans.\n\n"Throw a better version of Destiny's loot, tight 3rd person gameplay, humor, dinosaurs and awesome devs and you have one of the best games I've ever played: Guardians of Orion" - Aidan from Welland Gamers\nMarch 4, 2016\n","March 4","true","129.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I especially like it's concept as you can go from a top-down view to a first person view (which I think is a great addition). Although the game can be immersive (especially with friends), it can be redundant after a bit.\n\nThe game's structure is either a survival mode or slaughter mode. In survival mode you defend your harvester. It can defend itself but will need your help in maintaining it's health. In slaughter mode, the harvester is on the move! Unlike survival, you'll have to keep moving with the machine in order to keep it alive. If the machine becomes damaged, the player may repair it with a special weapon (that is given to the player). Any player of any class may repair the machine. All classes come with one main weapon and a side arm. On top of having basic abilities including roll, teleport, and grenade, each class has their own unique ability. There are four classes available at the moment : assault, support, tech and recon.\n\nAssault class is my favorite as they are given jet packs as their special ability and have an automatic weapon at their disposal. Support class has a shotgun instead of an automatic rifle and can deploy a healing bubble as his specialty. The tech can deploy a machine turret as their ability and the recon can turn invisible for a time being. This last class is given an EMP grenade to tackle robot type units. The grenade function isn't extremely effective at the moment and it's physics aren't exactly right. Imagine running then throwing, there isn't an extra "umph" and the trajectory feel isn't quite as right. Every class has an ability to upgrade their skill tree (this can be seen in the screenshots). Players can upgrade their melee ability or choose to be faster. There are three trees in total with usually two options to choose from. I believe adding this into the game can really make it stand out. As mentioned, the player can cycle through a top-down view or a first person view. I like to stick with a first person view when I'm engaging flying type units (to shoot in the air) but the overview helps when you're being swarmed by enemies. Small enemy dinosaurs, for example are difficult to see in first person as they can mask their movements through the grass.\n\nThe enemies themselves are pretty varied (even for early access) and some enemies will have you running for your life while you're trying to shoot at them. I really like the variety and the choice of enemies. Players are able to sprint in game while crouching is not available (I couldn't imagine what you would use it for anyway). I think they did a pretty good job allocating the controls and given the player a good feel of control over their unit.\n\nThe graphics are OK at the moment. Their neither extremely good, or bad, rather in between. You'll notice anything green or some rock edges not being exactly smooth (but this is okay because there is time to touch this up)! This also won't effect your game play experience. Sounds are pretty good but I would recommend adding some sort of scream when a big enemy starts charging at you. Make the player scared and excited to play! Although sounds do not directly effect game play, they can change how the player is feeling in any moment of the game. The first Splinter Cell did it with one note being played hard on a piano, I'm sure GofO can do something similar or even better.\n\nOverall, not a bad game. It feels like a mix between Halo, Turok and some defense FPS's out there. There is no campaign at the moment (I hope there is one) and multiplayer servers aren't exactly full. It will be tough finding a game. I would highly recommend getting this game on the premise that either you like it for what it is, or that you'll be playing it with a friend. I really hope as well they make it so you can burn the grass as you fire through it or some sort of effects along those lines. The game sort of lacks in this department regarding effects.\n\n\n\nEarly access RATING : 6.95/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C+\n\nScreenShots\n\n\nEngineer deploying a turret\n\nRepairing the harvester\n\nAssault can flyyyyyy\n\nOverhead view\n\nDouble XP powerups or damage powers can sometimes occur if you're on fire\n\nEither this guy charges at me or the T-Rex\n\nUsual unit you'll be fighting against\n\nLeveling up system in-game.

With solid gameplay today, it’s well worth the purchase while you wait for the rest.  It’s easily a few hours of content now for a casual game hopper, and a hundred or more for a dedicated fan.\n\nIt's a top down shooter...  No, it's a third person shooter...  No, it's a first person shooter!  You've got a range of shooting options, full controller support for all three perspectives, and a lot of variety for dinosaurs to slaughter.  It's missing a small bit of polish in some minor areas, but the devs have great ambition and have proven with past titles that they definitely won't give up until it's to their liking.\n\nCurrently it’s got “protect the harvester” and “survival” game modes, but they have more coming within the next couple months and a campaign mode coming by 2017.  For those of you who don’t like slaughtering dinosaurs, we’re getting robot enemies too.\n\nBut that’s not what you care about today, ‘cause every game promises big.  So here’s what you get for a dollar today (MSRP as of writing):\nDino horde survival co-op in top down/third person/first person perspectives.\nSolid character progression through loot and levels.\nFree currency to gamble with for chances at getting loot outside of missions.\nDaily/weekly “quests” to earn premium currency, leaving nothing behind a paywall, not even cosmetics.\nSolid controls with tight response times, resulting in great feeling gameplay.\nA visually appealing unreal 4 game, beautiful from all perspectives.\nCreative character customization in both serious and silly ways.\nAccess to all future ‘games’ within The Orion Project. -  An insane amount of content.","May 27","true","3.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

From above, everything looks pretty calm and your mission is to protect the harvester that will collect blue gold. But, it will not be a walk in the park (so to speak) as you and your teammates know exactly what sort of beasts are down there…. Damn right you know, it is full of dinosaurs and some robots ready to take you down and apart!\n\nGuardians of Orion is a top down co-op  action / shooter game where you take control of one of four Guardians and push back 10 waves of dinosaurs coming at you and at the harvester you trying to protect. At this stage, you have the choice of 3 types of guardian: Assault, Support and Recon. Each one has a special ability:\n\n1.	A Jetpack for the Assault class, which is superb when the dinosaurs are charging at you - use your jetpack to avoid the destructive impact and discharge a volley of bullets from above.\n2.	 A bubble of Heal for the Support class, deploy it and your health will regenerate quickly for you and for your teammates.\n3.	Invisibility for the Recon class, it will be hard for them to see and therefore to hurt you.\n\nAlso, each class has its own specific weapons; I personally like the Assault classes with the auto rifle and pistol. Another important item in your inventory is the Regen gun which can repair the harvester and heal you as well as your teammates.\n\nAs you battle the dinosaurs and robots, colour orbs will appear where your enemies have fallen - run over it and you will get a booster, such as speed firing, XP double points, damage increase and more. However, they will only last a short time.\n\nEach character will have a display with 4 different colour bars on the bottom left of your screen. You will be able to see your health, shield, harvester status and, most importantly, the XP bars. As you kill more and more enemies, you will collect points and sooner rather than later you will fill the entire bar and level up.  Then you will be able to add some skills to your character, weaponry and miscellaneous sections through the Skill Tree.\n\nThere is a good amount of gore in this game, where you can see a dinosaur head going one way and its body the other way upon its death. You will encounter and fight up to 10 variety of dinosaurs.\n\nIn this version, you will be able to play in 4 different maps either in a Solo game or online co-op. From the control point of view, they are easy to master. The only thing I would like to see is a better target icon. The graphics are really good as well as the soundtrack.\n\nAdditional guardian class and dinosaurs coming in 2016.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great graphics\n-	Fun and easy to play\n-	Good variety of dinosaurs\n-	In games achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Better target display\n-	No trading cards\n\nI am really enjoying this game and I look forward to playing the new class of guardians and fighting new dinosaurs!\n\n8.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

The sound design is top notch. Coming from ORION: Prelude, the gameplay almost made me feel at home. I'm not used to playing with a controller (Xbox 360), but the controls are smooth and responsive. Rolled away from and whooped a T-rex in single combat. This is just about what I was expecting.\n\n07 March 2016 EDIT: I've moved on from the Xbox 360 controller and have become established with the mouse and keyboard. Also switched from top down to 3rd person over the shoulder view (Press F1) for deeper immersion. Addition of item drops and crafting turns this game into Diablo Lite.\n\nInitial sales were extremely disappointing and development efforts were nearly abandoned. The dev team regrouped and has re-committed to turning this into one of the very finest products available on Steam. First person view, vehicles, new maps, weapons, boss fights, game modes, more classes, spaceships and galactic travel are all confirmed for development. This is already shaping up to be a fun game and it is going to develop into one hell of a product before its time is up.\n\nPick up Founder status before May 2016 for the best value.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spaghyeti/recommended/407840/","spaghyeti","Yeti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spaghyeti/","474 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA note about the developer\n\nI used to reccomend this game. I love the game and I supported David and the Orion IP since Orion: Dino Beatdown. The game review will be below this, but I want to talk about David Prassel. David Prassel claims to be very supportive and rewarding to his community, which is sometimes true. However, if you disagree with anything, think something should change, have any criticism, or even sometimes report a bug, he will lash out at you with insults and overall immature behavior and often time bans. Many people agree with this, and many of those people have been banned. Luckily those bans do not extend to reviews.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/drunken_drake/recommended/407840/\n\nThis review is a good example. Take note of Davids comment on the second page.\n\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-18-orion-dino-horde-dev-hits-back-at-allegations-of-metacritic-manipulation\n\nDavid Prassel is known for banning people and locking threads to those who speak against him. All you need to do to be banned is have an opposing opinion or offer some advice that he disagrees with.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/407840/discussions/0/357284767253434903/?ctp=2\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/407840/discussions/0/357287304421019351/?ctp=2\n\nThere is plenty evidence that he resorts to insulting his community as well as banning them. He has said "Lucky for you we don't do game bans, only community-based bans as I believe opinions sometimes need to be earned." However.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ioyo5XA.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D13vbJU.png\n\nNot ONLY did he ban this user from the forums and from The Orion Project, he threatened him and his family by saying he has called the police and given the police information against him and his family. Like what the ♥♥♥♥? He claims harassment but actively trying to make the community know his lies, mistreament, and ban abuse is not harassment. He even set a bounty on him and attempted to start a witch hunt to find him. Unfortunately for him, he didn't take the post down in time so now you get to see it. "Just know this isn't over." That is not a threat. It's a statement saying that David Prassel's bull ♥♥♥♥ won't end here, and he's right. I won't tell you to not support him, but I urge you to consider everything he has said and done and decide for yourself whether or not you want to support this kind of behavior.\n\n------\n\nQuick Orion IP History and Evolution\n\nSpiral Games Studios started off with a hell of a launch. They released Orion: Dino Beatdown to steam and it was recieved with a TON of negative feedback. I bought it and honestly could entirely understand why, though I still had fun with it. It eventually became Orion: Dino Horde, which was a slightly better version of beatdown. Awhile after that it became Orion: Prelude. By this point the game improved a lot. It gained a lot more content, polish, and became a really enjoyable game, as well as hit the low price of $1. The Orion Project is their next game and wow, I'm blown away. One thing, however, they do tend to market their game as what it will be, rather than what it is.\n\nThe Orion Project is a massive step up in quality. There's much more in depth mechanics, incredibly improved visuals, better animations, much better models, and impressive world design. The roadmap for this game is impressive, but I think totally believable. According to SteamDB, Orion: Prelude now has 2,000,000 owners. That's a good amount of income. They also are about to hit 100,000 with The Orion Project. Assuming David Presson and his team stay true to their promises, this game will be one hell of a thing. It's on its way to being a Destiny Esque RPG Shooter Exploration game with space travel, dogfights, dinosaurs, and more.\n\n-----\n\nActual Game Review\n\nOn to the game. It plays pretty well. there's a good amount of maps, 7 classes/Guardians, 3 skill trees with varying skills depending on the class, a ton of items, a interesting and well built crafting system, and a wide variety of enemies ranging from Dinosaurs to Android robots. Each Guardian has a 50 level cap and each a unique set of weapons. It's very enjoyable to play and supports a Third Person over the shoulder view point or a Top Down Twinstick style view point. First Person View will be released in May 2016 as well as quests and I'm sure a lot of other content. The game is planned to be supported with monthly updates and so far they have delivered. My first time playing I ended up playing for 8 hours straight and I've been addicted to the game since. It has a social aspect, where players are placed on an orbital command station in a lobby with a bunch of other players. Here you can check the leaderboards, stats, access the store, and party up with players.\n\nCurrently there are two gameplay modes, Harvest and Survival. Harvest is a 10 wave survival-like mode where you follow and defend a harvester collection Ion crystals, the main currency. Every few waves there is a side objective consisting of harder enemies and bosses with loot chests as a reward. Survival is similar to Harvest, except the harvester is in a static location and the waves are endless. Survival has a lower Augment (equipment) drop rate and no loot chests, but is great for experience, testing skill, and competing in the leaderboards.\n\nThe Orion Project does have some short comings, though. A great example is the never failing sequence of freezes when you first get the game. To play online, you are required to make an account which is very easy to set up and requires no activation. However, during the first launch you will end up in a infinite loading screen which you must close. The second launch, when you attempt to sign in it will infinitely attempt to sign in and must close. The third launch works 90% of the time, though, and you'll be able to play.\n\nSome players report having massive stuttering during game and freezes. For some, this has just gone away, others cannot find a fix and so far have not recieved any attention from the developers. This bug seems to be for a minority, though.\n\nOccasionally after signing in you will get kicked to the menu, sometimes multiple times, sometimes enough to not be able to play. Most of the time this will go away on its own and I assume it's issues with their servers. There is also a chance of being kicked to the menu when you try and launch the game.\n\n----\n\nConclusion\n\nDo I recommend this game? Short answer, Yes. The game in its current state is buggy, could use optimization, and may require some patience. However, it is fun as hell. It has enough content to keep you going for awhile and is a great game for coop with friends or even randoms. I usually don't enjoy being paired with random players in coop games but this one is an exception. I highly recommend this game if you are fine with experiencing some bugs and setbacks and want a really enjoyable shooter with in depth loot and crafting mechanics and/or want to support development and see this game grow. I don't reccomend this game in its current state if you have a low end machine (needs optimization), don't like dealing with any bugs (which is common in many Early Access games), or don't enjoy cooperative shooters.","April 29","false","43.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","5"

Fighting with Dinos and Robots..... what's not to like. The graphics are very nice, the levels challenging and the crafting system makes it really interesting.

If you've played other Dino games by Trek you know what you're in for. Gameplay is very smooth and most low end computers should be able to handle this game. The varity of dino's is there with the addition of robot AI and more enemies to defeat. The classes work very well in this top-down-twin-stick-pc-shooter, with each class having a different ability. Bottom line, it's worth the pickup and worth whatever its going to cost.

Yeah, one WHOLE €, that's quite alot.... I guess. Yeah, I got this for dirt cheap, and to be honest, at first, this game probably wasn't worth much more, but in that short time of about 6 months the developers added really flashy cool ♥♥♥♥ to this game that can be cheesy at times but for the most it's just awesome.\n\nPros/Cons\n\n+Literally blasting away dinos with shotguns, rocket launchers and flamethrowers, or shooting flying bird dinos from the sky with a magnum.\n+Masses of enemies to slice and dice your way through.\n+Nice enemy design ideas, like the Namor, hope Trek does more with that base.\n+It's dirt cheap.\n+IT GOT HATS AND COSMETICS! OHHH MY GOOD YEEEEEEEEE!\n+Loot system\n+Starting lobby, I think it's pretty cool.\n+Plenty of maps (and upcoming gamemodes!)\n+Plenty of Characters.\n--------------------------------\n+/- Cheesiest voice acting ever, kinda makes me laugh though.\n+/- There are two currencies, ingame earnable money and money by steam wallet, the real money version hopefully only is for cosmetics tho, crossing my fingers.\n+/- Quite difficult for a FPS player to first get into the controls, but after a time you really get used to it, tho.\n--------------------------------\n-Not finished.\n-Does have bugs.\n-Not the best optimization.\n\nMy overall verdict: 8.7/10 Surely, it seems like this is a perfect game, and yes, for the price, it truly is, definitely worth checking out, but overall, in a complete game standpoint it's surely not the best, but yeah, not every game deserves 10/10, that's as good as impossible anyway. (Note, added bonus on the verdict for the stones Trek has to 1. updating Orion till it's actually good and 2. Having the stones to make fun of it and 3. Bringing out another game... that's actually fun.\n\n\n","May 9","true","24.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Um spaceships?

Many of the ideas that are now being implemented come from the failed orion project on kickstarter which failed because it did not meet the funding goal.  Instead of floundering David kept up his stride and just kept hammering away at this.  Its also on UE4 the graphics are impressive even now.\n\nI must also add despite what some may of heard this isn't going to be Starcitizen on steam there is literally no game that can be this.  I wont go into the reasons why on this review, but i will say that Guardians of orion - the mmo it will eventually be will be worth every dollar you spend on it get it before it has a price increase which will likely happen.\n\nDo you like the idea of unreal tournament combined with an mmo then dinos and killer robots thrown in the mix?

Unless you count the odd lag spiks and unusual reactions of some enemy’s when approaching wave 40 in survival. I can definitely chalk that up to “it's alpha” reasoning. Adding to that that the lag is often short lived bit often showing at some of the most inopportune times. The levels do get a bit grindy and the initial break in to each new difficulty and gear range can be VERY irritating. I am not holding my breath for a revolutionary game that will redefine the gaming industry and taking the developers history in to account I did not expect this game to even get this far. With that statement in mind I do believe any issues with the company, if any did exist, are now behind them and I see the possibility of a very bright future for this game. I plan to continue to play with friends for quite some time. I will attempt to update this as time goes on just for the purpose of making sure bad updates don't drown out the good ones like the previous game.

The game it's self is being headed by an indie developer with big dreams who's last title, Orion: Prelude was once the worst pc game on the market which eventually evolved into one of the best indie $1 games on Steam. What this game badly needs is more story. There are several classes all with unique abilities, but if you were not a founder you will have to work hard or pay out of pocket to unlock these other classes. Though the game is quite limited, expect much more gameplay variety and unique features. For now, you may burn yourself out playing the game too much with the two modes that are offered. I reccomend playing every now and again and checking back as new features are added. Of course, that's not what I did at all. I got pretty addicted, as it is a very addicting game. Now,  I bought this game for $10 and a week later the price dropped to $1 so I wish I had waited. It's worth $1. Maybe, in time, it will be worth $10 or heck even $50. What I want to see is the developers focusing more on lore, story and unique features. They say they are dreaming big, and that they want this game to be a big contender. I've heard these words before spoken in what were once great ideas and now ghost-towns of games. You'll enjoy it, you might get bored at the end of the night from killing Dinos. It's not the same as killing humans or zombies. Wait a second, zombie dinosaurs? Hmmm....

At the moment there are 3 classes and they all seem relatively balanced.\n\nThe Assault Class-Has high mobility and kiting with his jetpack. Uses an Assault Rifle.\nThe Support Class (Main and Fave Class)-Boosts in healing and repairing the Harvester. With the help of the Trusty Shotgun has some decent spread damage.\nThe Recon Class-Can lose Dino Aggro in a split second with her Cloak mechanic. Uses the silenced SMG for some awesome long range single target damage. If specked right her emp grenades can do some pretty heavy damage too.\n\nRight now the only mode available is Survival. In this mode you protect this slowly moving machine called the Harvester while it collects ores throughout the map. While protecting the Harvester you will be slaughtering waves of dino/robotic enemies. This may be relatively repetitive for some, seeing your class level up and progress through their various skill trees makes it worth while.\n\nAnd again please note that this isn't the full release, the development team is quite active on working on new content, adding new classes, new enemies and new modes and fixing bugs that the community reports. This game is definitely worth a try with some friends. In it's current state I don't really know if it's worth the $20 price tag, but once complete I'm sure it will be. Taking advantage of the steam sales or (like I did) take advantage of the free copy promotions that Trek Industries has been doing would be worth it. This game has a lot of potential and I look forward to seeing how it develops.","December 11, 2015","true","190.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

However, as the Dev Team have mentioned before, they are hard at work on creating new content (check their News section and you'll see).\n\nCons: -\n\nSo you have idk how many classes in the game, and most of them are pretty generic.  Every class has a healing gun so that pretty much makes the 'medic' useless.  Each class also has their own special ability; and while most of them seem pretty lackluster, at least they have one.  There is also one ability that everyone has - the 'Blink', much like 'Flash' in League of Legends, or a simple, short ranged teleportation spell.\nOVERALL, the classes seem a bit bare-bones AT THE MOMENT, but I'm sure they will be improved with some sort of UNIQUE mechanics that actually involves some tactical or skill gameplay.\n\n- There is also no West coast server, so there is a bit of lag.  But that's alright.\n- User Interface (UI) seem very basic and simple-looking.  Aesthetically, it needs a bit of jazzing up.\n- Crafting system is kinda weird and complicated at first glance.\n- Controls are weird, so check them in the Options menu before you play to familiarize yourself!\n\nPROS!\n\n- One of the most fun co-op games on Steam imo, and it is very easy to pick up and play!  The gameplay is top-down, a lot like Helldivers, but guess what? YOU CAN ALSO SWITCH TO 3RD PERSON VIEW, which looks WAY more awesome! press F2 or something.  Check the controls!\n\n- Constantly being updated, and Devs are transparent enough.\n- Fun, engaging combat that isn't too hard to learn, and is fun to roll/blink around your enemies!\n- Has an RPG-like SKILL TREE for each class, so it feels rewarding to level up!\n- Graphics look very good, especially in 3rd person view.\n\nOVERALL imo a 7.5/10 (I bought this on Sale btw), may even rise to a 8.5-9 if the Devs flesh out this game more, it has a LOT OF potential...","April 11","true","7.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

A sci-fi top-down, multiplayer, horde mode shooter - if they added some more characters, differing armor/colour schemes, more maps, team death match, it could be something cool. But then came the third person view, and suddenly the floodgates opened for this weird lobby thing, incomprehensible item-crafting, dumb hats, and you name it.\n\nI think a lot of what I said comes from how ambitious the devs are. They don't want to do what I had hoped for, which is strange since that's what it looked like it would've ended up as if not for all the people complaining that it was "merely" a top-down shooter. So now we're getting mechs, an open world, first person point of view, and all kinds of stuff in addition to the poorly done and meaningless additions I already mentioned. Trek is shoving so much stuff into the game in order to please as many as possible, that it drags the whole experience down into a mish-mash of half-baked ideas overcrowding what little good there is. "The Orion Project" is hardly anything alike what I had hoped it would become... So for me, this is my lesson in early access.\n\nAlso, animation quality is really bad.","May 27","false","4.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","7"

I only started to scratch the surface of the game, and it seems solid, controller support, leveling, items, fairly balanced enemies, a variety of difficulties.. all improved upon from the previous ORION game.\n\nBut the developers still intend to imput tons more stuff. This game seeks to build off previous work on ORION: Prelude, which was in itself a pretty great game. And this means they want to take an existing frame work and include more classes, enemies, community features and game modes. Not to mention the ability to explore a galaxy and some really cool set piecies in the game.\n\n\nJust looking at that list in the game description, then look up at the price. Now back to the list, now back to the price.\n\nBuy into the game for $1.. Because really, what is there to loose?\n\nAnswer: One dollar.\n\nEDIT: Other Final thoughts, this is a developer who has consistently made thier games unbelivably affordable, charging crazy low prices in a world where games with half the polish and half the commitment go on sale for twice the price.. One dollar for early access? Seems crazy.. paradigm shifting and a breath of fresh air in a time filled with high game prices that seem to rise by $10 every year,\n\nI wish the development team at TREK only the best in their endeavours, I know I will be following along.\n\nFURTHER EDIT:\nThe developers announced today that the game was going to get a community panel implemented next year to act as a sort of moderator and lore building group for the world. Now that is some cutting edge stuff there. My only complaint from the last game was that I had absolutely no idea what happened to get me where I was.. Right now it seems all those questions are going to be answered by the community. Seriously, community elections while still in early access (albiet down the line, but still)?

There are basic, core features promised in the description which are not present in the current build of the game.  Early access is almost an understatement.  However, do not let that deter you from buying the game.\n\nSecond, I'd like to point out that the game is currently on sale for $0.99 and is worth all ninety nine pennies.  Buy it if you're thinking about it.\n\nNow, the review:\n\nI'm not going to give a list of pros and cons because this game is expected to change drastically, and hopefully my review along with it.  I will simply mention the things in this game that make it worth playing and things that make it not worth playing, just things that I happened to note throughout my experience.\n\nAs a top-down shooter, it succeeds.  The controls are intuitive and feel familiar, yet they're refined to work in both third-person and top-down mode.  I would recommend remapping the blink key (default 'c' I believe) to something that your right hand can hit quickly; preferably on your mouse.  Blink often, this is a feature of the game that will make it much easier and will probably be nerfed at some point.\n\nLet's talk about the third-person shooter aspect.  Press F1 to toggle between top-down and third-person.  I was excited for this feature, but quickly realized that I'm at a slight disadvantage because I can't see the miniature dinosaurs through the grass, whereas in top-down you can see them coming from quite far away.  There is one advantage though, which is that you can easily take down the flying dinosaurs before they can even attack you.  That's really about it, though.  And the flying dinosaurs aren't even that big of an issue unless they're in large numbers, which they rarely are.  The mouse feels funky.  Aiming does not feel good in third-person.  I've removed mouse acceleration (or whatever the setting is called ingame) and it still feels like there's some latency between when I move the mouse and when my character looks around.  It's very difficult to aim in this game, but luckily, aiming isn't important.  Your stock weapons can kill mostly anything on your level within 1-2 hits depending on your class.  Shotguns are 1-hit kill on all lower level mobs.  I recommend using the support class if you're new to top-down shooters.  It is very intuitive.\n\nThe graphics are really not impressive, but I'm not complaining about them either.  There is some customization, but not a whole lot.  I turn them down because it seems to reduce the foliage which makes it easier to kill the tiny little dinos.\n\nCrafting appears to be fully implemented and from my limited experience with it, it seems very well-done.  The menus work, I haven't experienced any bugs with it, and it seems to be easy to teach yourself how the crafting system works without much (if any?) guidance.  Your inventory has an intuitive sorting function which I love.  Makes things very easy to read.\n\nFeatures missing from the game...major.  This is major.  But, luckily, I know for a fact that they're coming, so I'm not upset that my $0.99 game is missing a few major, core features.  Open world?  No sir.  Travel the galaxy?  Not even a little bit.  Persistent universe?  Where?  Living, breathing?  Let's call it...not living, or breathing.  The game isn't finished, guys.  I can't comment on these aspects of the game because it simply lacks these features entirely.\n\nSo, that's pretty much my review.  If you're curious, and reading this later in time and now have the fully fleshed out game, then let me explain what it's like now.  You spawn in, and there's (I think?) a tutorial to show you how to do some basic stuff.  There might not be, I really don't remember.  But you enter this unknown space station in an unknown location, with zero identifying features, and you're told...nothing.  Nothing about how to start games or what you're even supposed to do.  Through asking people, I discovered that there is a strategy table where I can start a matchmade game, or another table nearby where I can craft, although crafting is all done through your inventory anyways so these hubs are utterly pointless.  So, the only thing you can do is start a game right now.  You can control the map, the difficulty, the item level requirement, and a few other things as well.  There are two game types to choose from at the moment, survival and harvest.  Survival is classic wave survival, dinos just keep attacking you until you can't hold out anymore.  Harvest is a bit different, but same-ish concept.  A harvester travels around the map harvesting an unknown material, and you must defend it from waves of attackers.  Occasionally a chest will appear, guarded by more powerful mobs.  All drops are personal, meaning no one can just steal a chest from you and get all the items while you get none.  Everybody gets their own randomized drops.  There are also powerups in the game, giving you things like running speed, shooting speed, etc.\n\nAnyways, as it stands, this game is hard to play consistently.  It's very grindy, but there are multiple maps to choose from.  Around 4-5 maps iirc.  Far from open-world, far from living/breathing, and far from completion, but a promising game worth $0.99 nonetheless.  In this state, I'd give the game a 5/10.  Enough to buy it, not enough to play it for over 100 hours yet.  If it had all the promised features, I predict an easy 8/10, and if they fix the mouse latency issue, 9/10.  Implement PvP = 10/10.","April 29","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Graphically does better on my system than most other games. At 1440 resolution I can run everything on Super High/Ultra with a GTX 970 and get around 60 fps with the occassional dips and rises. All other games that are graphically similar I'd only be able to play on High graphics at 1440 resolution. Being able to switch from first person to a top down view with F1 is pretty neat. It can really help sometimes depending on the situation in game. Guardians of Orion is very similar to Orion Prelude but it takes everything MUCH further. AND it's still being avidly developed and expanded, which is always great news. It does have some traits that are completely different than Prelude as well. For one, it now has a strong arcade feel both due to the optional top down view and from the loot collecting. Also, the waves of enemies seem to spawn much snappier here regardless of mode. The enemies have far more character in this game too. And the second main difference, Guardians has expanded on Prelude's RPG elements. Along with this new loot collecting there is item crafting (it's fairly simple so don't let that be a turn off) and a 3D character portrait surrounded by empty equipment slots to be filled with new gear typical to an RPG game. I found all of this to be pretty cool. There is an in-game money system that uses "ions" of which you collect as you play and destroy enemies. By the way, the main goal  of the game as of right now is to protect your harvester, a machine that travels around the new world harvesting minerals. There are many character types to choose from. OH, and there is a skill tree. It's nothing crazy, kind of reminds me of Borderlands' skill tree as far as the layout goes. Gameplay is very smooth. There is a roll/dodge feature instead of the normal jump with spacebar which surprised me but I easily got used to it. A new Quests feature is supposed to be released in April 2016. An update added a central hub when you start the online game. I like this a lot, it reminds me of Phantasy Star Online I and II because that game had a central hub stationed in outerspace too, although the graphics are very different nowadays... Sidenote: I especially love the music in this game as I did in Phantasy Star. Hmm, lastly, Guardians of Orion does appear to have an offline mode for local play of up to 4 people. I didn't get to try this but I would love to see if that works. This game is very promising as of right now and in my opnion worth the $10 asking price.","March 20","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

On one hand, this game isn't and wasn't ready, there are so many features missing that even Prelude in it's current state is better. Then again, one of the developers sold his god damn car to make sure Prelude transformed from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ disaster to actually being a fun game that I destroyed my free time with. They are promising ALOT of things, and I really want this game to succeed, because all I believe is that these devs need a good foot. So devs, please listen up, if you really want to get people invested early, I want you to do some stuff.\n\n1: Add vehicles, what made Prelude pretty fun and crazy WAS vehicles. Please give us those back.\n\n2: Balance out the item system, I find it really stupid that item drops are determined on how difficult your mission is, instead of how high of a level you are. You can just start out on the game and get level 500s if you have some friends to help you, that isn't the way to go.\n\n3: Upgrade servers or actually let us host our own connections, I get literally 100 ping on servers in the east coast in america, that's unacceptable since I only live a couple states away, upgrade the servers or please just let us host our own servers. One will actually save you a lot of bandwidth.\n\n4: Have workshop support and encourage it, the thing I love about games is being able to download tons of workshop content and then be able to play them for the night. It shows that not only do you care about your community, but it also shows that the community is here to help shape the game.\n\n5: Continue to show that you actively care for the game, seriously one of your guys sold his ♥♥♥♥ing car to continue development on Prelude? I'm not saying to destroy your life for us, but continue to inspire and amaze with what you can do, even if it has no future of hope.\n\nRemember your own words devs, "games cant fail, only developers can"\nPlease continue to make this game great, and I can promise you something, I will certainly continue playing it.","April 29","true","18.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But I kept tabs on it anyway just to watch the development.\n\nThen one day I checked to see a big update. 3rd person view added? Not only that, but switching between top down and 3rd person view on the fly with a hotkey? Open world in development? Wait, what, not just open world but open galaxy? And now it's only $1? Hell yes I'm in. The optimization is kinda bad currently but they're working on it, and I've found the top down mode is actually pretty fun and I switch between them frequently. I normally use top down for small waves because the tiny dinos are hard to spot in 3rd person, but they're easy to pick out from above.\n\nTo add to that the devs frequently ask for player input and actually listen. Honestly this would have been a purchase for me even at the original price after the 3rd person update, but at $1 it's an absolute steal. If you enjoyed Orion: Prelude picking this up is almost a must, you won't regret it.","May 3","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Now why couldn't other devs for other games do the same as TREK Industeries does with money. Anyways, Guardians of Orion is pretty much the coolest game I have ever played. Well right now it has little content right now but don't worry, more content will be coming soon for this game. I'll put some content in later but let's get into details. Well for starters, the game is of course, "Early Access" which means it's in it's early state right now but the game is still cool. It may have only two modes such as "Slaughter" and "Survival" but it's mostly fun with friends. So far the game has cool dinos such as Raptors, Dilos, Rhams, Stegosaurs, Triceratops, Ankylos, Compys and of course, the lengendary T. Rex! There are other creatures such as Jeckylls, Kruegers and Namors. So about the content coming for Guardians of Orion, here is what is so exciting about the game, there will be Space Fighting, Space Exploration, Social Hub, Orbital PvP and Orbital PvE. So Space Fighting will have PvP dogfights and spaceships for you and your crew (hopefully David adds multi-crew ships to), Space Exploration this one is my personal favorite, 'cause you get to explore solar systems and discover many things in them like planets, stars and life in the planets (depends which planet is habitable), Social Hub, probably anouther coolest thing that is being added to Guardians of Orion, this one is as the first word says, where you meet other players up to 40 of them and talk with them, David also mentioned that he will add more Social Hubs by making them larger and other larger social areas. Up next is Orbital PvP, this one is where you go up against other players on a orbital station and of course, see who wins in a fair fight. Orbital PvE is where you and other players go against enemy droids on an orbital station. Other content is there will be more dinos, more gear, more droids, more guardians, new vehicles and much more. Here is the bugs that have been going on (some may have not happen to you but it happened to me at times), When I start the survival match, there should've been a cutscene where it kinda shows the map your on and then you drop down from a dropship, but at times it would just get me into the game without showing the cutscene. There is also where I try to change my screen from window screen to the fullscreen but as soon as I put it on fullscreen, that's when the words would be blurey, and the gameplay too. And the fps would drop (not really very terrible as Ark Survival Evolved but I do beg for it to be fixed). It was mostly those bugs that happen to me but there are not really that serious. The fps problem isn't really a bug but it's kind of annoying when it drops but I still want it to be fixed. But in all seriousness, the game is awesome, it may not have much content at first, but when time goes by, that's when the game get's good updates every month. So I give this game 8/10. Love the game, hope the devs keep up the good work and that is all. Good Luck, David and TREK Industries! And like I said, keep up the good work! :)\n\nEdit: Can you devs also fix the lag? Even when I play by myself, the lag is just so rediculous. Thanks.","February 29","true","12.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

The game starts out with an offline mode and an online mode. The offline mode is the same as online except restricted to local co-op or single player. Wait, local co-op? Seriously? You, you offered local co-op? Gotta be honest here, we’re surprised. A nice surprise as local co-op is getting more and more rare in the PC gaming scene as of late.\n\nTo start the game online, you create an account. After that, it will sign you in, sign you into steam, and you’re off. You’ll spawn in a main hub world where you can buy items and crafting materials, talk to players, join other servers, create parties, etc. We don’t believe there’s native support for microphones, but we’re not quite sure. No one we played with talked except in the chat menu during our time with the game. To start playing, choose a class you want to play as (we chose support for his shield ability and shotgun) and you then level up. Each class you chose levels up independently, but the items and crafting materials you obtain from the store or during missions are universal to all the classes. The crafting is fairly limited, and we mainly just crafted things that give us a bonus to XP, as well as crafting some legendary items. You have common items (no color) below your level (green) at your level (yellow) and legendary weapons (purple). You can also craft or find armor pieces or bonuses to your class’ special power. Weapons and armors will give different bonuses for different things. In example, a level 300 chest piece may have 500 defense and add 200 intelligence, but a level 310 chest piece may add 550 defense but add 150 strength and so on. Legendary items often have special traits such as bonus gold finding or certain things that once hurt you healing you.\n\nDespite some gripes with the game, we enjoyed our time with it. It often reminded me of the older Turok games, as well as the Turok comic series. It’s not totally fleshed out, but we still enjoyed killing triceratops and getting murdered and eaten by t-rexes. We enjoyed the large variety of classes to choose from, and we enjoyed the nice variety of augments and abilities you can find. We wish you could sell unwanted items in the shop, and we hope that will be an upcoming feature at some point. While it is enjoyable, it’s clear that the focus is multiplayer, and it’s far better with a friend or two by your side.\n\nFor what it’s worth, we really like the concept of the game. While not the most solid early access game out there, it certainly got our attention. Would we have purchased it at $9.99 as it is? Probably not, but it’s still a decent game nonetheless and plays well.

I have not put more than an hour into the game yet since I do not have a group to play with yet as of now. Even without a group, the solo play is a ton of fun. Battling a T-Rex to some kickass rock is by far one of the best moments I have ever had in gaming. I highly recommend this game. $20 is a bit pricey, but honestly spending a dollar on the original is worth getting the $10 discount. For the money, the game is absolutely an amazingly good time.

Well, mostly.  For example, the crafting, while playable, is effectively unplayable because of how tedious it is.  But crafting itself doesn't seem necessary so the game at large is playable in a practical way even if the crafting isn't playable.  What needs addressed:\n\n- Game crashes easily on launch (above spec computer)\n- If your objective is located gruading a "harvester", then enemies should not run away from you OR you should have a teleport to harvester option.  This happens on timed missions to kill things.  But they seem to sometimes run away and sometimes meander.  Though once you are in range they start chasing you.  It doesn't feel like the challenge is to catch them in time, it feels like wonky AI that takes you out of the immersion.  The larger problem is how tedious it is to run back to the harvester.\n- Crafting menu needs LOTS of work.  It seems to be oversaturated with refinements over end results.  Categories could use work.  But probably the biggest thing is when you mouse over components, it should give you info or at least let you cross link to them by clicking on them.  It should go both ways, such that when you are on a craftable thing, it should show you what is needed to make it, and what it can be used for to make other things.  This is just information and organization.\n- It's far too cnsole centric.  From minor things like a useless splash screen if you are mouse/keyboard (showing you gamepad controls on PC even if you don't have a gamepad plugged in... lots of small development games make an assumption of what control type you are using based on what you have plugged in).  To larger things like not being able to type your name into a new save game field (you click on letters with mouse / gamepad).  This larger issue makes the game feel like PC was an afterthought.  Fortunately the gameplay feels fine.  But the tedious nature of these other things is a big negative to me personally as I feel this is representative of a build philosophy that isn't in line with my play philosophy.  It's fine that these games exist, but it makes me favor those in line with my play style (and who wouldn't look for games of their play style).\n- Inventory menu could use work.  Just the basic thing of highlighting the slot something you are dragging goes into.  This has been a stable of UI for a long time, and there's no advantage to removing it.","April 29","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is changable with the click of a button, which is pretty cool situational awareness. Dodge rolls and blink dodges are also big factors in keeping an advantage over enemies. Each class also has a specific special ability that can fit just about anyone's playstyle, and just seems to add that little something extra.\nEach class also has a skill tree of its own with a leveling system for different kinds of specialization or talents, which is just about as good as any skill system you'd see in a AAA shooter. This doesn't mean the game has no shortcomings or room for improvement. It is, after all, still in Early Access. Nonetheless I'd find it important to mention how lousy the crafting system feels in this game. It seems like what you can build now is currently limited to upgrades, consumables, and worst of all, other materials. I've nearly all of my crafting in the game so far on building better materials out of worse ones so I can build specific upgrades. This isn't unavoidable though, I find armor and upgrades all the time in the field, and  consumables are always pretty simple to craft with common items.\n\nAll in all, the game's sure not done, but it's very nice for a 99¢ Early Access, and hands down the best Early Access title I've subscribed to yet. Not to mention the rewards for helping the dev's by playing, it's pretty damn nice. :steamsalty:","May 4","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may only cost $1 at time of writing(got it on sale) but it is much fuller than many oithers that cost 20x as much. The gameplay and hitboxes are smooth and the combat is fun and fast paced(as long as everyone on the team hits R) It has several modes to play as well as being able to go offline for local co op or single player. It does have some bugs that I believe are going to be addressed. The developer is very obsessive with his creation, tweaking and fixing it on what seems to be a daily basis, to make it better. The walking and jumping feels goofy overall but doesn't distract from the gameplay. My only other complaint at this point in time is that I have a problem connecting to a host sometimes (10%) and it closes out the game completely. All in all, waaaaaaay worth $1, I would pay up to $10 for it in its current state, and with what the developer has in mind for this product, I would realistically pay $25 to $30 for a completed game.","May 2","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I thought this game would be a whole new package including  what ORION: Prelude had but adding more so I wondered if I should even buy it but it turns out it's quite different. 3rd-person, different gamemodes and different classes, including the 1st 3 from ORION: Prelude. If what they say is true then we'll see a exploration aspect which will be cool. In the end I think it's worth having both games since they are both unique and have a great developer who proved himself with the 1st game. One little thing I don't like is how they constantly shove the gamepad controls into your face even though I don't even have one...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psioptic/recommended/407840/","Psioptic","PsiOptic™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psioptic/","41 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Orion Project - Formerly known as, "Guardians of Orion".\n\nThis game really has a ton of potential, and a development team that is very clearly dedicated to the GAME and its followers, not the greenback.  It's not very often you find a development team that sticks to a program they believe in, even after significant failure.  That said, not only are they putting blood, sweat and tears into the project, they've literally got an extremely open 'canvas' to work with.  This particular game is quite unique, and it has a plethora of directions it can go and branch off in to.\n\nIt is an Early Access game, so if you do not take the time to READ what that entails, then you shouldn't be buying ANY early access games, software, etc.  Although it's an early access game, the core of the game and the core concept is solid.  Yes, you can tell the game is being ported from console, but with Trek Industries at the helm (given their track record so far) it's not anything I'm concerned about.  Trek will have this ported and optimized ASAP\n\nAs of the time of writing this review, the game is only .99¢ - and you absolutely can't go wrong if you enjoy co-op shooters.  Period.  However, I feel the game is absolutely worth the full early access cost of $9.99, as well.  This is one of those games, and development groups that WE, THE GAMERS can not only enjoy, but we can make a STATEMENT in the gaming world, as long as Trek Ind. keeps doing what they're doing.  How?  It's really quite simple.  Think about it...  How many times have you seen your favorite genre, series, installment, etc, etc. get 'sold-out' to some major 'gaming' company, then torn apart, dismantled and 'developed' into oblivion??  Personally?  Too many to count in my own 20-some years of gaming (yes, I'm that age).  When we support good games/development teams like this, it doesn't go un-noticed by all those conglomerates out there, that are dissecting games we used to adore/love.  This game is already becoming one of those games for me, and it will you if you give it the time and support they need.\n\nLike I said before, the game is early access, and aside from a few typical porting issues, it's a solid game.  It's fun, unique, graphics aren't bleeding edge, but with the engine they're using, that won't take much effort to optimize and add to, either.  Controls are what you're used to in FPS/Shooter games.  Content isn't deep, YET, but that certainly doesn't mean it doesn't keep challenging you with its current content, because it certainly will.  Thus far, the community that I've ran into has been pleasant, and happy to help (their is a small learning curve due to lack of tutorials outside of basic movement/use).\n\nCome join us in the fight for our future, join us on Orion and help us forge a new future, while surviving the untamed wilds of Nature, in her primal state using, Trek Industries ultra-advanced technology.  Let us make sure our future on Orion belongs to us, and not the Corporations and corrupt OWG.  Add me (same callsign as Steam ID) to your communications and I will teach you what I know, and perhaps we can join forces to give our future the edge it needs to materialize for us, instead of greed and corruption.\n\n8/10 so far...\n\nThe story of, The Orion Project... so far...\n\n*Edit for spelling error(s), Grammar use","May 1","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If the developers really are serious about successfully defying the gaming industry status quote, on persistent world online games, then make great effort to make sure the game actually does run stable. No Man's Sky is only a month away and already shows signs of being exactly this... stable.\n\nDay 3. Sunday ] SUCCESS. No crashes or crippling lag with not connecting to networks. However, got in on single player only. Everything seems stable enough, with only occasional environmental glitches... such a bit of lag on generating the vegetation detail. Best to purchase now and then come back in about 2 months for a check up. Then repeat cycle if needed.","May 1","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may only cost $1 at time of writing(got it on sale) but it is much fuller than many oithers that cost 20x as much. The gameplay and hitboxes are smooth and the combat is fun and fast paced(as long as everyone on the team hits R) It has several modes to play as well as being able to go offline for local co op or single player. It does have some bugs that I believe are going to be addressed. The developer is very obsessive with his creation, tweaking and fixing it on what seems to be a daily basis, to make it better. The walking and jumping feels goofy overall but doesn't distract from the gameplay. My only other complaint at this point in time is that I have a problem connecting to a host sometimes (10%) and it closes out the game completely. All in all, waaaaaaay worth $1, I would pay up to $10 for it in its current state, and with what the developer has in mind for this product, I would realistically pay $25 to $30 for a completed game.","May 2","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a huge improved in every single way, and show how much the company has grown as a whole. If you are doubtful of getting this game due to early access, have no fear, these developers are caring, and will help guide this game, and there community to greatness. The game is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful, with stunning environments, and moving parts to each world. Though it lacks in initial content at the current moment, it offers enough, to tie you over until, the next update. You fight waves of various dinosaurs, and robots, each feeling very different in both difficulty, and attack style. The game overs 4 maps currently, a day a night option, full controller support, and 2 gamemodes. Many people have been complaining about not being able to find any players, and even though this has not personally been an issue for me, those who worry about that may feel better waiting until the game grows a bigger following. The game is still bareboned at the moment, despite monthly updates, so Early Access can feel slow at times. This isn't a game that you can sit down and play for hours, because there isn't enough you can currently do, but you can most certainly play in small hour dosages. You can switch between top down, and third person, which is ♥♥♥♥ing genius, and offers players a way to play the game the way that makes them feel comfortable. The soundtrack is stunning, and perfectly matches the vibe of the game. The game sure as hell isn't perfect though. There is minimal content, and the content added can feel more or less the same. There is no story, or missions at all, and you're stuck doing the same, protect the harvest ♥♥♥♥ for most of the game. It's very bareboned at the moment, but I would recommended getting it on sale to watch it evolve into a masterpiece of a game. In it's current state though, theres still some fun to be had with it.","January 23","true","47.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have played games such as Killing Floor, ORION: Dino Prelude and other titles similar to those, then this game shouldn't be  TOO  strange to you. As of now there are two game modes currently availiable and seven classes.\n\nDon't think that just because the game is priced at a single U.S. dollar that it's of low quality. This game is very unique title worth well over one dollar even in it's current early acess state. If this game was completley polished and full of content I would be willing to spend upwards around $40.\n\nBut let's talk in detail about the game in it's current state.\n\nThe Details     Harvest\nSurvival\nSkill Tree\nItems\nClasses\n\nHarvest:\nProtect your collector machine as it mines "blue gold" veins from the planet. Ten waves of fighting dino's and alien creatures as this machines mines money from the ground. While doing this at certain waves a secondary objective will appear rewarding you will crafting materials, items, and currency.\n\nSurvival:\nRight now survival is the exact same as harvest except it never ends, you protect the collector untill it gets destroyed or everyone dies in a single wave. The devs have future plans to make survival a lot different by removing the collecter so you only have to worry about self and team.\n\nSkill Tree:\nThink of each playable class in the game as a different hero or champion you can select to use, and each of them level up on their own; and have their own inventory; and their own unique skills; and their own weapons types yaddha yaddah.\nWell anyways the skill tree is essentially your classic skill tree found in the game Borderlands, or like Masteries in LoL. There's 3 catagorys and every time you level up you get a points to allot in each catagory. You can reset all alloted points at anytime, free of charge, so don't worry too much if you missclick. <I beleive the current level cap is 50>\n\nItems:\nThe only thing there is to tell about items is that you can gear them towards a specific type of build prety well. My only problem is equipting different items doesn't change any visuals on the player.\n\nClasses:\nSeven different classes and many more in the making..

If you have played games such as Killing Floor, ORION: Dino Prelude and other titles similar to those, then this game shouldn't be  TOO  strange to you. As of now there are two game modes currently availiable and seven classes.\n\nDon't think that just because the game is priced at a single U.S. dollar that it's of low quality.

Ten waves of fighting dino's and alien creatures as this machines mines money from the ground.

There's 3 catagorys and every time you level up you get a points to allot in each catagory. You can reset all alloted points at anytime, free of charge, so don't worry too much if you missclick. <I beleive the current level cap is 50>\n\nItems:\nThe only thing there is to tell about items is that you can gear them towards a specific type of build prety well.

You will be able to explore and visit diffrent planets because this game will have an entire solar system in it. For just $1.... like damn this is allready better than most of the $40-50 range games, lol.\n\n- You're own spaceship. well ofc you need to have that if you will be able to explore an solar system. duh..\n\n- 3 view styles: Top-Down, Third-Person and First-Person.\n\n- Being able to create your own guardian.\n\n- Local-Coop, if you're an person that likes to play games with some buddies\n\n- Many diffrent creatures and dinosaurs that will be added constantly to the game.\n\n- Trading. Yay.\n\n- Weather patterns in each specific biome. like tornados and stuff like that. yay tornados.\n\n- And finally... Its not pay 2 win. So freaking many rpg games out there is pay 2 win. but yeah this game you will be able to get the in-game currency ION, to shop the stuff you like.

The actual game mechanics are fun aswell.\n\nlet me talk about the bad things, but rest assured the only bad things are cosmetic issues that I would like to be fixed:\n- I would like to see the UI/HUD vastly improved, at the moment it looks far too simplistic, with many items on screen having a simple slightly opaque border. this goes for the health bars, and the main menu. It all looks too plain.\n- I understand recycling sounds is easy to do, but I think we can all agree that the same annoying sound of the dinos chewing on the ship is infuriating. Please add differing noises and sounds for things e.g. footsteps, biting. Maybe even add a crunchy noise when you land after using your jetpack\n\nThe only technical issue I can fault is the lack of servers outside of the US. I live in Britain though, and have felt no lag so maybe the issue isn't that big.

GOO makes his older brother Orion:Prelude both proud and outdated.\n\nIt shuffles the already great formula Prelude had for a coop game mixing it with great RPG-like additions such as crafting and gear, and a more strategic/less "cheap-friendly" gameplay brougth by the new bird's view camera and the pulished mechanics.\nThe level up sistem got a total reboot and, at it is now even with is numerous flaws, is a total step forward.\n\nGuardians of Orion is one hell of a promise and must be followed with a much deserved expectation. TREK did a great job on a 1 dolar basis. Now they aim a little higher. Give this game a chance, play it with friends, and don't throw it away on the first flaw you encounter. It is greater than what it seems at first glance.\n\nPROS\nGreat cooperative gameplay, fun and challenging\nEnjoyable experience even around 250ms (i'm from Argentina)\nGood leveling up system and to-be-deeper customization, crafting and stat system\nNeat visuals and graphic performance. Way more solid and stable than on Prelude\nCONS\nServers' availability (US east and US west only at the moment of review)\nNavigation on menus could be greatly improved, in particular those meant to be integrated with Steam.\nThe menus themself could use a nice upgrade\nMuch less graphic options than in Prelude, meaning less flexibility\nI feel putting EARLY ACCESS issues on the "CONS" of the game, would be unfair for the dev team, as they are aware of many of the faults of their game and they are addressing them now thanks to the activity on official forums and continous community feedback.\nEarly Access flaws include:\nMinor rendering bugs\nMinor occasional framerate drops\nGlitched and unstable start up (may take a try or two to get the game running)\nMinor sync problems when creating lobbys\nPerk, stats, gear upgrades not working properly in some cases\nP.S.: english is not my native language","March 7","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has guardians which you pick from to play with and its easily playable offline and an additional online.\nThe game is good at this stage and is getting a brighter future ahead as the devs explain.\nI definitely recommend for anybody for either full price or on sale.\n\n\n\nBELOW SOME CONFESSIONS AND THINGS TO KEEPS FOR THE DEVS!\nNow I plan to play more of this game but hear me out Devs!!!!!!\n\nSo......\nPLEASE FIX/REMOVE ONLINE PLAY! Alrighty it works don't worry its fine. I mean for Australian servers so.  THANK YOU!\n\nPLEASE FIX UI ELEMENT! The controller buttons appearing everywhere should be a option that can be turned off.\n\nPLEASE FIX UI ELEMENT FOR OFFLINE. The reliance on local play is too big offline, make the game settings bigger.\n\nPLEASE CREATE MORE DIVERSE MAPS? Maybe more ruins or a city or more hills and less flat land like Orion Prelude???\n\nPLEASE REVAMP THE ART FOR THE GUARDIANS! Make them the same art and not from previous game.  THANK YOU!\n\nTRY TO PLEASE ADD IN FIRST PERSON! I know, I know but make it an option.  NEVERMIND!\n\nMAKE MORE GAMEMODES FAST! Somethings need another twist. I don't know, maybe a campaign?\n\nSOME COLLISIONS BETWEEN HARVESTER AND DINOSAURS! Really ruins the game when you see a dinosaur go through the harvester when your trying to repair it.\n\nPLEASE KEEP THE BROKEN ELEMENTS WHEN YOUR DAMAGED. Cracked screen, keep.\n\nYeah, MORE VARIETY IN GAMEPLAY. As cheesy as this sounds, it needs more. Offline I couldn't find more than 2 gamemodes and thats it.

My pc is definitely in the minimum requirement, but is that how bad the minimum requirement looks? Everything looks really bad on Low settings. I know how its supposed to look really beautiful with proper pc build, but good god if you have a pc that falls into the minimum requirement of this game, you should probably reconsider.\n\nAll in all, I love this game, I would love it even more if the minimum requirement actually represents the reality of running this game on such system, because at this point its almost like a false hope. I know its an early access game, but I think this is something that the devs might probably want to work on; with the minimum requirement all I got is 20 Fps and everything is nothing but blurs.\n\nAnd before someone goes, "Hey man its just your potato that sucks balls, throw it into the sea and go get a good one", Hey guys, I bought this game because the minimum requirement says that I would be able to run this game just fine, when the reality is the other way around. All Im asking at this point is maybe there would be a fix to this, or at least change up the Minimum requirement thats laid out on here.\n\nAight guys, and devs working at Trek Industries and Spiral Game, this is an awesome game, and I just want this game to be a whole lot awesomer.

And i thank them for keeping my faith with indie-development.\n\nThere first game later became a success and i really recommend it.

This game if played with a group is so much fun.  I don't wanna see a developer that really put something interesting together not get rewarded for that.  At two dollars this really is the most fun you can have and the thing is if they really do come through with some of the other stuff they are proposing I think the game can only get more feature rich which is a good thing.\n\nThe negatives are simply that the game right now doesn't have zillions of players and if they don't get players then the game won't be the fun it could be.  There is solo play but its dull in comparison to playing a mix of classes together.  The other thing right now is the itemization is a bit confusing level wise but I hear thats being addressed.  It is also early access so not all the content is in place and really right now I feel like the main menu needs a class tab where you can tweak your characters between rounds, as is you need to enter a game to make changes it seems.\n\nI recommend it the mechanic of switching between overhead view and third person really is cool.  I know many were mad they didn't go with the first person view like Orion but the switching between third person and overhead really is seemless and works well for this type of game.","February 7","true","12.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I don't think I did.\nThis game is pretty good, it does need some work though. I would really like some sort of laser sight to see what you are aiming at easier in the top-down view. I also think the crafting and skills should be able to be acsessed outside of an actual match, but the devs probably have a reason for this. This game reminds me of a mixture between Killing Floor, Halo, an old game called SAS: Zombie Assault, but with dinosaurs. It is rather easy to solo, but you don't get as many chances to get good loot, so I would probably reccomend playing with a group.

It has guardians which you pick from to play with and its easily playable offline and an additional online.\nThe game is good at this stage and is getting a brighter future ahead as the devs explain.\nI definitely recommend for anybody for either full price or on sale.\n\n\n\nBELOW SOME CONFESSIONS AND THINGS TO KEEPS FOR THE DEVS!\nNow I plan to play more of this game but hear me out Devs!!!!!!\n\nSo......\nPLEASE FIX/REMOVE ONLINE PLAY! Alrighty it works don't worry its fine. I mean for Australian servers so.  THANK YOU!\n\nPLEASE FIX UI ELEMENT! The controller buttons appearing everywhere should be a option that can be turned off.\n\nPLEASE FIX UI ELEMENT FOR OFFLINE. The reliance on local play is too big offline, make the game settings bigger.\n\nPLEASE CREATE MORE DIVERSE MAPS? Maybe more ruins or a city or more hills and less flat land like Orion Prelude???\n\nPLEASE REVAMP THE ART FOR THE GUARDIANS! Make them the same art and not from previous game.  THANK YOU!\n\nTRY TO PLEASE ADD IN FIRST PERSON! I know, I know but make it an option.  NEVERMIND!\n\nMAKE MORE GAMEMODES FAST! Somethings need another twist. I don't know, maybe a campaign?\n\nSOME COLLISIONS BETWEEN HARVESTER AND DINOSAURS! Really ruins the game when you see a dinosaur go through the harvester when your trying to repair it.\n\nPLEASE KEEP THE BROKEN ELEMENTS WHEN YOUR DAMAGED. Cracked screen, keep.\n\nYeah, MORE VARIETY IN GAMEPLAY. As cheesy as this sounds, it needs more. Offline I couldn't find more than 2 gamemodes and thats it. I can guess it gets boring after a while but its ok with Survival and Harvester.\n\nREMOVE THE LOW GRAPHICS. They look terrible and have no need to be here. Meduim should be low and so on.

A fun shooter without much meat around it, but good enough to keep me going for a few hours.\nGuardians of Orion (EDIT: Now The Orion Project) is not that. It's so much more.\nPlay it top-down or in 3rd person. Play with friend, play alone. Slaughter (now survive) or survive (now harvest). Play with a controller or with kb and mouse.\nIn my own experience I've found the controller to be great fun in top-down action and a single survival game can often last up to three hours.\n\nGOO (EDIT: Now PO :) ) is a great twin-stick shooter with a very (very) active dev that listens and responds (even to the tiniest things). Since the day I purchased it when I first saw it appear on Steam to now I've already seen incredible changes. Can't wait to see more.\n\nBeing a fan of Orion Prelude I have a lot of faith in this game and will support it all the way. The devs have a real passion for what they're doing here and with big plans.\nI didn't buy this game on $1 sale like many others, I paid the full price and it's been completely worth it. When it did go on $1 sale though I bought a bunch of copies and gifted them to friends, because they need to play this.\n\nSo, as the game is right now, is it worth buying? You bet. It's immensely fun with a leveling system that feels like you're working hard to earn XP but somehow never feels like a grind. It just has the right balance.\n\nThe weapons are fun and from what I've seen seem quite balanced. The classes are different enough to give each player something that suits their own style. Come the patch on 25 April 2016 they added some more impressive content like character customisation and complete level overhauls.\nI've read a few people had optimisation issues, but honestly I'm not sure how. I've got a three year-old pc and it runs on mine like it does in the trailer. They're not lying.\n\nKeep up the good work devs...and people of Steam, give this one a try.","April 22","true","25.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Solid topdown or third person shooter, four player or single player dino killin fun for just about any newish pc or modern laptop. The object of the game is to protect your harvester by killing dinos and upgrading your hero with the blue gold. There are multiple heros and guns and dinos and levels or maps. Each hero has at least one unique ability, There is so much planned for this game that I cannot express it in an TLDR.\n\nThis game is a mix between a very accessible topdown twin stick dino shooter and a very solid TPV/FPV dino shooter. With many planned features or modules in the works. I would expect to have bugs and small issues until most of the planned features of The Orion Project universe are added. Then the process of optimization begins. This game is worth ten dollars right now as is but for a short time you can get it for one dollar!\n\nSome planned features\nSpace based city with housing.\nPlanets.\nYour own space ship.\nMechs, just like Orion prelude but this time with at least three types.\nHoardes of dinos!!!!!! (At least ten so far)\nGuns. (implemented)\nClass based heros, female and male.(implemented)\nGrenades (implemented)\nVehicles.\nOpen world/universe.\nTrek store (where all things can be purchased with money earned in game or real money if you desire)\n\nI like this game because its innovative, has a roadmap, sticks to it goals like superglue, and listens to the gamers.. wait that might be the developers I'm talking about.","February 6","true","49.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

That's the game.\n\nI had hopes for this game getting a fix with the issues it has with BitDefender and Windows Defender as well. It is not a priority for the Devs right now and doesn't seem like it will be. I did have this game working briefly and the little time I was able to put into it got boring pretty quick. There is not much to the game even though it is early access. Unless there is a fix for poeple using these particular anti-viruses, I would save your money for something else. Even if this game did work for me it is not worth $20. I would say at most $8-$10 max and thats being generous. I think the biggest let down for this game was the support from the devs. I think the ocmmunity spent more time trying to solve this issue then they did.","December 14, 2015","false","4.3"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","4"

The topic is listed under general discussion rather than as a sticky under a Event/Promotion thread. After a few days and countless posts later you wouldn't even know there was even such a promotion unless you heard it in game.\n\nI don't think the majority of gamers on steam would actively read the discussion forums on a new game much less during a free to play weekend.\n\nIt does seem rather sore of them to say no you missed the cutoff, you were supposed to log in before the deadline even if you bought the game during the event. I would think rather than to deny buyers that bought the game prior to the deadline their status; they should allow them their founder status due to a small technicality to promote their player base.\nIt's a posted discussions, it's an advertised news announcement and it's in the beginning of nearly every trailer we've made since announcing it.\n\nYour Events/Promotion suggestion is a good idea and would be better suited for the suggestions thread, but acting like we talk about it one and done is crap.\n\nAll that being said, a minimal and fractional number of the gaming population visits forums or interacts on anything deeper than playing the actual game.  Most people never watch the trailers/videos, check the news or read the forums so it affects very few to begin with/\nReplied to a general discussion thread "Founder Status" in favor of granting a group of people that paid for the game during an event period their founder status and benefits, but failed to create an account prior to the deadline period. Gave an example of how certain promotions were not being advertised well and how it can be fixed rather easily. Tried to hint that a happy playbase promotes more advertising by way of "word of mouth" through existing members. That in return would increase playbase and the possiblity of increased microtransactions which is the path this developer is taking the game through.\n\nHowever the developer replied in accusation and complete defense. That was my first and only post on the orion project discussion forum. I understand some developers are passionate about their work but a tactless developer can be detrimental to their products and how the gaming base and community grows. That's why companies as well as celebrities hire public relation firms to oversee their customer departments and twitter accounts. (Viewers feel free to read more of his responses on the orion project discussion forums and see for yourself*) I understand that its taxing to deal with certain individuals on a giving basis but its a completely different matter when you're representing something. I didn't my comment was attacking anyone but if I were you should still have been the bigger man. That's the position you're suppose to assume so that others will support you no matter how outrageously demanding or rather reasonable players can be.\n\nThe orion project is a decent short term time waster. Still early with the usual "early access" bugs and low playerbase. Teamwork is going to be key. Unfortunately due to the developer's general nature and his future plans for the game I will not be playing any further. I have a feeling he'll reply to this and defend his statements. I'll leave it as is and move on.\n\nThe Orion Project\nGame Rating 4/10\n\nbugs so far:\n- players stuck in terrain\n- incorrect loadout going into map\n- out of bounds respawn\n- large dinos can be trapped in terrain permanently\n- infinite ammuntion bug present without the use of legendary augment (can be manipulated)\n- no hud bug during\n- drop pod stays on the ground for the entire duration of match\n\ncomments:\n- lower body in first person mode looks sluggish, movement does not look realistic when paired with upper body\n- multiple slow time phases interrupts the momentum of gaming (General mixed feelings on forum)\n- drops are not highlighted in minimap (creating a pet that picks up loot will not solve this problem*)\n- needs an option to display a large map of the environment while ingame (can solve drop highlight problem and help navigate terrain to find mobs during redikculous chest wave*)\n- keyboard bindings are not optimally placed.

The trailer certainly looked nice, but when the game is launched, it totally seizes up. Apparently, it recognizes my craptop as a high-end computer, as the visual settings were automatically on super high. Even when I set them to low, the game had constant skips in it. The audio was constantly bugging; even selecting things in the menus was glitchy. The last game was like this too, but I guess development has been abandoned on that. I couldn't even get to play the main game, but walking around was okay. It's sort of like a MOBA or something. I readied up and the game crashed. Fix the bugs and we'll be good. But for now, I'm not too fond of it.","February 28","false","0.2"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

This game gets repetitive and boring very fast. Spent 30 mins on it and they were the most boring 30 mins I had this week. There is a lack of action. Don't even bother with solo, you will get bored in first 5 minutes. When playing online with 3 other players, you get like 15 seconds of action and then you wait for almost a minute for next wave of dinos. There is nothing to do when waiting except running around and doing nothing. And it goes in a loop like this. Probably the same applies when playing with friends. Some guns (like shotgun) are too OP. Spoke with other players in team chat, they agreed with everything I just wrote. Can't think of any good aspects of this game. 3 words: Repetitive, boring, confusing. Can't recommend this game to anyone.\n\n10/10 would buy waiting simulator again.","February 8","false","0.5"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","3"

On lowest settings  (literally pixel graphics) with 6gb ram and 2gb video card i had like max 12-15fps in third person. And still there's stuff like disconnect issues resulting in your character lvl rollback etc. There are also bugs. I dont mind ping being high since it doesnt affect the gameplay much. However, I checked their patchnotes, it's ok that they focus on releasing content like 2 new classes, but come on, first of all at least make the game playable without fps lag, disconnects and other bugs, and then focus on contents. And yes the content is kinda limited too - only like 4 maps, limited skills and guns to each class makes this game boring very quickly. It's ok that you introduce inventory system and crafting, and that you look in the future to make a first person mode and introduce more classes, but for now this game is not worth its price (unless you buy it on sale for like 2-3 euros like i did). Im not even discussing that this game is almost 4 months old and there are less than 700 reviews (not enough promotion done), and online at the very best you gonna find like 5-6 rooms hosted and like 20-30 people playing. I know it's early access and the game looks promising, but the devs are obviously doing something wrong, or not doing good enough.","March 14","false","92.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","1"

Technically, the game runs, you can shoot dinosaurs, pick up loot, play co-op, spend skill points and all that.  It just isn't fun.  The guns are weightless and pretty boring to use, the dinosaurs aren't particularly interesting or well-animated, the loot system is pure stat-boosts, so it's not particularly interesting, and the skill trees are just stat boosts as well, meaning what you get at the beginning is what you have at the end, too.

It's a little dull at the moment because of the current lack of playerbase but that should pick up as the game develops and I hope it does pick up because this is the sort of game that will hopefully be easy to play in a relaxed fashion with friends and online players alike.\n\nThe current price tag is probably only worth paying for if you're keen to support the devs and want to contribute to the Early Access development because at the moment, there's not a huge amount here. There's a solid foundation including 4 classes with different weapons, a couple of game modes, nice graphics and lovely music. I was surprised to find the third person gameplay handling quite well as I was a bit skeptical about that and overall all the controls are fine, no issues there.\n\nSo the only thing I can see lacking so far really is content and playerbase, which will come in time.

Online with friends is clearly the best way to play, but if you find yourself gunning solo like myself, you won't be disappointed. Fun character skill tree mixed with twin-stick gunning goodness makes for a fun romp. Jetpack gameplay adds some (very limited) verticality that adds to the overall experience. Great sci-fi feel to the game.\n\nCurrently this game feels like a good way to kill 30 or 45 minutes in its current early access state. Felt satisfied with my $10 purchase on this alone.\n\nEDIT: The third person mode recently went live. It's not my favorite thing on earth (video below, shameless plug), but it proves that the dev is constantly listening to community feedback and responding quickly with updates that the community wants.

And at very first sight of actual gameplay, I was slightly disappointed to have realized its a top down shooter, not really my cup of tea, but after learning about the F1 button being the perspective switch, I might have decided to give it a better chance. That however doesn't help the fact just how clunky the controls are and how lame the gunplay is all in all.\n\nBut however, this doesn't really stop me from believing that the developers behind the game will do everything in their power to provide the best experience possible, fixing glitches, bugs, improving the AI (or at least I hope they manage that). This may sound oddly forgiving, I know, but I trust that these developers will do whatever they can, judging from the amount of people who have told that they make frequent updates to the game with numerous fixes and such. Plus, considering this is another project from the same studio which have got quite the praise of their sci-fi dino shooters, I'd much prefer to keep myself on the optimistic side believing the devs will actually fulfill their promises of an open world dino shooter thing-of-a-jig (which I myself am really hoping to see soon), hence why I will be giving this a thumbs up, just to keep the spirit strong.\n\nBut seriously guys, fix your AI, and your bugs, and give us maybe less clunky controls and maybe more feeling to the guns, otherwise its as I already said will feel just completely lame.","April 26","true","6.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It is played in a top-down perspective, and so far has been very enjoyable. It is early access, so there are improvements to be made, and obviously more content is to be added at a specified date, but this is fine as the devs have set a schedule for releases. So far as of Dec 2015, the game is fairly fluid, and runs well on my mid-range PC. There are 3 classes, assault, recon and support, with their respective skill trees and preset loadouts. Assault has a full-auto rifle and a pistol, and has a jetpack. Recon has a 3-round SMG and a auto pistol, and can cloak. Support has a shotgun and a heavy pistol, and has a drop-shield-style ability capable of healing all allies in its radius. Enemies are fairly varied, and range from tiny dinosaurs that are hard to hit, to rolling robot orbs that chuck grenades at you. Game is enjoyable, and has a lot of potential to expand into a really great game.\n\n8.5/10, for current build\n\nEDIT: The january update has added a lot of new content to the game, including a third-person mode and a new class. We have been promised a new guardian every month, and so this game has significantly improved.","December 6, 2015","true","15.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played 3 games solo before being joined by other players.\nAs each player joined the difficulty went up - the scaling is awesome - well done!\nSame Skill Trees (Almost) for all three types?\nReply: Yeah this is a biggee - The class types remind me of Global Agenda - Down to the coloring of the armor.\nI'm hoping to see more specialised skill trees giving each of the 3 classes a choice in Melee, Ranged, Support/Stealt/Tank options.\nPros: Runs awesome - No glitches for me so far and running Max everything. Not too happy with the cracked visor on damage but - HEAL!!! and it goes away lol.\nEasy to use controls and fast setup.\nIntuitive gameplay with the most commonly used buttons already mapped. E for use, G for grenade etc.\nLow price to start - This game is worth every cent, and if the developers continue to improve - ie - add a story arc, more weapons/tree/skills, even dare I say a "store" option where you spend ingame creds earned (NO PAY For DLC PLS GUYS! - how about a game thats made this millenium where the creators are more interested in customer base than profits?), I dare say this could be the new DOTA - especially if we get to play Dino eventually. Hint hint wink wink nudge nudge...\nAll in all This game has one of the best possibilities of every game I've seen this year - If it isn't screwed with too much.\nEven for Early Access, this game ranks at 7/10 Dragons for me.","December 4, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And whilst there still needs to be more variety to the gameplay and depth to the classes, what really stands out is the development. Lots has been changed, added and made better in the short period I've owned it, and what's to come sounds even more exciting.\n\nI'd definitely pick this game up while you can still get founders status (before May 2016) and if you do so during the upcoming steam free play event you can try it and then buy it and get founders status for only a dollar (later the game will be a dollar but you won't get all the perks). If you're on the fence I'd strongly suggest reading the community posts about what's upcoming in the game (like an open world in v1.6) sounds pretty rad to me, I didn't get it for as cheap as a dollar and I'm very happy that I picked it up.","April 22","true","242.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've always been a HUGE fan of the Sci-Fi/RPG genre, and i've never found any game that reached my desires.. but I found this game a few months back, and I was watching it, but then about 2 months ago (as of April 26, 2016) I saw that they started to change the game completely.. I loved it, and I just watched it change, and change into a better game.. So, it went on sale 2 days ago (as of April 25, 2016) and I bought it for 1$, I had my friend try and and I bought him the game too, so I hope that this game reaches it's full potential, and i'll always support the devs...\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAlright, the gameplay is hands-down awesome, I mean.. who doesn't want to shoot robots/dinos in a futuristic Sci-Fi scene, and the fact that it's SO EASY to make a server with you and your friends amazes me, but I give the gameplay 9.1/10 because there are still some bugs that can be made.\n\nSOUNDTRACK/AUDIO:\nOkay, I LOVE this soundtrack.. In the space hub, it's so calm and relaxing, I could just listen to it all day.. and the music hypes you up when you play in-game, because it's got a rock feeling to it, but it's not rock/heavy metal.. I just don't know how to explain how beautiful the sound track(s) are. I give it a 10/10.\n\nCOMMUNITY:\nThis is probably the best community out there, because I ALWAYS see new players, and they ask stuff like "How do I play?" or "Where do I go?" and everyone always answers so nicely. 10/10.\n\nPLAYER ROLES:\nAlright, they could use a bit of nerfing for classes such as the Marksman because his fire rate is VERY slow to me, but overall they're very well set up. 8.6/10.\n\nSKILL TREE/SKILLS:\nOkay, this is a DECENT engine for this type of thing, but it could use a LOT of enhancement.. It gets the job done, but it's very basic, and seems a little plain.. 7.8/10.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nYes, the game is VERY pretty, but it doesn't need a strong PC to run the "Super High" settings, and I still get 250ish FPS in-game/hub for such a pretty game.. (Check profile for PC specs if you wanna know mine) but the game could use a bit of tweaking for some of the lighting rendering errors (or maybe just me), but overall it's great. 9.8/10.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOverall, is this game worth 10$? Yes. Buy it, and support the devs.. They're very caring of their community, and are striving for the best out of the game, but if it goes on sale, buy a few copies for your friends and tell them to try it! But, I really can't wait for the full game, when it'll be like Star Citizens, but with littler things, but the things such as full space exploration is what I can't wait for.. I rate this game 9.6/10.

The third person works well, although I am still excited to see the first person module in practice. So worth the price, even in its current incomplete state.\n\nGet it now before Founder status goes away!\n\nI don't do early access games as a rule because a lot of devs are pretty untrustworthy, and it's a lot easier to have good ideas and sell that to rubes than it is to make a thing that does what they actually want. That said, these guys have really won me over-- Prelude is a lot of fun, pretty much distilling what makes a wave defense game a good time and leaving everything else out, which is fine by me.\n\nSo, when I saw the push these devs were making so that they could stay working on this game, I broke my own rule for the dollar buy-in price. I know they'll see it through. Plus, even just looking through these reviews you can see people having their suggestions implemented, and the devs are keeping the updates coming, and have some seriously good stuff coming down the pipeline-- I can't wait for the First Person Module, for example. That alone would be worth the cost of the game, as the scenery is so pretty and the dinosaurs look so good, is seems like a shame to be in third person, away from the action.\n\nAnyway, I've got high hopes and real faith that these guys will pull something out of this that's worth a lot more than the dollar I threw in when they needed it.","March 7","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

They only charge $1, and seem to be extremely promising on taking this game beyond Planet Side 2 scale, and beyond Battle Fields player size...\n\nThe initial way to get in a game and access your items is not very user friendly, but after you learn it.

From what I played I can see great potential. The combat feels better than Orion:Prelude and the different cameras are satisfying to shoot from. Maybe it will turn into Diablo with dinosaurs, maybe a microtransactions hell, but for the price I'd say you will get your money's worth.","February 8","true","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sure it's Early Access right now and a lot needs to be done but I feel that this will be my favorite top down shooter (besides HellDivers). This game looks really good right now in Third-Person perpective in relation to the fact that this is a Top-down shooter. Gameplay is smooth but a bit lackluster right now as there is no limited ammo so you don't really need to use the pistol at all. I'm sure limited ammo will be implemented before the game goes live. Hopefully the shop buildings from Prelude will make it into the game as well. There's only two game modes right now and they play pretty much the same. There's also only two difficulties that I had access to anyway which is easy and normal and normal was pretty easy so I imagine easy is a walk in the park. I haven't really touched the skill trees or crafting system so I can't comment on those yet.

I like the idea of the starcraft-like top view, but it needs a first person camera angle as well.  The over the shoulder 3rd person just doesn't work so well.

I mean, you run around shooting dinosaurs and robots, how could it be bad? The gameplay is fun and fast paced, the engine the game runs on works smoothly and the differnt ways to play and upgrades you can choose keep the game fresh. There are few things I think that could be changed or added to make the game better which are: The break time in between each wave is too long, shorten it from 1 minute to 15-20 seconds so everyone has to time their special skills better and use time healing better so you can get everyone to full health before the next wave comes. Also, maybe take away the heal guns ability to heal the user, make it so it can replenish shields by right clicking, but make it so you can't heal yourself so more teamplay is required. You might want to keep the self heal in solo mode however. And finally, (i know the game is still in development) just add a storyline, the possiblity for a solo campaign is a good one. That's all I have to say, hope the devs notice this so yeah. That's it.","February 7","true","19.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is definitely not the 'ultimate space adventure and combat video game for PC'. There's no open world or persistant universe, no galaxy to travel either. Not yet anyways.\n\nThere's no tutorial or any sort of introduction whatsoever.\nThe game seems to be made for people with gamepads, or at least that's my first impression.\nYou see a gamepad control layout every time you load a map.\nI don't even have a gamepad and I don't see why I'd want to use it for a game like this. Why shove it in my face?\n\nGameplay is boring as hell. You can either shoot dinosaurs and robots, or NOT shoot dinosaurs and robots.\n\nThe class system and character progression remind me too much of Firefall. Firefall was silly, imho (don't even get me started).\n\nIn Firefall you have several battleframes (character classes) which you have to level up separately, and they're very limited in what they can do. That's a lot of grind. Why not make it so your character and his profession evolve independant from each other or something?\n\nWill wait for further updates. I kinda want this game to accomplish what Firefall could not.","April 25","false","1.8"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","20","42","0","0"

It's a nice looking game I guess. I had beef with Prelude but me and a few buds had some good fun out of it, this game doesn't have any of the positives of Prelude. It's made for the top-down view and you can tell. Shooting isn't as good, movement isn't, obviously no vehicles in current state. Game isn't much of a game in it's current shape, especially the terrible item/crafting system that was just poorly done. Optimization is bad, lots of sound loops, lots of stugger and lag on a rig that can max Far Cry 4 and Fallout 4, even when I lower settings on this game it just glitches out. Had to restart the game 4 times before it would finally log in online, lots of people report this problem. Overall a technical nightmare in current form. What will TOP be like in a year? Not sure, maybe good. That's the main reason I put $1 down on this game, evntually it might be alright. $1 isn't much of a risk.","April 26","false","1.6"," 19 of 40 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","19","40","0","5"

I'm excusing the bugs and frame rate because that is expected in Early Access and though they are there this is not what affected me most. The game has no life in it right now, it's very bare bones and the bones aren't much fun. The game feels empty, like it has no heart.  Basically all the mechanics need tuned, tweaked or tossed for something new. There are all kinds of game mechanics that could be cool but none of them feel..."Juicy." I'd rather see what is in the game now tweaked and tuned instead of new content added.\n\nI have no problem with marketplace content being used but The new space station is actually an example scene pre built from an asset pack with a few pieces changed. It may be place holder but to me it's kind of lazy when it was not designed for this game. Take the pieces and block out one that is set up for this game.\n\nTry checking back later or pick the game up when its on sale. Maybe things will change.  It's a good concept and I hope to see it improve because it could be really fun.

(this is most likely a pety complaint but still being able to hear is nice!)\n3rd: movement is still only ment for top-down 3rd person feels too constricted. (The rol lis terrible no point of using it too delayed)\n4th: Better UI structure overall (honestly game's ui looks like a rip of any menu)\n5th: This is a pet-peeve but make the cross-hair not your menu cursor it gets lost in the colour.\n6th: Explanation of things going on I looked at the videos and played the game and I was strait confused.\n7th: Game is a very basic shooter (Though I expect gunplay and all that too be so much better as it currently is)\n8th: Whats up with the controller only controls when the game loads either have both keyboard/mosue and controller or just get rid of it!\n9th: I have no clue what I'm doing since there is just too much put to you without explanation some tool-tips would be nice\n\nPros:\nGame Functions for me\nNo FPS drops (I use 980ti idk about other cards)\ngame has a ton going for it\n\nCons:\nGun play is boring to say the least\neverything is way too basic to make sence of things\nObjectives are either defend thing or go do a time limit thing (make those shorter honestly you can beat them in less than five mins)\ngraphic options are limited I put everything maxed and the game looks like a blur\nsounds are off abit\nGame UI is bad and basic looks like a mobile port for the buttons\ngame is just very basic overall (there are crafting, skill trees, and equips)\nCrafting because thats what the cool games are doing (not saying it's bad but is felt forced in for no reason)\nCurrently desc/videos/pictures lie about how the game's current status is.\n\nMy finalish thouights on the game:\nIt's MEH it's not the worst thing I played nor is it the best they are promissing something huge and even making it and a sweet 90% discount but... the game in it's current state feels like a arcade game pop a quarter in play with 3 lives stop playing. NOW what makes me question is Why change this game? it doesnt seem logical to me just change a top-down shooter to this now propsed awesome space sifi game that is ment to be crazy. It's feels like too much to belive for me.\nNow do I doubt they will make a flop again  Yes oh god YES  well actually I think they might havea chance to make something great but they just gotta not have another flop.\n\nNow for my current rating of the game: 2.3/5 needs huge amount of work but it is a game and it is playable\n\nI just can't suggest you get it in it's current state (my review will change as the game evolves)","April 25","false","0.6"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

This is a failed diablo clone. I get that it's early access but it feels more like a flash game then a game you spend money on. It shouldn't even be called Orion because it has only one thing in common with orion. It has dinosaurs.\nIn this game your in an overhed view as opposed to the classic first person of orion. In the original orion you would go in teams of four against hordes of dinosaurs trying to destroy your generator or something and it was fun. You could feel the stuggle at times, you could feel the role each of the classes played and you felt like you were hunting dinosaurs. It mixed the fun of dinosaurs with the combat of something like halo or left 4 dead.\n\nBut in this game your in a team of 4 in an endless escort mission. You know those really annoying mission from games where you escort the annoying character that serves little to no purpose and just constantly dies resulting in a game over. Thats this game. So to go into detail remember how in orion you were in a constant struggle and all the classes served a purpose. In this game if you choose the assault class you win. Literally you can stand in one spot and as long as you point the gun in the right direction no matter the dinosaur it dies( excluding the t-rex) yeah real exciting. It's like stomping on ants except you have to shoot the ant's with a machine gun except way less cool and fun. Anyways so you go further in the game and youll notice that after 1-2 hits your screen starts cracking up and the first thing that pops into your head is, I CANT SEE ♥♥♥♥! because you literally cannot see unless your constantly moving your head. Not only is this annoying but it also makes no sense. This is a third person game so why are there first person screen effects. So anyways as you go on you finally get a new mission and the title "Hunt the t-rex" or something like that so you think to yourself oh hey that actually sounds cool so you run up to it start shooting it and realize you do almost nothing to it. Then it throws an undodgeable rock at you and you instantly die. Now the respawn time is a problem in itself. if you get injured you have to wait 40 seconds before you bleed out which is good for multiplayer but if your on single player its a waste of time there needs to be a way to suicide because the dino's dont attack you in that state. Then once you die you have to wait another 40 seconds before you respawn. Then when you respawn you have to sit through a 10 second tease of almost orion gameplay. Then you try the t rex again realize you still cant hurt him wait another 2 minutes switch your class not do anything to him and give up.\n\nIn conclusion this game feels empty and has a long way to go before it can compete with my dino candies and if your looking for a new orion game go to the corner store and spend your ten bucks on some dino candies and those little sponge dinosaurs that soak up the water and get bigger.","March 5","false","0.8"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","0"

Took forever just to figure out how to play, since first it wasn't working right to start a game, then there was nothing to do in offline mode but run around, then in online play you have to run around a maze just to find the console to interact with to start the actual game. Then you spend about 80-90% of your time standing/running aound either waiting between waves or running to intercept the dinos only to "battle" them for a few seconds then go back to waiting. And while I realize graphics aren't everything, they are pretty lousy, especially compared to the video which claims the footage is 100% real-time, whatever that means (I thought it meant gameplay footage, but it's clearly not, so I don't know what they're trying to claim). And the gameplay is nothing like what's shown in the video either.

Doesn't change the very limited mechanics, but hey, take what you can get, I guess.\nSo, firstly, I think this should've been a first or third person shooter. A wave and class based shooter with strong team elements would have been way more interesting than yet another bird's eye twin stick.\nTo elaborate, there is a class with a jetpack. Because of the viewpoint, it's completely useless unless you're facing a boss that can actually catch up to you.\nSpeaking of bosses, most of them straight up cannot hit you. If you backpedal, they catch up to you, but the wind up takes too long, so you're completely safe. The only actual threats are normal enemies that don't suffer from this problem, and when bosses go for the harvester in a certain gamemode.\nAs far as I know, all classes have a regeneration gun that has no cooldown or charge. At any time, you can just whip it out, heal completely, heal the harvester, and lose nothing.\nAdding to this problem, the AI will sometimes just run away or go for the harvester alone, completely ignoring you. This isn't a problem, unless it's a boss that takes a ton of damage while it hits the harvester for a ton of damage. So, either you lose everything in one shot, or absolutely nothing mattered.\nMusic is either fine or terrible. It's either Linkin Park/Doom or Mirror's Edge. How it's implemented is also terrible. At the end of a round, the music just cuts to the Mirror's Edge track. It's jarring going from edgy butt-rock to soft pianos with a sudden cut in the middle.\nIn general, it's pretty boring. You get attacked by dinosaurs, but it's just some creature with no interesting combat elements. There are also humanoids who have guns, and they have mechs that have blade things, but neither of those shake anything up.\n\nTL:DR Should've been a different perspective, very dull, bad enemy movesets, dumb AI, unbalanced both ways seemingly at random, music isn't great.","April 27","false","0.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","6"

It's bright and vibrant and fits the themes of the levels very well. On that note, the level design is also great too. It's easy to move around and isn't too inconvienient to get to and from the side objectives and the harvester. The soundtrack is great and really gets the blood pumping as you destory waves of dinosaurs and robots. The controls are also very easy to learn (I played with a controller).\n\nThe multiplayer connection is also very stable and I had no connection problems, which is quite rare considering I live in Australia. The game is also well optimised, had no problems with fps either.\n\nAll in all this is a very nice game to play solo or online with some buddies, with that good ol' Orion feel.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/l3p3LcVA8UI","December 6, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

This one is kind of tricky. The game is built with a controller in mind, to the extent that I feel like this is probably something that's on console and ported over with little changes. For what it is, you might get some enjoyment out of it, and I'm rather happy I got to try it before I spent any money on it. (Though for a dollar, you can do far worse on Steam) The problem I suppose, is that the game is still in the early access stages. I feel like it's going to either improve, or stay in the limbo of being early access forever (thankfully it seems the former), but unfortunately my tastes are soured with the title and I see no real reason to come back to it. I would only recommend it to players using the Xbox controller, in particular, since it is optimized for that. Which turns out to be the detrimental downside of being a keyboard purist.

You choose a character and spawn at some kind of ship in an otherwise empty map. You can run around for a while and shoot but that's it. There's no enemies or anything. There's a thing at the top that says "READY UP R" but who knows what that really means. There's no way to interact with it. Maybe there's more to come? Wasn't enjoying it anyway, I hope I didn't pay much for this as I don't even remember how it ended up in my library. Entirely forgettable. Oh yeah, it thinks it's an Oculus Rift game but all it does is apply distortion to a single full-screen camera view. You'll need to disable your HMD to play this... game. If that's what this is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolrobbit/recommended/407840/","coolrobbit","Cool Robbit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolrobbit/","147 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's a co-op twin stick shooter/3PS (you can switch camera angles) that mostly resembles your typical zombie shooter in gameplay, but has the honor of hogging 4 times more resources while having 4 times less things to shoot at. Also, replace zombies with dinosaurs and the protagonists with Gears of War characters piloting Warframes, and tack on some arbitrary RPG elements for good measure. I blame Epic Games.\n\nSeriously though, if you're gonna have adjustable graphics settings, try to make them in a way that the game doesn't become completely unplayable if you turn them all the way down. I literally didn't notice what I was getting attacked by when the first wave of dinosaurs came because they looked like part of the scenery. Had to opt for running the game at 15 FPS to compensate. Hell, my laptop can run L4D2 perfectly, but Unreal Engine 4 put a stop to that real quick.\n\nIf you want a good twin stick shooter with slick controls and fast gameplay, go play Assault Android Cactus instead. If you want to shoot at things running at you quickly with friends without having to buy a $2000+ computer, play Left 4 Dead 2.\n\nNot even worth the $2 from the sale. I'd ask for a refund if it were over $5, but I can't be ♥♥♥♥♥.","February 10","false","0.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

You'll start the game one time and it will come up fairly quickly.  Other times, go watch some TV while you wait.  Same thing goes for going online.\n\nWhen browsing for a game to join, there are no options to filter games or to sort the list by any of the server properties (i.e. difficulty, ping, map, etc)\nAlso, while not a major issue, there is no keyboard support while trying to create a character in offline mode.\n\nI only managed to join a friend's game once and it must have been luck.  I repeatedly tried to connect up with my friend and the game refused to allow me to.\n\nI can't recommend this game at all at this point.  They continue to focus on content when the framework is severely broken.

The graphics are amazing for a game that has an "early access" tag (many fully developed games in the market aren't even close to the quality of the Guardians). The controls are abit odd to master in the keyboard-mouse scheme but are responsive and accurate although it works wonders as soon as you use a controller tbh. There are still issues to be resolved (no damage registered @ some waves, dodging away doesnt work as intended at times) but hey its the first step in an early access game that rocks and boy it's gonna make noise...","December 4, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The single player game is ok but the Multiplayer is where the party is at. In my video, I played with three friends and it was an absolute blast.\n\nI think something that would really take this game to the next level is if there was a co-op campaign that gave the game some purpose with friends, an objective of sorts that focuses your efforts as a team on a certain goal. That plus some tweaks to the skill tree would really turn this into a top notch game.\n\nLook forward to seeing what the future holds for Guardians of Orion.

Why I can't recommend the game. It's definitely the makings of a tragedy; the biggest work from the developer so far, yet it's praises go completely unsung. To me there just isn't a game here, only mechanics strung together. I should love this game. Dinsosaurs? Check. Explosions? Check. LOOT? Check. However, tossing this all togther doesn't a game make.\n\nThe trouble starts when you try to join a game. Single player? I'll pass, I know horde games. Survival isn't an option for a rookie straight off the boat. So multiplayer it is. Now to choose a server. Easy, medium or hard? OK, I get that, no explanation required. Item level, 1, 100, 500, 10 000 000? OK, this is getting out of my water. Modes? No clue at this point, just lemme shoot something.\n\nThen onto the next hurdle. Welcome to this planet. We call it this planet because we don't know what it is, where it is, or why we're here. Oh, nevermind, this is why you're here. Protect this toaster while it shines light on these rocks. Now I'm engaged! /s.\n\nDifficulty? Well, if you're starting at the bottom you are Rookie from Hell! The Rookinator. Rooknan the Gun Toting Barbarian. Seriously, you're shooting fully automatic laserplasma beams at cute little bunny dinosaurs, with cute little nicknames to boot. I don't need loot, I'M UNTOUCHABLE.\n\nOh, loot you say? Well, here is a bunch of . . . stuff. You know . . . things. They do stuff, definitely. That's why they're there. Dinosaur bones? Oh yeah, grab those. Goo! Oh yes, I want some goo. Can I wear it? . . . nope. Shoot it from my assault rifle? . . . nope. OK, screw this, this isn't loot. I'm just cleaning up after things now. I hate cleaning.\n\nFinally! We made it, wave 5 complete! We've paved the planet with the corpses of a handful of helpless bunnysaurs, and it only took us 20 seconds! Semperfi! Now what do we do? Wait? A minute you say? I guess the next tiny wave of bunnysaurs needs to steel themselves, so we can hurry up to the next coffee break between ripples- er waves.\n\nAnd now we've won! Time to celebrat- wait. Where did everyone go?\n\nTL;DR\nLots of mechanics that should be good, but didn't get a chance to meet eachother before they were glued together. The game is a reminder that a game like this could be tons of fun. Top Down Shooter you say? A bold move steve, let's see how this pans out.\n\n\n","February 7","false","0.6"," 22 of 47 people (47%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","47","22","47","6","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waygooknom/recommended/407840/","waygooknom","Discotech *in korea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waygooknom/","332 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNo more updates. This review will apply most to new nonfounder players. This game isnt worth more of my time. Take the review with a heap of salt if reading too far after May 25, 2016.\n\nMay 22\n\nAfter trying to contribute to the community, and voice an opinion that was in line with other players, I have found that this game has a toxic community (dev and hardcore players mostly). The devs encourage name-shaming (banned by Steam/its community). Yep, players on the Galactic Council now vote to punish other players, and it is announced (see first vote thread)\n\nThe have taken my opinions, which have been supportive, critical, and constructive, and responded in a manner that will not create a solid community. They have responded with rudeness unbecoming of a developer, even resorting to threatening a "time out" for our differing definitions. The devs are negatively enforcing the community.\n\nOn this basis alone, I cannot recommend this game. No one wants to be in a community of belittlers, and angsty people (IMO).\n\nPreviously, I said this game was worth the dollar, but only if you didn't want to buy into the extra content. However, with recent events (devs behavior),  I cannot recommend this game. Do yourselves a favor and play any number of FREE games, like TF2 or Dungeon Defenders 2.\n\nIf you really want this game, put it on your waiting list, and wait a few years when the time vs. value of this game evens.\n\nShould you think this won't apply to you, you may continue to read the rest of my review (which as of the 22/25th is IMO entirely true). The developers will deny there is a paywall, simply because they offer outrageous exchange rates and time requirements. Can't pay? You'll pay with precious time. No time? Pay with your wallet. No good balance. If you feel that spending 30-100 hours per class is acceptible (meaning you will spend at the lowest estimate about 200 hours to get just the major planned guardians, based on estimates in the Ion conversion thread), then please continue.\n\n-----\n\nMay 25\n\nThe developer has tried to make it clear that upcoming features will minimize the need to spend a lot of time earning ion for exchange, and in-game achievments will grant enough credits for casual players to earn an extra guardian or so. The x-rate of credits, and the credits from achievements, still won't prevent what I feel is a paywall. At the very least it still doesn't change the time vs value.\n\nIn 21 hours, I earned enough to buy one guardian. Any further credits will be the result of long boring grinds (see the forums for info on grinds). If I was not a founder? Even longer. That grind includes no other content! No gear for my guardian, no mats for crafting. You'll likely grind for drones, vehicles, pets, weapons, campaigns, hats, mats, etc... On the same levels. Doing the same thing.\n\nUse ion xchange? 21 hrs = 1mil = 100 cred. 1/100 of ONE guard. Thats a LOT of time or grind for a new player.\n\nA revelation appeared in the 2017 Campaign thread, which clarifies that campaigns will probably be store bought microtransactions (read thread).\n\nGoG thread popped up, where the dev was denied access to GoG on the basis of microtransactions In the thread he mentions a ballpark -easy math- figure of around $100 dollars (read thread) oobtained through what he calls unobtrusive means (microtransactions). But, that's all subject to change, as is repeatedly told to players.\n\n----\n\nMay 27\n\nSee Orion Prelude 2 thread where dev resorts to calling a player stupid multiple times in different ways, then bans him. This isn't toxic at all. /s\n\n-----\n\nI can't recommend this game.\n\nThe game itself is fine, It plays well. It is optimized. It was fun to play online (when it wasn't crashing or lagging). There is a lot planned, but that is where I begin to see some conflict.\n\n----\nWhat I do like about the game?\n+ After 20 hours, there is only one thing I can say that is good about this game.\n+ The graphics.\n\nWhat do I not like?\n\n-/-/-/-/-/ It's boring atm\n-/The music. I just turn it off and put my own music on. BUT lots of people like the music, so....\n-/ The in game voices\n-/I don't feel there is enough difference between the classes to spend time on leveling more than one. A few guns, a few skills, but it feels like classes still lack depth.\n-/The game has little depth. There are only a few levels, which are large. But you still end up bored because you always do the same thing. The dinosaurs don't vary per level (at least not that I can tell), and there are only a handful of sidequests.\n-/Hollow boring maps deserve their own section. Please don't move to an open world, if you can't make players want to be in the "closed" worlds.\n-/ Although there are lots of dinosaurs, they still all feel the same. Apart from the Trex, I use the same tactics for every single one.\n-/ Not very user friendly interface. Crafting is a pain. Take a peek at some games like Terraria for how to do a proper system.\n-/ Hit detection (for topdown) is pretty bad. I'm aiming left, but shooting right.\n\n----\n\nThe problem lies in the future of the game, the developers and their business plan. If you buy this game now, and likley in the future, you are going to\n\na) waste a lot of time trying to get money to buy new classes (conversion rates force players to spend inordinate amounts of time to buy any extra content - guardians, etc).\n\nb) or spend a ridiculous about of money - on top of your "dollar game" to buy future content. To buy the classes alone you could nearly buy a new release AAA title.\n\nc) deal with the developers making choices for the player, frequently changing their minds, and being told to deal with it.  I would consider the developers toxic.\n\nd) deal with a toxic player led community leader system that is supported by the devs  - which is already abusive to players.  The first name-shaming and punishment vote from the Galactic Council is an example\n\nIt's pretty obvious this is becoming a cash-cow. You buy into the game for cheap (nearly free), and then you are encouraged to spend money to get different classes, etc. You are told it's cheap, and there is a lot to do... But all those features feel hollow.  By the looks of things, what you need to buy is only going to pile up. When a game has a cash store for content in early access, that is a bad sign. To me, it feels like the devs are tacking on a form of DLC in EA.\n\nFinally, I feel there are some ethical issues with the devs. A few months back they encouraged players to buy the game. They pretty much came out and said development was going to halt, and that they were then going to sell it for a dollar. I bought it at that time thinking development was close to finishing, and I wanted to support the devs. Plus, I got a discount.\n\nThis is when they really decided to split founders access from regular players (May 2nd). While yes, people were told to activate their account online, any players who did pay a higher price or fund the game with the intent to help and didn't activate the game... Are now shafted by the devs. These people will have to resort to either buying the content that they payed for - taking the loss if they purchased the game at a higher price, or spending hours and hours playing to get ingame currency.\n\nWAIT!?  What about all that conent coming in the future? It still doesn't change that for me I feel the devs crossed a line with this tactic. I understand that there is the counterargument "well, you were told you had to do it before then." I just don't agree with it. I don't agree with advertising the game with benefits,  when you aren't really willing to give those benefits to the players .\n\nY'all know this is my review, my opinion, right? Read the threads mentioned and make your own decisions, or just browse the forums. Things change too, y'know.","May 21","false","21.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","6","15","3","12"

Game play looks more like old school GTA as it's a top down perspective instead of over the should like in the trailers.\nAlso, this is not an open world game. In fact it's the complete opposite. It's just a variety of arenas in which mobs spawn and you have to kill them. The arenas aren't even that big.\n\nEdit: After searching through the controls menus, I found out how to switch to the over the should perspective and it does look more like the trailers. On a controler it's depad down, which the help screen lists as "regen device."\nThat does not change the fact though that the About description is misleading. It lists planned features as though they are already a part of the game. I am aware that it is early access, but this game as it is currently is not open world. Regardless of what the developer's plans are the About Game does not reflect what you actually get when you download this title.","April 26","false","0.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tts3/recommended/407840/","tts3","TE5LA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tts3/","212 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI cannot recommend this game because, while it may be early in development, there is no excuse for basic controls not working as they should. If you reassign the ASWD keys to something like the Arrow Keys, you cannot strafe, which is absolutely essential in a shooter.\n\nGame developers should follow the basic rule:\n\n"Make it work, then make it better."\n\nI have been playing PC games for over 35 years. Something has changed in game development over the years and it's not a good thing. I think the reason there are so many bad games today is due to how they are developed.\n\nIt used to be that companies sought out people to play test their games based on certain criteria: experience in gaming, their computer specs, their ability to communicate ideas, their ability to find issues and report them. I tested Battlefield 1942 before it was released. Altough it was laggy as the devil in the early stages, I knew it was destined to be a great game.\n\nNowadays, there is just one criteria for testing games: "Do you have enough money?" People are paying companies for the "opportunity" to do their jobs for them. This is crazy. Not only does this method attract testers who don't really know how to test and people who just want to try out the game, it also makes these people more likely to become irritated when a game does not meet their expectations. After all, from their point of view, they have paid for the game. Game testers who have not been required to pay are more likely to offer valid criticism. They are more likely to overlook early issues with the game.\n\nThe other problem is, since the game company has already sold a lot of games, there isn't that much incentive to make it good. It's like crowd-funded games. Give me $25 million dollars and I'll try to make a cool game. If it flops, big deal. Did you think a great game was guaranteed?\n\nI understand these things. Yes, I knew the game was alpha. I knew I was paying to test the game and find issues, but whenever I find a major issue within 30 seconds of starting the game that will prevent me from further testing, I am quick to make it known. What do I get for my efforts? The tired old excuse that "Well, this is Alpha. You can't expect it to be perfect."\n\nPerfect? No, but I'd like it to at least be playable. If the controls prevent you from basic moving around, what are you to do? Obviously, you don't point this out or you're flamed for being a whiner in an Early Access game. Fine, just give back my money I wasted on paying to help your game and I'll shut up.","March 9","false","0.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

But i was wrong this is just Orion Prelude but in top down/third person.But let's not get ahead of ourselfs.\n\nThe first time loading it it took ~3ish minutes. Fine for first time setup i guess. So after messing with settings i try to find a game and get in find after ~5ish minutes i cant spawn so i leave the game. Crash. Okay it's still in early access whatever. Start it again another ~3ish minute load time, frustrating but no big deal. I tought maybe i should try loading a offline game instead. The offline menu oh lord that menu. It would not (i cant emphisies this enofe) work with a key board an mouse. You couldn't type in the name and using the mouse would send you to random letters because they decided to not allow the curser(which is a red csgo crosshair) on the menu. Also their was no smove movement through the letters and to delete you need a xbox controller because trying to find any of the comand buttons at the bottom is impossible and the buttons are binded to a controller's four buttons for no desernable reason then it was dessigned for four person local coop. Okay I guess? So I've entered my name now what the start button at the bottom can't be found and what is regestered on the xbox one(which I had thank god) as start woln't work with the binded 360 layout. So doing as anyone else would do i press every button and find that I must hit the A button to continue and pick my class. Again I can't start but must hit A again to change match settings. why couldn't i do that before or pick my class imediatly after my name is entered instead of having to press a again, but whatever lets just play.\n\nSo i start and see its pretty decent as a top down shooter but where is the 3rd person mode shown in the pictures and videos? Turns out you have to hit down on the D-pad. Okay fine...if it told youthis anywhere. Maybe it did but i didn't see whatever. So I switch to sniper in the menu but I relised that hitting the menu doesn't stop the game and i die even as a offline solo game. Okay... i needed to die anyway to change classes. So starting as a sniper I find I can't scope in in third person and I tryed everything. So i switched back to assult(Defult class) and run around shoting dinosawrs I relised. This is Orion Prelued(as i said before) down to the T.\n\nMy main point is why is this a $10 game(currently on sale for $.99) if it is just the same game the developer released but from a different perspective. I guess i can see with all these things it promises(which at the moment seem very hollow and empty). But why not make it a dlc or a add on to Prelude instead of a new game?","May 1","false","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Always losing connections, and when you have no content, 3 maps, and pretty much nothing to do - it's a safe bet people won't be staying long, even if the lobby don't drop them every 20 seconds.\n\nEDIT:  The dev's would rather argue with you and blame everything else than work on or admit issues people are having.  Additionally they get fanboys or most likely employees / friends to jump in and comment as well.  No one who uses the word bra to address another person would go back and read reviews for a game they already own.\n\nIt's a review people - it's not a debate.  After more playtime I have the following to add.\n\nThe controls are clunky, going from one action to another is clunky.  If you blink while sprinting you need to let go of sprint and hit it again.\n\nI have yet to determine any correlation between gear level, your level, damage, or survivability.  I HAD lvl 320 primary mod on a lvl 29 Assault character, and was doing 12-20 damage on dino's.  After swapping out more than once - it started to kinda scale.\n\nI now have gear lvl 600 in all slots and still get one or 2 shotted by birds and medium size dinos, I expect that a t-rex should be able to just eat me.\n\nIf you accidentally run into a dino puke pool while healing yourself inside a healy bubble, you will die.....\n\nThe days of AOL are gone, and you can't buy anything less than 3MB service anymore, so cockily blaming someone's internet shouldn't be the end all when reporting connection issues, this ignorance alone made me want to delete your comment from my review, but I figured it would be better served showing everyone else your standard response.\n\nI really don't recommend this game now, if you want a really well done, not clunky fast paced FPS go play Warframe, it's had everything this game wishes it had and more since it launched EA, and is still one of the best EA's out there.\n\nI believe it's free, which is a buck better than this for a lot more bang.","May 13","false","21.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","3"

I would KILL to have the ability to Roll, AND Teleport for all Classes in a certain other game i play, but i can do it here so it's awesome! Each class has different abilities. I chose the Support class to have the ability to heal which only becomes useful when they Break through your shield which you can repair anyways with the regen gun which also repairs and heals the Harvester which you protect in survival mode. The Shotgun spread and range is pretty impressive but is obviously MORE powerful up Close. And i just played the the Assault class and i love the ability to temporary jump over and get on top of rocks which you cannot do as any other class. it's useful too because these assault classes can engage AIR units that have not landed near the ground to attack you. I have yet to try the Recon yet which should be useful in it's own way as well to probably flank behind the Dinos and spray with all he/she has. Would be Great if the VibroBlade or any other sword got in the game besides Knife because when things get crazy and your quickest weapon is a Knife which you can upgrade the damage as you level up. I highly recommend you play with other players, makes it Easier to Survive and the ability to heal each other's Armor with the Regen gun or Heal each other's health with support's healing bubble definetly encourages players to Co-op, Having at least 1 Person as a support is Mandatory with the Party's Survival. 8/10 As much as i love it, it definetly needs more classes, skill abilities, and Swords.

The game looks damn good as well because Unreal Engine 4 has excellent visual quality and finally the gameplay is fun for a top down third person twin stick shooter, the fact that guns have infinite ammo is cool and how every ability you use (as well as your guns) adds stategy so then you have to be careful with what you use because the enemies (mainly dinosaurs and wildlife) can swarm you if you are not on your a game. The game does have some problems but that is expected from an early access game but over time some the flaws will probably be gone. Overall the game is full of potential and I can't wait to see what it will be like whe it leaves early access.","December 4, 2015","true","34.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I follow Trek on facebook and was skeptical of this game.  Trek never gives up though, and despite a failed kickstarter, David Prassel decided to give all the backers a copy of the game anyway.  I was blown away when I started playing, I haven't enjoyed a twin stick shooter like this in years.  It's done very well, even at it's earliest release.  Not a whole lot to do, but the potential is crystal clear.  This game takes what was great about Orion Prelude and gives it a cool isometric angle and a big graphics upgrade.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NastPlays/recommended/407840/","NastPlays","Nast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NastPlays/","268 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo, I played the original game, ORION: Prelude, and I love that game. So much so, that I've probably purchased copies of it for about 20 of my friends (although I'll admit, the $1 price tag was also a big factor in doing that) because it was so much fun. And when I heard about the planned follow up, I was expecting more of the same.\n\nSadly, this isn't what we have here, at least not at this point. Instead of a first person shooter, we have an isometric, top down shooter, which is not what I signed up for. Maybe it's partially my fault, but it's not easily noticed anywhere on the store page that this game is NOT a first person shooter. It's there, sure, but you have to click on the tags rather than just look at them. Maybe it's just me, but if you're gonna completely change the genre of your game, that should be something that is put front and center on the page, unless the intent is to try and trick people into spending money on the game before they realize what is going on. I don't think that's the case here, as the developers seem to genuinely care about their player base, as evidenced by the huge amount of support and work they put into Prelude, but I'm still glad Steam offers refunds now, because this isn't what I expected or wanted from this game.\n\nAll that said, I still like and will support the developers, and will be watching this game. Should it develop an option for first person, or should the mod community make one that is good, I may be back. But for now, this one isn't for me, and if you were expecting more of the same as was offered in Prelude, you won't find it here, at least not yet, so for now, stay away. If you're more open to change than I am though, feel free to check it out. What little I played of it seemed well made, but I didn't play long, as isometrics aren't my thing.\n\nTL;DR version: Not an FPS like the game before it. If that's what you're expecting, stay away, at least for now. If you're open to isometric shooters though, check it out. Solid developers who will surprise you.","December 5, 2015","false","0.2"," 18 of 43 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","18","43","2","4"

But in all honesty it just does not feel like Orion at all, Prelude was amazing as the entertaining mediocrity it was. It had charm, it came by honestly and it was by far well worth the price. I enjoy the new innovations of some of some mechanics in Guardians of Orion. But due to my inherent biase and enjoyment of Prelude, I cannot stand GOO being a top down shooter, it utterly cripples the immersion factor for me, furthermore it feels far less chaotic and is slow paced by comparison to prelude which emphasized heavily on absurd horde mode. Plus, why the drop form 5 player coop to only 4 players? :/ If anything at all, a game like Orion Prelude demanded more than even just 5 players, and should have supported well up to 12. I digress, unless they return to their roots of having Orion be a chaotic FPS title, than I have little desire to participate in this installment. This is MY PERSONAL opinion, by all means if you enjoy top down shooters, then this game is for you!

Tried playing it and could not find a single room. The only 2 rooms where full 4 out of 4 and they where premade friends groups. Since I could not find players I decided to do some reading on the forums and found a few minor reasons why people weren't playing. Including not being able to reach past a certain "wave" in game before it crashes and dissappointment over the lack of certain features.\n\nSurprised at this considering the game looked decent I decided to post a thread asking for more info on the subject to see if there was a sense of perceived or actual misleading from the trailer and/or devs. Another user was kind enough to chime in his opinion about the subject and was very polite.\n\nAnd then it turned bad and wrong on so many levels and so fast that I am still spinning. In comes the lead dev to "respond" to my thread with some serious attitude and petty childish insults.\n\nHere is the thread in its entirety. As of this moment it is uneditted (he hasn't cleaned it up to change/edit it)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/407840/discussions/0/451850468361381333/\n\nNow my review for the game will be negative as I was not able to actually play it during peak times because of lack of players and what I am going to call a ridiculous amount of unprofessionalism by the dev of the game that led to this review.\n\nI will again try to play it in some months to see if I can actually play and test/review it.\n\nBut the ridiculousness and childish attitudes from the dev really make it hard to enjoy now tbh. I was hoping it was a good game and to have a good experience. And all I got was petty insults and abuse from a coward developer who acts like a child behind his keyboard.\n\nBet you 100 bucks he would never have the balls to speak to another human being this way if it was face to face.

Great idea for the game and I hope you continue to work on it, I will check it out again if I see some improvements. What kind of survival mode is to endlessly protect a moving machine? Just add normal survival to the death and it'll have some likable content. Also it's obvious that you made it a grinding game, where you use looted material to craft more material to eventually be able to craft 1 random item, and oh it's a long grind. The music is good, but it doesn't fit the theme of the game.\n\nJust download alien swarm, it's far better in every aspect and it's free, for this is currently unplayable. I could upload some screenshots where I used lowest settings to achieve at least 80+ fps, but you might go blind so I dare not. The game has huge potential but it just disappoints me right now.

According to comments, a lot has changed. Treat this review more as a standard on what the game was like when it was launched.\n\nSo I bought this game mostly because its built with Unreal Engine 4, particularly because I've been playing around with UE4 also.\n\nFirst of all, this game has a lot of stuff missing, and thus a lot of improvement to be had. (Hey it's an Early Access, it's to be expected) I have only played half an hour of the game(note: Steam was down for maintenance when I was playing, hence the lower gametime on my profile). So read the review with a grain of salt, especially when it's about missing things. As I haven't explored much of the available gameplay. Which may explain why I don't recommend this game yet.\n(I'm guilty of writing a review with only so little playtime, but since the game just released, and the only complaints have been it shouldn't be a third person shooter, I figured I'll write some issues I'm seeing that are more legitmate)\n\n-Gameplay-\nI've only spent half an hour playing it so far. Solo, with keyboard and mouse, default difficulties and map. It has been a bit boring, but I can see potential in it. I may make some comparsions to Magicka, Helldivers, both games by Arrowhead Studio or with Diablo 3 since it can also be considered a top-down action game.\n\nGuardians of Orion has infinite ammo, with a reloading system. The switching time for the weapons between primary to pistol, vs pistol to primary seems almost the same, making gameplay rather dull. In fact, it seems as if switching to secondary pistol once the primary needed to be reloaded, then switching back renders the primary fulled loaded again.(Not sure if bug)\n\nThere is no aiming distance for the grenade, only a direction, making it nearly impossible to land a proper grenade, especially when the grenade travels at a fixed distance.\n\nCompared to say Helldivers, there is no particular weakness spots when hitting an enemy, Making aiming a very simple task. There is no turn speed involved either, unlike say Helldivers where your turn speed is reduced based on certain situations. (Such as when you're firing, or if you're in a mech)\n\nI used the Assault class, which has the abiilty to use the jetpack. It's more of an evade for a set period of time button, while still able to shoot enemies, as there is no disadvantages from being above ground. Thus there is no turning off the jetpack.\n\nBecause movement speed is the same even when you're shooting, there isn't any decision involved in whether or not you should run or shoot.\n\nThere is a dodge roll button, but in the 30 minutes I've played, there has been no reason to dodge roll, especially if you have a jetpack, and a blink ability.\n\nThe blink ability loses its control in the target location, if you use a keyboard, since the location is depended on where you're moving, I imagine it to feel more good when playing on a controller with an analog stick.\n\nSprinting's only downside is that you can't shoot while sprinting, and the fact that the camera zooms in a bit. You can infinitely sprint.\n\nI'm not sure if there's friendly fire, but I couldn't shoot the objective I was defending, so I would assume it to be a no. (Will check multiplayer later)\n\nThere are power up drops occasionally when killing enemies, but those don't really alter the gameplay decisions, other than basic attributes, like movement speed, fire rate, health regen, etc.\n\nOverall, there isn't much decision making when playing the game. Especially when it's all cooldown involved, and there is no concept of a scarce resource, such as limited ammo. The idea of dodging and avoiding enemies, seem bland. More crowd control abilities may also bring more gameplay decisions in.\n\nThere are skill points you can invest in, which I hope brings in more decision making into the game. However at least for me, the first 30 minutes playing solo has been really boring to play.\n\n-User Interface-\nIt's an early access game, so it's not a surprise that the UI is rough looking. For any Unreal Engine 4 devs, it's obvious to tell a lot of the progress bars are using the standard UI provided by UE4. There isn't much of an indication of what each bars are, but it can be quite obvious after 5 minutes of playing. Top bar being health, then shield, ability power, and exp.\n\nThere were two different objectives during my games. Defending the Harvester, basically a wave mode, and Eliminate these enemies. The fact that the latter was called a Side Objective, but yet refusing to do it, basically stops the progression of the round/game, seems to beg the question if it really is a "Side" Objective.\n\nThe mini map is very basic, with a simple map image, and circles to represent the player and the enemies.\n\nAs expected, the UI would probably be polished later on. But for now, it serves its purpose at the moment.\n\n-Audio-\nI'm really not picky about audio, there is some voiced dialog such as "under attack". The gun sounds fine as far as I'm concerned. So nothing much I have to say about it.\n\n-Overall Conclusion-\nGame has a lot of potentials, do not expect anything like Magicka, or Helldivers sort of gameplay. There is a lack of decision making involved at least for solo.\n\nI will be updating this review as I spend some more time playing this game, especially the multiplayer side of things. At the current state, the only reason to buy it is for the reduced price, and for the sake of testing, and supporting the developer. If you're buying it to have a solo time, I do not recommend.","December 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 37 of 93 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","37","93","3","9"

For what this is i'm dissapointed. Editing my review to be more clear. Im using a surface device, which easily pushes games like Borderlands 2, Skyrim, and runs heavier games like Dying Light and Shadow of Mordor. Why do i need to reduce the resolution on this game to lower 800x levels? Why does this game run so choppy, animate so poorly, and overall run badly. On the desktop, it runs fine. The problem then is the fact that this game has very little going for it. It's mindless, has no depth, and becomes repetitive very quickly. It at least runs well on the desktop and looks okay, but it really isnt all that well made. I'm sure this review will continue to offend people and cause them to reply with further insults, but this does not change that this is a game that only really appeals to people that want mindless and unoriginal gameplay. I suppose it's fitting those same people choose to make unintelligent replies against someone that genuinely disliked this game. It's okay though, my first refund out of 200 steam purchases worked, so that was positive.","December 2, 2015","false","1.2"," 14 of 43 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","14","43","0","0"

When selecting a character class at load-out, the game crashes 100% of the time. Judging by other negative reviews, this seems to not be limited to just me.\nSo far I haven't seen any signs from the developer that they intend to resolve the issue in a timely manner.\n\nFor more information on the developer's poor (and even untrusthworthy) communication habits, continue down. Else, you can skip to the next review. :)\n\n---\n\n\nTrek Industries developed a respected reputation with their unusual response to Orion: Prelude.\nThere, they took a very low rated game, and worked on it until people felt positively about it.\nKudos!\n\nAnd here, we've a game with all the potential to be fantastic- combining all Trek Industries learned from the previous game and blending it with strong ambition and creativity.\n\nGreat!\n\nSo, why am I discussing Trek Industries' history in a negative review?\nBecause for all their previous positive conduct, there's something rather.. troubling with their recent actions.\n\nTrek Industries guaranteed us in February that the EA price would not drop below $2- that the $1 price was limited to the live launch, which would offer far less benefit for your purchase.\nSince then, they've offered the game for $1 in EA.\n\nJan 29th  [1]\n"After May 1, 2016 the game will be reduced to $1 for NEW BUYERS (AKA Non-Founders)"\n"Guardians will be marked down significantly for one last opportunity to become a Founder. Don't say we didn't warn you - now is the time to save!"\n\nFeb 5th [1] [2]\n"This is your LAST chance to become a FOUNDER for GUARDIANS OF ORION - and for the BEST price yet! You can now own GUARDIANS OF ORION and become a FOUNDER for less than $2, only for a limited time. This sale ends February 12, 2016. "\n\nFeb 22nd [1]\n*A Non-Founder is anyone purchasing the game once it becomes $1. "\nNow, is the game worth $2? Well, I wouldn't have bought it at that price had I not thought so. In fact, I still think so, and I feel supporting the game in being able to achieve its ambitions is a positive thing!\n\nSo what's the issue?\nThe issue is, Trek Industries flat out misled us, if not intentionally lied to our faces. Since then their website has been down, and they've rejected the steam communication attempts by me and others.\n\nThat seems.. a bit sketchy, no?\nIt's hardly the first time the developer has done poorly in communicating clearly during this EA, as well.\n\nSo, to reiterate, the issue isn't a specific matter, such as the loss of $1, or frequent changes in their plans, or their failing to communicate with the 80% of event participants who didn't get a free key during a promotional event promising such, or any other single event..\n.. it's that Trek Industries has thus far proven unreliable in their promises, and more importantly, have regularly been unwilling to communicate  over the various issues the game [or its marketing] have had thus far.","April 27","false","0.8"," 8 of 48 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","8","48","0","11"

If every Early Access game on Steam was like that, I'd have literally no life and would play said games all day.\n\nThe gameplay: it's a shooter, either top-down or third-person. Guns have seemingly limitless ammo. There's an Engineer class, called Tech, which can build turrets, and there are other vastly inferior classes which cannot build turrets.\n\nOne puzzling aspect of The Orion Project is as follows: in the first hub zone, you just look for the big table and activate it with E. The hub isn't the actual game, and most of the things don't work: there are no weapons, and F1 doesn't toggle the top-down view. Other than the "Start game" table and some terminals, there's nothing in the hub, it's a walking simulator of sorts. I assume this to be a beta-version-ish feature which will either get much more useful, or will be replaced with a simple menu.\n\nOh, and there's a crafting system, allowing you to create fake dinosaur bones out of metal ingots. I find this approach to modern archaeology mildly amusing.\n\nAnyway, do buy, it's good and promising, and you will feel good about yourself as you're clicking the "Add to Cart" button.","April 30","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shoot Dinosaurs, Robots, and they claim more will be added in the future. 5 different classes with different abilities and stats-to-upgrade implement a different playstyle for everyone, and as they do with most things, they claim that many other classes will be added as well.\n\nSo far, the community is very friendly, updates come out frequently, and the developers are very involved in the community, willing to reply to discussion posts and helping anyone they can. It seems this game won't be left in the dust anytime soon.\n\nI recommend this game highly. It's addicting and a great game to play with friends, but the same experience can be held when playing with any random stranger on the online servers, as I see very little toxicity in the community.\n\n-Darth Maul (The Third Wheel)","February 16","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Themed around its own lore with dinosaurs and robots.\nChallenging but forgiving. It's easy to get yourself killed, but also easy to master in surviving. Penalty for dying isn't harsh, only timeout for around half a minute.\nFour classes with their own loadout.\nTwo game modes; survival and slaughter.\n\nGood looking and works great even with high ping. Well optimized for an early access titles.\n\nMade by the developers of Orions Prelude, that was well known for their commitment.\nJust in a few days, they went through the suggestion thread and implement sensible suggestions quickly.\n\nStill, there's a lot of places that need more attention:\n- UI, just like in screenshots. They do the job but could be better for more professional looks.\n- Not many players, which is sad for a multiplayer focused title.\n- and Bugs, which is expected.\n\n\nWith their track record, it's safe to trust the DEV and they promises monthly updates.\n\nWill be updated in February.","January 13","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let the "Early Access" tag inlfuence your opinion too much, however, as it is surprisingly smooth for such a game. Guardians of Orion is simple and easy to jump into, but has an endless amount of replayability. The class-based gameplay system, skill trees, and ability to swap between a top-down or third person perspective adds a good amount of variety to the actual gameplay, and is accomomdating of personal play-style. Perhaps the driving factor of the game is that the main antagonistic forces are dinosaurs (everyone loves dinosaurs).\n\nIf there is one thing I would like to see added to the game, it would be a weapon/character customization system that allows people to slightly alter the functionality of their class. While the skill trees for each class are nice, being able to physically change weapons and armor would be only help to improve the game, in my opinion.\n\nAll things considered, it's a really enjoyable game.","January 21","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've recently got back into top-down shooters and this is exactly what I've been wanting to play.  That's not to say that I don't like a good FPS but I think the top-down dynamic is perfect for this game.\n\nI've only played a little over an hour and a half but it's a hell of a lot of fun.  The graphics are really beautiful and the music fits really well.  I know it's still early even for early access but I can't wait for more content - more missions, character progression, etc.  I think the ability to repair the harvester is very cool because I could see the game being significantly more difficult without that.\n\nOne very minor thing is that the character quips are a bit cheesy - I haven't looked in settings to see if that can be turned off or not.\n\nI should also mention that I've only played with keyboard and mouse, not with a controller.  I'm very happy with the KBM controls though.  I imagine I'll try a controller at some point too to see if I like it better.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend this game, even in early access, and I expect that it will continue to get better with future updates.  Keep up the great work!","December 11, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shoot Dinosaurs, Robots, and they claim more will be added in the future. 5 different classes with different abilities and stats-to-upgrade implement a different playstyle for everyone, and as they do with most things, they claim that many other classes will be added as well.\n\nSo far, the community is very friendly, updates come out frequently, and the developers are very involved in the community, willing to reply to discussion posts and helping anyone they can. It seems this game won't be left in the dust anytime soon.\n\nI recommend this game highly. It's addicting and a great game to play with friends, but the same experience can be held when playing with any random stranger on the online servers, as I see very little toxicity in the community.\n\n-Darth Maul (The Third Wheel)","February 16","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a lot of room to improve, and I hope the devs continue to implement new features, but I'm worried about how the devs seem unsure about where to take the game... Earlier it was planned to be a top-down shooter with no first person priced at $20, and then a top-down shooter with over-the-shoulder priced at $2, and now they have an entirely new vision with so many features. At $0.99 it's not much of a risk to buy this game, but I do hope the devs stick to their vision and implement the features well. Even in its current state, there are plenty of features to justify a purchase especially considering that low price point.\n\nTL;DR Should you buy it? Yes, if you have an extra dollar laying around that you don't feel like spending on something else.","March 20","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I have now replayed it with controls set up in a way that actually works.\n\nNow this review is happily a recommend :) although, there is a way to go, the bulk of the game is there, and appears to be solid enough. Oh, and may I also recommend that you start playing as an Assult class. It is a simple class, and one that gets you a feel for the game nicely.\n\nThe backgroundI played Orion: Prelude, and when this came out - BAM insta-buy. I finally get around to trying it, and it's no longer First Person view. :( This may not be a deal breaker for you, but that's what I love playing. (I've been informed below that in version 1.5, FPV is back!)\n\nThe GameThere are two modes of view. Top down third person, and over the shoulder third person. (And the v1.5 First Person)\n\nThings I like:\nLooks quite nice. (GTX 750 Ti)\nThe harvester has a sense of humour! :D\nThere appears to be a lot of work gone into the tech/upgrade tree. Hopefully this will allow for diverse / specialised set ups for people.Now that I have proceeded past the initial shock of the change of view. I can see why Jacko (again) said that he really enjoyed his first play, and made friends. He's pretty easy to get along with when you first meet - so that's a good sign. :) I'm yet to delve into the online version of this, as my time was short.\n\nThings I don't like:\nThe jump binding is conveniently called "Roll". (dual purpose - In actual fact, the whole control system seems to very geared towards handheld controllers.)\nThe game takes a while to load, but shows no indication that it is indeed loading. In fact, it doesn't even show up on the taskbar - making me think, each time, that it's frozen. (Intel Core i5-4690 2.5GHz / 16GB RAM / Win 10)\nThe character that is "you" seems disconnected from the world. That is to say, that the world could be projected onto a wall, and "you" just dance around in front of it. (For over the shoulder view)\nThe action of the grenade throw, and the actual grenade movement is lame. Needs work. ("early access")\nCertain characters (ie: Assault) insist upon saying "look at me go" every time you use the jetpack. Not a major gripe, but I hope in the final release it gives that a break from 100% of the time.\nDiscoveries:\nF1 Key switches between views. (Thanks Jacko)\nDespite you view not being First Person (out of the visor), the world around you seems to move with your characters breathing. And as I wrote above, and you'll read in the comments, in version 1.5, true first person view will be back.\nI can't tell if it's my underspec'd character, or that the jump / boost ceiling is very low. But getting around up high is very hard.\nIf you do manage to get up above the ground, only the dino flyers even attempt to get you. Most ground dinos become confused, and don't necessarily even attempt their primary destructive objective.\nThere are Hats - TF2, oh how you've changed the world.\nThere are drops and chests to be found.\nDem Feels\nMy initial feelings about this game was that I didn't get it. I got the Prelude, but this one... Now that I have rejiggerd the controls, and played it again on a simpler class - I had more of an affinity for it. So I'm happier now.\n\nThe End BitI'm sure more things will come to light as I play this in multiplayer mode. And I'm glad I gave this game another chance. I look forward to seeing where the devs take this.\n\n\nThanks to Jacko, Neomeinx and Cjnfl for helping me with this review.","May 4","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","10"

I also like the different classes (Assailt, Tech, Rocketeer, etc.) but the dev needs to put a lot more features into this game in order to really make it worthwhile for players to invest time & money into sticking with this game long-term.  A new quest system is supposedly coming in May & I'm looking forward to it.  I'm glad that there is controller support.\n\nThe skill tree needs to be re-worked to make it more meaningful for character progression.  Crafting desperately needs to be easier to understand how to perform.\n\nI wish the dev a lot of luck with this game.
