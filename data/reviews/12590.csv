My only negative that bothers me has to do with the audio, specifically with the cars; they sound garbled, hit-and-miss, inconsistent. I don't understand why this is the case and would hope it can be fixed soon please. But I still enjoy the game overall.","August 18, 2015","true","13.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Sprint Cars Road to Knoxville is a great game IF you love dirt track racing. The game is very specific to dirt track fans, and while not perfect, is the best one that is still readily available. Although to be frank, some playstation 2 models were indeed better games but are harder to get ahold of now. If you cannot race with a keyboard, I wouldn't bother because some seem not to work. The car sound can occasionally be garbled, and sounds bad but isn't detrimental to the gameplay itself. Also, I've seen many gripe about creating drivers taking forever. You don't have to, as long as your driving you can hire the cheapest driver and get to work. If you love dirt track racing, I think you'll find this game soothing enough to eat up some of your day.\n\nGood luck and hope this was helpful.","March 26","true","79.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ai is okay sometimes, career mode youll pretty much win every race by laping everyone once or twice wish there was a little more challenge there but if you like dirt track racing this is the game! Fun game overall, out of the handful of dirt track games ive owned this ones right at the top.","September 17, 2014","true","30.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I did have the boxed version of this years ago and, at the time, it worked with a joystick controller but nothing has been done it seems to get it working right before they put it on Steam. It's old and used to be fun but considering the many other racing games (old and new) that work fine with Win 7 without problems, this is not worth the time or money. I bought, tried to get it to work with no luck whatsoever so I got a refund.","January 4","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Everything was going good on the first lap; I was thinking positive things... Then I realized my car was unresponsive somewhat.
