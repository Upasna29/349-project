I have a friend called Harriet who I have decided to sign up to my club despite her lack of interesting and her having a part time job because I am more important.\n\nFirst was Sara; she is the quiet one who I follow about while she deals with her psychological issues; I got her to open up by knowing a lot about mystery novels which I had spent all night reading.\n\nNext was May; she is the cute little one who wants to develop a chest and is dealing with some serious choices about her families future; she decided to resolve them and join my club after I played some video games and stopped being such a NOOB.\n\nNext was my friend Cindy who was following her dream; through a combination of guilt playing and following her she finally gives in and joins me.\n\nMy next target was Vivian, the hockey star who gets ill from people bothering her; I continue to bother her until she joins me through Stockholm Syndrome, ironic as she is Swedish.\n\nTyler was stalking my friend; I give a potentially dangerous stranger my friends number without her permission and use Harriet to effectively trick him into joining. That's okay though, because I am too selfish to care.\n\nThen there is Male Student. He has a name, but you are supposed to talk to his father, hunt down his name through school and then ignore him not wanting to talk to me by threatening his social life until he joins my club.\n\nBy doing all of this, I got the good ending.","May 1, 2015","true","15.2"," 97 of 103 people (94%) found this review helpful 86 people found this review funny","94","97","103","86","2"

It could be described as Persona 3/4 without the drama and battling, or as a platonic dating sim, if you're into that sort of thing. Expect some routine anime shenanigans, with characters deep enough to be interesting. It's a very lighthearted, easy-going game, but all the characters feel "real" enough to give it sufficient depth.\n\nMy first playthrough took about four hours, and my second around two and a half. It's not a long game, but it's full of characters and personality, like a town from Paper Mario: tTYD, you can keep coming back to people for new looks at them. The game emphasizes making friends and being a well-rounded individual, which I think is as good a moral as you could get. I do wish there had been some forewarning about some aspects of the relationship-building dialogues. For example, you can only discuss a topic once with a "target," for the entire playthrough. Of course, this isn't a huge obstacle, and it only makes the game have stronger replay value.\n\nDon't count on much action, or even multiple dialogue options. All of the gameplay focuses on skill-building, time management, and selecting good topics of conversation. This is simply a great game for those looking for solid characters and friendships in a quirky, somewhat-cliche anime setting. If there's a sequel coming out any time soon, as the end of the game implies, I'm very excited for it!","June 2, 2014","true","7.7"," 64 of 69 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","64","69","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fruitsniffer/recommended/214610/","Fruitsniffer","Fruitsniffer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fruitsniffer/","314 products in account","Warning: Lengthy review incoming!\n\n\nCherry Tree High Comedy Club is an interactive visual novel with the gameplay of a dating simulator.\n\nBefore I get into the review, I want you to know, that I played the westernized localization of the game. I’m going to talk about this in a little bit more detail at a later point of this review.\n\nYou play as Miley Verisse, a young comedy fanatic, who’s planning on forming her very own Comedy Club in her school. Miley’s roommate has already been compelled to join the club, but the problem is that school clubs have a minimum number of required members, which means that Miley has to find three more people to join her club until the end of the club trial period. That means you’ve got two months to manipulate and befriend as many people as possible.\n\nThis is where the dating simulator gameplay comes in.\nThere are six different characters that can be recruited and you befriend them by talking to them about different topics. You raise your skill levels by reading magazines or visiting places and occasionally you can also find random stuff on the ground that raises your skills as well. The higher your skill for “fashion” for example is, the more the friendship level of a character will be raised when talking to them about this topic.\n\nThis type of gameplay can get a bit repetitive, since you do the same thing every day. You get up, talk to a character, talk to another character, watch some TV and the day is over. Repeat until some special event happens or until the friendship level of a character rises.\n\nTo get a character to join your club you have to get them to friendship level 5, which is pretty much impossible to do for all 6 characters in the first playthrough. Fortunately there is a new game+, which allows you to keep all your skills and only resets your friendship levels.\n\nThe whole game has a lot of jokes, because, you know… Miley’s a comedy enthusiast and stuff.\nThere were some jokes that are right up my alley that I found really amusing and then there were some others that just fell flat for me.\n\nThe characters are rather diverse and even though some of them seem pretty spineless in the beginning, you find out that they have a really interesting background story after befriending them. On the other hand, there are also some characters that still seem rather spineless after you convince them to join your club and their background story is by far not as interesting as you’d expect.\n\nA big problem I had with the game is, that it only supports a resolution of 640x480 and if you want to play it in fullscreen mode, the game window gets stretched to fit the height of your screen and you get two beautiful black bars next to the game to fill your screen. The settings of the game are also pretty limited, but hey, it’s a visual novel and not some fancy AAA game title, so I guess that’s expectable.\n\nAt the time I bought this game, no original version was available in English, only the westernized version, with different names and locations.\n\nWith the release of the sequel of Cherry Tree High Comedy Club on Steam we finally get to play the game in English with the original names and the same places as in the Japanese version of the game.\n\nFor example, Miley turns into Mairu and Cindy suddenly is called Haru. Also, chilli dogs turn into rice omelets, because, you know, western people only know chilly dogs and can’t comprehend rice omelets or something.\n\nAll those extremely western sounding names feel a bit out of place, because everything feels so Japanese and all those cherry trees in the background for example definitely don’t make me feel like I’m in the US either.\n\n\nI’m going to be completely honest with you: Cherry Tree High Comedy Club was the first visual novel I ever played, so I might judge this game a lot differently than some of you visual novel veterans out there but for someone new to this type of medium, this game was a really good entry point and even if you’re usually not a big fan of those type of games, you might still enjoy all those cute characters and the nice setting.\n\nThe multiple endings and the new game+ give the rather short game some replayability, since you will not be satisfied with only knowing the background story of for example 3 of the characters but you will want to know the background story of all of them, even though they might not be as interesting as you’d expect.\n\nAll in all, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a pretty decent visual novel for veterans and casuals in this medium. It might have its flaws but it is still a really enjoyable game to waste some time with.\n\nIf you’re a diehard action fan who needs explosions, headshots and a lot of gore to enjoy a video game, or someone who detests reading and dislikes games that heavily rely on text in general, you might want to sit this one out.\n\nEverybody else:\n\nShould you play Cherry Tree High Comedy Club?\n\nYes. Yes you should.","November 22, 2014","true","14.1"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","23","24","4","0"

If you've played Persona 4, the gameplay of CTHCC tries very hard to be the town segments of that game. You train certain skills to relate to people better, then talk to them as much as possible in order to become friends with them, see their stories, and finally convice them to join. Oddly, you never actually perform any comedy in the game, because it ends on the club registration deadline.\n\nCTHCC is definitely not anywhere near Persona 4, but most games aren't. Unfortunately, this game has the weaknesses of P4's town gameplay as well. It's very repetitive. The music would be decent for this game if it wasn't repeated over and over ad nauseum. But, this game's strength is the character-driven story. While the characters are not near the level of P4, they were better than I expected them to be, though I wish they had more chit-chat dialogue.\n\nThis game has some display issues. Alt+Enter is the only way to make it fullscreen, and even then it doesn't work well. The art is decent otherwise, for being 2D still images. CTHCC controls well enough.\n\nCTHCC is an okay way to kill an hour or two, but I was getting bored by the end of my three hour playthrough. I wouldn't pay much for it, though. Wait for a 75% off sale if this sounds interesting to you. If not, you're not missing too much by choosing to skip this game.","September 28, 2013","true","5.4"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","34","43","0","0"

It's locked into fairly standard anime tropes and character archetypes, and for a game about a girl that wants to start a comedy club, lacks even one moment of genuine humor.\n\nThe localization is fairly offensive too in how it tries to portray the game as taking place in America, even though all of the world's locations (the high school, the shrine) are clearly Japanese. This is 4-kids level, straight out of the 1990s localization that isn't even so bad it's good.\n\nAgain, it's harmless, but completely mediocre. The cheap price point may be good for those curious about these kinds of games, but I'm really not sure why, of all the doujin titles Nyu Media could have grabbed, this is the one they wanted.","November 17, 2012","false","5.8"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","30","41","0","0"

Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a feel-good story about Mairu Hibisu, your typical 'I Wanna Be Hokage' type protagonist who dreams of becoming the next big international comedy senstation. Re-opening her school's defunct comedy club is the first stepping stone to her dreams; however, in order to form a club at CTH you need to have at least three members who want to sign up. And this is where the fun comes in!\n\nCTHCC is essentially Persona Social Links The Game, but it puts its own cute little twist on things. You run around town discovering new students to harass and blackmail into joining your club hopefully recruit, and as you get to know each of the students you meet, you'll begin to level up your social standing with them. Get to know them well enough, and they'll eventually give in to your constant hounding join up.\n\nOne feature I really liked was how by talking to each character on a daily basis, you start picking up clues as to which converational topics they may or may not like. Some are made obvious, and some not so much. You also do better talking to students by increasing what you know about each of the conversation subjects. There are loads of ways to do this, from heading to the cinema or reading magazines in the library, to spending time at the arcade or listening to that weekend's guest speaker at the art gallery. There's genuinely loads to do all over town and many day/time specific events, which I personally enjoyed as it encourages you to get to know and care about the places & people you're interacting with.\n\nI also really loved the variety in each character's story, which starts to unfold as you level up your social standing with them. No story was similar and many were quite serious at times, but the sprites and character art remained adorable throughout, making it pretty hard not to find yourself endeared to everyone by the end. There's also a little re-playability value with the New Game+ mode (where you can start a new game with the stats you built up from the last one), but as CTHCC is just a quick bit of cutesy fun, you probably won't be picking it back up once you're done with it unless you want to see the perfect ending. Would highly recommend this as a great introductory game to the visual novel genre.\n\nQuick sidenote: if you're looking for pantsu, this really isn't it. There are absolutely zero romantic interactions with any character, which I was more than happy with but I understand would be a turn-off for some.","July 2, 2015","true","11.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

People compare it to Persona 3 because it has that "social link" aspect that Persona 3 has, but it's really different in tone.  It's very light-hearted-- not a bad thing, but when the game does try to take a slightly more serious tone, it's just awkward.  That didn't bother me too much, though.  My favorite thing about the game actually was how light-hearted it was, it's very cute.\n\nThe main problem is that it's just way too short and simplistic.  The point is to level up your relationship with different characters by talking to them.  You do this by selecting from a pool of conversation topics (like "art", "pets", "music", etc.)-- if the character likes the topic, your relationship improves.  After your relationship improves by a certain amount, it levels up and you get to see a cutscene.\n\nHowever, there's not much to indicate what topics you should talk about and what you shouldn't.  You can probably figure out maybe one or two of the topics that are good for each person by paying attention to the story, but the rest just seem like random guessing.  It'd be much more enjoyable if there was a logical clue for each topic + character, but I guess they couldn't do that since there were so many topics.  They should've really just had less of them.\n\nThe other big issue is that it's just really lame when you try to talk to somebody about a topic, and all the dialogue says is "You talked about X topic with Y.  Y loves to talk about X!"  It would've been more interesting to read if there was actually conversation between the characters about each topic.  The dialogue that's in the game is actually not bad (I played the westernized version), there just needs to be more of it.  As of now, it's too robotic and boring.\n\nIf you're a big fan of dating sims and got the game in a bundle, maybe it's worth playing through once just because it's cute.  I wouldn't recommend buying it outside of a bundle, though.","September 17, 2015","false","3.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Thumbs up to a fun interactive anime-type visual novel.","December 13, 2015","true","2.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

Therefore, you are forced into a few hours of grinding before you find out if you're doing the right things or not.

I didn't enjoy it but I completed it.\nI didn't think it was possible to mess up a visual novel but I guess it is.\n\n"Oh but x2Madda, this isn't a visual novel--" Then what is it? Because I'll tell you what it isn't, fun!\nCherry Tree is the tale of a girl trying to open a comedy club at school however she needs 5 members to be able to do so and her with her best friend are only 2 people. Recruit 3 more members out of a pool of 6 while finishing all your homework and balancing your fatigue or else you may collapse or fail class!\n\nThat's what the advertising blurb said anyway. You get to move left and right on various screens and talk to NPCs but this isn't a platform game and the walking only serves to give the illusion of gameplay or to pick up various objects scattered around. The "homework" just serves to waste days and fatigue can be balanced very easily by just not wasting time working jobs. You see you have 40 days broken down into 3 time slots per day in order to make the potential recruits like you. However the only way to make them like you is to impress them with your various diplomatic actions which are influenced by your diplomatic skills which you increase by choosing a skill to level up, thus also eating into those precious time slots.\n\nThis sounds like a game and it sounds like it could be good but the problem is that you can easily increase all your skills very high very quickly and recruit everyone with time to spare. You can also fail miserably if you try to actually engage with people instead of leveling up your skills so it reminds me of 'Long Live the Queen' but without the good writing. Or the fun.\n\nSpeaking of writing, this is one of the most boring non-visual novels I have ever read. How do you even mess up a visual novel with a comedy setting? Well it has little jokes relying more on puns and memes and oh ho, before you accuse me of playing the westernized version, I am playing the Japanese translated version.\n\nI didn't enjoy playing the game. The music doesn't create any atmosphere, the story is sweet at its core but lacks any charm and the characters are believable but as soon as they joined I didn't feel any connection or want to engage with them further. Lastly the sound effects are from an open source sound bank so if you reconize some of them from other games (100% Oranage Juice) that would be the reason why.\nReally, the graphics are very good and I like the ideas that went into the game but it suffers poor execution\nHopefully the sequel which is a straight up visual novel, will remedy the issues I experienced here.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 26, 2015","false","5.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

(One example: "I see now ... So that's why I like cannoli. That makes sense." "Wh... What are you talking about?" "It makes total sense." "Don't just end a conversation like that!")\n\nThat said, each of the major characters also has their own full story arc with actual emotional weight, ranging from coping with loss to coping with corporate encroachment. These topics are handled with surprising sensitivity, and display Mairu (Miley in the Westernized version) as more than a mere player avatar, with her own vulnerabilities occasionally surfacing... and then she'll make a lesbian joke, because deflecting is fun.\n\nThe gameplay itself is broken down into distinct turns (seen here as morning/afternoon/evening), in which the player can explore the town freely before deciding on their "move" for that particular round. Thankfully, the developers provided enough content to avoid turning the skill-building process into a grind. Dozens of NPCs populate this world, some appearing only at specific times, and each spawning new dialogue on a daily or weekly basis, giving incentive to wander a bit before reading the next magazine or earning more yen.\n\nThere are some minor bugs, such as character portraits being displayed with an incorrect outfit or NPCs referring to the previous week's guest lecturer as forthcoming. I played the deWesternized version, yet characters would sometimes lapse into their Westernized names, which is momentarily distracting but not nearly gamebreaking.\n\nYou will most likely need at least a second playthrough in order to experience all six storylines, so the replayability is sufficient to justify the non-sale price, and I encountered new dialogue responses throughout my second run. I'm planning to try a third, attempting to generate the "best" ending without the benefit of the New Game+ option, before diving into the sequel... recruiting was just the beginning...","February 15","true","23.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ultimately, though the writing and characters never especially  moved me or captured my heart (they're a little bit generic, as if hodge podged together from familiar tropes and little else) I think that I'm only left with that impression because the game isn't long enough to give anyone a character arc of satisfying length.\n\nUltimately, it's kind of like playing a single month of Persona 3 or 4, minus the dungeon crawling JRPG side of things, but the fact that the stats never seem to matter for much and the scenes you unlock with characters never allows you to make any dialogue or action choices leaves the player feeling much more like an outsider to the experience. While that's fine for a visual novel, in this case it only contributed to the feeling that this VN was merely half done.\n\nAll that said, I realize there's a sequel, and, since I did get it in a bundle with the original, I may change my opinion after playing that. Both are fairly cheap, so if I think of them as a bundle it may end up worth it. Nevertheless, CTHCC2 has a lot to make up for, and it's going to have to tremendously exceed the quality of experience the first game gave me if there's any chance I'm going to turn around my opinion on the series.","January 29, 2015","false","3.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/214610/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Cherry Tree High Comedy Club (CTHCC) is a light VN with 2D side-scrolling exploration that applies traditional dating sim mechanics to non-romance subject matter. This approach to dating sims has only been notably applied in Persona 3 and 4, so naturally it draws a lot of comparisons.\n\nThe dating-sim-esque format works a whole lot better here than it did in Persona. Mairu (or Miley, if you're a weirdo and chose the westernized version) is an actual character with her own personality, motives and ways of interacting with other characters (beyond being dead silent while other characters monologue to themselves for the entire game). Scenes where Mairu is strongarming people to bow to her own ulterior motives or genuinely relating to people with her own life experiences is infinitely more compelling than standing around while people sort out their own problems and attribute it to your intervention.\n\nGameplay-wise, the 2D side-scrolling helps enforce the illusion of an explorable, breathing, homely town a hell of a lot more than the usual VN affair of disconnected backgrounds, and while the locales are noticeably limited the walking/running and interactions with optional NPCs is welcome.\n\nGenerally, interacting with other recruitable NPCs involves finding them and opting to spend a block of the limited time you have with them, talking about one of 12 topics. The topics grey out after one use, and the NPCs reactions to each topic differ from person to person. Mairu can improve her knowledge on each topic by either spending a block of time performing an activity or by finding collectables around the time, that differ from day to day. Guessing which topics NPCs like involves a lot of gauging their character, and that's appreciated.\n\nThere's six recruitable NPCs, and you only need three to finish the game. While there's ample time to get three, getting six is impossible on a first playthrough, and there's a slightly different ending for nabbing all six through the NG+ mode, which encourages multiple playthroughs.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this VN.\n\nDespite taking place in the formation of a Comedy Club, and revolving around Comedy, there's almost no comedy in CTHCC. What little there is, is safe, sterile, clean and tasteless. A few puns and light insults thrown into an otherwise unremarkable conversation, or nothing at all. It's some of the weakest comedy they could have possibly gone for, and unless you've never heard a joke before, or are incredibly amused by "cute girls doing cute things" it'll do nothing for you.\n\nBeyond that there's just no substance to it. Even after two playthroughs there's no memorable moments. Even if the light dating-sim mechanics "work" a whole lot better than it did in Persona, it's got no punch, no bite and no gall to back it up.\n\nThis is an incredibly boring game that with all it's talk about making you laugh, won't even put in an effort to make you smile.","March 5, 2015","false","7.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I managed 1 playthrough in three hours, but in order to get the good ending I need to go through one more time. No complaints though, the game is good enough to warrant another go-around and and the new-game plus takes out all the little things I had to do to boost my stats, so I should have little trouble getting all 6 people on my side.\n\nIf you're not sure what the game is about, you're a girl trying to recruit a minimum of three people to your club in order for it to be accepted by the student government. To do this you must read magazines and watch telvision to boost your stats, then talk to people about those subjects in order to boost your friendship. Get to level 5, and they join your club. You meet 5/6 of the people over your spring break (and the last one when you get back to school), giving you about 5 weeks to befriend everyone. The days are all split up into 3 portions, two of which you have the chance to really communicate with the people, and then the nighttime where you can call people (Which does very little, to my knowledge), make some cash, or study up on your skills. Homework is also a small annoyance, but easy to overcome if you aren't streamlining friendships.\n\nThe story itself is relativly engaging, making it entertaining to converse with everyone you can to get the few snippets out of them. There seems to only be a few that they cycle through, but that's okay. They're often funny, given the whole comedy club point of the game.\nThere's also a lot of side characters you can converse with with are equally cool and play as much of a role as do the six subjects.\n\nMy only quarrel with this game is the wonky controls and the size of the screen. For whatever reason I could not make this game full screen, or could I use my gamepad on it. It only requires the arrow keys and the enter key, but that particular setup is unlike my usual hand placements and felt uncomfortable. The tiny screen also felt unnessisary, but this could be an issue on my end alone so I don't blame it that much.\n\nAll in all, a good little game to spend some time on if you haven't anything to do and are interested in basically a dating sim about humor. I'm excited to see what the next part has to offer based on what I did here.","March 15, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This colorful anime style game is an "adventure lite" and has more in common with dating sims than even adventure games.  You are a high school girl with a little over a month for your last shot at forming a comedy club.  The goal of the game is to recruit at least 3 people for your club (up to 6) before May gets here, and clubs can no longer officially form at the school.  You accomplish this by talking to people and becoming friendly with them.  Starting a chit chat will give you a glimpse at the topics that they like the most so you can engage them in deeper conversations.  But no one wants to talk to someone who has no knowledge or interest of their beloved topics, so you have to level up your knowledge in the things they are most interested in.  You can do this in a variety of ways such as buying magazines to read before bedtime, catching a show at the cinema, watching tv, hanging out at the art museum, or visiting the school library.  Some of these things cost money to do, and usually the more cash it requires, the more skill you will get.  You get money by collecting bottles on the ground, or doing part time work at a few places around town.  Once you have leveled up your skills you can then work on trying to recruit your "comedy targets" so they will sign your paper, join your club and the ending is happy for everyone.  Leveling up with a friend opens up new cutscenes and gives you little insights to their life.\n\nIt's a lot of text, reading, guesswork and time management.  Engaging in conversation or working passes the time of the day, which brings you closer to the ending, whether you have recruited anyone or not.  That's where the time management comes in.  Do you try to become closer to a friend by talking to them?  Working at the shrine for money so you can catch that cinema show and level up your romance stat?  Occasionally there's homework to juggle too!\n\nCherry Tree High Comedy Club has interesting characters and a bite size play through time... I managed four recruits and completed the game around the three and a half hour mark.  Since it is so linear story driven, I can't see myself playing it again for some time, but others will likely want to dive right back in to try for the six recruits "perfect" ending.  If you enjoy dating sims or anime, this game has the tendrils to hook you.  The stories are well written and the translation is at times, quite amusing, being given a very robust translation.  There's controller and big picture support so you can potentially blow through this from the comfort of your couch.  I do wish there had been more variety in the game play, mini games would have broken up the tedium of chatting and time management, and having a wider cast of characters or more inventive ways to get to know them would have been fun.  Instead you are racing for the next conversational topic level... which is entertaining but there was a lot of potential here to be so much more.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out, even if just for it's cute quirkiness, if any of the above sounds appealing to you!","July 16, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I literally don't even remember any of their names at this point just because I don;t really care about them.

There are plenty of video game references and pop culture, and lots of funny moments (Your trying to set up a comedy club after all) This game left me with a really good feeling, and I enjoyed every minute of the experience. Oh, and the music is great! As well as the 2D art style. You have the ability to move your character around in certain areas too which was nice, not something you get to do in most of the visual novels I've played. I highly recommend this game to somebody who likes slice of life and school themed anime's and wants to play a game with a positive and happy vibe.","July 14, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I however can't fault it for that, and what it does offer in my opinion is some quality gameplay for that genre combined with great dialogue and a decent size city to explore. My grievances are the limited and random statements made by characters, often causing them to repeat the same thing throughout intervals and the somewhat grindy nature of some conversations, provided no in game events are occuring (needed more in my opinion in this regard to detract from the basic gameplay). All in all it is a game of good value if you like the genre, that does even despite these listed flaws keep itself interesting through humor and the odd friendship/life lesson.","September 5, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You can say that it is somewhat of a social simulator. You play as a high school senior named Miley who is determined to start her own school club. She decides to make a comedy themed club. In order to do so, she needs to recruit at least three other studens, or else the school will not allow the club to form. You spend your time roaming around town learning new skills and studying certain topics in order to hold a conversation with potential recruits. Simply put, you have to become good friends in order to get them to join your club, and the best way to do so is to learn about the things that they like and talk to them about it. The game is very short, for me about three hours, but it felt right. The graphics are a blend of SNES and anime, which works perfectly for this game. I wish there were more games like this.\n\nWeird note: Looking at the art for this game (buildings and shrines), it's clear that this game takes place in Japan, but in the English version of the game, they say that it is in America. It's nice to see that the developers were kind enough to try to be inclusive with the American audience, but unnecessary. Modern day Japan is not a foreign as it used to be. I would not feel out of place there.","July 2, 2014","true","3.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Like many others, I had enjoyed the social link system of the later Persona games and this is basically a game all about that. It also called back to other stat-raising games like the Princess Maker series.\nSo for one, if you don't like stat-raising games, don't buy this game. Hopefully, that'd be obvious.\nIt's very visual novel-esque and really a lot of the game is pretty nicely done. The graphics are good and it's actually made in RPG Maker, so I was a bit impressed by how originally the game controlled. The characters also had some potential, too.\nBut the humor is where the game falls flat. For a game about comedy, this entire game only got a few chuckles out of me at most. And in a visual novel type of game, the writing is everything.\nIf you're the kind to be wooed by excessive memes and pop culture references, then this game might be perfect for you. But for me, that's not the case. The writing was rarely clever and is reliant mostly upon making you say "THEY SAID THE THING". And sometimes, the memes are just out of place, too.. If you see some screenshots from the community hub, you can judge the humor for yourself. Perhaps the Japanese original was funny, but the English dialogue totally dropped the ball.\nAt least the core of the gameplay is in tact, but if you don't like the writing, you have no wish to move forward. At least the characters managed to be moderately interesting, but some of their likes and dislikes were oddly difficult to judge.\n\nI suppose $7.99 is probably a good price, but if you're wary about this game, wait for a sale. Go see the community hub and watch a video of it. A small portion of the game is a good enough sample to know if you'd like it or not.","April 13, 2014","false","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/legacyme3/recommended/214610/","legacyme3","One Who Watches the Crowd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/legacyme3/","454 products in account","I'm very torn on how to review this game, since quite frankly, I haven't played enough games similar to this to compare it to. So keep that in mind as I try to jumble through my mixed feelings on this game.\n\nFor starters, let's start with what the story is about. You are a senior, named Miley. You love comedy. You want to start a comedy club. Jerk president of the student council or whatever says you need 5 members to establish a club. The conflict comes in here. You only have 2 members. Yourself and your best friend/roommate, who never is a big part of the game.\n\nSo you, alone, have a month+ (something like 40 days total?) to convince 3 other people to join your club. You accomplish this by getting their "friend level" up to level 5. They all start out at level 1 when you meet them. There are 6 prospective members you can have join you. You can convince any of them (or none of them) to join your club, through various odds and ends.\n\nOne example, and the one I expect most everyone will do on their first (and probably only) run, is the story of a little girl, and her grandfather's candy shop. These stories progress in 5 steps. Step one is the introduction to the character. Step two is the introduction to her story. Step three is the continuation of this story to the point where obvious conflict has arisen. Step four is another continuation of this branch, that usually results in you giving advice, or being helpful to the story's subject. And step five is the conclusion, where the prospective member thanks you for your help in the matter, and then hands you their club signup form, guaranteeing themselves a member of your cult of weirdos.\n\nYou need to do this for at least three of the six potential members to "win". If you get all six, you get the "good" ending.\n\nGenerally, this is a very easy task requiring absolutely no thought. You wake up in the morning and follow one of two schedules. You have a school schedule, and you have a day off schedule.\n\nOn school days, your three blocks of time are as follows... you go to school (and conveniently have most of the characters you wish to recruit in one place, to learn about their likes and dislikes, though this can be uncommon at best), you have a block of time where you can walk around the town and do one special task (whether this is talking to the member you wish to recruit, building your "skills", or spending time eating and doing absolutely nothing), and then finally go home, and sleep/talk to girlfriends on the phone/make beads for money (which is pretty useless honestly.)\n\nOn off days, you do roughly the same thing, except instead of going to school, you get an extra block of the free do whatever you want period.\n\nNow, the game sounded compelling in a way, and I'm a fan of anime-style graphics, so this game caught my eye. I went in with the understanding this game is very short (2 1/2 hours per playthrough at best?) and that the characters aren't to be taken seriously, but this feels like a pretty sloppy piece of work, considering how short the game is.\n\nThere are various magazines you can purchase, or movies you can watch with the intent of upgrading your skills... but this is mostly pointless, as I barely touched my skills, and managed to beat the game with 4 of 6 characters recruited into my club. I'm sure the books may play a bigger part when you are trying to broaden your horizons and get all 6... but even then, it's pretty simple to get any character into your club, given the stereotypical nature of all the characters (the ones who look like they like sports like sports, and the ones who like smart stuff like smart stuff).\n\nBy far the most interesting character in the game is the punk rock girl, Cindy, and her story is so short, that I feel unsatisfied. This is in contrast to Sara's story, which feels long and drawn out, and less interesting.\n\nI don't know, this is more of a synopsis on gameplay than a real review, so I may as well leave my final verdict here. The game is fun for about all of 20 minutes before the repetitive nature gets to you, and you lose interest in the story or what happens to the club. Should you manage to complete the game, (which isn't hard, the game is laughably easy) you can go into a NG+ mode I haven't touched yet (and don't plan to touch.)\n\nWhen a game offers me more content like that, and I say, "no thank you", it generally doesn't bode well for the overall replayabillity of the game. Unless the characters interests change, and the game gets harder (which I doubt on both accounts) I don't think I'll give this game another look.\n\nIf you really must try it, get it during a Summer/Winter Sale when it is wicked cheap, and not at the current price. Paying full price will lead to massive disappointment for all.","January 22, 2014","false","3.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","2"

In games of this type you have to manage a limited number of turns (time) and resources like stamina and money while trying raise your character's stats up high enough to achieve some goal, usually finding a girlfriend. As such most games of this type in Japan are dating sims, although many Japanese dating sims use a different visual novel (choose-your-own-adventure) style of game play. In this case, while it has the standard dating sim high school setting, the goal of the game is different. You're trying to get enough students to sign up as members so you can start a stand-up comedy club at your school.\n\nWhile I can very much recommend it to anyone who might like this sort of game, or is looking for something different, it's hard to rank against other similar games since there are so few games like it available in the west. You have to go back all the way to the ancient text game Hamurabi to find something similar in the western canon of games. The only two Japanese games with similar mechanics I know of that have been officially translated are the unreleased English version of Princess Maker 2 and the PlayStation 2 and Wii game Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love. There was one attempt to make an entirely new game of this sort (I think) for the western market, Brooktown High, but I haven't played it. The RPG games Persona 3 and 4 have elements of these sort of games, and as a stretch you could say the Harvest Moon series of games are sort of similar.\n\n(The original Princess Maker, by the way, is the granddaddy of this variety of resource management games. In the Princes Maker series of games you're trying raise a young orphan girl to become a princess, though other good and bad careers are possible. So Cherry Tree High Comedy Club isn't really breaking the mold by not being a dating sim.)\n\nWhile it has a major publisher in the west, this was independently produced game in Japan and written basically by one guy. So it's not big game, it won't take too long to get through it. I took me 8 hours according to Steam, though some of that might be been while I was away doing other things. The original setting was a small but rapidly growing town in Japan, but this was moved to America for the English localization. That translatation isn't perfect, but changing the locale and cultural references for western audiences was pretty much a necessity. It does produce an odd mashup of American and Japanese culture (why does an American town a have a Shinto shrine complete with shrine maiden?), but a literal translation would've been incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't lived in Japan for sometime.\n","February 4, 2014","true","9.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Some of the stats have fun titles, and there are a lot of well placed jokes throughout the game.\n\nCons:\n1. No noticeable save system.  I ended up quitting out of the game and lost all my progress.\n2. Dialogue gets a little too drawn out.  I feel like the writing could be better, which is a major flaw considering the game's focus on the story above anything else.\n3.

One issue I take with it is; if you're going to make a "game" that consists of reading lines over the back drop of pictures, you can at least make it 1080p HD. It isn't even 720p. In this day and age that is shameful. I could move past this though if it were the only problem. The real problem this 'game' has is very simple and yet very major -- It lacks controls! I've 'played' other so called 'visual novels' before and no matter who made them they all used pretty much the same system of control, which makes sense since it works. That system isn't here. I couldn't use my mouse or game pad at the main menu. I had to use the arrow keys and enter. After that the only thing the 'game' allowed me to do was click the left mouse button to skip to the next line of text. I'm not kidding - That was literally it. I couldn't scroll back to previous text or anything. If it's a good story and funny I'll never really know, because I am not going to spend my time on something with such bad design or rather lack of design. Software 101: The user needs to be able to navigate. I suggest passing on this.","January 18, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There's better out there.\n\nI didn't get to enjoy this game.\n\nThe story is OK and it develops well throughout the story (I only got until the end of April).\nI believe that the main thing that threw me off was the lack of "feel" from a japanese VN that felt more like adapted than translated. If I want American or British feel, I'd go after an American or British VN, if I want a Japanese feel, I go after a Japanese VN. This one... (in the non-westernized version) Is around 3/4 translated & 1/4 adapted.\n\nGood:\nThe gameplay quickly gets too repetitive and mechanical if you want to get to the good end, specially if you do the homework right off the bat.\nThe story-tellers tried to make this non-repetitive and that's good and it worked well enough.\n\nBad:\nI expected this to be heavy on comedy but... It wasn't. The comedy was OK sometimes, weak but, unfortunately, only allowed me to smile at best... when it didn't feel awkward due to wooseysm applied.\nEven when playing the non-westernized version, I saw what is to me too much wooseysm including jokes that I don't see how they can make sense in Japanese. Heck, one or other doesn't even make sense in its context.\n\nI don't know wether to recommend or not this game. As I didn't like due to the wooseysm + jokes that don't make me laugh (only smile or feel awkward in context) + expected to be amused with comedy, I will mention "no".\nDon't get the "no" fully get you, though!

I'm not saying this is a bad game, but it just shouldn't garner a price any higher.\n\nNow, for the actual game.\n\nIf you enjoy simple visual novel-styled games that involve the central mechanic of developing relationships with people based on levels of numerical values, then you will enjoy this. The story is light-hearted, and fairly charming; but there's is very little story to the actual main character herself. In order to get the best ending, you will also need to play through this at least two times, and maybe four times at the most. This is by no means anything on the level of 'Katawa Shoujo', or 'Fate/Stay Night', but is not difficult to enjoy either. The simplicity is really what makes this game fun enough to run through it several times.\n\nYou can clear it very quickly, and another playthrough means just getting the rest of the people to join you; and that's where I draw the line with buying it for no more than $2.99: because it's such a short game with little to add during your run of New Game+. It's still good though, and easy to play if you're out somewhere, or waiting for your next class to begin.\n\n*EDIT*\nAlso, why do they keep pushing the fact that this game clearly takes place in the United States, when I can clearly see how hard they're trying to cover up that this town looks like it's straight out of Japan?

Time for adventure!\nThe game is full of light-hearted humour, references to the real world, fourth wall breaking, and the translation from Japanese to English has been done extremely well (To the point of one of characters asking why there is a Japanese shrine in their village). Each character is pretty unique as far as anime characters go, and I quickly found myself taking a liking to most, if not all of them.\n\nJust like a dating sim, Miley only has a few days to date.. or in this case, recruit friends for her comedy club.

The difference here is that you're making purely platonic friends with the end goal being to recruit people to join your comedy club. Otherwise, it's the stuff you're probably already familiar with- the ultimate test in time management of socializing, keeping up with school, working part-time, and leveling up your stats.\nIt's a great game and very relaxing (if simultaneously suspensful because you wonder if you can get everyone before the month is out) with cute character design, dialogue, and development. It's just a really well-rounded package and if you've got any interest in visual novels, enjoyed Persona's social aspect, or just want a cute little story then this shouldn't be missed.\n\nIt should be noted there is a Westernized version and a localized version- the former changes the original Japanese names to American ones like 'Miley' or 'Sara'. I played with the latter option because it's kind of jarring to play a clearly Japanese product but have it stripped of that sort of authenticity- and I'm not necessarily stuck up on things like subs vs dubs. I can't comment on the quality of the westernized version, but it's great that it's an option for people who want it, but it should be noted that the sequel stays faithful to the original Japanese qualities... so if you're interested in both the localized version is probably your best pick.","January 5, 2015","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because of this, you have to play it again in order to get a perfect run, because you just can't learn everything you can do in the game and still get it 100% right within the time limit. This may or may not be a bad thing for some.\n\nThe game is also very short. It feels like having many good intentions scattered across but ultimately not well enough developed, because there's no way to fit such things in such a short timeframe. There is some relationship building and some background info on the characters that you discover this way, but it's all way too short and succinctly presented.\n\nOtherwise, the game is neat. It delivers the cuteness dose it's supposed to, it's interesting enough, and can keep you busy for a few hours or more.

You play as a girl called Miley who has the dream to become a comedian, and this is why she's creating a comedy club.. though.. to have a club, you need members, something she doesn't have yet. Time for adventure!\nThe game is full of light-hearted humour, references to the real world, fourth wall breaking, and the translation from Japanese to English has been done extremely well (To the point of one of characters asking why there is a Japanese shrine in their village). Each character is pretty unique as far as anime characters go, and I quickly found myself taking a liking to most, if not all of them.\n\nJust like a dating sim, Miley only has a few days to date.. or in this case, recruit friends for her comedy club.

Also another annoying factor about this game is that is plays in such a small window. You can't even full screen it!

If you have no interest in anime, ridiculous and exaggerated characters, and playing what more or less amounts to a friendship simulator, I can tell you right now there is nothing for you here. On the other hand if you enjoy quirky Japanese games, Cherry Tree is one of the few of its kind to be found on Steam and that novelty is what lead me to giving it a go. Unfortunately I came away quite disappointed, and am once again left searching for a suitable replacement.\n\nAlthough there were quite a few things I felt ended up as missed opportunities, the biggest detractor was the lackluster characters and writing. Though it's set in Japan the dialog is decidedly westernized, which led to it feeling less like one of my beloved anime comedies and more like what you might find in a Disney channel show. I never grew fond of any of the characters, and actually became rather annoyed whenever I had to spend an extended period of time interacting with them. This lack of interest also lead to repetition setting in rather quickly, and by the end I was simply going through the motions in order to recruit my required number of members. Given you can beat the game in a short 4-5 hours, how quickly it turned into a grind is very disappointing.\n\nI honestly really wanted to love Cherry Tree. It appeared to have all the ingredients for a game I'd love (anime and pixel graphics, a premise that sounded right up my alley, and gameplay that fell into the realm of the unusual), but it never clicked for me. Interaction felt shallow, the writing and jokes all fell flat, and it's strict time structure left little room for experimentation. There is certainly some semblance of charm to be found here, but for me at least, it didn't wind up amounting to something I enjoyed, or have any real desire to replay.","August 11, 2013","false","3.3"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","21","45","0","5"

With the word "comedy" right in the title, the game is under pressure to deliver, and some might find the humor a little too bright and quirky, but it generally delivers. The gameplay can get a tiny bit grindy towards the end, but it's not really long enough to suffer much for it. I managed to just recruit the minimum of 3 characters two game-days before the deadline in my first playthrough, which clocked in at about 5.5 hours. A second play-through (which allows you to carry over your skills and records of the potential recruits preferences) took just another 3 hours and was wrapped up with an in-game week to spare.\n\nBrevity aside, this game did successfully elicit both laughs and a few tears from me for the correct reasons. Actually, the short length could make this a good choice for someone who is hesitant to try something from the visual-novel genre/medium.\n\nAlso, I think the only difference between the original and westernized localization translation are the character names.","November 24, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For those who aren't familiar with the U.S., we don't have shrines... like... AT ALL.   It doesn't have any kind of action/platforming what so ever and is so absurdly riddled with typo's, you begin not even to question if the translator speaks English natively so much but rather, if they are even fluent in it.  Regardless, the writing gets the job done and the characters are all unique and interesting.\n\nAll things taken into consideration, the "slice of life" aura CTHCC brings to the table is a breath of fresh air in a market flooded with violence, zombies, and post apocolyptic environs.

Funny things can be found in this game, and at least one character, the shrine maiden (not seen in the picture to the right), has a deadpan-serious about random things type of personality that really suits my taste of humor. The humor is a backdrop to the main focus, though - exploring and planning the tactical manipulation of 6 schoolchildren into your "comedy club" within a set number of turns, without NG+, can be pretty difficult. This game can be entertaining if you're like me and are interested in any game involving anime-styled characters.\n\nSpoilers:\nIt's supposed to take place in America, apparently, but the town resembles modern day Japan a lot more, complete with a shinto styled shrine on a hill that was supposedly donated from a sister city in Japan. I'm not sure if this was a change the translation team decided to do, or what.\nAlso, I'm sad that the MC doesn't tell any jokes, or at least any memorable ones. For a game about a comedy club, you would expect a series of stand up jokes from the MC, but alas, she only exhibits manipulative behavior and a bit of lesbianism.

It doesn't have any kind of action/platforming what so ever and is so absurdly riddled with typo's, you begin not even to question if the translator speaks English natively so much but rather, if they are even fluent in it.  Regardless, the writing gets the job done and the characters are all unique and interesting.\n\nAll things taken into consideration, the "slice of life" aura CTHCC brings to the table is a breath of fresh air in a market flooded with violence, zombies, and post apocolyptic environs.  Personally, for eight bux, I'm certainly getting my moneys worth out of this title.  For a nice distraction from the drudgery of the waking world or even other games, I whole heartedly reccomend this off beat title.","February 2, 2013","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the word "comedy" right in the title, the game is under pressure to deliver, and some might find the humor a little too bright and quirky, but it generally delivers. The gameplay can get a tiny bit grindy towards the end, but it's not really long enough to suffer much for it. I managed to just recruit the minimum of 3 characters two game-days before the deadline in my first playthrough, which clocked in at about 5.5 hours. A second play-through (which allows you to carry over your skills and records of the potential recruits preferences) took just another 3 hours and was wrapped up with an in-game week to spare.\n\nBrevity aside, this game did successfully elicit both laughs and a few tears from me for the correct reasons. Actually, the short length could make this a good choice for someone who is hesitant to try something from the visual-novel genre/medium.\n\nAlso, I think the only difference between the original and westernized localization translation are the character names.","November 24, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically Persona 3 without Tartaris.\n\nYou go through each day, (morning, noon, and evening) and try to recruit fellow students to join your school club.  To do so, you have to talk to them (like building social links) but in order to make interesting conversation, you must build your rank in various and sundry topics one might converse about (just like leveling personal attributes in Personas 3 and 4).  As you can imagine, this all takes time and the clock is ticking down.

Funny things can be found in this game, and at least one character, the shrine maiden (not seen in the picture to the right), has a deadpan-serious about random things type of personality that really suits my taste of humor. The humor is a backdrop to the main focus, though - exploring and planning the tactical manipulation of 6 schoolchildren into your "comedy club" within a set number of turns, without NG+, can be pretty difficult. This game can be entertaining if you're like me and are interested in any game involving anime-styled characters.\n\nSpoilers:\nIt's supposed to take place in America, apparently, but the town resembles modern day Japan a lot more, complete with a shinto styled shrine on a hill that was supposedly donated from a sister city in Japan. I'm not sure if this was a change the translation team decided to do, or what.\nAlso, I'm sad that the MC doesn't tell any jokes, or at least any memorable ones. For a game about a comedy club, you would expect a series of stand up jokes from the MC, but alas, she only exhibits manipulative behavior and a bit of lesbianism.

That sort of xenophobic sensitivity is painful and decades out of date. Even ignoring the weak attempts to pretend it was all happening in the US and fit everything into stereotypes thereof, the localization team was in dire need of a fluent English-speaking editor because the English language was abused in many amateurish ways. There/their/they're, to/too, etc. are prevalent errors, and I encountered at least one sentence so broken that it is incomprehensible gibberish. It's a doujin so I let the poor English slide for the most part, but it's something that anyone competent in the language could have spotted in an evening read-through so it makes it feel like they rushed through it.\n\nMechanically, there are some bugs and design choices I find questionable. At times, the wrong sprites and location lables would show during events and conversations, but it was nothing game-breaking. I found the randomized events and such to be frustrating because attempting to apply strategy in skill-building was ultimately undermined by my inability to predict or control which skills would be leveled by the random events. There are multiple endings and a new game+, and, as it seems unlikely to get the complete ending the first time through, there is a reason to play the ng+, but you'll likely be so over-skilled that you'll finish the recruitment about half-way through, which makes it inconvenient that there are neither text-progression contols nor more effective time-advancing mechanics.\n\nIt was alright, but could've been better.","November 29, 2013","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Funny things can be found in this game, and at least one character, the shrine maiden (not seen in the picture to the right), has a deadpan-serious about random things type of personality that really suits my taste of humor. The humor is a backdrop to the main focus, though - exploring and planning the tactical manipulation of 6 schoolchildren into your "comedy club" within a set number of turns, without NG+, can be pretty difficult. This game can be entertaining if you're like me and are interested in any game involving anime-styled characters.\n\nSpoilers:\nIt's supposed to take place in America, apparently, but the town resembles modern day Japan a lot more, complete with a shinto styled shrine on a hill that was supposedly donated from a sister city in Japan. I'm not sure if this was a change the translation team decided to do, or what.\nAlso, I'm sad that the MC doesn't tell any jokes, or at least any memorable ones. For a game about a comedy club, you would expect a series of stand up jokes from the MC, but alas, she only exhibits manipulative behavior and a bit of lesbianism.

You manage a limited amount of time/actions to improve your skills and then use those skills to overcome challenges.  It is a good time for the short game/novel it is.  About 3-4 hours of unique content with a second playthrough pretty much needed to see the stories of the all characters.  After seeing the content however, the game loses all replay value.  Nothing random happens and the majority of the events have maybe 1-2 versions depending on your progress at that point in the game.  I would recommend to pick it up on sale if you have interest in these types visual novels.  However, it won't convince anyone to be a fan of the genre.  Keep in mind there is a new game+ that allows you to carry over your stats if you "beat" the game to allow easier recruitment on future plays.\n\nNote: I played the non-westernized version.\n\nPros:\n+Decent characters - I liked them.  They were trope heavy, but they were well written and I enjoyed the banter.\n+Great Art - I really do enjoy the art-style of the game.  Between the pixel art characters and the  cartoony overworld, you will be enjoying the colorful town.\n\nMeh:\n~Short - Common for this genre, but depending on your reading speed it is easy to finish the first time in 2.5-3.5hrs.  I completed the game 3 times in my 5.5hrs and saw everything this game has to offer.\n~Music - Nothing wrong, nothing noteworthy.\n\nCons:\n-No dialogue skip - Most visual novels have the ability to skip over text you have already read, if you plan on playing 2-3 times to either see the other characters or recruit all 6 this feature is sorely missing.\n-Poor graphics options - Full screen stretches and the default resolution is pitiful.  Would benefit from either bars on full screen or the ability to scale the game window.\n-Short - Common for this genre, but depending on your reading speed it is easy to finish the first time in 2.5-3.5hrs.

You play as Mairu, a slacker and joker who argues with children over cartoons. Mairu wants to start a comedy club at her school, but waited until the last minute to recruit the remaining 3 people necessary for her club to be official. Help her achieve her dreams. Think modern Persona games, with all the dungeon and fighting stuff cut out. You spend your days running around town, picking up empty bottles and trying to raise your stats so you can trick people into liking you enough to join your comedy club. The game is actually a bit harder than it looks, as later friendship levels can move at an almost glacial if you aren't using the right conversation topics. There really isn't much too it than that, and the game is fairly short (takes place over about a month and a half, which was over 3 hours for me). Perfect for living out all my Japanese high school life fantasies.
