Very little has changed. Same controls, same key-bindings (With the Pause, Fire & Alt-Fire still locked just as they were in Halo: Spartan Assault) same mission structure, same narrative style, but thankfully an improved UI. The differences & additions are very few. But in truth, there was little expectation of it to be so, nor any effort to make us believe as such. And being a game that's just above half the price of it's official soundtrack album, it's cheap & cheerful fun that will occupy you for 2-4hrs.\n\nIf you had fun with Halo: Spartan Assault shooting lots of bad guys to achieve a highest score, this will not fail to satisfy. If you've played neither, you can pick them up together in a bundle, which I recommend you do to save yourself even more money.\n\nIt's a twin-stick shooter that surprisingly inherits the combat of the core Halo shooters very well, and while it isn't anything noteworthy or something I'd consider highly recommendable, it's performance is solid & undemanding, it doesn't demand your time nor leaves a large hole in your wallet.","April 16, 2015","true","7.5"," 195 of 218 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","195","218","10","2"

Do you like the Halo franchise?\n2.) Did you enjoy Spartan Assault?\n3.) Do you mind playing more of the same, with some new content and a fresh coat of paint?\n\nOf course, it's not always that simple. Spartan Strike might appeal to people who haven't played much of the Halo franchise, sure. The gameplay is basic, but satisfying. Thanks to the 'Skull' system in this and its predecessor, you can custom-tailor your difficulty to a degree, as well as limitedly changing up a some of the gameplay mechanics.\n\nIf you're looking at the game from a value standpoint, my opinion is that it's worth the money... if the gameplay is your cup of tea. I haven't finished the game yet, but I can tell it's most likely going to be short. I don't have a problem with that, considering the reasonable price tag. Honestly, $6 feels like a sale price already, especially considering that the aforementioned Skulls can add some challenge and a bit of replayability.\n\nNow, for fans of Halo, this game succeeds in capturing a bit more of the large scale feel of the previous Halo games a lot better than Spartan Assault, at least in the beginning. That doesn't mean it's got huge levels with divergent paths and a whole lot of room for creativity in your runs, it just means that the actual scale of things is better. There are background events you can pay attention to going on above or below your field of play; the second level even had the huge bridge from Halo 2 down below, with what I assume to be Master Chief in a Scorpion tank blowing up Ghosts. It was a nice touch.\n\nI can't speak for the state of the port. Honestly, I haven't had any issues playing the game. The game looks reasonably pretty, though I might not be the best metric for that. I thought Dark Souls I looked good on PC. Performance is solid, even on my relatively low-end PC, but that's to be expected from what's basically a side-by-side PC and mobile game. Luckily, there aren't any of the microtransactions the mobile version undoubtedly has, which is always refreshing.\n\nAll in all, I'm enjoying my time with Spartan Strike. If you like Halo and don't mind a bit of rehashing, give this game a try. Then again, if you like Halo, you have to have a pretty good tolerance for rehashing. If you like twin-stick shooters, this is a pretty decent one.","April 16, 2015","true","2.6"," 125 of 145 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","125","145","6","0"

You're basically a Spartan (that's you!) and you're in simulation training, which you're tasked to do various missions in different operations. From the Battle of New Mombasa all the way to the Battle of New Phoenix. Even though the gameplay isn't everybody's cup of tea, at least give it a try. The levels can be short, so you'll end up finishing it at about a couple of hours at most. But along with getting the achievements and adding skulls for a bit of a challenge, it took me a little over a day to complete the game.\n\nSpartan Strike also introduces new things that weren't in Spartan Assault, such as the Warthog, Kestrel, and fighting Promethean enemies. The new content alone is enough to add a little more fun to the game and spice things up a bit.\n\n$6 in my opinion is worth it for a decent top-down shooter like this. $6 is cheap for a standard game alone, but you can also get it when it goes on sale (66% off on the bundle as of right now!) so you get more bang for your buck. The only bad parts are that there's no multiplayer co-op along with no badges or trading cards (although that may happen in the future!). But even then, Halo: Spartan Strike is a great game as it stands for everyone to try out!\n\nShould you buy this game?\nAs a Halo fan, you should definitely get it! If you're looking for decent games or getting into Halo, give Spartan Strike or Spartan Assault a try!\n10/10\n\nEdit: I wrote this review as these games were on sale at the time (66% off), but now that's no longer the case. :(","September 13, 2015","true","18.3"," 55 of 59 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","55","59","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/324570/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Right from the landmark battle aboard the UNSC Pillar of Autumn, the Halo franchise has almost always been a team effort, even though Master Chief has done most of the heavy lifting in the mainline series. That's where all the spin-offs and novels come in. As the follow-up to Vanguard Games' Halo: Spartan Assault, Halo: Spartan Strike is not only a spin-off, but also a top-down shooter that reinforces the notion that Halo need not be limited to the first-person perspective. From a continuity standpoint, Spartan Strike takes bigger risks than Spartan Assault, setting reprisals from Halo 2 while giving more screen time to the Prometheans, who weren't introduced to the series until Halo 4.\n\nSpartan Strike's bite-sized five-minute missions fit in well with a straightforward story involving the Artifact of Doom plot device. In this case, the artifact is called the Conduit, a device that functions as a Promethean portal key. It is also a tried and tested sci-fi term that has been used in Mass Effect, Dead Space, and as the title of a Sega-published first-person shooter. Through much of Spartan Strike, the Conduit is subjected to a football-like change of hands between the UNSC Marine Corps and the Covenant.\n\nEqually engaging is the opportunity to revisit familiar areas from the main series. In Halo 2, New Mombasa was a war-torn battleground where Master Chief was just one of countless soldiers tasked to repel the Covenant. The raised visual perspective of Spartan Strike shows off New Mombasa as a highly vertical metropolis. While you're guiding a Spartan-IV along a commercial district in the foreground, UNSC troops are holding their own on a bridge in the background, hundreds of yards away. Although your player-character functions like a one-man army, nothing detracts from the implied accomplishments of the soldiers in the surrounding areas. Conversely, the location shift to Gamma Halo (also known as Installation 03) is a less engrossing environment, as, for the most part, it's a generic jungle accented with Forerunner architecture.\n\nIn terms of the general control scheme of Halo: Spartan Strike they are pretty much identical to Spartan Assault. The only changes worth mentioning have to do with the responsiveness of the controls. In Assault, I found vehicle controls to be a bit of a chore, as it was a little tough to simultaneously pilot and aim the weapons. However Spartan Strike seems to have made some minor adjustments that have lead to an improved experience in terms of vehicle controls. I’m glad they succeeded in this area, because Spartan Strike throws a lot more vehicle based combat at you at a faster and earlier pace than Assault did.\n\nSpeaking of general changes, Spartan Strike also makes some significant changes to the credit/weapon upgrade system. Both games have an arcade-ish system of weapon prep prior to the start of any mission. Players can expend credits to upgrade the default weapons and power-ups for any mission. Credits can also be spent on damage and score power-ups, which is important because players earn said credits by achieving high scores (complete with a three ‘star’ system) and hitting level-based objectives (such as killing  a certain number of enemies with a particular type of weapon). The big catch is that any weapon or upgrade purchased applies only for that next mission playthrough, meaning that players should probably think about how much they want to spend on what mission.\n\nPlayers can also apply difficulty ‘Skulls’ (a throwback to gameplay modifiers that can be found in other Halo games) to increase the percentage of credits earned at the expense of making the game more difficult. The Skull system is particularly important in these games because it’s really the only way one can tailor difficulty, as there are no general difficulty levels to choose from. I also think it works well in the Halo: Spartan games in general because the missions aren’t particularly lengthy, so it’s cool to customize difficulty and if it's too onerous, it’s not a big deal to restart and try a different combination.\n\nGetting back to the Spartan Strike improvements, the amount of credits earned in each mission, as well as the cost for weapons, has seen a significant reduction when compared to its predecessor. In addition, the first six missions are relatively easy to earn lots of credits on without upgrading your hero which means by the time the difficulty gets tough, you should have a decent batch of currency available to customize your weapons and power-ups. There are also some pretty cool weapons you can upgrade to, such as the Spartan Laser and Rocket Launcher.\n\nThe biggest improvement I think Spartan Strike brings to the table is its greater emphasis on narrative-based gameplay throughout the missions. Spartan Assault had a habit of giving the player a general objective for a single mission and then letting them go at it. Spartan Strike feels like it has a more ‘dynamic’ flow in terms of the multitude of objective that can be found in any one mission. You might start out searching for a convoy, which then translates to an escort quest for said convoy while occasionally being interrupted to go on a fetch or switch quest, all of it accompanied by narrative that at least gives you a purpose for what you’re doing. It sounds like a small upgrade, but I feel it’s important for overall immersion and it certainly made me more invested in each mission.\n\nAnother huge improvement is in terms of visuals. Spartan Assault looked pretty good for a two year old game but Spartan Strike blows it out of the water. Explosions look great, you can see enemies and allies fighting each other on different tiers in the backdrop, and everything just looks clear and crisp. Credit also goes to the great soundtrack, which captures the auditory feel of a Halo games very well.\n\nIf I had to choose between Halo: Spartan Assault or Halo: Spartan Strike I’d pick the latter. It has a host of iterative improvements to the gameplay formula and looks and sounds excellent. However, both have a enough story immersion that I’d recommend picking up both for completion’s sake. Regardless, these are both two great dual stick shooters that are well worth a purchase.","May 15","true","7.2"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","1"

Even though there are only two, Halo: Spartan Strike is the best.\nThis will be a doubble review because I bought the game bundle for 10 USD.\n\nHalo: Spartan Assault\nMeh it's good I guess...\n\nHalo: Spartan Strike\nAlthough the game is the same as Halo: Spartan Assault (really they just changed the main character and changed the last part of the name fron Assault to Strike) the game is better for some reason.\n\nThe shooting is great and I love it how the armour abilities are in the game. The weapon selection could have been a little more expanded, all you get in other weapon selections are the SRS99C-S2 AM Sniper Rifle,\nW/AV M6 G/GNR (Spartan Laser) and the M41 SSR MAV/AW (Rocket Launcher). The starting weapons you get (varies on mission but going to list the first mission weapons) are the MA5D Individual Combat Weapon System (Assault Rifle) and the M6G Personal Defense Weapon System (Pistol).\n\nFor my final thought, the game is awesome... I would play it for a few missions a day and enjoy it! I say if you're a Halo fanboy like me or like top-down shooters then buy it!\n\nAND IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING HALO ON PC!!!\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CanadianGuitar/recommended/324570/","CanadianGuitar","Canadian Guitar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CanadianGuitar/","308 products in account","Halo: Spartan Strike is a top down, twin-stick shooter set in the Halo Universe, taking place after the events of Halo 4. It is an indirect sequel to Halo: Spartan Assualt, developed by 343 Industries (who has taken over from Bungie making Halo games), and Vangaurd Games (who also worked on Halo:SA).\n\nThe game works like your typical twin-stick shooter; your view of the game is from the sky looking down at your character and the surroundings, moving with one stick/hand (controller/Keyboard), and aiming with the other stick/mouse. I didn't play with keyboard at all, so I can't speak for how well it does or doesn't work, but plugging in my Xbox One controller the controls were great, and very responsive. Most of the time, you're tasked with going here, clearing out an area, or defending one, and then extracting. During some missions, you have access to various vehicles, a total of 6 playable, including one new to the series the UNSC Kestrel (Essentially, the UNSC equivalent to the Covenant Ghost). Also at your disposal are a  healthy selection of 18 hand held weapons, from the UNSC, Covenant and Prometheans, and a few different armour abilities including stronger shields, a sentry turret, and many others.\n\nThe story itself is pretty forgettable in my opinion; as I lose a lot of interest in the Halo universe when the Prometheans are mentioned. The game is made up of Operations, there are 5 total (A through E), and each operation contains 6 Missions each, thus there are 30 levels in total. I completed the game (will return for some clean up on achievements) in almost 5 hours on the mark. One operation takes place during the events of Halo 2, but the rest take place after the story of Halo 4. The levels themselves aren't hard at all, and there is no difficulty selection in the game. I only had died maybe 4 times through the whole thing, and had to replay 1-2 levels where I failed an objective. The game can however be made more difficult by activating a few different skulls on different missions that act as sort of a modifer. These add various interesting features such as; guns you pick up have less ammo, or you must melee enemies to regain shield, and a few others. During the missions, not only are you working on the in game objectives, but there is also a scoring system earning you stars on each mission (Bronze, Silver and Gold). Points are earned for each enemy killed, or getting medals and getting multikills. These serve no purpose other than to get you an achievement.\n\nThe graphics look good, but won't blow you away. If you are familiar with Halo games, it looks as any other would, just from the sky; colourful and well thought out landscapes. As far as graphical options, you can only change the game resolution, or the Anti Aliasing. The game's requirements are pretty low by todays standards, and I can't imagine anyone having difficulty running this game. I personally experience no issues or stutter at all, even with other programs running in the back. The sound effects are good, and sound on par with that of the console games. There is little voice acting, but it is satisfying, but nothing award worthy.\n\n\nPros\nVery fun game\nEasy to sit down and play, not a lot of thinking or difficulty\nCheap to pick up\nLarge variety of guns for a twin stick game\nHalo universe is always fun and interesting\nMostly easy achievements\nCons\nOnly Single-player\nAlthough the game is lengthy for the price, there isn't a lot to go back for once you beat it\nStory is forgettable\nPrometheans are boring\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, the game is fun. It's a cheap game, easy to play through, and a very solid twin stick experience. While it doesn't add anything particularly new or exciting to the genre, it's solid enough on it's own to warrent trying out, especially since it's only a few bucks. Those who like the Halo universe, will find it even more enjoyable.","April 5","true","8.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I beat the main storyline, and had a lot of fun doing it. They did a good job of bringing a game type that's not seen so frequently nowadays and making it seem modern with great graphics and smooth mechanics. It's a very three-dimensional world for a top-down shooter, with a tactical edge even though the maneuvering is limited. The vehicles are cool, with the classic control someone controlling something driving system, just so it's different and not too easy. You can tell they wanted a small project they could bring to both PC and mobile, and yet they did a great job.\nHowever, it doesn't quite compare to Spartan Assault. You are either in cities or the jungle, reducing the alien/sci-fi atmosphere. The Covenant are not your main opponents after the first operation, which gives it nice variety. There are too many of the weak-but-lethal Promethians, though. Almost all the guns 1-hit kill the majority of the people you face. I love some of the new weapons (YEAH BATTLE RIFLE), but they're too overpowered. The game was much easier than Spartan Assault, only one level really frustrating me. Even the classic sit-in-turret-and-kill-suicide-grunts level was really easy. There were no challenging destroy-20-vehicles-with-a-magnum levels either. Besides, the whole story was a simulation. That kind of pales in light of the epic story of self-sacrifice in the first one.\nIf you're looking for something new and fun, play Spartan Assault. If you don't bore of that (which you shouldn't!), definitely get this game.","September 2, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I am going to write this review using only facts and at the very end I will give a quick 'my opinion' portion.\n\nSo here they are, a buncha random facts about the game.\n\nGame - Halo: Spartan Strike\nReview Date - 07/15/2015\nPlatform - PC/Steam\n\n\nFeatures:-The game was developed by 343 Industries and Vanguard Entertainment\n-As of 07/15/2015 the pc version of this game does not have co op and there are 6 operations with 5 missions each.\n-You can rebind most of the keys. You cannot rebind the functions Pause (escape) fire (left click) throw grenade (right click) when using keyboard and mouse.\n-There are drivable vehicles and manable turrets.\n-There are leaderboards for who has scored the highest on specific missions.\n-There are cutscenes in the game.\n-There are achievements in the game (20 at the time of writing).\n-There is a tutorial.\n-Each level has a bronze, silver and gold level of performance (based on your performance).\n-You may adjust the volume of SFX and music in the options, but you cannot do so during a mission.\n-You may disable subtitles in the options.\n-You can adjust resolution, AA and refresh rate in the options. (There does not appear to be a windowed fullscreen or windowed option but when I alt + tabbed the game became windowed.)\n\n\nStory:-The plot of the game takes place after Halo 4, but jumps back in time to Halo 2 during some of the simulations.\n-You play as a Spartan IV super soldier.\n-The battle rifle is available during some missions.\n-The new enemy race from Halo 4 is included in this game.\n-All levels are simulations.\n-The final operation cannot be accessed until you have gold in all other missions.\n\n\nMechanics:-You never reload in this game. All weapons fire until you are completely out of ammo.\n-Running over a weapon you are holding will automatically pick up the ammo in the gun on the ground (this includes plasma weapons).\n-When you throw a grenade it will travel towards your cursor location.\n-Firing slows your movement down.\n-While inside of a vehicle or turret it will take damage and you will not. If you are in one of them when it is destroyed you die.\n-Grenades can hit obstacles on their way to target and get stuck.\n-The plasma pistol can be charged to deal chunk damage to vehicles and disable them.\n-While banshee's do fly overhead, you never actually fight or drive one.\n-You can hold up to 5 grenades of two types and can swap between grenades.\n-You hold up to two weapons at a time and can swap between them.\n-You can melee using the melee key (default space bar).\n-There is a border at the edge of each mission to which you can not go past(a visible barrier). Enemies will sometimes phase into the playable area from outside this region and will be invincible until they fully phase in.\n-You have a Radar that shows enemies as red dots.\n-There are explosive barrels and objects that can hurt you and enemies.\n-You can drive over enemies which will kill them instantly.\n-You will be killed instantly if a vehicle (including your own) drives over you.\n-If you use the 'hollow' and 'pacifist' skull you can kill yourself by shooting until all of your shield is gone.\n\n\nGeneral:-You can only increase the difficulty with skulls.\n-There are 6 skulls total.\n-You may only apply 2 skulls max.\n-Applying skulls increases point gain.\n-You can performs certain tasks to gain lump sums of points by filling objectives known as Assault OPS .\n-There are weekly objectives and mission specific ones.\n-Points can be spent to swap out your primary, alternate weapon or your armor ability. They can also be used to apply a buff such as increased score.\n-It is possible to get all 20 achievements in under 25 hours.\n-There are no flood in this game on the pc version at the time of this review .\n\n\n\n\nQuick opinion:\nYou can ignore this section unless you're still on the fence about the game and want my opinion.\n\nMaybe if it's on sale for a lot, but I felt the game was extremely samey environmentally and not nearly as interesting as the first. It also reused a lot of the levels. It feels like they took the first game, copy and pasted some of the assets to this  one. Unless you're a big fan of halo or you see it on sale for money you are ok with throwing away for a few hours of entertainment, avoid it.","July 15, 2015","false","15.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

I decided to immediately pick this up as soon as I saw it for sale, as I enjoyed the last game, Halo: Spartan Assault.\n\nSpartan Strike's story has you playing as an unnamed orange SPARTAN-IV, tasked with the goal of hunting down the Conduit, an ancient Forerunner object from the Covenant. The first part of the game takes place in a simulation of Battle of New Mombasa during the events of Halo 2, with the rest taking place after Halo 4. The story isn't anything special, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. The gameplay remains the same from Spartan Assault, but with the additions of a new UNSC vehicle called the Kestrel, and the Prometheans as an alternative enemy to the Covenant. As with the Steam release of Spartan Assault, there are no microtransactions ingame, as additional weapons and abilities can be bought with ingame currency gained from completing missions. There is no multiplayer sadly, which is disappointing.  The music(composed by Tom Salta) is one of the best parts in this game, as it sounds closer to original trilogy's soundtrack compared to Halo 4's.\n\nIf you enjoy the Halo franchise and/or like top down shooters, I recommend this game, especially at it's current price.","May 15, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Disfrute esta entrega porque yo nunca jugué contra los nuevos enemigos: los Prometheans, por lo tanto me hace sentir un poco más en contacto con la saga.\nEn cuanto al título, lo considero mejor que su predecesor, Halo Spartan Assault, la jugabilidad sigue siendo la misma, con la excepción de que le fue añadido un vehículo UNSC (Kestrel), nuevos enemigos (Prometheans) con todo el arsenal de ellos. Las misiones fueron más difíciles que en las de Halo Spartan Assault, y los logros como los vidmaster challenges ya suponen un reto en el que uno tiene que batallar para poder desbloquearlos. Lo único que no me gustó es que la campaña es muy corta, un gamer casual lo podría pasar en 3 ó 4 horas, yo tengo registradas más de 15 por que me gusta desbloquear todos los logros.\nNo se puede configurar la sensibilidad, así que tendrá que adaptarte.\nNo está compatible para todas las resoluciones, no encontré la resolución nativa de mi monitor, pero no merma la forma en como se disfruta el juego, porque los gráficos son hermosos para un top view shooter.\nY pues como es un top view shooter, es bueno para la presentación de este tipo de juegos, pero quiero destacar que se podría añadir un modo multijugador como en la versión para celular, y que hubiera misiones cooperativas como en Halo 2 y 3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/324570/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","At first, I thought of reviewing both Spartan Assault and Spartan Strike as one game, then noting their differences. The Twin-Stick shooter gameplay is similar to make you think that SS is the same as SA (which came first).\n\nHowever, after playing all of SA and 80% of SS, there is a subtle difference in how each game plays that may or may not to be to your liking: The mission structure in SA is less "Halo" than SS, which I think is to the game's benefit.\n\nIt Plays Like Halo, And Suffers For it\nThe PC port for Halo: Spartan Strike (and Spartan Assault) is a mobile/tablet port for an isometric twin-stick shooter (made by the same guys who made Gatling Gears, Vanguard Entertainment).\n\nAlmost all buttons can be remapped, save for the fire, the grenade and the pause button. Controller support is optional, and the keyboard and mouse controls are almost all perfect. The only lacking thing for controls are the vehicles. There are also simplistic options, nothing that is going to tax your computer.\n\nImporting the mechanics of the Halo franchise works, to my surprise, quite well for the genre change with some tweaks to how they all work. Along with some alterations to work within the new genre. For example, no reloading for weapons and the alterations to certain guns like the Spartan Laser's sustained fire.\n\nSome carry-overs from the Halo franchise: The two limit arsenal, the armor abilities, the Skull difficulty modifiers, the later addition of loadouts (which uses XP you earn in completing missions to unlock one-time weapon unlocks and other changes for your loadout), and the expanded arsenal and vehicles. (Yes, you can board them.)\n\nYou'll fight both the Covenant from the original trilogy and the Prometheans of Halo 4. All of their AI acts exactly like how they would in the Halo games.\n\nExamples: Elites are more mobile, Grunts go on sucide runs, Brutes charge at you. Promethean Knights teleport when hurt and they try to rush at you. The droids around them can catch your grenades, ressurect fallen allies and shield some enemies.\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised they were able to impliment all of the AI abilities into this game so perfectly.\n\n(And the human AIs for your teammates are useful for once. Go figure.)\n\nThe weaponry and the vehicles are much larger than in SA. You get the BR, the grenade launcher from Reach, the Warthog with remote turret controls, and a new vehicle called the Kestral (a human Ghost with grenade turrets). Most of the Halo staples are here and, again, all of them feel useful.\n\nDespite having a larger amount of weapons, their diversity is worse than in SS. Some of the human weapons are held back from you unless you happen to play a mission on a human settlement. You still have the rocket-launcher, the Spartan laser and the sniper rifle unlocks, but I'm surprised they didn't expand upon the unlock system. (Now it's Credits not XP.)\n\nAs you would expect from a mobile game, your objective is to complete simple missions and to get the best raiting. In this game's case, beat the 5 to 10 min missions in the quickest time with the most flare. This is through the medal system from the Halo franchise, which fits in to providing an enjoyable experience.\n\nHowever, and the one thing I think will irritate players, is how the game plays more similar to the Halo campaigns. That means being sent backwards for an arbitrary reason you can't move forward, or having delays/changes to your objectives scripted for you.\n\nCampaign 1 of 5 (there are still 30 missions total) is the worst offender as the first-section of the game is padded with needless backtracking and showing off the fancier graphics and mechanics. Once you get past the first campaign, the next missions (2 to 4) feel more similar to SA.. But it still can suffer from changing the objective constantly in a scripted manner.\n\nPerhaps it's a personal preference, but if you're going to focus a mobile game on doing your best in the quickest time, you should have a simple objective with zero abitrary timers (unless if it's a holding-the-line mission). It feels as forced as the moments in Halo that pads its game out.\n\nSome Improvements/Regressions from Spartan Assault\nThe narrative for Spartan Strike is as unimportant as Spartan Assault. Argubly even more pointless because you play events as a nameless Spartan who wasn't really there--it's just part of the simulation. However, this game does shed some light on the Conduit for Halo 4. (Not that it ever really bothered me to know more about that device.)\n\nVehicles control vastly superior to SS. Now the controls are back to the Halo style movement of hold the forward button while turning with the other thumbstick (or A and D) and it looks smooth.\n\nFor some reason the player now has a cursor for its direction, but the movement looks more stiff as a result. (Was that an issue to some people who couldn't tell where they were going?)\n\nWhile the gunplay is just as satisfying and more interesting with the larger loadout, I noticed far more delay on shooting with my mouse. (Sometimes punching would be the best way to fix it.) I didn't have this issue in Spartan Strike as often as I have experienced it here.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the mission structure is almost the same, but because of those abitrary timers on your mission, when you fail an objective you'll quit far more because you'll have to sit through those scripted sections, again. Many times I would quit the mission and come back with a rocket-launcher to vent my frustration. It wouldn't be bad if there were checkpoints--optional--that would take off lots of points.\n\nAnother huge change that I don't find useful to the type of game SA tried to be is the removal of the time-bonus feature. Now you have a base score, and your medal score. There is no incentive to rush through missions for a bonus surplus of points.\n\nVisual fidelity is obviously an improvement, and I wonder if this engine will be used for Halo Wars 2. (It looks good enough to work for that game.) And the environments look less samey as they were in SA. Plus, seeing other character do things in the background is a nice little attention to detail to make the battles feel more lively.\n\nOh, and to unlock the final selection of missions, you have to earn gold stars on ALL the missions to unlock the final six. It's abitrary for all the wrong reasons and if you don't know that will extend your gametime.\n\nNeedless to say, I am not a fan of how the final operation is unlocked--but it is simple to get over it without much stress.Save up credits for the score-booster, and you'll have no problem.\n\nInterested? Buy the Bundle\nIf you are interested in these games, I would definitely recommend the bundle whether on a discount or full price. You'll get your money's worth together rather than paying for them individually.\n\nI would definitely say Spartan Assault is the better of the two games because the game plays similar enough to the Halo FPS series while making something new. Spartan Strike suffers from the same problems Halo missions can suffer from; abitrary restraints on the player.\n\nThis problem is fine for a linear FPS with checkpoints, but for a mobile game with short missions, you'll find the abitrary mission objective changes the bane of your time. Not the brevity of the missions nor the simplicity of the genre.","November 29, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Halo is mainly a fps but, now bungie has made Halo Wars which is a strategy, down view halo game. This is basically both combined. It is very fun very little violence, and a classic Halo game that is interesting to experience. I mostly like the fps but, the games campaign style makes the game more fun for the player. Halo Spartan Assualt is an ok game but, if you want to pick between the two I would say that Halo : Spartan Strike is the plus. More abilities, different enemies, drive vehicles, detail cutscenes, and etc. Halo Spartan Assualt is just a normal top down shooter with very little story.\n\nIf you are a a person like me that likes some Single Player games and Halo then i recommend this game. If you want to spend the extra money to play both it's a great deal in my opinion. If you aren't new to the Halo series and have already played the fps types then, you might not like this style. The fact that it isn't the Halo most are used to.

Like most mobile games the content can get a bit repeditive but unlike other mobile titles this gets repeditive before the sequal to the game and occurs between missions.\n\ndue to how the game is set up you get dropped back at the level select screen about the time you start getting into a level. the missions are broken up into objectives and those local objectives are what the larger map is broken down into. I would almost expect that the entier playing area would be combined for PC users so there wouldn't be such a disconnect between areas. the game has an average play time of between 5-15 minuets before you are forcibly dropped to the menu by completing an objective.\n\nsince this is a premium game it at least spares you the deluge of ads between levels so somehow subliminaly inserted into the playing fields. This game leaves a lot open to sequals or DLCs which should be relatively cheap if they are developed, however since this is a mobile game the likely hood of DLCs coming out is low, you would almost certanly get hounded to simply buy the next game instead.","April 20, 2015","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It may be but a meagre slice of the franchise that Microsoft is willing to give to the PC crowd, but even so, Spartan Strike and it's predecessor manage to feel like true Halo games thanks to their enemy, vehicle, and audio designs echoing the main entries in the Halo saga. The level design can at times be uninspired and unmemorable, but the addition of Promethean foes in Spartan Strike helps to mix up the gameplay throughout the fairly short campaign. Either way, it's still a mile better than Halo 4.","February 12","true","9.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

Nice graphics and animations in great scenes and 3D environments with a lot of action makes for a fun game!  The variety of weapons continues from the previous game as does the player's operation of a variety of vehicles in the game.  The missions seemed a little on the shorter side that Spartan Assault, but there is a few more missions in this one.\n\nOn the Good Side: + Great graphics and animations\n+ Great 3D environments in a variety of locations\n+ Good selection of weapons and vehicles\n+ Intro videos for missions (though not always fully animated, but still pretty well done)\n+ Upgrades available by spending "experience" earned on previous missions in case you have difficulty on a later mission.\n\nOn the OK side:~ The female voice of the "guide" for the player while in the game seems more "reading the lines" and a lot less "inspiring"\n\nOn the Down Side:- Required "Gold Star" rating on all missions before the final six missions of Operation E are even available.  It was a good game and a fun game, but not quite "fun enough" to make me want to play the previous missions over again to get the Gold Star.\n\nOverall:  This was a well-done 5.5 hr or so campaign (not even counting the final 6 Operation E missions) that I really enjoyed; just not so much to go back and re-do previous missions to get a better score.  8 out of 10.","February 10","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s a top down shooter with a twin stick control scheme. One stick moves the character while the other aims your weapon. You can shoot enemies, use melee attacks or lob a grenade. Plus  an array of different vehicles and gun turrents. Most of the arsenal and enemies were taken out of previous games, so fans of Halo should feel right at home with Spartan Strike. Although I would have appreciated if the developers had introduced some more stuff.\n\nThe game play is very simple, but gives it that old school arcade charm. In fact dying sends you back to the beginning of the stage. The lack of checkpoints adds a level of intensity and challenge that’s missing from newer games. I really enjoyed the game because it just never seems to slow down. It’s constant "boom" "boom" with enemies coming from every side of the screen with no reloads to stop you from pulling the trigger. Strong pacing is constantly maintained by the game's variety in missions and weapons.\n\nThe campaign is broken into 30 stages with the last 6 being unlocked after achieving a gold medal on every stage. It’s really refreshing to see a game giving incentive for repeat play as oppose to selling off levels as DLC. You also earn money that can be spent on power-ups.

I love all these little details that make it feel like you’re in the middle of a conflict. The orchestral music is top notch and the voice acting is solid. Cut-scenes are brief but look great when you consider the game’s low price point.\n\nIn conclusion Spartan Strike is a fun, no thrills top down shooter that doesn’t bring anything new to the table.

But it made me want more. I felt that need to have the camera a tad bit closer to the player and the need to shoot something instead of slamming things to death. All the sudden, Halo spartan assault and strike come out, and BOOM! Problems solved, and more!\n\nI played spartan assault on the Xbox 360, but it just did'nt feel right, as it was'nt entirely built for such a huge screen. My biggest complaint about spartan assault was that the smooth grey color of palmer's armor blended in with the environment too easily, and I often lost track of where I was on screen. Plus, the weapon and vehicle varyiety was'nt too great. But now in spartan strike on steam, my f.o.v is closer, with a new character in neon orange that is easy to identify, as well as some new & creative introductions to weapons and vehicles.\n\nThe Warthog we all love is back, and even better as you now control the gun from the driver seat, resulting in unique drive-and-shoot action that we've never realy seen before.\n\nThe Kestrel VTOL is FINaLLY back!!1! I know what you're thinking, "what? it's not 'back', this is completely new?" well, little known fact that the Kestrel was a cut vehicle from Halo 2 that originally looked like a pelican with the same propellers that you see in the Kestrel from spartan strike. But this new kestrel is more like a UNSC take on the Ghost. Basically, give Halo 5's gungoose the levetating physics of a Ghost, and there's your Kestrel. This is by far one of my favorite vehicles in all the games. Just imagine how over-powered this 'grenade ghost' would be in one of the main games?\n\nArmor Abilities are still a thing, and dang are they better than ever! A pulse wave that damages enemies in an area around your location, the promethian timey-warpy-teleporty thing, and many more things that would be downright rediculous in Halo 4 or Reach. A new covenant trip-mine that gets up, levitates, and seeks it's target as if a needler shard. Now that just would'nt be fair in multiplayer, now would it? But that's what makes it so great, is that your fighting with all these guns & vehicles, but your armor ability can be life or death.\n\nOur old friends the promethians are back, not too different from how they where in Halo 4. Though that's nothing to complain about, because their weapons and abilities are more powerful and crazy than ever. They offer a decent challenge against you, and the weapns are just too much fun. The surpressor just tears things to peices, the binary rifle packs a punch, pulse grenades actually work, and the teleportation ability makes for a better escape than sprint or a jet pack can ever do.\n\nMy main favorite thing about this, is that if you play this game and imagine it from a first person perspective, the level design and everything else about it feels just like any other Halo game. It honestly is a true Halo game on PC, but it's just viewed at a different angle.\n\nIn conclusion I'd say this is another good game of this epic franchise, but that's not a bad thing. While most view this as a twist on what the game usually is, I'd say it's just as much of a seperate formula as Halo Wars and Halo 5 have been; not an extreme change, but just some good old variety on what we're used to so things don't get stale.

Even better than its predecessor. If you're a Halo fan, you should really get this game.If you believe this game could be potentially worse than its predecessor, Halo: Spartan Assault I'm here to tell it is not, it's even better!\nEven more exciting and challenging missions. Shocking landscapes. Good music, but still nothing too great.\nNew Promethean enemies and equipment.\nMore UNSC equipment, abilities and the Kestrel, the new UNSC vehicle.\nGame time just as extended thanks to mission stars, Assault Ops, achievements, etc.\nI recommend you play this with a controller.It does have a couple of cons, though.\nNo Steam trading cards.\nExtra operation has to be unlocked, unlike in Halo: Spartan Assault.","January 18","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it made me want more. I felt that need to have the camera a tad bit closer to the player and the need to shoot something instead of slamming things to death. All the sudden, Halo spartan assault and strike come out, and BOOM! Problems solved, and more!\n\nI played spartan assault on the Xbox 360, but it just did'nt feel right, as it was'nt entirely built for such a huge screen. My biggest complaint about spartan assault was that the smooth grey color of palmer's armor blended in with the environment too easily, and I often lost track of where I was on screen. Plus, the weapon and vehicle varyiety was'nt too great. But now in spartan strike on steam, my f.o.v is closer, with a new character in neon orange that is easy to identify, as well as some new & creative introductions to weapons and vehicles.\n\nThe Warthog we all love is back, and even better as you now control the gun from the driver seat, resulting in unique drive-and-shoot action that we've never realy seen before.\n\nThe Kestrel VTOL is FINaLLY back!!1! I know what you're thinking, "what? it's not 'back', this is completely new?" well, little known fact that the Kestrel was a cut vehicle from Halo 2 that originally looked like a pelican with the same propellers that you see in the Kestrel from spartan strike. But this new kestrel is more like a UNSC take on the Ghost. Basically, give Halo 5's gungoose the levetating physics of a Ghost, and there's your Kestrel. This is by far one of my favorite vehicles in all the games. Just imagine how over-powered this 'grenade ghost' would be in one of the main games?\n\nArmor Abilities are still a thing, and dang are they better than ever! A pulse wave that damages enemies in an area around your location, the promethian timey-warpy-teleporty thing, and many more things that would be downright rediculous in Halo 4 or Reach. A new covenant trip-mine that gets up, levitates, and seeks it's target as if a needler shard. Now that just would'nt be fair in multiplayer, now would it? But that's what makes it so great, is that your fighting with all these guns & vehicles, but your armor ability can be life or death.\n\nOur old friends the promethians are back, not too different from how they where in Halo 4. Though that's nothing to complain about, because their weapons and abilities are more powerful and crazy than ever. They offer a decent challenge against you, and the weapns are just too much fun.
