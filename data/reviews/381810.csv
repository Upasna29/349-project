This is the most relentless of all the games underneath that paradigm, with pop-ups telling you to JOIN VIP, and strategically placed "BUY ME" buttons that show after LEVEL UP screens. It was when I got to the "FREE VIP" bit where I had enough, and tried to close that window in the game.\n\nIt wouldn't let me close the window until I "joined VIP" for a free measly 6 hours.\nSo I closed the game and never opened it again.\n\nAs for gameplay, it's your standard Plants vs Zombies mentaility, summon tanks and helicopters to fight other tanks and helicopters while clicking on power ups to do a thing, and then be assaulted by a "ALL OF YOUR ENEMY'S UNITS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, CLICK TO WIN" button which makes you win. Rinse, repeat, rinse again, and then repeat until you are fed up with the game.\n\nThe game can be played in single player and multiplayer, but understand that this is fundementally a c l i c k e r game, and a "pay to advance" one at that.\n\nThe only positive in all of this is that you don't need UPlay.

I'd rather call it Freemium.\n5) The amount of crashes and bugs and the loading screen issues needs to be fixed too.\nLastly, If you Devs want "Tom Clancy's Endwar Online" to be a successful game and not gonna end up in the trash can like many other free games or shut it down at some point due to 0 profit and no players you gotta take a SERIOUS look at those points mentioned above.

Everything is similar to Plants vs Zombies, except chat room, game level mechanics like shooting other sides if near range, earning Energy, Ranks for buying commanders, and "Gold". What I say "Gold" is you can earn "Gold" by leveling up, or finishing random task, or buy it for $10.00 for 1000 gold. Is it addicting? Well a bit, just ok. The main problem is not because of the core of the game, it is because 90% of the game is using Cash to play. So its Freemium.\n\nTo add more insult and injury. They offer you "x" item for $99.99, everytime you start the game, it "pops up".\n\nYou know that $99.99 is worth more than playing this game, like The Witcher 3, GTA 5, this game is downright "ANDROID" feel game, its a Phone game, but somehow ported on PC. How this trend keep getting popular and mass produced? How is this game Free 2 Play? Is this the current gaming industry nowdays?

In that aspect,it deserves a thumbs down. It's a good time waster for me,but,there's absolutley no way I could see anyone crazy enough to spend 100$ just for an ingame commander that you're supposedly given for "free".

No just no.\n\nAlso if you do consider playing this game to waste time,you'll be given a 6 hour free vip to help you speed stuff up a bit within that time frame so use it wisely,but I wouldn't recommend spending money in to the game just for a commander n gold for 100$.","January 25","false","8.0"," 70 of 108 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","70","108","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/holiCmore/recommended/381810/","holiCmore","holiCmore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/holiCmore/","5 products in account","Hello everyone,\n\nI have been playing this game for around 1,5 months (on uplay server, no real money investment) and believe to understand it well enough to write a review.\n\nFirst of all i do not understand this much hate towards this game. I will be honest, i haven't played the "original" endwar and therefor i can not compare the games. Many of you write about how much the games differ and i believe you. I think Ubisoft tried to use the hypewave of the endwar name and now it backfires. But really guys, try to see it as a different game, just with fimiliar name ;)\n\nSecondly, i would like to speak about tutorial aspect, which many of you have mentioned. I agree it overcontrols you there and shoud be reduced. Just be patient here please, it will stop after 20 minutes and from then on you will be free to do what ever you want to do.\n\nThird topic will be the pay to win mechanics, which are without a doubt a very important question in nowadays games.\n\nIs this game pay to win? I would tell you "a little bit"\nLet me explain you exactly what i mean by this and then you can decide on your own if this game is a pay to win. There are three currencies in the game: energy, fame, gold. Gold is the currency, which can be bought for real money. Can gold be obtained by playing? Yes, it can. Here are my numbers for a  good, well developed player: For 100 bucks you can purcase 10 000 gold, i (top10 of the server) can do around 300 gold daily. Are those 10 000 gold game breaking? No, not really, in the end we all will run level 60 rank 5 commanders with orange equipment (it takes 3-4 months). Money payer will probably have a bit higher upgraded equipment, but trust me, this isn't deciding in pvp. Right timing, good positioning and a strategy behind your commanders deck will allow you to still win the match.\nIs everything in the game obtainable just by playing? Sadly, no. I really hope the developers will change their mind on this, because this sucks. Right now there are three commanders, which you will be awarded by recharging gold only (around 100 bucks and more). Good thing guys, those commanders aren't that overpowered, imo i still can biuld better decks with usual commanders. I am afraid right now though that in future they might release even more OP commanders, which can't be obtained just by playing and i will have to give up on the game.\n\nFourthly, i would like to mention, why i do like this game and would recommend to play it. I got to know this game, when i watched mmohuts video on youtube and was amazed by graphics for a browser game and gave it a try. Normal missions made a lot of fun in the beginning and i nerded the game hardly, can't explain it very well, but it felt like lelouche vs britannia, especially in higher levels, when you dont have such good level and equipment and AI is way stronger. After a while normal missions became just a daily routine, it is a place for me where i farm some veteran equipment from time to time and levelup commanders. Not much of fun anymore, if i am honest. I hope devs will make chapter 10 missions a lot more challenging with a strategy. I understand too that this isnt an easy thing to do, no matter what, in the end you fight an AI and since you are a human, you still can find ways to abuse it's weaknesses. Devs just can't code every single behaviour pattern.\nBut exactly at the same time you open new cool aspects of game,  those are the reasons why i still play it. It is the PvP. Skirmish, wargame and fortress are pretty cool game modes.\nFortress is about right timing. When to start a fight and steal the position of a stronger opponent in ranking to take his rewards.\nWargame mode is the best place to test your strategies. You can biuld up you dream commanders decks, those are lvl 60 with maxed abilities and i believe with maxed equipment too (not sure). This is where i found out which strategy would like to play in lategame with my own commanders.\nSkirmish is the pvp mode, where you use your own commanders. On the one hand this mode is awesome, you can earn here gold and energy and really a lot of it. On the other hand, the strongest gets stronger, loser stays with nothing. This mode MUST be reworked and improved as soon as possible.\nProblem is also that devs dont fight the multiaccounting and this mode is hardly abused by such players.\n\nMy last point will be about the game developing. I have to admit that i am not satisfied with it. I have made a lot of suggestions in the forum during this 1.5 months. Moderators said that all of them were forwarded, but i havent seen any single change of what i or any other player have suggested. I am not sure our ideas reach the developers, or maybe even if, do they give a ♥♥♥♥?\n\nAll in all,  try this game out. It is worth a try. I would be happier to see you on Uplay europe delta server though, this is where i play. I am not sure i will be able to play vs you otherwise.","January 26","true","0.2"," 31 of 58 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","31","58","2","1"

What game play comes down to is sending waves of units down different lanes towards an enemy base, the units have abilities they can use so you have to match up the different units and send them in an order that they will make the most progress against an enemy's wave. While the objective may sometimes vary, the most common way to win, in my experience has been to destroy the enemy's base or have them use up all there units.\n\nGameplay in end war online is broken into a singleplayer campaign and multiplayer, so its a clicker game you can play with friends. I feel that you may need to use more strategy than most games in the clicker genre, so thats a plus in my book.\n\n\nThere are however a few negatives I should put out there. The biggest being so is this is obviously a huge disappointment to most EndWar fans, being so different than the original EndWar game.  Another thing, that does not bother me so much as it does lots of other people is there is indeed a cash shop, thought it has not had any significant negative effect on my gameplay so far.\n\nOverall I would recommend fans of clicker or mobile games try this, contrary to the title I do not think there is much here for the Tom Clancy fan.","January 26","true","2.6"," 28 of 55 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","28","55","4","2"

Highly Addictive! A Must Play! Genre Changing!\n\nThis game is by far the most non pay to play game out there. Yes, it has the option to buy a ton of different packs, and boosts, etc., however, you get all of that free just for playing. I have never played a game, especially one that is desgined like the most high end "browser" type game, (since its an actual game, versus a browser game. It feels as solid as a real game, and not pathetic like browser games are in that sense.) that awarded the players with so much free items. For example, gold is considered a premium currency, which players are awarded gold that seems to be awarded with nearly every move. Also, the daily bonuses are extensive, with 30 day bonus streaks, and rapid increase in bonuses with each passing consecutive play.\n\nAnother thing I would like to mention is about the micro management that must be done in this game. Yes, it would seem like there are a lot of things to constantly upgrade. With every unit having several different screens to manage upgrading. In the beggining it seems like that is true, however, about level 13 (a couple of hours playing) it doesn't anymore, because it is based on the players level. The best part that the game has is the nicely way it notifies you that you can do anything. Everytime you can upgrade, boost, level up, etc., it gives you a very contrasted marker on each of them to let you know. I belive it is the better of any game I have played. It takes all the thinking out of everything, exactly what a FTP game should be. I know that my units need to always be leveld up, and any equipment I have I need to have the best equiped to my units at-all-times. So why do other games make the players constantly chack to make sure it is? Shouldn't the game be capable of doing it all by itself? It is, by the way, 2016; we should not have to waste hours on this.\n\nThese are only a few examples of how I think Endwar has brought this type of game to a whole new, and better, level of gaming. All other companies are going to have to step up their game to compete, now that this is out.\n\nThank you for your time,\n"Princess Sascha"","January 26","true","24.8"," 23 of 46 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","23","46","4","2"

Airstrikes remove pesky clusters of units.\n\nThere may - or may not - be some of the better gameplay in the genre in there, but I haven't gotten to it yet.

Check this out!\n\nFirst of all it is NOT pay to win. You can buy gold but you can just as easily build your army by, PLAYING the game. What a novel idea! The most determining factor in winning in EWO? Your BRAIN!\n\nThis is a great game! It has 5 different game modes. Campaign, Skirmish, Fortress, Wargames and Friendly match. These modes unlock as you play the game. If you are looking for instant gratification or are impatient this isn't for you. EWO is a game for a more mature audience who enjoys building an army according to thier strategy of warfare. This is not the basic rock, paper and scissors. The game has a deep level of unit progression with many different units to recruit. You have to learn the different abilities of these Commanders and how they compliment each other to form an army. The game eases you into the warfare. I have seen many players rush through the Campaign mode only to get their butt kicked in skirmish because they didn't take time to recruit and train their Commanders. The game has a HQ area that has to leveled up. Weapons, armor, offensive and defensive systems all must be attained and ranked up.\n\nI'm not talking about earning a new skin that changes your camo like in COD. Everything and I mean everything in this game is inter-twined into the effectivness of your army. You need to play not just Campaign but also Fortress, Wargames and Skirmish as they all play an important role in the total game. Map strategy is NOT basic. The best of this game will lose. That is because there is a counter for every strategy on every map.\n\nIn my honest opinion you cannot judge this game fairly until you have reached level #25. At that point you can play every mode. Reaching #1, on Platinum level #1 of Fortress is very hard. Playing Skirmish you will soon learn where your weakness's are and what you need to do to be competitive. If you take this game with a grain of salt, you will get eaten up and spit out. I challenge anyone to beat me! A few have and we respect each other. You may steam roll a few players spamming units at low levels. When you finally get to play with the "Big Boys" you will get a spanking. So take this as fair warning! If you under estimate the game then you will most certainly under estimate your opponent.\n\nLast, EWO has a great community! You can easily find players willing to help you with the more advanced strategies and questions. I'm always available and willing to help anyone improve their game!\n\nMARSFLYBOY","January 25","true","15.9"," 32 of 73 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","32","73","2","4"

Don't support developers that are too lazy to make actual games, who cannibalize and monopolize their franchises with this microtransaction cancer.

This is mobile gaming cancer that needs to be eradicated via starvation.\n\nSend Ubisoft and other gaming companies a clear message: we will not stand for this garbage.

But while i was playing i see the truth - just a anther mobile game with is playable only if you have no job and are available 24/7. or if your are willing to pay for some advantage. It would be better placed in some mobile store but due to it is "free to play" it is ok for a casual approach - but do not expect to win much of the matches. SP seems to be balanced  - MP is feeling like P2W without that play to lose. Maybe some future updates will balance this but i would not expect at the moment.","January 25","false","0.9"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"
