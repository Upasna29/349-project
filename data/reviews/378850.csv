While I usually avoid early access games, this one has broken that chain, as the updates that evolve it have consistently made it better and better. It is visually appealing, putting both retro and modern visual elements onto the same screen, with a color pallet that contrasts extremely well. The controls are simple to learn, and when combined with the fresh yet classic feel of the gameplay mechanics, allow for an experience that appeals to both a seasoned veteran and a beginning gamer. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, with a track list that features constantly changing genres while maintaining a hint of retro throughout. Support for the game is excellent, and the developers are highly involved in the gaming community. In short, on my usual 5-point scale of rating games based on Concept, Appearance, Controls, Mechanics, and Sound I would have to give Galagan’s Island: Reprymian Rising a 5/5. This is an overall excellent game; it is well-constructed, appealing, and entertaining.","August 10, 2015","true","5.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You die, you go back to the beginning.\n\nGameplay: 25 Levels of chaotic shooting and trying not to die. And it's fun!\nYou have powerups like shield and triple fire that make it easier to blast aliens.\nEverything is very fluid and well-optimised which makes the game very enjoyable.\nGame features a local co-op so you can play with a friend, or a cat, or you can be two players at once if you don't have any friends (don't worry, I will always be your friend)\n\nGraphics: Cool retro style with modern effects. Lots of explosions and other similiar effects commonly seen in today's games. Enemies are pretty generic for a bullet-hell game, various blobs and space octopuses, but that's okay.\n\nSound: Most sound effects don't stand out that much so there's not much to say about them. But the music is awesome! An interesting blend of many genres like electronica, jazz and even hip-hop. If you're planning on buying the game,I encourage you to also buy a soundtrack, If you enjoy at least 2 of these genres.\n\nControls:  Kinda weird. You must hold hover if you don't want to be at the very bottom of the screen.\nWhen you hold hover your ship also steers slower, so it's really hard to dodge a barrage of projectiles when you're in the middle of the screen. The flip ship works only when you have the double ship powerup. If you don't have it on levels when enemies spawn behind your back, then you must wait till they break the formation and follow you, which can take a while.\n\nOverall, nothing ground-breaking, but simply an enjoyable indie game that features an awesome soundtrack and doesn't cost a fortune. Give it a try, it can surprise you.","November 22, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","6","9","3","4"

The game will be on sell until Dec. 1, 2015 for $1.99.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Your typical schmup with gameplay that is already tight. You can play as a Single Player or Co-Op. While optimised for a control pad (I'm using my Logitech Xbox 360 controller in X Mode) it also works with a keyboard. There are power-ups, and you can link two ships, but you only get one life. You die. You dead. Each enemy target is worth 1 point, but enemy hits to your ship will deduct 10 points from your score. So shoot well. Dodge well. Live long (and prosper).\n\nGRAPHICS: They are quite stunning, with several settings and resolutions to choose from. After I took several screenshots the developer contacted me to try a different setting and resolution. I have captured several screens at various settings and resolutions.\n\nSOUND: Not as stunning as the graphics, but acceptable. As for the songs they are a matter of personal taste.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS & TRADING CARDS: 34 Achievements just went live, of which I have earned 2*. I only downloaded this game today so give me a break that I haven't earned more. The developer told me that more Achievements and some Trading Cards will be added as more levels and bosses are added. But so far I've only heard of 1 person beating the 25 levels and 5 bosses (one boss after each group of 5 levels) in 'Galagan's Island: Reprymian Rising' as it stands.\n\nEXTRAS:  There is a DLC game called 'Galagan's Island: Metagalactic Monstrosities' which requires the first game to be purchased and installed. In this DLC game you play as the 5 bosses. This DLC is FREE with the purchase of 'Galagan's Island: Reprymian Rising OST,' which replaced some of the song tracks of the original version. However the songs swapped out are included as bonus tracks. Currently you must own the original version to buy this version. The OST version is currently on sell for $1.49 until Dec. 1. 2015. So that's two versions of the same game, plus the bonus game 'Galagan's Island: Metagalactic Monstrosities' for a total of less than $3.50. A bargin.\n\nRECENT UPDATES INCLUDE (Developer):\n\n*In response to player feedback, we've turned down the "floatiness" of the player ship movement to tighten up the player's controls and emphasize the bullet-dodging slow motion mechanics of the game.\n\n*Updated controls screen to reflect the hold-to-fire change and added a message to the screen that the game was designed with gamepad in mind and that it is recommended input method.\n\n*Adjusted UI responsiveness.\n\n*Adjusted position of the "Back" option on the Volume Control Slider.\n\n*Added solid black backgrounds behind the Pause and Options UI menus.\n\n*New soundtrack. The songs switched out will stay on the OST as Bonus Tracks.\n\nI bought everything. So $3.50 for two great games and two music options.\n\nOverall I would rate this Early Access version 5.0 out of 5.0. Or, put another way, 10 out of 10. As a member of highscore.com I have requested that this game be added there. I currently have approx. 2,072 High Score Trophies and one Patch. Writing this review you'd be surprised (or not) at how many times I typed 'Giligan's Island' or 'Gilligan's Island.' Ok, I'm a baby boomer in love with Dawn Wells (Mary Ann Sommers), so cut me some slack. :)\n\n* I have now earned 6 achievements and beat the first boss. :)","November 26, 2015","true","2.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","7","11","3","0"

Glad they added in a co-op mode as well cause it would be great to have another person to play with.  I can't wait to see what else comes to this game.  There is supposedly a whole lot more coming so I guess we'll wait to see what else this game brings.

There are upgrades, nice bosses, enemies and some twists. I can strongly recommend this game to every fan of Shoot'em up and to every fan of the old Galaga game.\n\n+ Pixelated graphics are totally amazing, they are really beautiful and somehow different than anything else.\n+ Soundtrack is a masterpiece - I could listen to it for hours, it brings nostalgic feeling.\n+ Upgrades are very nice and various, weapons and shooting well done.\n+ Ship statistics: health, shield, heating etc. I really love such things and it brings a lot of possibilities to come.\n+ Enemies are various and their look is awesome.\n+ Many bosses and mini bosses.\n+ Few twists like a way to shoot or fly your ship (check it yourself!).\n+ It is still an early access game which has enourmous potential!\n\n- No tutorial; I know some games do not require it but I think there is something missing... I wish there was some prologue, some little story which could explain what we are doing, who we are etc. and some little guide how to play or what to do.\n- Both left and right panels are way too big - I really wish I could have bigger gameplay screen and see more.\n- I have played this game just for a couple of minutes but it has already crashed once for me - it was when the first big boss destroyed my ship - I had to forcequit the game.\n\nSumming up, Galagan's Island is an amazing game which I can recommend to anyone for short and some longer playthroughs. It has amazing features and there are more to come. If that is not enough then think about it being still in early access. Comparing to other early access games, this one is very-well polished, stable and entertaining.

Though it may not strictly adhere to pixel art (at least, outside of the sprites), the influence of old arcade shooters like Galaga is evident in both its gameplay and its art style. It brings to the table its own unique blend of art & music, and deviates slightly from the typical elements that you see in many SHMUPs.\n\nGameplayWhether or not it plays as well the old classics is not the question here. Though it is as SHMUP as it can get, instant death is not a thing here, though the raining bullets is usually more than enough to cover for it. The controls are simple and quick to learn, and though the movement speed might not be as rapid as I'd like, I feel that it helps compliment the lack of one-shot kills (a.k.a the use of a health system) for you. There are also a few additional elements, such as your ship gravitating towards the bottom, an overheat system for your weapon and so on. If you want a hellish or traditional SHMUP/bullet hell, I'd advise going back to Galaga, Raiden or even Touhou. However, I advise giving this a chance, rather than judge before you've tried it out (and it's $4.99 USD, which is close to the price of takeaway).\n\nArtworkThe art direction in this is interesting. Personally, I feel that the overall quality could do with some more work, especially with the GUI. I also feel that there are some stylistic inconsistencies with the sprites, background and effects, without bringing the UI into it. HOWEVER, I am willing to forgive much (at least everything except the UI, that needs more work guys) for the psychedelic experience that's brought out from the art. From the particles to the sprites and down to the enemy patterns, it's best described as "one helluva acid trip" and something I recommend more than taking LSD (additionally because it's probably cheaper to be hooked on this than on LSD). The theme that's brought out is certainly unique, and an experience that's also bolstered by...\n\nMusicI highly praise the music in this game in particular. Though it varies quite a bit (from a chiptune menu theme to a funky, funky tune), it brings out life to the gameplay, to say the least. This, along with the artwork, pushes the experience that the designer of the game wants to bring out (which is to give you the joy of smoking pot without having to find a dealer, it seems). The OST is wonderfully composed (at least, imo), and would be nice to be released as a pack on its own as well.\n\nRatingI don't like giving a rating system (since my track record indicates I rarely give below 7/10 anyways), so I'll just say this: Buy this game, and try it out. It's an experience worth having (and you have steam refund if you think I'm a dirty liar, so just buy it already).","September 14, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I will be going back to it later.. but had to stop as my hand is numb.. Pleasantly numb.  I had forgotten just how taxing an old school "Shump" can  be.\n\nI love the game.  The graphics are rich and colorful.. and the music <different for each level> is quite awesome.  I had it blaring out of a mediocre sound system with a sub and it put it to work.  Loved it.  My 5 year old son watched me play and kept saying stuff like "The rainbow bullets are soooo cool daddy!  Get the boss!!"  He really got a kick out of it.. he's gonna try it later.\n\nMy only real "complaint" is that there seems to <me> be way too much in the way of alien fire floating around the screen.  It's impossible to avoid and a little frustrating.. However, your ship takes a great deal of damage and can handle it.  Some of it can also be shot down as well.\n\nIf you enjoy old school type shoot em ups, and blasts from the past, you can't go wrong with this game.  It's fun and would be great to chill and relax for a few levels to let some nasty stress go..\n\nHighly reccomended.\n\nScott Hollander","August 8, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Ever wish they'd develop a little, creativity, in their swarming? Looked at what Google "dreams" about when we're not looking? Considered mixing the two?\n\nThat's what you get here. Your space-blasting action, mixing bright colors and some reverb-inducing slo-mo, joins with some more creative (and enjoyable callback) designs many of us already know and enjoy.\n\nControls are decent, with Xbox 360 controller support right off the bat, and a variety of screen sizes to choose from.

I speak for my experience. This is great game where you're in mood to play shmup game (Shoot 'em up)  but if you're not in mood to tap rapid the buttons to shoot? How about not holding the button to rapid the fire? This is for you and all you have to do is press the fire button to active automatic shooting. Make sure you keep your eyes on overheat meter bar while shooting. So, don't forget to deactive the fire button before it get overheat.  The other button is where you can speed up the ship. Once you get hit from bad guys, you do not die, You have health meter bar!\n\nThis shmup game is very different from every other shmup games.

The enemy fire is VERY tough to dodge and that definately adds to the difficulty. Don't expect the first levels to be a push over.

It's a more modern take on Galaga and other arcade space shooters of the 70s and 80s.\n\nAnd it's the most fun shoot 'em up of its kind, and a must-buy on Steam! Why?\n\n1. Visuals\nThe game's graphics are pretty awesome. The backgrounds are well-done and look quite realistic for the game's theme. It also scrolls as you move across the screen, which is a nice touch. The player and enemy graphics are represented by pixel art, which makes them easy to recognize from the background. Visual effects, such as the shield the player can acquire and the destructive bomb attack are great to look at. Each enemy also has a unique explosion(s) when destroyed, most of which are eye-catching and colorful displays of enemy destruction. The game manages to make destroying enemies visually satisfying.\n\n2. Gameplay\nWhat's a game without gameplay? Galagan's Island: Reprymian Rising also has great gameplay that's very easy to pick up, but certainly difficult to master. You can move left or right, toggle auto-fire and fly vertically into the air. You have a couple powerups to help you destroy those pesky aliens like the shield, triple shot, super beam and the destructive bomb.\n\nThere are many other things about the game you have to learn, like the HUD. The red meter on the right of the screen is your overheat meter. The overheat meter fills up the more you fire, and if you fill it up all the way you'll be unable to shoot until it's depleted back to 0. Luckily the game will make a sound when you approach the danger zone, so it's not too difficult to keep from overheating.\n\nThe meter on the left side of the screen is your triple shot meter. Once you get the triple shot powerup this meter will be full and as you fire it'll deplete. Pretty self-explanatory. There's one more behind the score display, which I believe is the powerup meter. It fills up as you destroy enemies, and portions of it are consumed when powerups appear from destroyed asteroids.\n\nAnd then there's the enemies themselves! Every level has their own unique enemy formations. Namco's Galaga series can't even hold a candle to this game's enemy formations, as you have enemies forming different shapes like roses, fish, butterflies and treasure chests;they even make synchronized movements! The game has enemies and bullets coming from nearly every corner of the screen, forcing you to use the flying ability to avoid them or lose lives. And even though you have tons of them, every extra life is precious in this game as you won't get any more.\n\nAt first I hit the game over screen on level 10. With a little more practice I managed to get further. In order to survive in Galagan's Island: Reprymian Rising, you have to pay attention and stay focused as there's many hints each level gives you to beat it without much taking too much damage. In this game, you'll be doing as much dodging and observing as you'll be shooting.\n\n3. Music\nI love the game's music. Every screen in the game has a unique music track. The type of music used within is unique to indie games, as I don't hear too many jazz tracks in other games. This game manages to be an aural experience on its own. While most triple A games have memorable soundtracks, few indie games have unforgettable music in them. The soundtrack to Galagan's Island: Reprymian Rising joins the ranks of those that stay in your mind long after the game is over. The sounds of old video games, combined with jazzy harmonies and sophisticated urban grooves make each track oddly catchy and infectious.\n\n4. Final Remarks\nWith 25 levels of hand-crafted and challenging gameplay, great music and visuals that are easy on the eyes, Galagan's Island: Reprymian Rising is well worth the purchase price even in Early Access. One should try the free demo, then buy this game immediately\n\n\n","July 6, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"
