It looks really dodgy and it is on many occasions. If you can make your way past the first 20 minutes, it really picks up with a menagerie of bizarrely textured guns and a colourful cast of monsters. Monsters such as Imps, Ogres, Midget Lizard Men, charred gas mask clad soldiers that dance when you kill them, and even skeletons that throw...."rocks".\n\nFINAL OPINION: Not quite worth $9.99, but it's fun to play overall.\n\nEDIT: The latest patch has broken the game. I can no longer recommend it until the problem is solved.\n\nEDIT EDIT: It's been rolled back to a stable version. So it works again.\n\nEDIT x3: However, no work seems to be being done to improve the game anymore. Also, some DLC has been released when the base game is rubbish with no signs of being fixed. I had high hopes for this game reaching it's $9.99 value, but it seems that's never going to happen. You have disappointed me, Dakker. Your small scale example of the AAA gaming industry disappoints me.","April 28, 2015","false","1.8"," 104 of 115 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","104","115","10","0"
