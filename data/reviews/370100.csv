Honestly, we have no interest in bashing other "developers" but here we made an exception.\nThe level of laziness, exploitation, and overall dishonesty associated with this "game" is insulting. It is because of games like this that players trust developers less and less and Greenlight is slowly becoming a corrosive garbage dump of incomplete, poorly designed, and in general crummy games.\n\nA couple of months back we had posted a game of ours on Greenlight and it took roughly 6 months for it to get Greenlit. We're not boasting about our game being the best thing since sliced bread, but we sure as hell have been sweating our lower regions to make it. Also, we still have not released in any form. Not Alpha, not Beta, not "Early Access". You know why we haven't released it? Because it's not finished... Then by comparison we have people like this who go and download an asset, pop Unity up, make a build, get Greenlit and immediately try and squeeze a buck out of those who are ignorant to what went down.\n\nA little bit more... at first we weren't even that upset... it was like okay... maybe they tweaked a few things here or there... but no. This "developer" is so lazy, and would even go so far as to say arrogant, that they couldn't even come up with an original description for their "game".\n\n"Sandbox, multiplayer, open world game in a few steps. The game also with several different gameplay modes such as Death Match, Survival Horror, and Zombie Swarm. You can create your world, customize your rules, and enjoy the games with your friends."\n\nThis is the exact paragraph (right down to capitalization and grammatic structure) that is used to market this asset on the Unity Asset Store. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26912.

Put in about......oh.. about 15 mins worth of work? And shovel it onto Steam.\n\nNow, as they have done, please make sure you attach Steam Trading Cards to it. That way, people will still buy it for the cards. Classic.\n\nNow, you can take some notes from these developers. They release "updates" every 2 to 3 months. Why is this important? Well, duh, because now it looks like you are actually committed to change and improving your stolen work. Make sure you attach some cool version numbers like 1.2, or 1.5. Extra points if you drag it out to 3 numbers like they have done. Dont worry if the few people who actually play your game complain that your updates did absolutely nothing, and call you a scammer. No one will read them or care. Trust me, its Steam!\n\nNow once this is complete, make sure you buy some new Unity Asset packs. One per game please. Make sure you change the name of your Dev and Publisher so you can avoid any unsightly trash talk until your game has sold enough for you to make some profit.\n\nCongrats! You are now a Steam developer. How does it feel? Dont worry about that layer of filth and dirt all over you. Its natural!\n\nNext time, we will cover advanced tactics, such as pirating the Unity assets for more phat lewts, microtransactions, and of course, getting into fights with popular YouTube personalities!

The loss in time isn't worth the profit you get from the cards. (Please proceed to the summary.)\n\n\nGameplayYou can select from 5 different blocky characters which start with different items (following typos are ingame):\nPoliceman: Spawn with gun and ammunitions\nFarmer: Have an awesom and piece of woods\nSalaryman: Spawn with food and several items\nNoo New: She have everything necessary\nDoctor: Have a medicines and survival kit\nThe game offers 3 different maps (typos in the titles are ingame):\nZombie Land - open world survivor\n- You are set in an open but limited world, can retrieve items and you have to kill zombies.\nSandbox - just for test\n- Here you can try out the game, guns and what not. Unluckily you can't test the crafting system as there are no ressources to find.\nDeath Match - plyers vs players\n- Obviously a map for pvp action.\nYou will have a health, hunger and thirst bar.\nHealth drops on damage.\nHunger decreases over time.\nThirst decreases over time too but quicker.\nIn general you have to live from pickups.\n\nYou run around, find pickups and kill blocky zombies. There are only 2 types of them: Normal ones and (let's call them) raging ones. Latter run faster.\nIf you die you lose everything you collected and respawn. You aren't able to pick up items where you died.\n\nAt the start you may have a gun with limited ammo. You need to find new guns and bullets from pickups.\n\nYou can find wood and metal plates to craft different things, also found as pickups. You can craft rudimentary building parts too. With rudimentary I mean about 5 different parts. Foundation, wall, roof, door, window if I remember correctly.\n\nI'm sorry but I have nothing positive to say about this game.\n\nIssues that really need to be fixed:Most guns shoot multiple or all bullets at once without inflicting any damage or damage equal to one bullet. (The update stating "Fixed shooting" is false!)\nRemapping key bindings is missing, the pop-up menu before starting the game doesn't work either and is missing options like reload or sprint.\nThere is no way to set mouse sensitivity ingame. I could change my mouses' dpi but then it would take ages to drag the cursor in the menues.\nScrolling takes ages, it would be better if one step on the scroll wheel would be equal to one row in the menu. At current state you have to do multiple laps with your mouse wheel per row. The wheel is more convenient than dragging the scroll bar in the heat of the battle.\nTalking about battle: There needs to be a quicker way to swap weapons, for example switching guns by directly using the mouse wheel. At the moment you need to open the item list by pressing [E], (maybe you even need to click & drag the scroll bar), select a weapon by clicking on it, click on "Use", click [E] again to close the menu. Congratulations, you are dead.\nMany other flaws, (this list isn't complete):Broken English.\nThe game doesn't tell you all the controls. For example sprint [SHIFT], reload [R], items menu [E]. These 3 you have to figure out yourself.\nZombies pop up randomly in your proximity, sometimes even a few steps in front of you. Yes, you occasionally watch them spawn and drop on the floor and then running at you.\nZombies that are stuck in the floor. You can only see their heads sticking out of the soil. They run at you but can't damage you. You can't damage them either.\nItems spawning in front of your nose.\nFloating props, items and buildings. (The update stating "Houses do not float in the air" is false!)\nGlitches and inconsistencies in graphics. Sometimes you can see cracks in the floor. Your gun has a shadow but your character model hasn't any.\nThis game has no music at all and you can't change the sound volume.\nThe pause menu (called "Main Menu") only has the options "Resume" and "Disconnect". (Yes, even in single player mode it is called "Disconnect".)\nMultiplayer spawn camping is easier than in any other game I played. No secured area to spawn, no spawn invincibility, spawn points basically next to each other. Position yourself at the side of the spawn points, just wait for spawning enemies and shoot.\nIn multiplayer everyone can join the same team, there is no automated or manual way to balance teams. In addition every time you die you can swap teams.\nMost multiplayer games are not reachable. The seventh game I tried to join finally worked. After I looked for another one I had to check even more games.\nIf you open the chat prompt you can't close it other than writing a message. So if you hit [ENTER] by accident you have to send something.\nLast but not least this game impersonates dishonesty!This game is simply a 1:1 ripoff of this asset package called UnitZ[assetstore.unity3d.com].\nIf you look close enough even the description is a partial copy.\nOriginally posted by Steam store description:Sandbox, multiplayer, open world game in a few steps. The game also with several different gameplay modes such as Death Match, Survival Horror, and Zombie Swarm. You can create your world, customize your rules, and enjoy the games with your friends.Originally posted by Asset store description:This kit can help you to create a sandbox, multiplayer, open world game in a few steps. The pack also comes with several different gameplay modes such as Death Match, Survival Horror, and Zombie Swarm. You can create your world, customize your rules, and enjoy the games with your friends.Sidenote: The game "developer" even forgot to delete "in a few steps" in his stolen description.\n\nAlso take a look at the videos and screenshots on both places. You will see that everything is the same except the name.\n\nAssets from the assetstore are mostly meant to be a base or a nice addition to your own game. In this case UnitZ is meant as foundation and you build your game around it and fix possible issues.\n\nI don't know if the added halloween props are copied/stolen too. It looks like they aren't part of the UnitZ assets. (But maybe from another one).\n\n\nSummaryHere we have an unplayble game as it is broken to a point that you simply won't be able to play it properly. On top of that Uncrowded is a fraud because it is a blatant one-to-one copy in almost every single bit.\nShame on the developer Kotach.\n\nCatastrophic game\nDon't buy and support this game by any means. (Except you are greedy and want to make profit from cards if it is on a 2 cents discount again.)\n\nI never thought I would ever need to give this rating to any game:\n0/10","November 5, 2015","false","1.3"," 183 of 188 people (97%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","97","183","188","38","4"

There's also one that still floats majestically above the map, I can't say where the house is because you're given no ideas for direction in the form of a map or even a compass.\n\nWe made a video on Uncrowded recently which showcases all these problems if you'd like to see them without paying the £1.59 to buy the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSDwyHi3_n4","June 1, 2015","false","1.3"," 193 of 202 people (96%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","96","193","202","66","6"

I only gave it a thumbs down because I'm trying to be innovative, like the developer.\nYou see, Uncrowded isn't just a game. It's a way of life. For instance, the guns in this game don't do any damage, unless your gun is literally inside the zombie's face. The dev himself is an absolute genius for doing this, and only the most cultured individuals would understand.\nMahatma Gandhi himself would have advocated for this. It's a testament to how we shouldn't solve our problems with guns, and how we need to find other ways of solving problems.\nDo you know any other game that has CTRL hotkeyed to shoot? Do you know any other game that lets you punch zombies through walls? Any other game where your fists are more effective than a shotgun?\nOf course you don't, because those games aren't Uncrowded. Some crappier games have attempted to copy the splendor of Uncrowded, but all have failed. I'm looking at you, Unturned. Sure Unturned has cars. but Uncrowded has something else. It has soul, dedication... HEART. Unturned doesn't charge you to play, and is a "f2p" game, but Uncrowded does. This is because the dev himself knew that microtransactions aren't a good business model. Just look at Payday2.\nNot to mention, the game is currently having a Halloween update, even though it's November as of this review. If you didn't experience Halloween in real life, now is your chance.\n...Because, Uncrowded IS real life. When you see those lush landscapes, sprawling pixelated hills, and bold physics, you won't look anywhere else. When the gas station plays motor sounds so loud you feel like your ears will bleed, you know it's real. Because cars are loud in real life.\nThis isn't a game, but if it was, I'd have to applaud the direction it chose. The plot may appear to be paper-thin, but it's not. It really isn't. It just doesnt want to distract you from the captivating gameplay and struggle of the main character.\nSo overall, the campaign is better than Halo Reach. Stop wasting your time with other games and play this, a real man's struggle.\nThanks for reading this review, and hopefully you can understand the motivation of the developer. Not to create a shameless cash grab, but to inspire new and refreshing take on our everyday endeavours in an industralized and modern society.\n\nEDIT: I just discovered that there is indeed a car in the game, even though it's worse than walking and can't reverse. Proof that the developer is trying to discourage the use of fossil fuels and wants to help the environment.","November 20, 2015","false","4.4"," 60 of 62 people (97%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","97","60","62","88","4"

The cards that drop can be sold on the market and you'll get all your money back (actually you'll come out making a profit)\nedit* now that the game's been discounted for a while, the cards are more common and you won't get as big of a return as the first week.\nIf you missed the sale, wait until it is on sale again. This is the only reason to get the game, by the way.\n\nAs you'll read in many other reviews, this is just a Unity asset pack that anyone can buy and build upon to create their own game. What the so called "developer" has done, is taken that asset pack and somehow made it buggier and worse than the original copy they purchased the license to use. That is, if they actually paid for it. Most Unity asset packs, including this one (which, by the way is called Unit Z by the original creator) apparently is very easy to torrent/pirate so who knows. Since they haven't added any of their own content as the asset pack intended, none of this is actually the work of the "developer" outside of some code they have changed.  They manipulated the shortcomings and exploits of greenlight to get this greenlit despite it being nothing more than this. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26912\n\nTheir other game "The District" is the exact same scenario.\n\nBy the way, you might notice at the beginning of the trailer on the store page, it says "Field Z" instead of "Uncrowded"  Why?

It was worth every penny of the $0.19 that I gave up to play this. So here's a rundown of all the features that make this game a canidate for Game of the year 2015.\n\n1. Combat: Never before have I ever played a game with a combat mechanic as unique as this. Whenever you click to fire a gun, you expect it to fire one bullet, but not in Uncrowded. Nope, Uncrowded has gone the extra mile by making it so whenever you fire a gun, it unloads the entire ammo clip in one earsplitting volley (Note: firing seven bullets at once does not deal the damage of 7 bullets, in fact, 9/11 times all the bullets will miss). Also, never before in any game has a more shoddy Melee mechanic been developed. The range for all weapons is concistent, meaning that, whether you're armed with a flashlight or a fireaxe, you're going to run up to a zombie and take 10 damage if you want to kill the zombie. Also, the damage recieved by player characters and npcs from melee weapons is not consistent, i.e. you're able to one hit a player with a flashlight, but with a fireaxe, it takes 2 -3 hits to kill a player. Meanwhile zombies will take 2 - 3 hits with a flashlight and only 1 with the fireaxe (Update: June 29th 8:43 p.m. After more experiments, the flashlight is offically the most op weapon. It can down ANYTHING in 1 hit at a cost of 10 -20 damage). Turely a combat mechanic as amazing and aweinspiring as this has never been seen before.\n\n2. Game sounds: Most people would consider it a bug when the sound of another person (in multiplayer) picking up items is broadcast to everyone on the server no matter where they are, but it's just another one of those charming features that makes Uncrowded so irrisitable. There is literally no doplar effect in the game, meaning that zombies will make the same amount of noise whether they are 40 yards away from you, or right behind you. This often leads to countless ♥♥♥ rapings since you never know whether or not a zombie is behind you. (Note: an easy fix to this is to just spin in circles for the entire game).\n\n3. "Special" Zombies: Uncrowded has three very special and unique types of zombies. First, there are the regular zombies which will start gaily jumping towards the player out of sheer excitement of finally finding a potential target to ♥♥♥ rape. Second, are the magical Big Black Satan zombies that dwell deep in the woods. These zombies almost always spawn next to the "re spawn" points, which means after you "re spawn" you're going to get ♥♥♥ raped again. They deal a ludicrous amount of damage and there seems to be no spawn cap, which means three of these over grown ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are going to be somewhere on the map, ready to pounce upon the player's virgin booty. Third are the super amazing teleporting zombies. If you want to keep you're player safe by camping out on a roof top, it's certain that one of these will spawn directly behind the player. The player will then be ♥♥♥♥♥ in the ♥♥♥ and die.\n\n4. Day and Night cycles: Because if getting ♥♥♥ raped in the day wasn't fun enough, getting ♥♥♥ raped in the night (slightly darker day) is twice the fun.\n\n5. Cars: Actually, there's only one car which can go about 0.4 miles an hour, when it's not gliching out or getting stuck on the road. However, the car is the most op weapon since it is the only thing that will one hit a zombie, provided there is only one directly infront of the hood. If there is more than one zombie, the car will flip over and you will die. The car also does jackshit when it comes to protecting the player from zombies, since they can easily jump ontop of the car and proceed to hug and ♥♥♥ rape the player to death. (Update: June 29th, 8:42 p.m. if the pc enters the car after it rolls over, and exits it, the pc will be catapulted about 50 feet in the air and die on impact with the ground)\n\n6. The name: The game is way more crowded than the title suggest. The town, surrounding woods, and farms are constantly patrolled by the 3rd Zombie Platoon: Silent ♥♥♥ Raping Division.\n\n7. Construction: Apparently it's possible to erect a dwelling of your very own, but you're mostlikely going to get ♥♥♥ raped by the silent zombies before you can gather enough materials.\n\n8. Realistic need bars: Your pc will get hunrgy and thirsty, which can be solved by selecting any food or drink item in the inventory and literally throwing the food in your face.\n\n9. Sprint mechanic: Your character can sprint forever.\n\nClearly, this game is amazing. It has almost every feature a person could want, killing, krafting, and keating. It's obviouly better than any other game that has been or ever will be released. Instead of paying $69.69 for Fallout 4, just buy this. It's got all the same features and is twice as fun, and twice as broken.\n\nUpdate June 30th, 2015: A steam user by the name of Red has kindly pointed out to me that Uncrowded is not a game. I have to completely agree with him. Despite the makers of the game literally calling Uncrowded a game in their description, Uncrowded is 100%, undoutable, not a game. Uncrowded is an experience for an individual. Uncrowded is an ♥♥♥ raping simulator. Uncrowded is a software that can be downloaded onto the hard drive of your very own personal computer and executed via a desktop shortcut then played for countless hours with friends and/or by your self. So thank you, Red, for kindly bringing that to my attention, Uncrowded is definatly not a game, its it's own special entity all on it's own.","June 29, 2015","true","2.4"," 251 of 381 people (66%) found this review helpful 396 people found this review funny","66","251","381","396","18"

Minecraft being a successful game and all these devs rushing to make games just like it. Stupid if you ask me. for 9 cents on the steam store I think I want my money back.","September 1, 2015","false","2.8"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","28","29","3","4"

It is a ripoff from other ripoff games.\n\nThe mouse lag in this game is horrible and the sensitivity cannot be customized. It is unbearable to move the mouse throughout the game and hard to aim at enemies.\n\nThe hit detection is broken as bullets just fly through enemies most of the time. Also, the third alternative fire, I believe, literally fires a fury of bullets no matter the weapon, be it pump action shotguns and even the sniper rifle.\n\nZombie spawns are fairly broken as some of them tend to spawn within houses and get stuck. One of the zombies, a "black" zombie, is overpowered as it senses a human player no matter the range and moves way too fast, killing quite easily.\n\nHardly any zombies do spawn by the way in the huge map, making gameplay very boring after five minutes.\n\nMultiplayer is NOT functional at all, I either receive a disconnect or failure to join.\n\nIn summary, the game developer(s) were at least nice to put this game at a very good discount and the trading cards that come with it are more valuable than two cents, thus a nice profit is earned for enduring this stinking, rotten pile of horse turd. Still, this game is very badly made and is without a doubt, a cash-grab that should have never been greenlit.\n\n===\n\nIf this review is too long, here's a shorter summary. The game is more broken than a d!ck snapped in half.\n\n===\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI take back anything I said nice about the developer(s). Some butthurt f*gg-ot banned be for this reason:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/s6fiylq6xhj9y57/Screenshot%202015-11-02%2011.20.39.png?dl=0\n\nIn conclusion, I feel like a rich man for buying the game at 2 cents, receiving 3 cards totalling around 18 cents, and then requesting a refund as I played the game for only 1 hour.","October 30, 2015","false","1.1"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","28","29","9","0"

There is no grind and it just gives you cancer so it will save you from the non-cancerous people. The fact that bullets dont effect the zombies is among the best characteristics of this game.

But man. This..?\nI can't even say anything positive about this.\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nThe game is completely and utterly BROKEN. I tried joining and restarting the game several times, however, this didn't keep my character from walking on his own :-)\n\nFurthermore, even without this handicap, this game is UNPLAYABLE. I saw multiple bugs and glitches. Such as zombies not taking damage / Being able to eat food multiple times / Zombies turning into trees / Zombies walking into the corner of a room, then suddenly dying out of nowhere, I can go on, but don't feel like even wasting the time.\n\nWhen I died and waited a few minutes to respawn, the game crashed and gave me a crash report, telling me it would be great if I sent that to the developer of the game. I have better advice for the developer of this game: STOP.\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nIn conclusion I deeply REGRET paying 2 cents for this, and paying another 2 cents to gift it to a friend as well. Buying a Steam emoticon would have been much more rewarding.\n\nDon't buy this game.\n\n[NOTE: If anything, this game is good for earning your money back by selling the cards it drops for more than you paid for the game, hooray.]\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬","November 21, 2015","false","3.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

There are times when the indie game scene is rather slow, but that is because the true masterminds that are responsible for opening up this very platform of indie gaming. Specifically reffering to The Behemoth.\n\nIndie gaming is very important and Steam Greenlight is a mixed bag between success and this. Even when the Indie Games were blowing up these developers needed a publisher, this is why Steam Greenlight was such a great idea. Most of the games 'greenlit' are only purchased because you can profit off of their Steam Trading Cards.\n\nLet me now explain why the developers should feel ashamed of doing this. The developing company, The Behemoth is the father of indie games. They put their game on the GameCube and PS2, Alien Hominid. Was a minor success which got got it ported to the Xbox and Game Boy Advance. This is my own research but I can affirm this as the first multi-platform indie game at this capacity. Knowing this, the Uncrowded developers here literally put 5 minutes of effort to get this game on Steam. The same amount of time their development process took.\n\nThis game is an act of laziness. I wouldn't call a homeless man on the streets a 'bum' because that is rude. The developers are truly bums. I mean this game is literally the equivalant of selling a pre-made DIY kit, you can read other reviews from more details on what I mean. These people are the worst coders that they cannot even edit pre-made lines.\n\nThis game is insulting. Team Meat, The Behemoth, Derek Yu (Spelunky), and various of great indie developers made enormous risks, their creations could've never seen light if a publisher rejected them. Every indie developer should keep that in mind that it is wrong to take advantage of a system like GreenLight.","September 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

The little too it that is good is not even originally made by the developer. Most if not all of the game is an asset pack on the Unity store for $50.\n\nPros:\n\nTrading cards\n\nCons:\n\nThe graphics are too simply made and some of the items don't like what they're supposed to be.\n\nIf you hold your left mouse button for any longer than a microsecond, your entire clip instantly empties itself harmlessly.\n\nThere are very few items in the game.\n\nThe zombies are far too fast to have any chance of surviving for longer than a few minutes.\n\nOverall, the only reason to buy this game is if it's really cheap and you can make a few cents off the cards.","July 1, 2015","false","11.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was 2 ♥♥♥♥ing cents on the sale! I got 18 copies of it so I can have some edgy bragging rights.\nThe game is downright broken. Nothing works. Cars can't go reverse! We live in a world of chaos!\nAll the hours I placed into the game are from experimenting around. As you can see from the video on my profile, cars are pretty unsafe. You are safer on foot. Or are you? I died while climbing a ladder, jumping on a car, getting stuck in a door.. The list is never-ending!\nNot even the zombies work. They have no hitboxes for firearms so you can only use melee weapons. I recommend the hammer because it sends them flying around. The damage they deal is insane. Zombie lifts his arms, doesn't even hit me, takes away 30 HP. The fast zombies are even worse taking away 50, sometimes 60 HP.\nThe firearms are a joke. You ever seen a shotgun fire 7 shells at once? You ever saw an AK empty 30 bullets in a second? Then come play this piece of art!\nDon't get me wrong. The game is utter ♥♥♥♥. I do have to admit that it is a great deal for lovers of broken games. It kept me laughing for 30 minutes till I started losing breath and almost fainted. I'm glad I bought this game and that it even exists on Steam.

In my opinion it's only just started and somewhere between alpha and very very early beta.\n\nOverall:\n5/10 +1 price, +1 full multiplayer -2 alpha / not done (and probably won't ever be) -2 UnitZ / Unity prebuild = 3/10\n\nThe Dev is still slowly working on the game but to be fair there is probably 3-4 years to go before this game is worth spending a huge amount of time on. That's the problem with a small dev team.\n\nNow the game is $1, and on sale now and then, and it has cards.  So call it $0.70 after cards.  Can you get $0.70 worth of fun out of this game? Yep. Are you going to get $10 worth of fun? Not unless the dev puts another 3-4 years (20hrs per week) into the game.\n\nThere are better free games on steam, there are better similarly priced games on steam, there are just better games (period).  There are two reasons to get this game. First if it's on sale for less than the cards cost.  Second, you have 3 buddies and want to have some “this game sucks so bad it's fun” co-op gaming.\n\nI hope the dev gets some free time and actually takes a game that is 99.99% Unity / UnitZ and turns it into something.  If not, maybe (s)he should just give up game dev and move onto something else.","January 24","false","22.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I got the game for 7p (GBP 0.07) on a 96% sale (original price of £2). In my opinion (TL;DR) is that this game isn't the best game in the market (heck, it's one of the worst) however it shows some potential, even if the whole concept, design and textures are just a Unity Asset Pack.\n\n(Not TL;DR)\nThe first thing that I complained about was the poor framerate, even in the loading screen / menu (I even had higher frames in the actual game; 45-52FPS in the menu and 51-62FPS in the actual game) but that didn't stop me. After I had created my new Character (clevery named "Ben Dover"), packed him in a suit and went in to the world of, well, this game.\n\nIn my first life I had experienced the terrible "Pistol" which had used all my clip in a single auto-fire burst; which dissapointed me (and my ears bled for a couple of miniutes), and I'm not even going to mention the fact that the bullets don't even render or do any visable/physical damage (most of the time, 98% of the time) to the zombies. Later, I went to my first house (on the way picking up 3 pieces of wood, all in one, convinient stack) and there I noticed a shadow. Not just any shadow, but my shadow, or should I say the shadow of my "pistol"; a very shabby shadow at it's best (even if the game was in 1080p at it's "High" Graphical Setting, which told me nothing about how the game is going to look). After that I got mowed down by jumping zombies; where I found out my pistol is completely useless (as mentioned before).\n\nOkay, so I started my second life; in a position close to my old one. Here I was generously placed between 3 piles of wood; which I learnt was a mediocre melee weapon against the zombies. I saw a town, so I went to the town; and found a gorgeous sniper rifle (one of the best things about this "game") along with some ammo. In that house I learnt about the crafting system and the building system; which allowed me to feel like an MLG by blocking all the zombies out after I had spliced two pieces of foundation together and put some walls on top of them. But my fun didn't end there; possibly the best thing about this game was the sniper rifle's kill ragdoll, which made the zombies fly in rings as they are being ripped apart into shreds. Soon I discovered I could smash the zombies with pieces of wood through the walls - thinking this would last for all eternity; however the  walls did give up after some time and then I encoutered a big black thing, a wolf perhaps but, in the end, I killed it in the same amout of hits as I did a regular zombie (but this "wolf" had higher dps) however soon the zombies caught up to me and, I died.\n\nI would like to add that the game has no indication as to where you should find the resources needed to craft badages, hammers (e.t.c.); since all I could find was wood, shotguns and other weapons.\n\nMultiplayer works; to an extent (lower frames, 1-5FPS less then Singleplayer has) but the players are often silent and idle (oh, and the admin has super powers that can send you flying into the air and make your spine break; that was fun).\n\nAxes are only weapons, not actual tools that you can use to cut down trees and get wood that way. Grass is a flat 2D sprite that floats above the ground and looks misplaced.\n\nVerdict:\n\nCategoryScore (Out of 10)Performance7/10Graphics5.5/10Concept9/10* or 4/10Multiplayer7/10Gameplay6.5/10Overall6/10\n*Note: 9/10 if the game were to be original and fully made by the developer, but in it's current state it's a 4/10.\nVerdict: Buy it on sale, and only if it's under 10p (GBP 0.10); and buy some for your friends too! It'll be a great laugh!","September 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I checked the terminal output and saw the following:\n\nERROR: ld.so: object '/home/user/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/gameoverlayrenderer.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32): ignored.\nI disabled the Steam overlay and was greeted with another error when trying to run the game:\n\n/bin/sh: /home/user/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Uncrowded/Fieldz.x86: No such file or directory\nUpon checking the directory, I was able to verify that Fieldz.x86 didn't exist. There is a FieldZ.x86 - I guess the devs never got the memo that the path is case-sensitive. After correcting this, the game loaded with a 'Unity Personal Edition' splash screen. I knew this was probably just going to get worse now.\n\nAnyways, on to the game. I look around and realize I probably need wood. There are trees everywhere and I already have an axe. I guess I need to chop down some trees, right? Nope. That would be logical, but it doesn't appear that this can be done. Instead, I need to find precut wood blocks strewn about along the road.\n\nAs I'm trying to manage my inventory, a zombie attacks. I equipped my gun, clicked to fire at the zombie... and the entire magazine unloaded at point blank range, but no bullets seemed to have hit the zombie. Zombie kills me. Eventually I figure out that the axe kills the zombies in a single hit, but I lose some health because the zombie touches me, or something. That's better than dying though, since my gun seems to be worthless.\n\nEventually I found a shelter. Zombies swarmed around me. I killed a few in the doorway, managed to kill a few more by swinging my axe through the wall, and eventually realized that they are spawning nearby. I sprinted away from the structure and eventually hit the edge of the world. The zombies didn't seem to follow me. I wandered back into a wooded area and walked away from my computer for a few minutes. When I returned, I saw my character is still alive. I wandered some more, found an old farmhouse, and was killed by a swarm of zombies, that seemed to spawn out of nowhere.\n\nI wandered into another village and spotted a vehicle. I tried to get into the vehicle, but it tipped over for some unknown reason, and I died again. I decided at this point that I'd had enough.\n\nThis is a game that did not get off on the right foot with me, and did nothing to redeem itself. It's basically what would happen if Rust and Minecraft had a mentally challenged baby together. Don't buy it, not even for 19 cents when it's 90% off. If, for some reason, you do buy it... play until the card drops are done, sell the cards, and go do something else.\n\ntl;dr\n*The Linux version needs manual intervention from the user in order to run\n*Despite an axe and an abundance of trees, wood is acquired by finding it laying around\n*Guns are worthless\n*Weird spawning mechanic\n*Vehicles are death traps\n*Don't buy it","July 4, 2015","false","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you want a better version of this game go to the source of unturned it's f2p and less bugs.","September 1, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I got the game for 7p (GBP 0.07) on a 96% sale (original price of £2). In my opinion (TL;DR) is that this game isn't the best game in the market (heck, it's one of the worst) however it shows some potential, even if the whole concept, design and textures are just a Unity Asset Pack.\n\n(Not TL;DR)\nThe first thing that I complained about was the poor framerate, even in the loading screen / menu (I even had higher frames in the actual game; 45-52FPS in the menu and 51-62FPS in the actual game) but that didn't stop me. After I had created my new Character (clevery named "Ben Dover"), packed him in a suit and went in to the world of, well, this game.\n\nIn my first life I had experienced the terrible "Pistol" which had used all my clip in a single auto-fire burst; which dissapointed me (and my ears bled for a couple of miniutes), and I'm not even going to mention the fact that the bullets don't even render or do any visable/physical damage (most of the time, 98% of the time) to the zombies. Later, I went to my first house (on the way picking up 3 pieces of wood, all in one, convinient stack) and there I noticed a shadow. Not just any shadow, but my shadow, or should I say the shadow of my "pistol"; a very shabby shadow at it's best (even if the game was in 1080p at it's "High" Graphical Setting, which told me nothing about how the game is going to look). After that I got mowed down by jumping zombies; where I found out my pistol is completely useless (as mentioned before).\n\nOkay, so I started my second life; in a position close to my old one. Here I was generously placed between 3 piles of wood; which I learnt was a mediocre melee weapon against the zombies. I saw a town, so I went to the town; and found a gorgeous sniper rifle (one of the best things about this "game") along with some ammo. In that house I learnt about the crafting system and the building system; which allowed me to feel like an MLG by blocking all the zombies out after I had spliced two pieces of foundation together and put some walls on top of them. But my fun didn't end there; possibly the best thing about this game was the sniper rifle's kill ragdoll, which made the zombies fly in rings as they are being ripped apart into shreds. Soon I discovered I could smash the zombies with pieces of wood through the walls - thinking this would last for all eternity; however the  walls did give up after some time and then I encoutered a big black thing, a wolf perhaps but, in the end, I killed it in the same amout of hits as I did a regular zombie (but this "wolf" had higher dps) however soon the zombies caught up to me and, I died.\n\nI would like to add that the game has no indication as to where you should find the resources needed to craft badages, hammers (e.t.c.); since all I could find was wood, shotguns and other weapons.\n\nMultiplayer works; to an extent (lower frames, 1-5FPS less then Singleplayer has) but the players are often silent and idle (oh, and the admin has super powers that can send you flying into the air and make your spine break; that was fun).\n\nAxes are only weapons, not actual tools that you can use to cut down trees and get wood that way. Grass is a flat 2D sprite that floats above the ground and looks misplaced.\n\nVerdict:\n\nCategoryScore (Out of 10)Performance7/10Graphics5.5/10Concept9/10* or 4/10Multiplayer7/10Gameplay6.5/10Overall6/10\n*Note: 9/10 if the game were to be original and fully made by the developer, but in it's current state it's a 4/10.\nVerdict: Buy it on sale, and only if it's under 10p (GBP 0.10); and buy some for your friends too! It'll be a great laugh!","September 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are interested in buying Uncrowded. Don't do it. It's a waste of money and time. Reasons:\n1st: Bad playability. The looking around feels weird, and the aim does not stop in place when you stop moving the mouse.\n2nd: GLITCHEEEES. One of the most annoying glitches is that guns. Do. Not. Work. What kind of zombie survival game has this kind of glitch? Almost none, because firearms are a essencial part of these games, and this one does not have it. Also zombies are very glitchy as well. Also, you can't have more than one character, as the game will glitch and force you to play with the first character you made, and you can't delete your previous character, so yeah... choose your character wisely, because that's the only one you'll use.\n3rd: Extremely uncompleted, almost nothing works asides from walking around and hitting zombies with a melee (the only way to kill them). Oh, and zombies do extreme levels of damage as well.\nSo, I expect that after reading this review, and the thousands of other negative reviews out there, that you realised this game is not worth your time or money and that you go back searching on Steam.

Uncrowded (weird name but OK..) seems like a fun combination of Minecraft and DayZ... that is untill you start playing.\n\nLike DayZ there is no goal or mission but to survive; scavenge, eat, drink and fend of incoming zombies but in this game you may also craft buildings if you wish. Graphically 'Uncrowded' looks a bit like Minecraft and personally I don't think it looks that bad but there's something seriously wrong with the shadows in this game.\n\nThe problems soon arise once the zombies start chasing you. Most of the time the zombies simply won't get hit even though the crosshair is aimed right at them. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but you would guess I know how to properly aim a gun in a game by now.\nAfter a while some black zombies start chasing you who are ofcourse faster and stronger. When a zombie is attacking you, you can't kill it because it's too close and somehow you also lose all your ammo in one go while hearing an extremely loud noise (I tried to explain it the best way I can). The result: you will die and respawn again.\n\nThere are a lot of games like this and this is one of the worst. If the developers just put a little more effort in this game it could've been an OK game but as it stands now there's no fun to be had in this game unless you enjoy respawning and glitches.\n\n","November 7, 2015","false","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

So good infact, it couldn't handle someone as low as me playing it, so it had to boot me out a couple times. The game offers expansive options and unvaried customizability, with 3 graphics settings and 5 different characters. Something I really like about this game is that unlike its more borish peers, it realizes the objective superiority of a plank of wood over something as trivial as a pistol or sniper rifle. While a piece of wood can take down zombies in 3 or 4 hits, you can unload multiple clips of bullets and not do even a lick of damage. I feel Uncrowded fairly represents wood in a medium where it is sorely misrepresented, and even mocked. Uncrowded's zombies are a standout, you can very well tell why zombies were able to take down humanity, not only are they stronger and faster than you, they also have an advanced space program! You read that right, while a zombie was chasing me, he realized his dreams and aspirations had changed, and he immediately took off into space after running into a tree. It was a truely inspiring and thought provoking moment you just don't see in modern gaming. In conclusiong, Uncrowded is a fantastic game, the game of the year, and possibly one of the best games of all time, surpassing even Battletoads.","November 1, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

I had that from selling bloody trading cards, i figured i could get SOME worth out of it. I did... but that doesn't mean you should buy it.\n\nIt wouldn't matter if the gameplay for this was good, if the sound design was good, if the graphics were good, it just wouldn't matter. This game is an asset flip. They bought a premade pack on the unity store, packaged it up, and sold it. Despite the "updates", they added nothing. Every feature in this is available on the free demo you can play in your web browser, which, might i add, actually works BETTER than this game. The reason for that is that they used a pack made for Unity 4 on the Unity 5 engine, and didn't try to fix anything that arose from that.\n\nIt's glitchy. REALLY glitchy. The number of times i got sent flailing into the sky from a physics error was astounding. I suppose, in and of itself, that's really the only worth i got out of this, the giggles from the amount of times i managed to break physics. (And this one time i managed to climb a ladder and somehow get stuck in an abyss with my gun snapping into random pieces back and forth.) You can't actually bind things to your hotbar to my knowledge. Zombies have this odd tendancy to get stuck to you. ETC.\n\nOverall, this never should've gotten onto steam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/recommended/370100/","Luna_Nyx","♥ Gia ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/","398 products in account","You know...I'd understand if this game was 1.99$ and Unturned was 59.99$. Sometimes, we don't feel like spending a lot of money for a single game, and we play the cheaper, or F2P version of said game. For example (Yes, gonna use this example), when Minecraft was a PC exclusive title, lots of people that wanted to play minecraft on their 360 bought that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with zombies, forgot the name, castleminer z? I think. It's either that, or nothing.\n\n...But here...You actually have to pay for this game, while Unturned is completely free. Even if you had to pay 5 cents for this piece of crap, it's totally not worth it, because UNTURNED IS FREE. Paying for a vastly inferior product is something you shouldn't even think about doing. This isn't even hilariously bad, it's just plain bad. Now, let's talk about the game....\n\nBasically, you pick your class (The only thing that Unturned doesn't have, but who cares?), and spawn in the middle of nowhere. You run around, a zombie shamelessly spawns right in front of you, and starts clobbering you. You try to shot said zombie, and your bullets seem to go through his body at times. (Btw, being a basic asset, zombies look terrible in this.)\n\nWhen the zombie finally reaches you, your shots are worthless. You won't hit him, at all. You have to run, turn around, and shoot him again with your peashooter. Sounds like fun? It isn't.\n\nZombies are buggy, their bodies fly up in the air when you kill them, sounds are buggy, and quite painful to listen, graphics are ugly, boring, bland and uninspired (Because again, this is just an asset flip, barebones.), hell, sometimes they even flicker, as if the entire stability of the in-game world was about to collapse, and you can reach the "end of the map". It's just an invisible wall. Didn't expect anything more. It's easy to get lost, too.\n\nHouses are buggy, too, sometimes they spawn upside down, sometimes you can go through walls, and sometimes you can even go through the rooftop if you are up there, falling down into a trap of hungry ghouls.\n\nAlso, vehicles suck, don't even bother. They are too slow, you're vulnerable against gangbangs while trying to pick up speed because there is no roof, doors, or anything like that, and they slow down drastically each time you hit a zombie.\n\n"Braaaaaaains"...It's hilarious at first, but then, it's plain annoying. It's even worse when there's like 10 zombies after you repeating the same thing over and over. They spawn on roofs at times, they did that when I was taking a screenshot of all the zombies hugging each other trying to reach me. They can't even walk in a straight line, they keep jumping like ♥♥♥♥ing minecraft spiders, and that, in a zombie, looks ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. Every single zombie looks the same, except some random black asshats with red eyes that move way faster. Also, zombies sometimes die and explode when they collide against certain buggy objects. I was playing in sandbox mode, and when a zombie collided against a parked vehicle, the zombie dies, and the vehicle just starts spinning in the air. It's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Shooting zombies can cause all kind of weird stuff to happen, like zombies flying up in the air, being launched several feet backwards as if nothing happened, or just making them slide on the floor as if it was covered with ice.\n\nOh, it's got multiplayer, also....Not that anybody wants to play this piece of ♥♥♥♥ when you've got, I dunno...Unturned. Don't even try to get your friends to play this with you, because they will hate you.\n\nAnd it's got steam cards....If that's your fetish, like mine.\n\nHow the ♥♥♥♥ did this got greenlit? It's not worth your cents, it isn't worth anything, hell, even if it was free, it's NOT WORTH IT. I feel like some of my brain cells died after playing this game. Avoid like plague. I rest my case.","October 9, 2015","false","2.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And lets start it off:\n\nThis game looks more like a preview/demo of a game, rather then a full game.\n\n1. It gives you no controls and it doesn't show you how to play, and it shows no settings either, so if the music is too loud or something, bad luck.\n\n2. The car noises you can hear from ages away and they are so loud, louder then the whole game itself\n\n3. The running is way to fast and unnatural and weird.\n\n4. Ctrl shoots as well as mouse, like WTF? its okay if i cant crouch, but i hate if i try and it makes me shoot\n\n5. You cannot exit a vechile. I tried to enter one, and somehow did but some random control, and i couldnt exit, i mashed my keyboard and pressed every button, still couldn't get out.\n\n6. Black zombies are fast as f*ck.\n\n7. How the f*ck do I get metal pieces? You either start with a gun, so u can defend urself (policeman) with nothing else and not too much ammo, or start with just an axe, so just wood, or just food. Like you should just start with an axe because wood is important and a gun or something to at least protect yourself.\n\n8. A worse version of unturned, only way its better is the ground graphical features.\n\n9. Did i already say NO SETTINGS? So no change of controls, or sound, or make it window mode or change resoloution.\n\n10. No trading cards?\n\n11. 2 cents is too expensive, wouldn't even give it to my alzhemic grandma, she wouldn't forget about this, thats how sh*t it is.\n\n12. They still won't even fix these bugs, they just add "You can make houses" and "Sh*tty pumpkins yay!"\n\n13. I played the game for less then 10 minutes and found all of these problems, there are probably more.","October 31, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Do not by.\n\nThis game is a Unity asset flip, nothing more.\n\nThe programer can not bug fix to save their life, with weapons, that you would think would be easy to impliment, unable to function correctly. The weapons firing all the rounds in the magazine at once and dealing no damage, ragdoll physics that sends zombie bodies occasionally flying far off into space are just a few of the bugs that i found when playing this on stream, with many many others constantly visable. There is no ambient audio, however, if you do come across a sound source, like a tree or a car, they are very loud and obnoxious and will cut out a very specific distances.\n\nThe Zombies, the main focus of the game, spawn in very close to buildings. I believe that the game can only render about 2 or 3 zombies at a time, and there are two whole types of Zombie, the standard green, and a black zombie that can run really fast. They have essentally no pathfinding what so ever, walking only in a straight line, often trying to clip through walls.\n\nVisuals are some of the poorest I have seen in a unity flip. The ground tile is tiny, flickers randomly at points of elevation changes, some tiles are missing textures, the trees are same-y and my god, the tiny-bricked homes! Textrue scaling is a thing!\n\nI will admit that the one redeeming feature of this bugged mess. Hitting a Zombie with the axe. Thump!\n\nDo NOT buy.\n\nFeel free to watch the train wreak of a "game" here.[www.twitch.tv]","October 30, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got it for $.02.\nThere's lots of wood piles to find. Just laying there. In the road.\nThere are also lots of shotguns (I found 4 in a room at once)\n\nCons: I have one of the best laptops in terms of gaming. On ultra high quality i crashed twice and capped at 15 fps.\nI flinch every time I melee kill a zombie because the noise is so loud.\nThe reason I melee kill zombies is because the guns are garbage. You can only kill with headshots, and the bullets never register. I shot 3 zombies and they died 30 seconds later.\nI have yet to find a single food item.\nZombies literally run faster than you unless you sprint. Which attracts more zombies.\nZombies also pop out of the ground to spawn. 5 feet in front of you.\nThe main Dev (if you can even call him that) apparently doesn't speak english well so the translations are pretty messed up. It's legible, but barely.\nAs far as I could tell, there were no towns, just random houses in the woods (again, with no food)\nI couldn't find an options menu. Not sure if there is one.\n\nTLDR: The dev is probably a 13 year old from a non english speaking country, and made this game as a school project. It's actual garbage. If you spent more than 2 pennies, you were robbed, my good sir.","October 31, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got it for $.02.\nThere's lots of wood piles to find. Just laying there. In the road.\nThere are also lots of shotguns (I found 4 in a room at once)\n\nCons: I have one of the best laptops in terms of gaming. On ultra high quality i crashed twice and capped at 15 fps.\nI flinch every time I melee kill a zombie because the noise is so loud.\nThe reason I melee kill zombies is because the guns are garbage. You can only kill with headshots, and the bullets never register. I shot 3 zombies and they died 30 seconds later.\nI have yet to find a single food item.\nZombies literally run faster than you unless you sprint. Which attracts more zombies.\nZombies also pop out of the ground to spawn. 5 feet in front of you.\nThe main Dev (if you can even call him that) apparently doesn't speak english well so the translations are pretty messed up. It's legible, but barely.\nAs far as I could tell, there were no towns, just random houses in the woods (again, with no food)\nI couldn't find an options menu. Not sure if there is one.\n\nTLDR: The dev is probably a 13 year old from a non english speaking country, and made this game as a school project. It's actual garbage. If you spent more than 2 pennies, you were robbed, my good sir.","October 31, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wonder for what? I can`t even gather enough wood to build something (BTW placing house parts is... well. See for yourself) Fow now i crafted door, doorway and windows. But i`m unable to place it, or i placed it but accidentally on middle of room... We need to eat and drink to survive. But there is no river and no way to gather crops so.. why bother?

Suddenly you're trapped. You have a gun, of course, but it's too glitchy to actually fire reliably. You try to make a run for it, but Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥ is too fast. You won't be able to outrun him and his terrible animations. You have nothing to do but lay down and plead for mercy before Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥. "Please Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥. Please spare me! I've done nothing wrong."\n\nUltra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥ looks confused, then suddenly sprints at you, arms flailing. He wants blood. You try to run, but it's no good. Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥ catches you eventually. He begins to attack you relentlessly until suddenly he stops moving! What just happened? Are you ok, Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥?\n\nYou look back in surprise to see that Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥ is stuck on a tiny slope. Well of course, you're not going to waste this opportunity. You stand up and sprint at an ungodly speed from Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥. Each step you take is paved with dread until you eventually stop and scan your surroundings. Have you lost him?\n\nSeconds become minutes as you stand tall, searching the horizon for Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥, but he is nowhere to be seen. You're safe.\n\n"Well, now that that's over, I'm going to attempt to build some kind of shelter. I'd better collect some wood!" you say with relief. You wander off into the forest to find some wood, and eventually stumble upon a few stacks mysteriously lying on the ground. Who put these here? Why are they just brown cuboids? It matters not. Glad to have some resources, you gather the wood and begin to investigate further.\n\nYou search the area and then something catches your eye. It's another stack of wood lying right at your feet! Didn't you just pick this up a moment ago? Apparently not. Glad to have some extra resources, you turn to leave while you're ahead and suddenly trip over another stack of wood! "Where did this come from?" you ask. You definitely just picked it up. Well, it seems this is some magical wood, you presume. It continues to reappear again and again. Perhaps you can come back here repeatedly to gather wood with consistency.\n\nWhatever. You'll investigate this further a little later. For now, you've gotta build a shelter. You roam this barren wasteland and find an area of flat land, not too shabby, honestly. It looks good! You lay down your bags and put down the foundation of your building and spend a few minutes throwing up some walls.\n\n"It's looking good!" you think to yourself, marvelling before your grand construction. With a revitalized sense of oneness with the world, you open the door to your house, then suddenly...\n\nULTRA GIGA ♥♥♥♥♥ OUTTA NOWHERE! He dives at you, pinning you to the floor before flailing his arms around on you. You're left completely defenseless! How did he even get in here? There's only one door!\n\nYour protests are useless. Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥ relentlessly beats you to death on your own floor, and then you respawn, back in the same old wasteland, with the same old broken gun, and the same old Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥. The cycle repeats in an infinite loop of black death, and such is the cruel reality of Uncrowded.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nBONUS!\n>Download game\n>Oddly long first time setup\n>New game\n>Take a look at the broken Unity terrain with odd lighting\n\n>Be attacked by zombie that's faster than you\n>Undead cubes from every direction\n>You try to fire back but can't because your gun is glitched to sh!t\n\n>Try to run\n>Haul as$ until a zombie eventually gets stuck on a slope and can't chase you anymore\n>Intelligent AI.jpg\n>Suddenly die because a random black zombie (Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥) appeared out of literally nowhere\n\n>First letter of every sentence.

Suddenly you're trapped. You have a gun, of course, but it's too glitchy to actually fire reliably. You try to make a run for it, but Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥ is too fast. You won't be able to outrun him and his terrible animations. You have nothing to do but lay down and plead for mercy before Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥. "Please Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥. Please spare me! I've done nothing wrong."\n\nUltra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥ looks confused, then suddenly sprints at you, arms flailing. He wants blood. You try to run, but it's no good. Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥ catches you eventually. He begins to attack you relentlessly until suddenly he stops moving! What just happened? Are you ok, Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥?\n\nYou look back in surprise to see that Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥ is stuck on a tiny slope. Well of course, you're not going to waste this opportunity. You stand up and sprint at an ungodly speed from Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥. Each step you take is paved with dread until you eventually stop and scan your surroundings. Have you lost him?\n\nSeconds become minutes as you stand tall, searching the horizon for Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥, but he is nowhere to be seen. You're safe.\n\n"Well, now that that's over, I'm going to attempt to build some kind of shelter. I'd better collect some wood!" you say with relief. You wander off into the forest to find some wood, and eventually stumble upon a few stacks mysteriously lying on the ground. Who put these here? Why are they just brown cuboids? It matters not. Glad to have some resources, you gather the wood and begin to investigate further.\n\nYou search the area and then something catches your eye. It's another stack of wood lying right at your feet! Didn't you just pick this up a moment ago? Apparently not. Glad to have some extra resources, you turn to leave while you're ahead and suddenly trip over another stack of wood! "Where did this come from?" you ask. You definitely just picked it up. Well, it seems this is some magical wood, you presume. It continues to reappear again and again. Perhaps you can come back here repeatedly to gather wood with consistency.\n\nWhatever. You'll investigate this further a little later. For now, you've gotta build a shelter. You roam this barren wasteland and find an area of flat land, not too shabby, honestly. It looks good! You lay down your bags and put down the foundation of your building and spend a few minutes throwing up some walls.\n\n"It's looking good!" you think to yourself, marvelling before your grand construction. With a revitalized sense of oneness with the world, you open the door to your house, then suddenly...\n\nULTRA GIGA ♥♥♥♥♥ OUTTA NOWHERE! He dives at you, pinning you to the floor before flailing his arms around on you. You're left completely defenseless! How did he even get in here? There's only one door!\n\nYour protests are useless. Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥ relentlessly beats you to death on your own floor, and then you respawn, back in the same old wasteland, with the same old broken gun, and the same old Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥. The cycle repeats in an infinite loop of black death, and such is the cruel reality of Uncrowded.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nBONUS!\n>Download game\n>Oddly long first time setup\n>New game\n>Take a look at the broken Unity terrain with odd lighting\n\n>Be attacked by zombie that's faster than you\n>Undead cubes from every direction\n>You try to fire back but can't because your gun is glitched to sh!t\n\n>Try to run\n>Haul as$ until a zombie eventually gets stuck on a slope and can't chase you anymore\n>Intelligent AI.jpg\n>Suddenly die because a random black zombie (Ultra Giga ♥♥♥♥♥) appeared out of literally nowhere\n\n>First letter of every sentence. Yours sincerely. Grizzlebear.\n\nHad more fun writing this review than I did playing the game. Thanks to Harichi-Kun for gifting me this in the first place.\n\nEDIT: Damn censorship.

Not ha-ha funny more like "I want to die after playing five whole minutes". It's that bad, First I would like to adress the gameplay, The game is more like Roblox, In alpha, Roblox has better graphics(and no, I'm not a kid i've just seen those annyoing ads) The ingame charecters are ugly and give little to no bonus because you'll die by a zombie a foot away. The weapons cannot be reloaded and they all miss point blank on a zombie. You can't connect to other player's using Hamachi, Dedicated servers, or even LAN. (I have a neighbor that sadly bought full price and attempted to play with him) Don't get it on sale even if it is six cents, My friend bought this for me,I hate him now, Full price is a joke, the creater should take this down, give everyone there money back with an apology, and probably change thier identity. In conclusion don't get it as a gag, a joke, a birthday gift or a game to play when you have money to spend.","October 26, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Comparing this game to its rivals such as Team Fortress 2, Tomb Raider and Dota 2. This game stands as a clear winner. Everything about this game is just perfect, from character progression to complicated world designs. This game is revolutionary, some might say, to me...This game is more than that, it's the purpose of life. This game taught me how to live life to the fullest potential and fight for dreams that matter most. Overall this game has nice graphics (5/21) and great sound (9/11), sounds even better on 7.1. For $0.02 that I got for free, this game is a clear winner.

It takes a lot of inspiration from other classic videogames and combines them to a masterpiece. The game is atmospheric just like Shadow of the Colossus, has the same rewarding gameplay as Super Metroid and an intriguing storyline similar to Silent Hill 2. Not only that but the graphics are just beautiful forget Just Cause 3, Metal Gear Solid V and The Witcher 3 this game is just pure art. And sets a new milestone for videogame graphics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikebloke/recommended/370100/","mikebloke","Mikebloke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikebloke/","1383 products in account","This is going to be quite an honest review, I spent 2 pence on the game, and I clocked out at 63 minutes. Various others have paid similar prices (or more) and asked for a refund, I won't be doing such thing and in this review I'll explain why:\n\nI base all my games on the premise that 1 hour for £1 is a reasonable cost. If I buy a AAA game for £30 I expect it to last me at least 30 hours, if it lasts only 15, I seriously question whether its been worth the money. Its a basic rule.\n\nFor 63 minutes of gameplay, most of it in the single player mode, I got approx 31 minutes per pence, that is nearly in comparison to another game on my list, The Last Remnant that lasted 72 hours in one playthrough (not 100% either!, in fact I didn't actually play it, I watched my ex-Wife play it) for £2, making it roughly 36 minutes a pence. But enough about the cost-playtime ratio:\n\nThe game is essentially based upon a content package that seems to be available for $50 for the unity engine, this is fair enough. What the developer has essentially done is renamed and released this content pack in a barebones release, currently on sale for about 79p or 2p in the sale. If the developer has made more than $50 in this game, They can call it a financial success. If I had paid full price for it, I'd still have technially matched my value criteria.\n\nBut what about the game itself, it plays more like a tech demo than a game, and in reality it could have changes done to it within a matter of hours and it could be so radically transformed and its value increased. I struggled to join a multiplayer game for a start, and when I did I never met another player (though it appeared some were logging in), there appears to be a quick inventory list but I have no idea how to actually asign things to it, crafting building material is fair enough but I don't get how to actually place it (I tried building a door in a pre existing house only to die before I could figure any of it out), and shooting is problematic and unreal. A plank of wood is more effective at the beginning until you get an axe, which appears to one hit kill zombies every time. There is a scoreboard by pressing tab, but otherwise no other notice of how well one does.\n\nIt appears as though the developer does make updates to the game, which is quite interesting; in the unlikely event that any of these suggestions would be considered, I make them anyway:\n\n1) There is no good reason why personal scoring can't be labelled on the HUD, put it in a top corner.\n2) Zombies clearly spawn near houses, its pretty much the only way to find them, the occassional one when you are hiding out in the woods would not be a bad thing.\n3) There are two types of Zombies, this could be easily increased with ones that'll take more than a single axe hit, and make weapon progression more worthwhile.\n4) In single player trying to find resources and building without getting jumped on is virtually impossible.\n5) A round/wave based system would fix this game up so easily.\n\nThese basic things could improve the basic game so much and make it less ridiculed. Yes there are better games (for free) on steam using the same content packs, but I'm treating this game as an Individual game in its own right.","October 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can not believe how much this game saved me. I was looking for a reliable game that has superb action and co-op capability to play with my friends, and this had it all! Completely new experience, never before have I seen something unique. To come up with the idea of surviving against zombies in an open world HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. The multiplayer is great! Everyone can join off of you! It's great! It's easy to create one, even without a single tutorial as to how to make a server private and just for your friends. This is the game of the year, boys, I have no idea how you can live without this. It's the new GTA5, I say. The future is here. As another note, this game is flawlessly made in terms of bugs. I haven't encountered A SINGLE BUG THAT AFFECTED MY EXPERIENCE. Nope, none at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToothyMoose/recommended/370100/","ToothyMoose","Ryudius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToothyMoose/","166 products in account","This game tries to mimic the success of Unturned, with a price tag. The Dev took everything that Unturned and Day-Z had, and tried to make a game out of it. Honestly, it looks like it was made in a few days. They probably thought that they could make money out of something free. If you really want your games to sell, at least work on them. And out comes this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, Uncrowded, with the same prefix, gameplay style, and game icon. How the hell did this game get out of Greenlight? It's like the Dev ripped Day-Z out of cardboard, and they still sell it to people like me who buy cheap games. But, it doesn't even end there. The game is actually free to play on their website. So, what's the point of selling it for money on Steam?\n\nThe gun animations are a joke, barely any work done on them. Every item is held the same way, and all consumable items are given a 'punch' animation instead, which doesn't really make any sense. Damage done by weapons is unrealistic, as a .50cal sniper will destroy a vehicle in 5 hits, where a flashlight will destroy it in 4. The flashlight does the most damage out of all weapons in the game, either a bug or the Dev didn't really care much to compare the damage of weapons. There's really no use of vehicles, since sprinting is faster than driving, and that vehicles have so little health points that they will explode after a few shots. No warning, no smoke, just explosion.\n\nSome weapons share the same fire sound, such as the M4A1 and the AK47. Why? Did the Dev run out of time that they had to release this game before creating another sound? The game has five classes, all uninspired, all vaguely described with their special abilities and bonuses. For example, the Salaryman class spawns with extra food, which doesn't really make sense. Another class, Nod New, spawns with "Everything She Needs." What the actual ♥♥♥♥ does that mean?\n\nThe game is very buggy, unsurprisingly. Spamming CTRL (used to fire) will cause weapons to shoot at an abnormal fire rate, with the audio speeding up and overlapping. Touching a car's tires will cause it to fly up in the air. There's also a uselss thirst and hunger bar, which, by eating or drinking, doesn't ever rise. Any physical object can kill you instantly, even if it is slower than you.\n\ntl;dr The game isn't worth its price. It's a game that plays like Day-Z, looks like Unturned, except it doesn't have as much content as both of those games split in half. Try Unturned if you want something that is actually playable, you won't even have to spend a penny on it.","June 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Various others have paid similar prices (or more) and asked for a refund, I won't be doing such thing and in this review I'll explain why:\n\nI base all my games on the premise that 1 hour for £1 is a reasonable cost. If I buy a AAA game for £30 I expect it to last me at least 30 hours, if it lasts only 15, I seriously question whether its been worth the money. Its a basic rule.\n\nFor 63 minutes of gameplay, most of it in the single player mode, I got approx 31 minutes per pence, that is nearly in comparison to another game on my list, The Last Remnant that lasted 72 hours in one playthrough (not 100% either!, in fact I didn't actually play it, I watched my ex-Wife play it) for £2, making it roughly 36 minutes a pence. But enough about the cost-playtime ratio:\n\nThe game is essentially based upon a content package that seems to be available for $50 for the unity engine, this is fair enough. What the developer has essentially done is renamed and released this content pack in a barebones release, currently on sale for about 79p or 2p in the sale. If the developer has made more than $50 in this game, They can call it a financial success. If I had paid full price for it, I'd still have technially matched my value criteria.\n\nBut what about the game itself, it plays more like a tech demo than a game, and in reality it could have changes done to it within a matter of hours and it could be so radically transformed and its value increased. I struggled to join a multiplayer game for a start, and when I did I never met another player (though it appeared some were logging in), there appears to be a quick inventory list but I have no idea how to actually asign things to it, crafting building material is fair enough but I don't get how to actually place it (I tried building a door in a pre existing house only to die before I could figure any of it out), and shooting is problematic and unreal. A plank of wood is more effective at the beginning until you get an axe, which appears to one hit kill zombies every time. There is a scoreboard by pressing tab, but otherwise no other notice of how well one does.\n\nIt appears as though the developer does make updates to the game, which is quite interesting; in the unlikely event that any of these suggestions would be considered, I make them anyway:\n\n1) There is no good reason why personal scoring can't be labelled on the HUD, put it in a top corner.\n2) Zombies clearly spawn near houses, its pretty much the only way to find them, the occassional one when you are hiding out in the woods would not be a bad thing.\n3) There are two types of Zombies, this could be easily increased with ones that'll take more than a single axe hit, and make weapon progression more worthwhile.\n4) In single player trying to find resources and building without getting jumped on is virtually impossible.\n5) A round/wave based system would fix this game up so easily.\n\nThese basic things could improve the basic game so much and make it less ridiculed. Yes there are better games (for free) on steam using the same content packs, but I'm treating this game as an Individual game in its own right.","October 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can not believe how much this game saved me. I was looking for a reliable game that has superb action and co-op capability to play with my friends, and this had it all! Completely new experience, never before have I seen something unique. To come up with the idea of surviving against zombies in an open world HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. The multiplayer is great! Everyone can join off of you! It's great! It's easy to create one, even without a single tutorial as to how to make a server private and just for your friends. This is the game of the year, boys, I have no idea how you can live without this. It's the new GTA5, I say. The future is here. As another note, this game is flawlessly made in terms of bugs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToothyMoose/recommended/370100/","ToothyMoose","Ryudius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToothyMoose/","166 products in account","This game tries to mimic the success of Unturned, with a price tag. The Dev took everything that Unturned and Day-Z had, and tried to make a game out of it. Honestly, it looks like it was made in a few days. They probably thought that they could make money out of something free. If you really want your games to sell, at least work on them. And out comes this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, Uncrowded, with the same prefix, gameplay style, and game icon. How the hell did this game get out of Greenlight? It's like the Dev ripped Day-Z out of cardboard, and they still sell it to people like me who buy cheap games. But, it doesn't even end there. The game is actually free to play on their website. So, what's the point of selling it for money on Steam?\n\nThe gun animations are a joke, barely any work done on them. Every item is held the same way, and all consumable items are given a 'punch' animation instead, which doesn't really make any sense. Damage done by weapons is unrealistic, as a .50cal sniper will destroy a vehicle in 5 hits, where a flashlight will destroy it in 4. The flashlight does the most damage out of all weapons in the game, either a bug or the Dev didn't really care much to compare the damage of weapons. There's really no use of vehicles, since sprinting is faster than driving, and that vehicles have so little health points that they will explode after a few shots. No warning, no smoke, just explosion.\n\nSome weapons share the same fire sound, such as the M4A1 and the AK47. Why? Did the Dev run out of time that they had to release this game before creating another sound? The game has five classes, all uninspired, all vaguely described with their special abilities and bonuses. For example, the Salaryman class spawns with extra food, which doesn't really make sense. Another class, Nod New, spawns with "Everything She Needs." What the actual ♥♥♥♥ does that mean?\n\nThe game is very buggy, unsurprisingly. Spamming CTRL (used to fire) will cause weapons to shoot at an abnormal fire rate, with the audio speeding up and overlapping. Touching a car's tires will cause it to fly up in the air. There's also a uselss thirst and hunger bar, which, by eating or drinking, doesn't ever rise. Any physical object can kill you instantly, even if it is slower than you.\n\ntl;dr The game isn't worth its price. It's a game that plays like Day-Z, looks like Unturned, except it doesn't have as much content as both of those games split in half. Try Unturned if you want something that is actually playable, you won't even have to spend a penny on it.","June 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Only paid $0.02 for the game, just to see what all the fuss is about, and to give my input on it.\n\nSo, here's how it all went down...\nI bought game...\nI installed game...\nI tried...really hard...to play it...I really wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt...\n...I was stupid for even trying...\n\nSo, with that said now, I will now make a quick list of the pros and cons of this so-called "Game":\n\nPros:\n1. Only cost me 2 cents...I let it sit on the title screen till I got 3 Trading Cards out of it. Currently selling the cards for 8 cents each. It's the only game of its kind where you actually make a PROFIT from the trading cards. But was it worth it? Probably not...\n2. Thankfully the uninstall functionality works after obtaining the trading cards.\n\nCons:\n1. Shooting your gun at the ground, building wall, tree, or even at point-blank range at a zombie that's constantly bashes you does nothing but blows through the whole clip of ammo in less than a milisecond. Apparently using a log, or if you play as the Fireman, using the Axe, or finding a Hammer and just using a melee weapon is far more efficient than any ranged weapon in the game.\n\n2. 3 Game Modes! Sandbox which...has absolutely nothing in it but stuff...that you don't know what to do with! Death Match which is unplayable! "Open World Survival" where the map is supposedly "Open World", only to realize that when you reach the edge, there's an invisible wall on all corners of the map! As for survival, zombies or monsters will spawn sometimes directly in front of you, they run just as fast as you, and will hit you until you are dead cause you can't shoot them at point-blank range!\n\n3. There's a vehicle in the game! Sweet *Goes drives it, only to see it spontaneously fly up in the air, somehow land in between two buildings, stuck, and there's no reverse* .......okay......I suppose that makes sense.\n\n4. No statistics, no scoreboard, no sense of direction, no "game". How did this get passed Greenlight while so many other games with potential did not is beyond me...\n\n5. It's Halloween! Guess what they added to the game for Halloween!? PUMPKINS! Scarecrows, and Tombstones! WOW, and not a single thing done to even "attempt" to fix the game, let alone change it from looking like a complete generic cut / paste copy of "other" games!\n\n6. According to my recorded time, it took 3.4 hours to get the 3 Trading Cards. I busy playing Clicker Heroes while I had this going in the backround. Yea, that's right, I'd rather play a mundane simplistic game like CLICKER HEROES over this pile of crap!\n\nAnd there you have it folks. Give this pile of dung a round of applause for making it up there along with other great titles, such as Big Rigs, Plumbers Don't Wear Ties, etc. I'd rather play the game "Don't Move" over this!\n\nTo those that are Trading Card enthusiasts, and are willing to suffer for 3 hours roughly getting Trading Cards to sell for profit, get it while it's still on sale for $0.02.\n\nTo those that enjoy playing terribly horrible games, buy this when and if it ever costs $50 just so you can say you blew a lot of money on a load of garbage.\n\nTo those that know someone you utterly dislike, and want nothing more than to see them suffer, but without wishing them any ill will (cause wishing bad things on other people is never a nice thing to do), buy and gift this game to them instead. It's far better than trying to come up with any clever insult upon those you despise. =)\n\nTo those that want an honest opinion on the game, whether it's even worth spending $0.02 or even $0.99 to play, please don't. There are far greater things in life that your hard earned cash can be spent on, like a candy bar, or a cheap roll of toilet paper.\n\nHope you all have found this review helpful in making the right decision. Thank you all, and have a wonderful day!","October 30, 2015","false","3.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
