I've bought this for 4 Euro's and in my opinion it's too expensive because I bought once a five in one bundel for 5 Euro's with 5 much better HOG's than this one.\n\nI repeat: buy this one for your kid or little nephew....","April 26","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I find myself randomly clicking instead of actually searching.\n\nA shame because the concept itself is very interesting.","May 16","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
