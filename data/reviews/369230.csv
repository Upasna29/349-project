You have to own a controller to be able to play. Until they add support, if ever, for keyboard + mouse i am giving this a HUGE not recommended. To bad, cause i really wanted to try this game out, but can't even play it at this point.","January 7","false","0.2"," 193 of 265 people (73%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","73","193","265","40","22"

But would you want to?\nYes!\nThis is an incredibly fun little game, with a huge roster of characters from the movies, the models look great, and the voicing is alright. The maps are beautiful and look just like their movie counterparts. It's definitely not as balanced and perfected as Super Smash Bros., but it doesn't need to be. If you enjoy the movies, and these characters, then you'll have alot of fun playing as them in this game.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a fan of Kung Fu Panda.","February 15","true","1.6"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","21","27","5","0"

If you're going to make a fighting game, controls controls controls. The way they are handled kind of dissasembles the whole point of this game.\n\nOutside of that pretty much everything else is so on point to the franchise.  They art, environment, animations, and character models are completely wonderful.  Even the music/sfx, UI, particle effects and general ambience are excellent.\n\n...why did you drop the ball on the contooooollllls, this could have given even smash brothers a respectable competator. ;_:","March 28","false","0.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Really, I do. It gave me what i'd been wanting for some time now: A Kung Fu Panda Fighting game on the PC.\n\nThe different game modes would allow for an amazing time playing with friends or in single player mode (despite the lack of an actual story) But it's slugish controls make it barely playable on even the lowest difficulty settings.\n\nI wouldn't recomend paying for this game unless the developers fix that with an update or something.","March 29","false","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
