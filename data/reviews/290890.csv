That's it, if that's exactly what you want then read no further - this is the game for you.\n\nOnto the review proper.  I have never played 10000000, I do no know what type of game it is and maybe I should have done more research because the description 'About This Game' was not what I was lead to expect at all when I bought You Must Build A Boat.\n\nYOU DO NOT BUILD A BOAT.  For every stage you pass your boat gets bigger and more furnished.  You have no input in how this happens.\n\nYou do not actively gather a crew or capture monsters.  These events happen as you match tiles but, again, you have no strategic or tactical input.  There is no skill involved.\n\nYou can upgrade your weapon, cast magic and upgrade your board.  But ultimately there is little choice in how you do any of these things.  The game boils down to: buy the cheapest upgrade so that you can eke out a little more time in the next match 3 game and then buy the next cheapest upgrade.\n\nThe match 3 game which is the core and only gameplay of You Must Build A Boat (as there is no boat building or monster wrangling) is frustrating rather than fun.\n\nCertain enemies are weak to certain tile combinations - swords for an enemy weak against physical for example.  But the very tight timelimits left me frantically mathching anything I could in the hope that any damaging tiles - regardless of appropriateness - would fall onto the board.  There is no time to build combinations effectively and no guarantee you'll be given magic or ability tiles when needed.\n\nThis is not a thoughtful puzzle game.  The timelimits are too tight and the board too random.  If you're waiting in a station or a queue at a shop this would be a good time waster but on a PC where I am choosing to spend my time on entertainment for enjoyment; it's just frustratingly flat.","June 7, 2015","false","3.2"," 371 of 611 people (61%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","61","371","611","15","19"

So as you can imagine, I was very surprised when I played YMBAB and had a friggin blast, hours flew by and I didn't want to stop playing. The game takes all of its genres and mixes them perfectly. Mixing not only match 3 but also light RPG elements. What drives you to continue playing is the games constant reward system. You are rewarded with new crew members, gold, or expansions to your vessel. No run feels pointless, you always feel like you are accomplishing something. On top of all that you have access to a vast array of abilities to improve. This feature allows you to create a strategy and play style that is unique to each player and something you wouldn't expect in a match 3 style game. Of course the only problem I could find with YMBAB is that sometimes your attention needs to be divided with what's going on up top and continue matching. This isn't always easy and can be a little frustrating, however this is far from any kind of real problem. YMBAB is made extremely well and bug free. The pixel graphics are adorable and the music matches suit. There really isn't any reason to not check out YMBAB at a great low price of $4.99. So excuse me while I play over and over again and expand my vessel!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/6rqyZND7w2M\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","July 30, 2015","true","8.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

It is essentially more of the same, with some additional layers of complexity which help the experience feel more rounded.\n\nYou will probably not be surprised that your primary goal is to build a boat. You do this mostly by clearing dungeons, which is generally accomplished by executing a variety of match-3's in an experience that mirrors an endless runner. You'll have a variety of ways to attack your enemies, you'll gather loot, and you'll use that loot to upgrade your ship. The dungeon goals feel a little tougher this time around. While this adds a welcome level of complexity (and hoarding spells to hurl at fireball at a frozen enemy does feel mighty fine), these more complicated goals can sometimes stall your experience. There was one dungeon objective which was so poorly explained that I was stuck for at least an hour before I finally Googled to find out what I was supposed to be doing. When a similarly difficult objective came again a little later, I didn't waste as much time before looking up the answer. Still, plenty of run goals are accomplished simply by entering the dungeon and matching away. As you upgrade your weapons, spells, and shield, you'll find allies to aid your journey and your runs will become longer as you master the matching mechanics.\n\nYou Must Build a Boat suffers from being extremely repetitive. You are going to be doing the same matches again and again. You will go through dungeons that all look fairly similar and face lots of similar enemies that want to kill you. It is a grind, and while it is well-executed, you will probably not be able to play the game in one sitting. My mouse hand grew numb during more than one play session, and the visual strain of staring at the screen to discern matches can be tiring. Still, I absolutely recommend the experience for its high level of creativity and clever execution. I have always enjoyed endless runners, and this is among the best of them.","June 20, 2015","true","8.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

MUST. BUILD. A. BOAT." 11/10 transformed my dingy into a massive pirate ship pimp-my-ride style.\n\nI received this game as my second review copy (wohoo!) and was very excited to try it because I love match games – in particular, Puzzle Quest. I was very satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like match games, RPG-lite elements, grinding, and retro pixel-style graphics, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are simple and nice – the variation in monster/character sprites is decent and the amount of detail in the game is good. As you progress through the game, you will encounter new crewmembers, resulting in new rooms being added to your ship (increasing its size). Eventually, you will transform your tiny dingy into an awesome pirate ship. Whenever you complete an area, you will travel to a new one, complete with different backgrounds and “water.” The music and sounds are decent and remniscent of the old-school retro games era, however, I muted it after an hour of playing in favor of my own.\n\nControls are entirely mouse-based and very easy to learn. There is a mobile version of this game, and you will quickly notice how the game is meant to be played with a touch interface. That being said, the PC version is still very playable and fun. There is a helpful tutorial, however, I noticed that it does not seem to be skip-able – which can be a bit annoying when you start a new game again and have to go through the text dialogue multiple times. The learning curve is mostly minimal, however, will have to do a fair bit of grinding in order to progress (even if you happen to be the best match gamer in the world). Enemies become stronger as you progress, and the game continues until you are knocked off the screen – which is hastened whenever you are attacked or take time to open chests. I like this system because it is indicative of your remaining health – so at max health, you will be running at the very right end of the screen.\n\nGameplay consists of you matching various tiles (minimum of 3) while your character runs through a dungeon. Different tiles execute actions like attack (magic or physical), open locks, and shield (prevents damage and refills health – allowing your character to run further to the right). There are also brain and muscle icons, which act as a form of currency to purchase things like attack/spell upgrades and hire crewmembers. Crate tiles take up space, however, destroying them will sometimes yield useful items or spells (ex: a fireball spell that pierces all visible enemies). You get bonuses for matching more than 3 tiles, matching different tile types simultaneously, and chaining matches. Grinding plays a critical role in this game because enemies will start to do massive damage to you if you are not upgrading things like your defence (health) and attack.\n\nWhenever you start a dungeon run, you can add missions (a maximum of 3 once you invest in the ability) – each one adding to the dungeon difficulty and loot chance. Completing missions will give you resources, as well as things like new crewmembers (monsters) to recruit. Recruiting monsters will provide you with a particular bonus (ex: increased critical attack chance), and recruiting all monsters in a “set” will give you an extra bonus. Monsters that have been recruited will appear on your ship, roaming around and looking ferocious. Once you have run a specific distance, the difficulty of the dungeon will increase and you will enter the next level of the dungeon area. Completing all levels of the dungeon will allow you to progress to the next area. It is always advised to progress as soon as you can because loot rate/rarity (and monster difficulty) will increase significantly, allowing for more efficient grinding.\n\nEventually, you will encounter “traps,” which must be disarmed by matching the appropriate tile. If you fail to do this within a small window, you will activate the trap – the worse one being a freeze trap that renders all of your actions invalid until you thaw out (very easy to lose if this happens to you at later stages). Sometimes, you will find food in your play area – clicking it will refill your health substantially. Treasure chests will also increase in difficulty (requiring you to match key tiles 3 or more times), however, you can offset this by matching 4 or 5 tiles instead of the minimum 3. A nice thing about the game is how it says: You Win! whenever you get knocked off the screen. The tutorial even explains that you cannot truly “lose” the game.\n\nOnce you complete the game, you can restart in a new game+; I tried this for a short while until moving on to other things.\n\nOverall, the game plays very well, and can be extremely enjoyable if you are a fan of the match-3 genre. I got ~7 hours out of this game, and have played it into the wee hours of the morning just because I wanted to finish a stupid mission.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","July 3, 2015","true","7.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

It wants to have the feel of an older game, as one can tell by the minimalist pixel art style and the 8-bit music. Your objective: run through a temple, gather treasure while fighting monsters, and use your gold to progress upriver by... building a boat. Who knew...\n\nTo it's credit, YMBAB works well with its chosen style. Old games are, on the whole, more challenging than most new releases. And you will find that YMBAB is challenging... it will take awhile to master.\n\nAs you continue you gain crew members who make you stronger and give you a place to spend gold... you even collect monsters to help you.\n\nHowever, many players may be turned off after about an hour or two of gameplay due to repetition. Runs are essentially identical, different places are really just palette swaps, and too many times you will try to complete a quest only to just not be given the proper tiles. That's my major gripe with this game. How random things are, often times preventing you from advancing to the next area simply because the tiles won't line up right. I'm sorry, but I can't predict if a cascade will get me my mandatory 4th triple match of the run before I get pushed off screen to start over.\n\nAlso, I've noticed only two music tracks in the game: one for your boat, one for going on a run. I'm not against 8-bit music, but only two tracks is aggrevating.\n\nI have yet to reach the end of this game, and maybe I never will. Perhaps all that's there is a "GOOD JORB BUDDY" sign and a button to start again. I don't recommend YMBAB, but go ahead and play it if you want... just be aware of the grind you are about to suffer through.","July 16, 2015","false","3.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

You Must Build A Boat gets a wholehearted recommendation from me.  Gameplay is terrific.  Timed match-3 is fast paced and rewards you even when you don't succeed with your run-goals.  Actually, they say you won each run, even if you failed your objectives, because you still collect treasure, gold, etc. that comes back to your boat where different vendors you've picked up along your travels will sell you upgrades to melee & magic weapons, spells, shield and more.  The chip tune music is catchy (I could listen to it for hours-long game stints without tiring of it) and matches the game perfectly.  This game mixes luck (random tiles) with skill (your timing, choice of attack, strategy against different foes, etc) which is nice because it doesn't get boring.  The RPG elements of upgrading your equipment and run bonuses are great.  The one-step-at-a-time introduction to new gameplay mechanics, plus the simplicity makes this game easy to get into - while the "one more run!" addictive gameplay and charming music keep you playing once you start.  Lastly, I like that it's "different".  Your ship's crew looks to be made up of monsters.  You're not really told what the story is, and I think as I finish the game it will be revealed - and I'm looking forward to learning what I'm sailing towards and why I've built the boat.  I'm surprised the regular price is only $4.99.  I think they could have asked for twice this and had very few with buyer's remorse.

I enjoyed 1000000, but this game is like someone decided to draw it out as long as possible while removing half the things that made the original tolerable.  Oh right and when I beat the last quest the game softlocked.  GOOD JOB.\n\nThe drink system is absolute rubbish now, with mostly-useless effects and less flexibility- drinks last a set number of runs so once you drink one you're stuck with it for that amount of time.\nMonsters have a large variety of effects, which means for the most part there's no strategy for taking them out.  You just have to match attack tiles in general.\nUpgrades are now basically worthless for the gold they cost, and you have almost no gold income aside from quest rewards until the very end of the game!  This means you can't grind until then, and when you DO get there, you HAVE TO grind, because the last quest is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.\n\nOh right, quests.  Instead of collecting resources to unlock upgrade types, you have to do quests, which usually involve satisfying some unique action during a dungeon run.  That's generally fine, though some rely on blind luck.  However, their main purpose seems to be roadblocking upgrades.  After a certain point, the equipment upgrades all require "silver" which only drops from quest rewards until you get an upgrade near the end of the game that lets you get it from matching crate tiles.  Thus, silver restricts what upgrades you can get, which makes grinding mostly useless.  Furthermore, base stat upgrades are hard-locked to completing "monster capture" quests, so you can't grind for them at all.\n\nTake the combination of the following factors:\n1) Traps are so punishing you have to have a variety of tiles ready to match at all times, which requires luck.\n2) The RNG is streaky which means you get a lot of garbage or a lot of accidental match chains, which can either roadblock you or make progress smooth.\n3) Quest items are looted from boxes which require a lot of matches of specific tiles.\n4) The last quest item is put so deep in the dungeon you have like 10 seconds to match the required tiles.  The dungeon is pushing you back just that fast.\n5) Dungeon effects are randomly generated, but they stay the same until you complete a quest.\n6) Monsters near the end of the game take like 5 or 6 attacks to kill and have no weaknesses for the most part.\n7) Items can be stockpiled for emergencies between runs once you get the upgrade that allows it, but all items STAY IN THE GRID, GETTING IN THE WAY.\nAll these factors combined means that if you get a bad roll for your last set of dungeon effects, the final quest becomes PURE LUCK.","January 1","false","9.8"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","19","33","2","0"

You can compare it to 10,000,000 but it added some new mechanics that my draw in new players.\n\nLong review:\nNEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS (for as much as this game has any)\n\nLet me go a bit more indepth now. On the surface the gameplay between both games is exactly the same, you go in a dungeon with Explorer and do the puzzle shoving and solving with the 'match-three'-game. Meanwhile you will beat enemies, get gold and other goodies. Gold is basically used for the same thing as in the previous game, you buy upgrades with it. One thing changed in that perspective. If you played 10,000,000 you know you collected wood and stone to upgrade your shops and things like that. However in this game, you will unlock your shops through getting certain achievements in the dungeon. And you have way more shops then in the first game, also you will catch some loot like random rings and stuff. Eventually you will unlock someone you can sell that stuff to for gold.\n\nSo with the wood and stone collection gone, you have three new tiles. You have a 'Meat', 'Power' & 'Crate'-tile added to the mix of your normal staff, sword, key and shield. 'Meat' & 'Power' are basically for the best new addition to the game, namely the monster buddies. Completing objectives and achievements will unlock certain monsters, which you can eventually purchase. These monsters are basically your upgrades for certain things. Like +10 Staff Power or +10 Trap Time and stuff like that. These become very useful eventually also in later dungeons. What remains are the 'Crate'-tiles. These basically replace the item-slots you got when opening chests in the first game. Nothing special, only thing is they take up a place on your board. This can be a bit annoying when shoving around but it will help you immensly.\n\nHow about the gameplay then? Like I said it didn't chance much, they added some tweaks and turns. But on the surface it's exactly the same as 10,000,000. Only thing I like better in this game then the previous one is the fact that you have more then one dungeon. You basically travel with your boat (starting of as a simple rowing boat) down the stream and go plunder the dungeons along the way. Completed all the objectives in one dungeon, you travel on. For me personally I like this better. In 10,000,000 I usually had no problem beating the first level of the dungeon, but came across trouble beating the next levels, which essential made me put down the game. Here you can just go and keep on doing the same dungeon over and over. Ofcourse eventually you will run into higher speed and difficult enemies. But it won't block you, cause you will start on Lvl 1 of every dungeon and you will not travel futher and get more challenging objectives before you beaten the dungeon, basically serving as a watchman for your difficulty. Only downside I see to this is, that if you eventually encounter a dungeon that's to hard for you, you can't go back to the previous. I would love to have seen this to be added, but I can see why they didn't.\n\nOverall a very positive vibe from this game. It's much like 10,000,000 and if you liked that one, you more then likely are gonna like this one. If you didn't like the first one, you can always give it a shot. Because the game added enough new content to try and be an 'upgrade' from the first one.","July 17, 2015","true","3.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But You Must Build A Boat is more of a party.\n\nFor those that don't know, this may  look like a "regular" match three game, but you can complete matches by sliding columns and rows which adds more strategy to the match three gameplay. Also, the player progress through dungeons by making matches to affect the sidescrolling adventure at the top of the gamescreen and gaining materials and gold and leveling up RPG-ish elements.  And I find it much more fun than Bejeweled. It's not as in depth as Puzzle Quest 2, but again, I had more genuine fun with You Must Build A Boat.\n\nAll the extra bells and whistles in YMBAB are charming and the music is happy.

If you like hard games then this is definitely for you. This game is far harder than any other match 3+ type. There is no difficulty controls, only an option to do more than 1 mission at a time which makes it more or less difficult. Even if you do just 1 mission it can still be very hard. It does require some luck to get past. There are areas where you will suddenly need to get 3 in a row of a key and they give you about 2-3 seconds to see it and find it before you get dropped with a trap that will freeze you forcing a restart of the level.\n\nThe game does an ok job of not making it so frustrating when you fail. If you fail a level you can instantly start it over w/o waiting for any type of loading. You also will gain gold constantly during each fail. If you fail and restart right away you will notice your gold constantly builds up so you can go get stronger to help make it easier.\n\nMy only real negative is that the first several levels are very very easy and then all of a sudden after you have moved your ship about 2 times it suddenly gets about 10x more difficult. I have been stuck on this one level for a while where I keep dying within 60 seconds and feel like I am making no progress.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun challenging games. It can be very frustrating too or maybe it's just me. I am really good at these type of games, but this one leaves me feeling really stupid at times.","June 7, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game was also the first game that I played with the core gameplay being match 3. If you haven't played 10 million but you want try this one out, don't worry, that will work very well. You Must Build A Boat is a very easy game to get into even if you have never played match 3 games before. The gameplay is very repetitive, so if you don't want to be doing the same thing for around 8 hours (this is how long it took for me to beat the game) then you should look elsewehere. But if that isn't a problem then please try this game out. It's cheap, I very much like the art style and the music is fantastic. Gameplay works very smoothly and when you hit those massive combos accidentaly it truly is the most satisfying thing in the world. Really my only problem with the game is the fact that it's very VERY addictive and also when you start the game again you can't skip the tutorial. So all in all this game is absolutely brilliant for what it is and with the price tag it has you can't go wrong.","June 8, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Current stats are not displayed prior to committing to an upgrade purchase, and then only briefly.\n\nForcing me to click numerous times to "get" the upgrade I just purchased, or to break my loot out of a crate, is mindless busy work, and the exact opposite of fun.  (the swipe right to open a reward chest is... tolerable)\n\nThe screen shake when selling loot is unnecessary and awful.\n\nThe artifact that makes matches possible at the start of a run feels like a punishment, not a benefit.  More often than not, it leaves the board thin of matches.  On a related note, the Matterhorn activation is incredibly jarring; the damage hose is nice, I guess, but it disrupts whatever I was trying to do on the grid.\n\nBeing a tenth of a second off on your timing invalidates whether a match is applied.  The monsters don't have to approach formally and present a Document of Formal Request to Fisticuffs, they just start swinging... why do I?\n\nThe RNG _does_ feel super capricious.  Just beat a monster, and can see a chest behind him?  LOL, we're gonna throw keys in the right spots to wreck all your easy matches!!!  Hope you weren't planning on gaining ground anytime soon!!!  LOLOLOLOL  Two monsters in a row?  Nah, we're all out of swords and staffs... try back next week.\n\nThe area progression curve is a right angle.  In spite of all the issues above, I made steady progress until Pagoda... then I slammed into a brick wall titled "grind for upgrades, nub."\n\nThis took three years?

To start off, you dont build your boat, you instead get crew members by completing levels and they add their little part to it. Then theres the meat of the game which are the endless running sections. (already sounds fun) you match tiles and get as far as you can but no no no thats not up to you to decide, its the game. Its luck that drives the game. For an example i have to kill an enemy, so the correct thing to do would to use a spell or a sword attack. WRONG! You MAY have those three tiles and if not, say good bye to your highscore or mission you had to complete. Instead of this i would try buying Kung Fury, its free on the app store and £1 on steam, you could probrebly get more of a kick from it then this. But one reason to pick this game up is for that epic sound track. Its catchy and in a good way.

Keep in mind though that you won't be matching symbols one by one, but rather matching columns and row. Eventually it still is the same principle.\n\nIt's well made, with some RPG elements, where you can decide what sort matches will have a stronger impact. The emphasis of the game is about getting stronger, investsing in certain abilities, so you can get farther and face stronger enemies. It's not a relaxing game, as you have to be quick, but once you get a hang of it, it feels good and non-stressing. There is a story, but it is practically non-existent. It's just for the setting's sake. This game is all about the match-3 kind of puzzle.

After escaping the castle/dungeon/whatever in the original game, the protagonist now finds himself alone with two monsters on a small rowboat. The idea of the game is to enter a dungeon, complete various tasks and eventually you unlock various merchants, and capture monsters. As you acquire more merchants, your boat magically is expanded to accomodate them, thus the whole time you are building your boat.\n\nWhen you enter a dungeon, your character progresses along the top of the screen, and as he runs into monsters, and chests, and various traps, you match tiles to allow him to progress. It sounds simple, but is quite addicting, especially when you see "You Win!" every time you finish, even if you didn't complete your actual objective. That's because each time you get gold and other resources to spend to allow you to get stronger.\n\nAs for how much you get out of the game, it can come down to a matter of skill. What took me fifteen hours to do may take you less time. But for those of you die hard enough to tackle it, there's a hidden achievement you can only get by beating the game twice, and then going almost to the end a third time to acquire a hidden item. No new game plus here though, as you start over again fresh with the danger and difficulty of the dungeons raised. So yeah, even at full cost you will get your money's worth here.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

As such, I will try to tailor this review to those who haven't played 10,000,000. If you've played 10,000,000 before, then know that this game is a direct sequel that improves and expands on gameplay elements as well as replacing scoring points with plot advancement.\n\nYou Must Build A Boat is a match-3 RPG hybrid where what tiles you match decide what your character does. For example, matching sword tiles makes your character attack an enemy, and matching key tiles makes your character open locks and chests. The gameplay is controlled entirely with the mouse; select a tile with your mouse cursor, then drag it vertically or horizontally until 3 or more matching tiles align. The plot, as one could tell from the title, is to build and expand your boat to sail further down the stream. Each time you play, you'll (most likely) obtain rewards in the form of gold and resources; these things you can use to upgrade your weapons and defenses to aid you in further playthroughs. The better your boat, the harder the levels will be (i.e. stronger enemies with more health), but the rewards will be greater as well.\n\nOne thing I'd like to point out is that there isn't any way to lose in this game (as said in the tutorial), as each time you play, you keep whatever rewards you've earned during your last playthrough. You can play as many times as you want and quit anytime you want with no penalty. However, just because you can't lose doesn't mean it's easy to progress; to progress through the game, you have to meet assigned challenge tasks (i.e. Slay a certain amount of enemies) to upgrade your boat and advance to the next level.\n\nOverall, this game is simple with a very fitting retro soundtrack. I'd very highly recommend it for those who enjoy Match-3 games, or for peope who want a good game to kill time that has some plot and gameplay advancement.","February 6","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The eponymous boat is full of pixels.  They are hard to keep straight and discern where to go to upgrade equipment, and most of them are monsters that just clutter up the space.  It all doesn't fit on the screen, making it a pain to go on another run, having to click somewhere to move the screen in order to be able to click where you want.  The music is really annoying.  Success has more to do with luck than skill since many times there are traps that have to be defeated with matching items that are not on the screen.

A friend of mine gave it to me as a gift knowing I was a fan of puzzle quest and I dove right in. What I discovered was a lesson in frustration that quickly devolved into the firm opinion I wasn't having any fun. The RPG aspects, great. The music is phenominal. The gameplay itself is garbage sadly. 50% of my matches I quit and restart because RNG gave me such poor drops there's literally nothing to do but break useless objects with the hope something I need will come up, which usually doesn't. Upgrades have little impact unless I want to just grind and grind, which might be ok if I could formulate a strategey or patterns but that ugly RNG rears its head again, screwing the player over at every opportunity.\n\nLike it or not, the game replaces difficulty and tact with a classic "cheapness" factor I thought we all left alone in the dark ages of the 8 bit era and I won't be recommending this to my friends.","June 6, 2015","false","1.6"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","9","27","0","1"

This game is especially good at pulling you out of boredom, since apart from the match-3 board it also has this sidescrolling segment that you have to pay attention to. I don't usually even have to look at Bejeweled anymore and I still win, but this game wants me to pay attention. That's good, I like that a lot.

It is a Match 3 dungeon runner with RPG elements made famous by Puzzle Quest. It uses the take on match 3 where you drag a whole row or column at a time and it continues from the other side of the play area when it gets to either end. Match 3 or more of a tile and they break, filling in from above and giving an effect based on what tiles were broken. There is also a 'dungeon' above the play area that shows your little pixel dungeon runner moving forward until they encounter either a monster or a chest.\n\nChanges from 10,000,000\nGone are the locked doors from 10,000,000, but instead you will encounter little flying traps that will fly in over the top of whatever you're encountering. The trap has a tile type displayed in it which shows you what type of tile you need to break before it drops on you and also tells you what the effect will be if you don't. The traps add a bit more complexity as they force you to either deal with their effects or break them before they drop on you while still trying to deal with the monster or chest in front of you.\nAlso changed from 10,000,000 is the items which now spawn directly on the play area and you click them to use them. This can present a problem as they are essentially dead weight until you use them, but they aren't useful in every situation. You don't want to use a damage item if you're on a chest for example. Another example is certain monsters are weak, strong, or immune to certain items, so saving them for that monster or not using them when they'd have less effect is important, but you also can't match with them so they reduce the amount of available matches on the board.\nI know you're also wondering, what's up with that title? Well rather than the stark dungeon rooms of 10,000,000 you are instead gradually building a large sailing ship, though you start with a basic rowboat. The ship automatically expands as you gather more NPC's to buy upgrades from and once you've gotten all the quests done in an area you sail on to the next part of the map, which is a new dungeon.\nQuests are essentially the same. They form the backbone of progression in the game and give rewards for doing specific tasks along the way. Some quest rewards are just gold, some are key items which give other passive bonus effects, some are new NPC's, some are captured monsters (more on that in a second). The difference from 10,000,000 is that you can select how many quests you want to have for each run. Each quest you take increases the difficulty and rewards available on that run. They also sometimes come with their own modifiers to that dungeon.\nAs you progress through the dungeon levels, it will either add a modifier, or reroll an existing one if it already has 4. These can be things like chests with more locks, monsters with more HP or damage output, or even visiual effects like mist or darkness that covers the right half of the dungeon.\nThe basic NPC's are there, sword upgrades, staff upgrades, shield upgrades, potion vendor eventually. The new ones are for the replaced tile types. Wood and Stone have been replaced with Muscle and Mind. Instead of using them to unlock rooms or upgrade them, you use them to unlock small passive bonus effects in the form of captured monsters or to eventually upgrade your spells. Also since XP tiles aren't around anymore there's a vendor later that sells you those static effects for other forms of currency instead. There's even an NPC much much later that will allow you to invest gold now for a random chance of gaining more gold back after you've gone a certain distance in dungeon runs (cumulative over multiple runs). Seems like an odd choice for how late you get it, but it takes some of the grinding away potentially in the late game where stuff costs a ton of gold.\n\nOverall impressions\nThis is a pretty good sequel. No bugs that I saw, better options for audio and video this time, feels like a full PC game rather than a mobile port. There are a lot of lessons learned evident in the design of the systems and it feels mature in comparison to 10,000,00. I was able to get through the main game in a few longer play sessions with 1 or 2 shorter ones here and there between. It can be picked up and put down pretty easily and still feel like you're making progress. The game isn't super long if you're just playing through all the quests, which isn't a bad thing in my eyes. My playtime represents how long it took me (approximately) to beat the game for the first time. There is an option to reset and play through again with an increase in difficulty if you're looking for a challenge or some replay value. I did not unlock everything, but I didn't feel the urge to do so. That's not a knock against the game's appeal, it shows that you don't need to grind out every upgrade in order to win.\n\nIf you like Puzzle-quest-like games: This one is less complex in terms of RPG elements and trades turn based for frantic clicking action. If that sounds like fun, you'll get some good enjoyment from this one.\n\nIf you like Match 3 games: The RPG elements aren't too deep or complex, and the action is real time and gets a little frantic. If you can handle that, then this one is a lot of fun.","June 21, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You must build a boat.  It's a tile matching RPG/Dungeon crawler where you play as a guy who must build a boat and by matching tiles you attack, get items, and get resources to progress your quest.  You can, effectively, never lose this game as after every attempt you get a "You win!" text because you will progress, albeit sometimes slowly, towards the end goal.\n\nIt was a fun romp, I must say.  I paid $3 for the game and it took me 7 hours to complete it, partially because I'm bad at puzzle games and match style games so that didn't help, so I'd say I got my moneys worth.  It has that "One more run" feel until the final area where bad luck and RNG come into play much more so then the usual amount.\n\nMy only major complaints for this game would be sometimes the game didn't react to my mouse clicks properly and I've missed many matches because of it, which would then cascade into me losing the level.  If I could change one thing it'd be the ability to store a match I made inbetween running from critter to critter because you need to clear useless tiles on the board during your brief respites but far to often would I match tiles when approaching an enemy expecting it to go through only to have the game decide that despite me being stationary I wasn't yet "active" to attack thus wasting time and possibly losing the round.\n\nOverall though, it's a fairly enjoyable puzzle match type game that serves well as an IOS game and as a short time waster.  I'm not sure if I'd say it's great for $5 but I have no complaints at $3.","June 9, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had not played 10.000.000 so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. But what a game! Its short, only like 6 hours of gameplay with some replayability if you are the kind of person who wants to keep running over and over, harder and harder... But that does not really matter, I loved the characters, loved the concept and the idea of matching three in a row to get your hero through the various locations that the game has to offer, and I loved to see the boat getting bigger and bigger.\n\nI found it to be a very well balanced game, where the quests and the runs you have to do to complete the quests scale nicely with your ability to see the combinations on the board. I enjoyed every minute of the 6 hours I played this, even though I got stuck at some points. The random factors that occur when you replay a level keep it interesting and challenging.\n\nFor me, this is the best game I have played all year (so far..) and that for only 3€! I would have happily paid 10€ for this, it is that good.\n\nThe music is amazing but limited to two songs and I garantee you they will get stuck in your head and you will find yourself humming the tune in the supermarket when trying to race old ladies to the line at the cash register...\n\nI made a short video about the start of this game here, if you are interested:\nhttps://youtu.be/q1T32ujGEs0\n\nThis is a good game :)","June 17, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a Match 3 dungeon runner with RPG elements made famous by Puzzle Quest. It uses the take on match 3 where you drag a whole row or column at a time and it continues from the other side of the play area when it gets to either end. Match 3 or more of a tile and they break, filling in from above and giving an effect based on what tiles were broken. There is also a 'dungeon' above the play area that shows your little pixel dungeon runner moving forward until they encounter either a monster or a chest.\n\nChanges from 10,000,000\nGone are the locked doors from 10,000,000, but instead you will encounter little flying traps that will fly in over the top of whatever you're encountering. The trap has a tile type displayed in it which shows you what type of tile you need to break before it drops on you and also tells you what the effect will be if you don't. The traps add a bit more complexity as they force you to either deal with their effects or break them before they drop on you while still trying to deal with the monster or chest in front of you.\nAlso changed from 10,000,000 is the items which now spawn directly on the play area and you click them to use them. This can present a problem as they are essentially dead weight until you use them, but they aren't useful in every situation. You don't want to use a damage item if you're on a chest for example. Another example is certain monsters are weak, strong, or immune to certain items, so saving them for that monster or not using them when they'd have less effect is important, but you also can't match with them so they reduce the amount of available matches on the board.\nI know you're also wondering, what's up with that title? Well rather than the stark dungeon rooms of 10,000,000 you are instead gradually building a large sailing ship, though you start with a basic rowboat. The ship automatically expands as you gather more NPC's to buy upgrades from and once you've gotten all the quests done in an area you sail on to the next part of the map, which is a new dungeon.\nQuests are essentially the same. They form the backbone of progression in the game and give rewards for doing specific tasks along the way. Some quest rewards are just gold, some are key items which give other passive bonus effects, some are new NPC's, some are captured monsters (more on that in a second). The difference from 10,000,000 is that you can select how many quests you want to have for each run. Each quest you take increases the difficulty and rewards available on that run. They also sometimes come with their own modifiers to that dungeon.\nAs you progress through the dungeon levels, it will either add a modifier, or reroll an existing one if it already has 4. These can be things like chests with more locks, monsters with more HP or damage output, or even visiual effects like mist or darkness that covers the right half of the dungeon.\nThe basic NPC's are there, sword upgrades, staff upgrades, shield upgrades, potion vendor eventually. The new ones are for the replaced tile types. Wood and Stone have been replaced with Muscle and Mind. Instead of using them to unlock rooms or upgrade them, you use them to unlock small passive bonus effects in the form of captured monsters or to eventually upgrade your spells. Also since XP tiles aren't around anymore there's a vendor later that sells you those static effects for other forms of currency instead. There's even an NPC much much later that will allow you to invest gold now for a random chance of gaining more gold back after you've gone a certain distance in dungeon runs (cumulative over multiple runs). Seems like an odd choice for how late you get it, but it takes some of the grinding away potentially in the late game where stuff costs a ton of gold.\n\nOverall impressions\nThis is a pretty good sequel. No bugs that I saw, better options for audio and video this time, feels like a full PC game rather than a mobile port. There are a lot of lessons learned evident in the design of the systems and it feels mature in comparison to 10,000,00. I was able to get through the main game in a few longer play sessions with 1 or 2 shorter ones here and there between. It can be picked up and put down pretty easily and still feel like you're making progress. The game isn't super long if you're just playing through all the quests, which isn't a bad thing in my eyes. My playtime represents how long it took me (approximately) to beat the game for the first time. There is an option to reset and play through again with an increase in difficulty if you're looking for a challenge or some replay value. I did not unlock everything, but I didn't feel the urge to do so. That's not a knock against the game's appeal, it shows that you don't need to grind out every upgrade in order to win.\n\nIf you like Puzzle-quest-like games: This one is less complex in terms of RPG elements and trades turn based for frantic clicking action. If that sounds like fun, you'll get some good enjoyment from this one.\n\nIf you like Match 3 games: The RPG elements aren't too deep or complex, and the action is real time and gets a little frantic. If you can handle that, then this one is a lot of fun.","June 21, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I'd like to say I enjoyed "10,000,000" (the predecessor), I found the goals and progression rather slow. This game fixes that. Everything is driven by the quests for each level and it makes the progress seem do-able rather than impossible like "10,000,000". Overall, I played for 8 hours before I finished the game. I got the game for free from the very generous developer since I owned 10,000,000. I have to say I found the game addicting yet certain frustrating quests made me want to rage quit at times.\n\n4/5 Stars.

Instead of repairing a dungeon you are building a boat that will carry you and your monster buddies to freedom.\n\nWhile still in a retro 8-bit style, it feels like the graphics are a little crisper and the movement of the tiles is a little less wonky than the original.

Same match three concept.\n\nYou Must Build A Boat has more "overworld" to manage - with multiple upgrades, shops, the addition of a monster recruitement system, junk collector and rare artifact merchant. As you progress, you build your tiny dinghy into a shipworthy vessel.\n\nIt feels more rewarding to progress in YMBAB because of how you can physically see your ship becoming bigger, but I do prefer the simplistic play style of 10,000. It might also be my imagination, but this game poses a bit more of a challenge than 10,000 did. So far, I've also put more game time into it and the game seems much longer.\n\nVery difficult to screw up a game as simple as this - I can't think of a single reason not to play this game.

I bought this on sale for two or three dollars expecting something I would play for five minutes and then never touch again, but I found myself coming back to it constantly until I had beaten the game. I enjoyed it so much that I even bought it for Android so I could play it on the go. Not much replayability though, because it's tedious and rather boring to have to redo challenging quests. However, on your first playthrough, all the quests seem very challenging, but as your skill increases and you buy upgrades, they'll feel like a breeze. The soundtrack is amazing, memorable, and very catchy, but outrageously repetitive.  Would have liked new music for each area.

One of the few games where I made sure to 100% the achievements.  Going through the story mode will take ~7.5 hours, and around ~25 hours to get all the achievements.\n\nPros:\n- Lots more to do.\n- Building the boat is a more obvious form of player advancement than the counter in 10000000.\n- Plenty of hidden extras all over the place.  (Black dragon in the art gallery, for example)\n- You can always make a match, so failure is (almost) always your fault.\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes when you find a crate, you'll have none of the tiles you need on board, so you'll be frantically matching while you slide off into oblivion.  Can get frustrating at higher levels.\n- Can get frustrating when random level modifiers boost enemies in unfair ways.\n- The UX is a bit of a step back in some ways.  The game seems to have been designed for touch, and you'll often do something and be left with an item on screen with no clue that you're supposed to just click the living crap out of it.  The busywork clicking is annoying and out-of-place with the rest of the game.\n- When you restart at a higher difficulty, you have to redo the tutorial.

I Must Be Crazy For Liking It.Genre: Combination of RPG, Rogue-lite and Match-Three Elements.\nDeveloped & Published by: EightyEight Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.\nBusiness Model: Single Purchase.\nCopy Purchased by Myself, Playtime Was Mostly On Android Preamble\nI used to like mobile-centric games, back in 2013. It was a new frontier of gaming and a lot of new ideas were being used to figure out what could be done. However, I eventually became fatigued of the current running trend which is freemium everything. Freemium mechanics and business model, an extremely toxic and unenjoyable combination of ideas. It completely turned me off from trying new games for a while. It didn’t help that I felt like there weren’t any games being made for a core gamer such as myself. Games where I can sit down for more than five minutes and actually get a deeper, more challenging experience as I went along. Most of the time, the game shows its hand and I’ll get bored of it pretty quickly. A friend eventually cajoled me out of my negative attitude towards it and sharing a bunch he recommended. So, I decided to give Android another go, to look in the inner depths of the platform and find games that PC-centric gamers like myself might find interesting. It's true that You Must Build A Boat isn’t exactly a hidden gem. However, I think it’s a good starting point for me to start from. Let’s talk about building boats and killing monsters.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nYou Must Build A Boat is a combination of RPG, rogue-lite and match three mechanics. The player starts on a boat and is tasked with, well, building a much bigger boat. To accomplish this, he must run an endless procedurally generated dungeons, defeat monsters and acquire loot. Incrementally and eventually growing strong enough through capturing monsters, recruiting crewmates, finding relics and upgrading your capabilities to take on the challenges ahead. There are two phases to this game, running the dungeons and buying upgrades with the recently acquired loot. As this is a rogue-lite, the objective isn’t to “win” the dungeon, but get as far as you can and acquire as much material as possible. The RPG mechanics are in how you can upgrade your weapons, defense and spells that you can use in the dungeon. There’s a good tutorial that runs you through the various mechanics and currencies in the game.\n\nThe main portion of the game that the player will be playing in is the dungeon running. This side-scrolling endless dungeon has the player running to the right as long as they can. As soon as they get pushed off to the left, their run is done and they can either retry or return to the boat to acquire upgrades. This is the player’s health bar essentially. Each run will have an objective(s) that the player must strive to achieve. These objectives can unlock new shops on the ship, gold or power depending.  As you progress through the dungeon, there are procedurally generated enemies, chests and traps that will try to hinder your movement. You must match the appropriate tiles in order to defeat these obstacles. For enemies, this is usually matching sword or magic staff tiles to do damage. For chests, it’s key tiles. Traps and certain chests will have an icon associated to them telling the player what they must match to defeat them. Enemies won’t simply stand around and let you kill them, they’ll throw their own attacks that will knock the player farther to the left. You can match shield tiles to prevent “damage” but these must be refreshed pretty often to keep the shield up. There are three other tile sets as well: knowledge, strength and crates. Matching knowledge and strength tiles give you a currency for upgrades or recruiting “found” monsters which grant bonuses. Matching crates gives the player a chance to find items to sell or spells that can be used in the dungeon run at the player’s discretion. These spells vary from freezing spells to fireballs. While the player is running, they are constantly charging a horn spell that, when the horn is charged and the player is in danger, will clear the immediate screen of enemies. This can sometimes be a clutch play or completely wasted on a single enemy. It depends.\n\nThe general idea when you’re playing the match-three section is to have as many sword/staff/key matches available to deal with whatever obstacle you’ll run into. While the guy is running between obstacles, the player should clear the board of crate, strength and knowledge tiles as much as possible for their benefits and so they can have access to the sword/staff/key tiles. Matching four or five tiles in a row increases the potency of these tiles as well as tile multipliers that are unlocked later in the game. All the while, the player is up against a constantly changing timer due to the aforementioned “health” bar.\n\nUpgrades can be purchased to improve the player’s sword, shield, staff, spells and even dungeon runs in general. There’s a choice of three different upgrades for most of these items but generally they are all stat upgrades with some having certain effects. All upgrades are worth getting, it’s just a matter of whether you can afford them.\n\nGame Thoughts\nYou know, I rather enjoyed YMBAB. As far as mobile games go, it pushes the player to keep getting better at match-three. Since you’re up against a health bar timer where faster and better matches are constantly encouraged, it makes the player improve along with the character you’re playing as. Sometimes, runs can just be bad because you won’t get the natural matchups you need but more often than not, you can make it work. It’s about making the best of a difficult dungeon. Once I finished the campaign, I felt I had gotten enough of the experience but boy, it was a pretty darn good experience. While the upgrade/RPG mechanics aren’t exactly that deep, it at least gives you something else to think about and strive for in each run so that each subsequent run is that much better. It’s still a pretty simple experience when you get right down to it, but it’s got the right combination of mechanics, skill ceiling and ideas so that even someone like myself can enjoy it.\n\nPC Settings and Audio/Video\nGame Options:What the User Can Configure:Resolution Options: Reasonable selection.A list of resolutions limited to your max resolutionScreen Mode: Windowed/Fullscreen ModeBorderless Windowed is part of windowed mode.V-Sync, Shader Effects IncludedOn/Off ToggleParticle Count.User selected for low/med/high.Audio Options. Music & SoundAdjustable sliders.\nFinal Thoughts\nHonestly, I think You Must Build a Boat is a better experience on mobile devices. That’s not to say that the PC port is bad (it’s not). However, the mouse feels like a poor substitute for the touch-driven design. You could still play it with a mouse, but I think you’ll enjoy it more on your phone/tablet than on a PC. Still, this combination of fast-paced match-three mechanics and rogue-lite mechanics make for a fun time. And You Must Build A Boat is one that a decent amount of hidden depth for a mobile game. It keeps me interested despite its simplicity through its push to the player to keep getting better and faster at matching tiles together. So, give You Must Build A Boat a look.\n\nRead the full & unabridged review, among others, on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","April 23","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
