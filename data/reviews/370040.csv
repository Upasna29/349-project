Make sure you first play Lilly and Sasha: Curse of the Immortals before playing this one.  When you start a new game weather you import your save or start a new game there is a recap, but if you havn't played the first game it will be harder to get into.\n\nSame as the first Lilly and Sasha game.  Good story, nice well rounded combat system, and the music goes great with the game.  Thankfully the humor that made the first game such a pleasure playing through is back in this one as well.  At the time I wrote this I am about five hours in and I look forward to playing this and I hope John Wizard is able to bring the third Lilly and Sasha game onto Steam.","June 10, 2015","true","21.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","2"

Why even have the quest then?","May 30, 2015","false","1.4"," 32 of 55 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","32","55","0","0"
