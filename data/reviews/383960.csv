But with that being said, attention to detail with the map tilesets is noticable - they took time and showed care for the creation of the areas I've seen so far.\n\nCharacter designs and pixel art are of good quality (within the confines of the engine), and the characters themselves are expressive enough visually to keep a scenes mood intact. Translation quality flows well enough, though personality of the characters so far seem to lack "something" - not sure what - but they feel a bit flat. More time playing may fix that though.\n\nStandard Jrpg music, nothing obnoxious so far, but nothing amazing either. Japanese voiceacting during combat is a personal plus for me, adds alot of personality. :) Unfortunately full voiceacting outside of combat does not exist - I assume it was just too out of reach for the devs. =/\n\nGameplay reminds me of a mix of Xenogears, and Star Ocean 2. If I had a complaint - using a controller is a bit twitchy/sensitve during combat, as my 360 controllers' dpad does not work within the game, and instead I have to fiddle with the combat menu using the joystick. But that's more a personal gripe.\n\nEnjoying it up to now - it's not a fancy, next-gen game - but it has noticable, genuine effort put into it, and likeable visuals. And so far the gameplay is fun.","July 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 118 of 135 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","118","135","4","3"

I'm a fan of JRPGs in general, so I was expecting to enjoy working on this when I got the opportunity, but between the battle system and the catg-- I mean, the way I ended up really liking all of the characters, it exceeded my expectations.\n\nTo get the one big downside out of the way first, it's not all that long - I'd ballpark it as being around 7-10 hours for a playthrough that doesn't get stuck on any of the bosses, but it's hard for me to say because I had access to the game files so I knew a lot of the game's inner workings and also had to spend time checking every little thing, both of which distorted my playtime significantly. It's also fairly linear, with no real sidequests other than finding the items needed to upgrade your party's weapons.\n\nBut past that, it has a fairly unique battle system where you string attacks together using a "Cost" system - basically action points - and deal additional damage on later hits, based on both the number of attacks used, and the number of hits those attacks each dealt. Figuring out what enemies are weak to and then setting up a string of attacks that both builds up the combo meter and strings as many TP-costing "Over-Arts" as you can into the mix without using more TP than you want can be a challenge, but one the game rewards by letting you blow through enemies. Battles are pretty action-packed, especially because the game doesn't really encourage holding back - during boss fights especially, it ends up feeling like every turn is an extreme all-out attack.\n\nI also ended up really clicking with more or less all of the characters. Cram is adoracute. *nods* Also, especially if you can understand a bit of Japanese, all three of the playable characters (plus Cronos) have amazingly adorable and hilarious voice acting in combat. Even if you can't, though, the banter between the party outside of combat is really, really good and funny.\n\nSo yeah. Even if I wasn't paid to work on this game, I'd have to recommend it to JRPG fans. For people who aren't into JRPGs very much but still enjoy anime-styled games, I'd still recommend trying it, especially if their objections are more that JRPGs are long and boring, or don't involve much strategy, than that they're too complicated. (If it's that they're too complex... yeah, Planet Ruler's combat system isn't super tough, but it's significantly more in-depth than "hit the bad guy, heal when you get hurt.")","July 28, 2015","true","4.1"," 150 of 188 people (80%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","80","150","188","25","4"

Now I have honestly of all my time playing JRPGS have never played an RPG Maker game, mainly because they all really looked the same to me. But I have to say Machina of the Planet Tree really stood out for me, so I felt now that I own the game and I have played through some of it, it is deserving of a review (from someone who hardly ever does reviews haha so please bear with me).\n\nThough made from RPG Maker (not sure which I'm assuming the most recent) looks almost nothing like an RPG Maker styled game. The combat is combo based with loads of very stylized and nice looking moves. The story is so far very well done. And the character art looks like it was drawn up by a professional or a group of people who spent lots of hard work and time devolping them. Just overall a game that is currently very deserving of more recongition by the community.\n\nThis game being as well made as it is,still has that very classic and turn based styled feel to it. So if that's not your cup of tea maybe this game wouldn't be for you. I only am mentioning this because of how lost the art of turn based RPG's has become. But it's how times change of course. Anyways overall verdict...\nA game well put together using a very limited system, almost brings me to the point of being speechless haha. Well deserving of a purchase by any JRPG fan looking for a solid game.\n\nWell that's about it from me! I thank anyone who happens to read this! And of course I hope everyone is doing well and living the best they can! Happy playing my fellow gamers! :)","August 7, 2015","true","2.1"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","29","30","2","0"

Im not sure if its the type of game aimed for replayablitily. Afterthat its confusing because as its a JRPG you would expect a lot of grinding, that isnt the case.\n\nSadly controller support is bad, its always bad with rpgmaker games. it doesnt help that they force you to use arrow keys on the keyboard instead of wasd which is pretty much a standard at this point.\n\nAlso animations will surprise you, they are excellent, kudos to whoever did those.\n\nresolution is a pain, its low res at a guess 1024x768 and full screening for some people causes all sorts of issues.\n\nOverall id say its a safe buy. if you like rpgmaker games then get it, if you like anime along with its sillyness get it, if you like jrpgs then do some research first as this is a little different. Combo reminds me of early final fantasy games and that is a very good thing.","July 30, 2015","true","1.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chibitya/recommended/383960/","Chibitya","Chibitya","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chibitya/","51 products in account","Just finished this game today, and really impressed overall.\n\nThe game is around 7 to 10 hour long depending on how fast you can adapt to the combat system (which is pretty simple at first but does have some depth) and if you wanna farm for the last weapons or not (them being optional to finish the game).\n\nDifficulty is pretty well balanced, I think I wiped 3 or 4 times total, and never had to grind during the game except just before the final boss.\n\nGraphisms wise, well it's a rpg maker game, but a pretty good one : the character art is nice, the sprites go from decent to pretty cool. The maps are pretty well made with a definite attention to details.\n\nThe music is average with some cool boss themes, but they aren't too agressive and go really well with the mood. Also, the game includes fully friendly character voicing in battle, wich means you get some hype while Cram is shouting things like Gravityyy NOIREEEE and things like that. For people who aren't into that, you can still remove the corresponding files  if you want. The rest of the game isn't voiced sadly, but that goes with budget restriction probably.\n\nThe game itself is pretty straightforward, there is basically no side quest except getting new weapons, and while the story will not be remembered forever, it's pretty decent. There is some pretty good comedy in the in game skits and most of the conversations, which will remind some people of the Tales of serie.\n\nAlso, to note: a 2.0 version with some added content is to be expected, and this game is basically a test to see if people are interested in it : the studio wants to go for a big full blown rpg sequel if the players reactions are good.\n\nConclusion : you definitely wanna play this game if you like these rpg maker games in general, it's one of the best in the genre. If you like jrpg in general, you probably wanna get a look at it, the combat system and the interaction between characters are pretty good and worth a try.","July 31, 2015","true","13.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It starts out and puts you right into the action without wasting time with a "tutorial level" of sorts. It just goes in the first few fights when you begin  "Ok, this is how you do this, this, and this. Good luck!" I appreciate that, Gamers don't need their hands held.\n\nThe character animations are excellently done and the artwork is superb. The upgrade system is pretty well done and it isn't hard to understand a bit. The game is pleasantly challenging (The rare spawns and  bosses at least) and there isn't much, if any, of a grind to it to level and strengthen your characters (THANK GOD).\n\nThe music is also superb, to dynamic boss music to soothing overworld themes, complimented by interesting areas and  enemies.\n\nI cannot reccomend this game enough to anyone who is a fan of of the classic old school JRPG.

I really enjoy the battle due to the great OST and what's more important was how the battle went. First, you got to choose what needs to be done, and when you pressed Attack, the battle gameplays are similiar to Valkyrie Profile's battle with things to press and combos to build.\n\n> The art is decent and good, it's pretty rare to find a good JRPG in Steam with a good art-style and GOOD Music, it reminds me of FF7 somehow.\n\n> This is an RPGMAKER Game indeed, but developer did their job beautifully to create this game. Maps are very detail and that's what you  rarely get when playing an RPGMAKER Game. Moreover, the SPRITE of the characters are great, it's not just like what classic FF like FF1/2's sprites, the sprites here're moving and detailed enough! If you don't believe me, just see the trailer video for yourself.\n\n> I don't really get about voice actor, but I think those people are decent enough to voice act each character.\n\n\nCONS :\n> I WANT A STEAM ACHIEVEMENT PLEASE. 10/10 a GOOD GAME. Such a good game, wish they'd add steam achievements through the game.\n\n> Was it just me, or i can't seem to run the game in full-screen (CTRL+Enter), it all just went all black through the entire game except when i changed it back to windows mode.\n\n> Voice act should've been added more for the important scene / dialogue for better feels about the game. I do know Japanese, and I tend to hear the dialogue rather than reading it entirely. Still a great game.\n\n\nConclusion :\n9/10 Should buy this game. I APPROVED OF THIS GAME.\n\n","July 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

It expects you to choose attacks quickly with the combo timer on it, but it also requires you to go through this really archaic battle menu first to choose your command. It encourages you to mix up your attacks to build combo damage, but when mooks resist your attack they resist it a lot, and you can't really exploit weaknesses since using the same attack twice in a row nets you a repetition penalty and decreases your damage. There's also something really weird with mashing action oriented timed combo system with a turn based battle system that encourages you to think carefully first. The game is also unclear about who your characters target next when the mook they're attacking dies mid combo. Which can really ruin your battle.\n\n-The battle menu. Simply put, it is atrocious. It is very unclear, and there's this one submenu where ALL the commands other than Assists and Items are inside of, and it's labeled CUSTOMIZE. It has commands like RUN and CHARGE. What the bloody hell do those commands have to do with customizing?\n\n-The art. Okay so the art for the main characters are actually nice and all, but the NPCs use stock RPG Maker mugs. This makes the game feel really jarring on the eyes sometimes. Also, the backgrounds are just horrible. This is pretty much up to your tastes, but I really disliked the backgrounds, especially the world map, which just feels lazy. They're also incredibly off scale and because of that the character sprites look like they're all Pikmins. Not literally Pikmins, just sizewise. Everything looks so much bigger compared to them in the battle screen. I wouldn't complain so much but the battle screen is literally what you see for 90% of the game, and just slapping over a background like that feels really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lazy to me. Enemy sprites are also off scale, so you can have a rat that's twice as big as your guys.\n\nThose are all the issues that I had with this game. I don't know about anyone else's tastes, but these were deal breakers for me, and I'm getting a refund.\n\nThe game is competently made indeed, and it has a nice, if generic, plot and premise, but I just can't stomach the issues above. Shame though, I really wanted to like this game. I really did.","August 13, 2015","false","1.2"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","1"

I felt the love that was poured into it, but there are a few problems that just killes it for me.\n\nFirst thing that really annoyed me was that I could not change the tiny game window resolution. I have no idea what it is, but it guess its about 480p. The second thing was, that this was designed for QWERY Keyboards, this is not a big issue by itself, but if you play on a nonm QWERTY keyboard you have perform constantly finger gymnastics to hit z/y.\n\nThis game has no option menu whatsoever, so you cannot change (or review) the keybindings. If you opt for the "Partial Controller Support" option, have fun playing the "guess the button" game.\nI have a 360 Controller, by default you cannot use the D-Pad (you could fix that with some extra software, but I was to lazy to do that at this point in the game) and the analog stick is so damn twitchy that you have the precission of a neuro surgeon to get your combat combos right.\n\nThe sad part is, that I liked the setting, characters and story so far.

It's light, it moves along, and the characters are playful and comedic. Music is great, battle voices are fun and don't annoy, and monster battles are colorful and fresh. An achievement(s) for this game would be great, if added!\n\nThe only shining flaw with the game is its lack of explanation concerning the key bindings or controller.

Its a risky move as multipul people have experienced this issue and dispite questions being asked, no one has any solution or even comment on it so just be wary.  For me thou, I'd say it'd need to be better bug tested before being released to stop people from wasting money on a game that may not work at all and furthermore force them to restart their PC each time they try to play it.","July 30, 2015","false","0.0"," 7 of 36 people (19%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","19","7","36","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gvbn/recommended/383960/","gvbn","GVBN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gvbn/","444 products in account","A short and simple JRPG that will leave most gamers wanting for more.\n\nLet's get the main technical complaint out of the way first: the game runs in tiny 640x480 resolution.\n\nYour party consists of 3 characters. Cram is the main lead who, together with Cronos, serves as the warrior class of the group. There is Retla, who has a sort of cat-theme going on with her kitty hood, bell, cat tail, and what we in the trade call "Big Fat Cat Tats". She's the typical rogue of the group, with high speed and avoidance. Final member of the group is Estiole or Esty, who fits the mage role with her high magic attack.\n\nThe combat system is a mix of building up the combo counter and the standard RPG fare of exploiting enemy weaknesses. Each skill has its own "Over-Arts" version, which makes it more powerful but consumes TP upon use and doesn't restore any upon hitting the enemy. Using the same skill multiple times in a row incurs a repetition penalty. While there is some depth to the system, I found that just toggling between normal and Over-Arts version of one skill a simple and effective strategy.\n\nWhen a character's TP bar is full, they can enter "Over-Tension" mode which doubles the amount action points available, leading to very high combo and damage potential. Early in the game you might use this as a quick way to finish bosses when their HP is low, but later on the bosses' HP regeneration goes through the roof, forcing your damage dealers to enter Over-Tension as often as possible just to keep up with the regen, while others support them with TP potions and healing.\n\nBattles look great. While enemy monsters only have static sprites, player characters are smoothly animated and their flashy skills, coupled with their battle cries, look like they really pack a punch. Transition from skill to skill also looks seamless most of the time.\n\nThe characters are fully voiced during the battle and right after the battle. Unfortunately these are not translated from their original Japanese, which is a shame as the after-battle banter is often quite playful. Voice acting is high quality across the board, but Retla's voice actress in particular strikes me as talented.\n\nSome of the tunes are good, like the main battle theme and the final dungeon theme, but overall the soundtrack is all over the place. I don't mean that they're bad, just that there is quite a bit of variation to the point that they don't feel like they belong on the same soundtrack. After you finish the game, you are teleported into a music room where you can listen to the songs at leisure.\n\nThe story is hard to follow at times, thanks to "releasing network seals", "phase-space singularity", and other such etherbabble. Your journey follows the repeating pattern of "open this seal, go to this world, fight this Elite Four miniboss, fight this guardian boss". These worlds have a standard RPG theme, such as "fire world" and "ice world", with matching enemies. There are some puzzles, or at least puzzling map layouts. There are only a few NPCs in the town, as well as the inn, the workshop, and the shop. This is very much a dungeon-focused RPG.\n\nAll dungeons have excavations points scattered throughout. You can excavate these points to get restoratives and crafting components. What you get is randomized and each point can only be excavated around 6 or so times, but resting at the inn resets them. You probably won't be revisiting these areas however, as there is rarely need to grind EXP, and the crafting system as a whole is severely lacking. Often times the crafted weapons are worse than what the character would normally wear, e.g. severely cutting attack while slightly increasing agility or defense.\n\nWait, defensive weapons? That's because there is no real armor in the game. Characters have slots for weapon, armor, and accessory. Only the weapon slot has choices; your armor stays the same, and the accessory slot remains empty until the very last chapter when the one and only type of accessory appears in the shop.\n\nGame length is about 7-11 hours. There are definite shortcomings, but I think the 10 hours I spent were pleasant.","July 31, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
