This is one of this games that are easy to play but harder to master. You control a wheel, it can spin left and right or change its size. The bigger it is... the faster it falls. The strongest + in here is the levels design itself, they are unique and fun to play. There are many tricky moments also, so in order to complete them you must try different strategies (sometimes there are several ways to finish them). If you are stuck there is possibility to try different level because you can skip them. 160 levels included + additional 75 will be released soon.","June 7, 2015","true","9.6"," 66 of 73 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","66","73","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/324070/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","IntroThe sharp, minimalist visuals of iO were the first thing that caught my attention when I checked out the Steam Store page. Having seen and played tons of puzzle platformer games I was asking myself if this game would introduce me to new gameplay mechanics I hadn’t witnessed or experienced before. And while we’ve certainly seen specific parts of it before in other games it does actually give us something new, and maybe even something to get excited about.\n\nGameplayHaving debuted on Ouya (a platform that everyone was excited about when it was first showcased, but once released the interest in it took a nosedive) iO never got the attention that it initially deserved. With the PC release it might still have a hard time getting any attention at all. So many games are released every week that it’s hard to get your game promoted, especially if you’re a small game developer. And it’s especially hard if it’s a fun game as well. Let there be no doubt: this is a fun game and I hope it does well, both commercially and critically.\nThe setup is simple: get the ball to the end of the level, marked with a portal. The levels are made up of random platforms, these can be horizon and vertical, as well as diagonal. Then there are the platforms that have to be pushed out of the way and tricycles that can get you across fiery (red) platforms that will destroy your ball. Falling down or getting too high up will also destroy your ball. It’s your goal to keep the ball on or between the platforms as much as you can.\nBut it’s not as simple as getting from A to B. Like a wise man once said; it’s the journey that’s important. And that’s exactly right. That’s because the ball has to increase or decrease in size to get through specific parts of a level. And within a few minutes you’ll learn how to speed up your ball to get to higher parts of a level but you’ll also learn how to blast off so you can jump across a gap. Not only that, but you’ll also learn how to jump, which is actually quite easy once you know exactly what to do (which is usually the case with pretty much anything these days). The keyword is ‘momentum’ which means you have to time your actions. You’ll be repeating levels over and over again because 1) you didn’t know what to do, or 2) because your timing was off. It’s usually 2) that causes the retry.\nThere are 150 levels to complete and each one you complete can earn you a medal. Can, because taking too long won’t earn you anything but if can complete a level within several seconds or minutes (this, of course, depends on the level) you might be able to earn a bronze, silver or gold medal. The gold medal usually requires perfection. You might not notice this right from the start, but halfway through things can get hard and earning that gold medal might not be so easy anymore.\nThe controls are easy; a controller works best here but bringing up the menu while in-game can be troublesome. I frequently pushed B to bring up the menu, but because the game wasn’t as responsive in this area as it should be it usually took a little longer. By then I was already rotating the stick and eventually was returned to the main menu or the next level. A small nitpick but still a little flaw in my book.\n\nGraphics & AudioAs I already mentioned in the first paragraph the game uses a minimalist look, meaning everything has a basic shape and there are no backgrounds or background colors. It also uses basic, neon-like, colors like red and blue. It looks pretty in motion and the core of the ball becomes fierier the faster it goes. A little detail that doesn’t add anything to the game itself, but it surely looks cool.\nAudio-wise it’s also very minimalist with some decent background music and basic sounds.\n\nReplayabilityYou can play this game just for the bronze medals or you can try to finish them all with gold. In any case it should take around 5-7 hours for a quick ‘playthrough’ and for a thorough playthrough it will take you probably double that amount. That’s plenty of gameplay for a game with this price.\n\nClosingiO (still) is a very fun, but sometimes extremely challenging, game that mixes up the genre a tiny bit. Its gameplay mechanics are solid, as are the controls, and its visuals are beautiful and relaxing. If you like to play puzzle platformers then iO is the perfect game for you. Even newcomers to the genre should have a bloody good time with it.\nIt was a small success on Ouya, but now is the time to make it an even bigger success. Click that ‘Buy’ button, people.\n\n[Rating: 80/100]","December 5, 2014","true","4.8"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","49","56","2","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/recommended/324070/","blaxpirit","BlaXpirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/","516 products in account","Imagine a game where the character is just a ball the whole time. A ball that isn't even bouncy and can't jump. Consider how difficult it is to implement any platforming that isn't simply clunky and awkward with such a limitation.\nNow let's think about 99% of platformers. How very annoying and limited would they be if they didn't allow changing directions in midair? It is completely unrealistic, yet omnipresent.\n\nI thought about these concepts a lot, and didn't believe it was possible to make a decent game with the mentioned limitations. And yet, here we have iO, and calling it decent would be a huge understatement.\n\nSo yes, the character is a ball that can roll clockwise and CCW. You don't simply "move right"; the movement happens because of friction. The ball can also shrink and grow (changing its mass) anytime. Arbitrarily changing mass and angular momentum are the only unrealistic things here; the rest is just physics.\n\nAnd oh how fun pure physics can be...\nAs mentioned, rotating allows you to move using friction. The friction also applies to walls and ceilings, allowing you to do not-so-obvious things. Changing mass in mid-air while keeping the momentum lets you change the trajectory (launch yourself). The process of growing in size improves your grip, letting you speed up easier, or... climb some walls! Now, don't forget that you can only grow/shrink so much...\nAnd of course, we also get the more typical features of a physics-based game: There are moving platforms. You can push and interact with things in other ways using friction. Portals: speedy things comes in, speedy thing comes out... but what if the thing can change mass?\n\nThe game is almost flawless (if you overlook occasional clipping through objects in rare cases, which doesn't affect the gameplay).\nGraphics are very aesthetically pleasing. Won't talk about music, because I rolled with my own.\n\n★★★★★★★★★☆","December 18, 2014","true","16.9"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","34","35","3","3"

The game features O, a small ball which has the ability to get bigger and get smaller. By doing so you increase/decrease your mass, alowing you to gain a lot of momentum when being big, and then transforming that momentum in actual kinetic energy when your smaller. Obviously the game has way too many features for me to discuss right now, so I'll just write down the tops and tips.\n\nTops:\n-Very good graphic design for a game of this genre\n-Non-lineair gameplay, so that the game stays fun\n-Challenging\n-Good music\n-Runs very smoothly\n-Original\n-Plenty of content (150 LEVELS, HOLY SH!T!!)\n\nTips:\n-Perhaps implement a competitive leaderboard (I haven't seen yet, might have missed it) so people can compare their score to others\n-Implement multiplayer\n-A level editor would be awesome\n\nI definitely recommend you to buy the game, as far as I've seen.

Sounds simple enough on paper, in reality its pretty tricky. You can change your size and that will determine your speed and the rate at which you gain speed, and this is essential part of the gameplay - figuring out the optimal size to achieve a task. There is no time limit on the levels ( all 150 of them !!), but medals are awarded, depending on your speed of completion - the faster, the better. About that, I would love to see a timer inside the level, but maybe that's just me.\nThe controls are fine, I used keyboard - either WASD or the arrows. The ability to rebind tjem would be a plus, but I didn't feel the need for it at all. The music is abstract and fitting, the sound effects are not that much, but still reasonable.\nThere is no level progression, you can start from whatever level (out of the 150) you want. There is a trial pack of levels, that plays the role of the tutorial and introduces you to the game mechanics. After that, there are still the occasional hints inside the first few levels, but the game does not hold your hand by any stretch of the imagination. After the first few straightforward levels, you'll need time to figure out the way to complete the level, and then actually execute your plan ;) It's enough to say, the game has a key to instantly reset the level - you will use it a LOT. The trial and error is the way to complete most of the levels for the first time. I really like the steam leaderboards and the ingame medals, as there is always a way to improve with these game mechanics ( it's not set in stone thing like a "jump" - you gradually change your size and speed, so optimal size and time to switch it, is hard to determine).\nThe only thing I dislike about the game is, that it has the nerve the actually spin up all my hard drives before starting - typical for a KISS release, and really annoying in my opinion.\nWith the pretty simplistic game graphics and mechanics, a level editor will be a really nice edition to the game at a later stage, allowing the community to go nuts, but for now, I think, trying to ace the 150 levels is more than enough.\nThe huge amount of levels, steam leaderboards, steam trading cards, addictive gameplay and that price tag ... all of it leads to my wholehearted recommendation of the game!\n\nTL:DR you can check my overview video, where I complete the first level pack :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351747382\n","December 5, 2014","true","1.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","0"

It requires you to develope a good amount of skill with the basic concepts provided as you succeed in more and more of the challenges. Figuring out the puzzle of the basic layout of the level isn't the hard part here. It is more about understanding the consequences of shrinking and growing (and thus changing mass) at an instant applied to a rolling object while the rest of everyday physics is kept the same. By doing so you get a feeling of how momentum is connected to mass and how it acts on the velocity of an object. The level design incorporates these new mechanices in some surprising ways. And you can test if you truly master the mechanics by aiming for the optional medal rewards that are given for beating a stage within a time limit.\n\nUltimately I can recommend this game to all who seek a good challenge and don't get frustrated all too easily. Even for the latter kind there is an option to skip levels and return to them at later time.

The puzzles where well thought out.\n\nIt's based around a simple premise: you are a ball that can spin around it's own axis, and you can change your size (and with it your weight). For example, this allows you to go from heavy to light (so you can launch yourself) or from small to big (to hold on to the walls).\n\nThey take this one mechanism and really explore what you can do with it. It reminded me of Portal, where you basically have one mechanism, and the game is playing with that mechanism in many ways. This game does that with a size-changing ball.\n\nI feel the difficulty was good. Most levels I got before they got frustrating, but it was never easy to get a gold medal.\n\nThe graphics look good, and the game ran fast.\n\nThe only problems I had were with the controls. For one thing I never managed to get my XBOX (original) controller to play nice on linux (I haven't tried on windows).\n\nThe other problem I had only happened in 3 levels with complex manouvering while using a USB keyboard. It seemed like the controlls stopped working part way through. I got a PS2 keyboard and this stopped. I think it might be due to n-key rollover. This means those three levels could be frustrating if you are playing with a USB keyboard.\n\nBesides those three levels, I had no problem using the USB keyboard.\n\niO took a fun idea and used it well, I look forward to the developers next game.","March 31, 2015","true","6.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Like the physics based platforming and puzzle solving. The shrinking and growing mechanic was fun and inventive. Sometimes the mechanics didn't seem to work, like you are supposed to grow when going down and shrink when going up, but shrinking actually slowed me down sometimes and growing slowed me down somtimes, so more consistency could have been nice. Also greater variety in mechanics with more abilities, and different backgrounds that weren't just neon blue and had different thinks and objects in them to get around. Some levels were just annoying levels that forced you to get multiple perfect jumps or climb some vertical wall to beat it, and that was it, as opposed to doing a bunch of different things, so it required a lot of repetition. More gameplay like night sky could have been fun. Also more contraptions to drive would be nice, as the wheel one didn't seem to move as fast as it should for me rolling in it. Great that the developer is adding more levels in updates, although annoying he is just adding "impossible levels" which means they require you to be perfect a bunch and repeat things. Still it was fun, a much better version of the sh!t game called "color bind". I enjoyed it, and there are a lot of levels, although many are short. 8/10.","June 11, 2015","true","22.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

As it stands, therefore, although I finished it, I wouldn't really recommend it. I was mostly playing it while holding conversations and watching TV, so it's not like it requires desperate focus.","August 10, 2015","false","3.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","3"

To some, this may just be a very minor thing, but I am very much a completionist. level 8 of the tutorial seems insane to get gold on to me, and getting frustrated to the point of almost ragequitting in the last level of the tutorial to get gold, isn't a good sign. after this I tried some of the levels in the first level pack. It's like another tutorial. Kind of odd game design there, they put a tutorial in some of the levels after the tutorial, and they basically repeat the things they already said. I again, found myself extremely frustrated at some of the first 10 levels, if the game got much harder then that, I have no idea how anyone would really like this game that much.\nAnother issue are the controls. For me, at least, the controls feel really awkward. things like shrinking, would have been nicer if you shrunk, that the ball actually got put on the ground, but instead it shrink to the middle off the ball, which was one of the most frustrating things when dealing with level 8 of the tutorial. it was difficult just to pass that level.\nThis also isn't a puzzle game. a lot of people say it is, but it really is not.\nother then that, there are a few minor things that can get annoying, like portals not being colour-coded, or the long-♥♥♥ animation you can't skip at the end of a level.\n\nIn the trailer they mention crafty mechanics, don't expect too much crafty mechanics. I have looked in a bunch of later levels and they really don't introduce that much new things. it's pretty much just grow, shrink, and other things will do things depending on size.\n\nTL;DR needs balancing, controls bad, lots of minor problems, not really anything unique past the core concept.","July 10, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"
