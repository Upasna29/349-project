Very very few games have made me care so much about the characters within the story and Memoria hooked me in with ease. As the sequel to The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, it greatly improves upon the animations and the thought process of puzzles. However, there might be a few puzzles that will seem like complete BS to you and you wouldnt be wrong. It might require you to think outside of the box and have some determination. If you can i would recommend playing Chains of Satinav before this so you can know the background of everything.\n\nPros:\nGreat Artwork and details\nBeautiful and unpredictable story about love and adventuring\n\nCons:\nSome puzzles may take some time and frustration","November 27, 2013","true","15.9"," 59 of 62 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","59","62","0","0"

It is not only a game; it is an experience, a tale to be told over and over again! I strongly recommend playing the prequel, The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, which explains the events a year before Memoria, revealing the background story for Geron and Nuri for you to be able to grasp all heartwarming references of this game.\n\nAfter the tragic, yet beautiful ending of the previous game, we meet Geron again in Andergast. A travelling caravan is visiting the silent medieval town, hailing from Far East. Driven by the possibility that there may still be a way to turn Nuri back into a fairy, Geron visits the residing site of the caravan to ask for their wisdom. Fahi, the travelling riddler and storyteller welcomes Geron, and challenges him to solve a riddle that resides in a long forgotten tale: the tale of princess Sadja.\n\nI personally think that Memoria is Daedalic Entertaintment’s best work yet. Characters are so deep and alive, you keep carrying them with you long after you finish the series, as if you've just finished reading a good book, and wonder what to do with your life now. Aside from Geron and Nuri, our newly met characters - Sadja and the mysterious magical staff - are remarkable. The story is built so masterfully, you keep playing for hours, anticipating what shall happen next.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to grasp, hints and interactions are curiously enjoyable, puzzles are nearly always challenging. The art work is breathtaking just like the prequel, depicting different fantastic environments in a fashion that you'd wish that you are there. There are lots to discover in this game!\n\nI consider myself a hardcore adventure gamer, and I haven't been seeing a game that I can compare to old classics like Grim Fandango, The Longest Journey, Syberia or Monkey Island Series. Memoria, is no less than a modern competitor. I thought Chains of Satinav to be a glorious fairytale that should be considered a classic. In this case, Memoria is a masterpiece!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 27, 2015","true","8.6"," 55 of 61 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","55","61","0","0"

It was discribed to me as a game that didn't require having played the other games to appreciate this one.  To an extent, that is true, but the game feels a bit overwhelming when you havent played the other games. The game has some expectations, espectially in regards to it's puzzles. They are logic puzzles, and they are a bit outside of normal adventure game logic of one item for one interaction. Other traits common to adventure games, such as randomly rubbing everything against everything else is still in-tact.\n\nI would recommend playing the other games before jumping into this one, but if you can't be asked, then jumping into this game alone is possible. Half of the story is underwhelming (i.e the part where you play as garron). it has a few moments, some tense, some funny, some that are actually a bit scary, but not enough to say it's anything other than passable. The other half (where you play as Sadja) are a real treat. Sadja is a female heroine who is actually a well\n-rounded, well-developed character. For me, the game was worth it for her involvement alone, it was that good. The normal tedium of adventure games, the obtuse puzzling, the sometimes uncooperative interface, and the weird logic, were worth it just for Sadja's story. Adventure games don't do gameplay well, and this one really isn't different in that regard, but it tells a fantastic story with a damn good ending. I had goosebumbs at the end, despite the fact that i was a bit frustrated with the game at that point. It really mad the game worth it, rapped everything up nicely and made me happy that I owned the game.\n\nThe art in this game is fantastic. It has a Pastel feel to it. Lots of softer colors, blurred lines, and a really earthy beauty to it. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The sound design wasn't bad, nothing offensive, but no tunes i find myself whistling. And the voice acting is hit and miss. Sadja's voice acting is usually very good, Garons is passible, and everyone else is up for grabs (some good, some Laughably bad). The dialogue and writing are better then most, and the world being build is actually an interesting one, which makes me interested in the other games or possible sequals.\n\nThe game definitly has some negative points, such as towards the end. i won't spoil, but a character's personality change will leave some with a feeling of whiplash. It wasn't bad, just unexpected and definitly a bit sad. It felt a little forced, and didn't compare well to the rest of the character development that had happened thus far.\n\nAll in all, the game is good. It's an adventure game in an older style. Still has some of the same niggles as older adventure titles, but still tells its story well enough. It's beautiful, has some wonderful characters, and a deep enough world to make it something people can dive into if it's their thing. If you liked older adventure titles like Monkey island, and want something a bit more centered around drama as opposed to comedy, then this game is worth a look-see. If your more into The Walking Dead style of adventure games, you may feel a bit disappointed. If adventure games arn't your thing, skip it or get it on sale.","December 19, 2013","true","8.6"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","37","38","0","0"

Sitting to the game I had some expectations about the overall course of it, and involved mechanics. I was somewhat uneasy about announced introduction of another main character – Princess Sadja, but overall I did not expected any drastic changes between “Memoria” and its predecessor.\n\nTo my surprise however, after just a couple of minutes I had to completely abandon all these previous assumptions, and for the benefit of the game that is ! Not only all the strong points of  “Chains of Satinav” were still present – with its stunning music, beautifully hand-painted backgrounds and complete, detailed voice-over, but also, to my content “Memoria” introduced a handful of new ideas making the game even better !\n\nIn ‘Memoria’, contrary to the previous game, we follow two seemingly separate stories. One starts right after the events of the previous game, which left Nuri, a former fairy and Geron’s girlfriend, turned into a Raven, and the featuring Princess Sadja, a heroine from over 450 years ago, whose footsteps we’ll have to follow. The narrative is written perfectly, telling us the truly moving story, full of surprising events, magic and sacrifice. The characters are likeable, interesting, and their motivations are truly believable.\n\nThe main flaw of “TDE: Chains of Satinav’s” gameplay were its puzzles, which although solid and logical, turned out to be quite simple, and after a while may have felt a bit repetitive. In “Memoria” this problem is nonexistent, ‘cause almost each of game’s many brilliant puzzles feels unique. All that thanks to an improved magic mechanic, greatly augmented in comparison to “Chains of Satinav”, with both spells variety increasing, and their impact on puzzle solving changing dramatically. Now we are allowed to choose from much larger diversity of powers than before, each coming with a distinct applications.\n\nSumming up, I have to admit that “Memoria” has left me speechless, and after finishing it, I won’t hesitate saying that this jewel should be counted among best adventure games of the last decade. Both plotline and the puzzle design in this game are as close to perfection as I’d dare to ask, and above that we are once again pleased with astonishing aesthetics known from the previous game in the series.\n\nI’d strongly recommend this game not only to those who enjoy this particular genere, but also to anyone who has even the slightest liking to a top grade fantasy tales !\n\nPros:\n-	Deep and intriguing plotline with two entangled keynotes.\n-	Huge amount of witty puzzles.\n-	Unique magic mechanics.\n-	Beautiful soundtrack perfectly fitting the story !\n-	Sequel to “Chains of Satinav”\n-	Set in a vast fantasy setting of ‘Dark Eye’\n\nCons:\n-	Boxed “Collectors Edition” available only in Germany","December 26, 2013","true","18.6"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

When I sat through the ending credits of this one, I was just blown away by the cleverness of the plot and particularly its ending.\n\nWorld Setting:\nI guess that most gamers know all the "usual" fantasy elements well - magic, dragons etc. but the world of this game presents such original ideas that it really feels special and more deep than other fantasy worlds.\nI won't spoil it, I'll just say that in this game artifacts and spells do original and interesting things, that we just don't see in other games.\n\nAs for the quality of other elements of the game:\n- Graphics and Soundtrack: Beautiful as you would expect from Daedalic Entertainment.\n- Puzzles: I think that most of the puzzles were great and fun. There were only a few that I found to be awkward, but still most are great.\n- Voice Acting: Good but certainly not the strong side of this game, although it shouldn't drive you away from it.\n\nAnd lastly, just note that this game is a sequel to The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, which is also a great game. You can't just play Memoria without playing Chains of Satinav first.\nLuckily, it's another great game, and playing through both of them will give you a great journey.","October 17, 2014","true","7.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

I absolutely loved it, and got so into the game, I wound up playing it much, much later than I intended because I just had to know what happened next.\n\nPros:\n- great music, which had me searching for a download after I finished the game. "Nothing is ever Lost" actually made me well up. Epically beautiful music for an epic game.\n- as in CoS, Memoria is full of even more beautiful art. The city of Drakonia is especially a standout, looking like something that even Tolkien would find enchanting. It seems more polished and detailed than CoS was as well-- with fog and lighting and shadows.\n- The story, writing, and dialogue are all much better! The story was so engaging I lost track of time, especially when playing as Sadja and her staff. In fact, I found the two of them to be much more interesting and fun to play as than Geron and Nuri. The dialogue felt more natural to the characters as well. I actually teared up a few times during the story and would occasionally find myself gasping in shock or giggling at a joke. Again, the detail to the rules and background of the game universe is absolutely wonderful. While this is a relatively new world in comparison to The Lord of the Rings and The Elder Scrolls, I still feel that a comparison is deserved. The universe feels real and complete and it's obvious the developers put a lot of thought into it (I only wish we learn more-- they should add "books" like in TES, so we can read more if we like).\n- The voice acting! In my review for CoS, I mentioned this a con, with Geron and Nuri using inappropriate intonations or coming off monotone, or strangely whispering at times it wasn't appropriate (such as when yelling... yeah). Those problems are no longer present in Memoria. This may be because the story switches between Geron and Nuri to Sadja and the staff, meaning less of a chance for me to be annoying with Geron and Nuri. The addition of Bryda was welcome as well. The stand out, however, is the staff. I was wanting to play more often as Sadja and the staff primarily because of him-- excellent VA work there.\n- The puzzles were a lot more fun this time. It's very similar to CoS, but it felt more intuitive, even during those times I would get a bit lost. Speaking to everyone as much as you can is a must, as it'll only help you to put the puzzles together. I didn't find myself "pixel hunting" so much, as it seemed more obvious what could/couldn't be clicked. The best part though was the increased use of magic in puzzle-solving. With both Geron and Sadja, you get the use of more (and fun) spells. Sadja's especially were a joy to play with :)\n\nCons:\n- Performance issues AGAIN. My computer far exceeds the recommended requirements and yet, when I play for more than an hour, noticeable lag and long loading times start to appear. Play for more than several hours and the game becomes near unplayable and requires being restarted.\n- Animations are poor and poorly synced. For such a beautiful game, the animations are embarassing. Sometimes the characters mouths don't move, sometimes their mouths don't start moving until they've been talking for a while. Most of the quality animation seems to have gone into Sadja's glorious ponytail. It's very strange and a bit jarring once you get into the game.\n\nTips:\n- make at least 2-3 saves per chapter, as there are different ways to complete quests and different choices to make, not to mention some fun/silly random achievements (the very first silly achievement, which can be had in the 2nd chapter when Geron first meets Fahi, actually made me laugh out loud). It'll be easier to experience all of this with several saves per chapter, and there are more than enough save slots for it.\n- Really, talk to absolutely everybody you can, exhaust all their dialogue options. Some puzzles will leave you completely lost if you don't!\n\nIn all, I can't recommend this game enough. It's earn a spot on my list of best, and favorite, point-and-click games. I bought it while it was on sale for ~$5 and got more than my monies worth for sure.","December 14, 2014","true","10.6"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","5"

And that really shines through, by the end of the story.\n\nNot to mention, it's really super to have characters who have their non-white cultural roots clear to be seen in their personalities and actions, while not falling into roles reflecting exoticism.

While it started a bit slow and seemingly about two separate groups of individuals from different times, but it didn't take long to get me engrossed in the story and characters. I played the whole thing in one sitting - I just had to know what happened next.\n\nThis is a tragic love story at it's heart, and yes, I cried. You should probably play Chains of Satinav first for the backstory of Geron the bird catcher and Nuri the fairy, but you won't miss anything in terms of plot if you were to start with this one as it tells a separate story.\n\nIf you like point & click adventure games and are after something a bit serious I highly recommend this and Chains of Satinav, and I hold these in much higher regard than some of Daedalic's other works (perhaps it's just me, but I couldn't stand the protagonist in Deponia and I felt that the characters in The Whispered World just fell flat).\n\nThese games have also got me interested in exploring The Dark Eye universe further, which is a role-playing game from Germany along the lines of Dungeons and Dragons.","December 7, 2014","true","9.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/243200/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","Great game.\n\nGreat story, great art, great characters, great voice acting. I was sad to see the game end. It's of proper length and it has a satisfying ending and I hope it will get a sequel because I got attached to the main characters and would love to see (and hear) them again.\n\nIt has varying forms of puzzling which never bored or frustrated me. I glanced at a walkthrough a few times to hasten a few things up which I didn't get right too soon, but I believe everything is solveable perfectly fine if one isn't in a hurry and maybe uses a pen and paper to sort some stuff.\n´\nA good thing: Throughout most parts of the game you can press a button to have things you can interact with in the world get highlighted. It helps those who don't want to look for "hidden items". It's not mandatory so those who love getting their full classic adventuring way can have it just as well. There is also a "combination helper" that, when enabled, puts a glow on your cursor when you hover with one item over another or over a spot in the world which it interacts with (though it seems towards the end it is sometimes isn't working fully either, intentionally or by accident).\n\nThe story could have some logic loopholes, but I need to think some details over because things can get convoluted with various characters looking differently at events throughout different timelines and sharing their (un)knowing amongst each other.\n\nA downer: The English text and English voice acting aren't always aligning. Sometimes something is said but something else is written. In a few instances I had text or voice lines appear from previous scenes that made absolutely no sense in the scenes I was in at the time. One line (well, it was just one word, but still) was skipped away quickly even though I didn't press any button at all. There is a background journey "log" of sort you can look up and I noticed one text part not existing at all in the English version (it isn't just lacking translation - it's really simply missing, you get an empty subwindow when you try to read it in English language). These things don't happen too often, but they aren't exactly rare either.\n\nHowever it's possible the English voice acting is better than than the native one. I played the game in English because I'm used to that but glanced at the German version because the developers are from Germany: It's by no length bad but in direct, short comparison I liked some important characters better English voiced. But I could be biased because, as I said, I played it mostly in English.\n\nI noticed a specific scene that has significantly deviating English lines. The basic idea is still there, but there are some implications which are more direct in the German version. Could be that it's different in English because these are sexual implications. I hope the English version didn't shy away from the German original too often like this because as much as I like this game I don't think I'm gonna replay it in German anytime soon.\n\nAlso, that journey log - it looks kinda nice, but it's not very handy to use. It's a wall of images that get added over the course of your journey with some logical lines connecting to the images back and forth. You click on these images and lines and get some info on what happened (which is appreciated because the story can be confusing at times). However some parts of this image wall one may look over accidently because there aren't always clear cuts between the images and connecting lines.\n\nIt won't hurt to know the prequel "Chains of Satinav". The title "Memoria" is unfortunate as it should be "The Dark Eye 2: Memoria" to make clear that things happened before. This is an independent story, but one of the main characters and his female companion clearly had a long journey of their own before this, there are some references to events that happened back then one may understand and relate to better when having played the prequel first. I can't tell right now because I haven't played Chains of Satinav yet. The English voice acting is very great at showing that these two feel a lot for each other and went through a lot together, though, so it could be very well a positive aspect because it wants me to play Chains of Satinav soon.","May 10, 2015","true","30.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

It's not often that a sequel to a good game is even better than the original, but it is certainly the case here.\n\nThe story is just as intriguing as the first game's, if not more so.

Geron's story is told in present day, while Sadja's is recounted through flashbacks. Aside from solving puzzles the usual way by using objects with one another, you also sometimes have various magic skills at your disposal. This game is supposed to be a prequel/sequel to another earlier game, but I didn't play that one and found no problems at all following this one, nor did it affect my enjoyment/appreciation of the story.\n\nThe Good- Very long game (took me several days to complete, including the time taken to deliberate over puzzles)\n- Super value for money (cost ~$1+ as part of a Daedalic game bundle offer)\n- Gorgeous, breathtaking painted graphics\n- Lots of different worlds/environments to explore\n- Fully voiced + good voice acting\n- Pleasant music + ambient sound\n- High quality game + solid production values\n- Fantastic, meaty, epic story\n- Some choice (in how the story branches) towards the end of the game\n- Interesting, well-developed characters\n- Many well done puzzles (logical yet required some thinking and not so straightforward)\n- Animated cutscenes at certain points in the game\n- Tons of achievements\n- Proper ending + makes you think\n\nThe Bad- Subtitles sometimes buggy (voice says something completely different from text)\n- A few buggy areas (e.g. you can click on something that technically isn't there in the ore adept's room)\n- Complete guesswork needed on some puzzles, especially those that required the use of visions\n- "Save game" feature needs a bit of refinement (the procedure is rather counter-intuitive)\n\nVerdictA truly epic game in terms of story and delivery. The many subplots and story branches kept things fresh and engaging. Puzzles were also quite ingenious for the most part. There were a few bugs but none affected gameplay. A must-play if you love point-n-click adventure games with a hint of romance and fantasy.","May 13","true","24.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

Stories within stories and their authors inside them are common themes in various metafictional novels and films but have not appeared very often in games. Memoria builds an interesting, labyrinthian tale from themes of imagination, memory and myth that pleases the senses as well as the mind.\n\nMemoria picks up where Chains of Satinav left off, with the bird-catcher Geron once again leading the cast. Since playing the previous title is all but necessary I will not discuss any plot details from either. As a general description it can be said that the story takes place in two completely different times and places and accordingly on two different levels which mix in various interesting ways as events unfold. Unfortunately the story inside the main story, the one detailing Sadja, a princess in an Arabian-like kingdom, begins on the wrong foot. I have rarely seen a more cold-blooded and merciless exposition beginning to a story as the one for Sadja. To make things even worse her quest is a rather abstract one making it difficult to become immediately involved. Sadja herself is odd company: ambitious to the brink of ruthlessness with an odd sense of a grand fate awaiting her. As such she is as unusual creative choice but in the end does fit into the overall themes and design.\n\nThe writing in general is more concerned with the whole than the parts which I found pleasing. There are no quotable one-liners nor amusing banter but given the fairytale surroundings this austerity may indeed be better than any rhetorical flower arrangements. The somewhat weak beginning is the only major flaw and offset by the very impressive ending. The many layers of mythology logic seen throughout the story are also unusual and take the place of any everyday realism. In this case the high fantasy works since the whole is kept to an economical length are there are no larger-than-life emotional outbursts.\n\nWhile the writing takes some time to draw the player in this cannot be said from the sensory stimulation. The hand-drawn environments are both lucid and vivid and could not have been done better. One of the key strengths with Chains of Satinav was the bittersweet orchestral soundtrack and while Memoria does not reach the same heights it does an admirable job of setting the mood. A true weakness in the presentation are once again the animations. Slight ruggedness during adventures is somewhat easy to ignore but becomes difficult indeed during moments of dialogue. When the only part of the face moving is the mouth the effect is jarring to say the least.\n\nAs the puzzles require fantasy logic to solve some of them may be problematic but I did not see any insurmountable ones. The number of items, hotspots and screens needed for a major puzzle are kept to reasonable limits. The game also has a questlog to remind you of the current task as well as lore reminders of the things you have learned. Should you lose hope on a puzzle there is even a hint system for the desperate. Chains of Satinav introduced limited spellcasting into the otherwise traditional pointing-and-clicking. Geron only had one ability at his disposal in that game but now he has two in addition to Sadja's three. Not all of these are used very much so some editing could have been useful but on the other hand this system lessens the clunky "bottomless pockets" inventory-based problems of many other adventure games.\n\nMemoria's ultimate strength is perhaps a strong sense of identity. The developers did their very best with the indie resources available and cleary love the genre and the game as much as the adventure game audience does. Memoria will not conquer the world any more than any other contemporary adventure will but for those willing to appreciate its quiet appeal there is much pleasure to be discovered within these ten hours.","June 6, 2014","true","10.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

This game is fantastic; it retains that epic, big quality that Chains of Satinav had. While I do love this game, I have one personal nitpick...Lets get it out of the way before I gush my love.\nIn the prequel, we follow Geron and Nuri. I fell in love with these characters, and although the ending was bittersweet, I would have been content had it ended there. However, we see them in Memoria, as Geron is hoping to change Nuri back to her original form. This goal leads him to learn about Sadja, who is the heroine that Memoria centers around. Sadja is an amazing heroine and her story is incredible. The more I learned about Sadja and her quest, Geron and Nuri's quest seemed less significant, so by the time it was time to settle the ending for Geron and Nuri, I wasn't as enthused as I knew I should be. I quickly resolved their story, just so I could see what happened to Sadja, because that was who I really cared about in THIS game. Now all the good stuff, and there's alot.\nJust like Chains of Satinav, it is gorgeous. It's more of the beautifully hand-drawn backgrounds and characters that we love. The cutscenes are also breathtaking. The look of this game gives it that epic feel. The voice acting is superb. The soundtrack blends itself perfectly to the look of the game, bringing tears to my eyes in places.\nThe characters are well done, but the ones that stick out are Sadja and her magical staff. These two make the game. Sadja is everything one would want in a good heroine. She is strong, resolved, caring, feisty, and dramatic. Her magical staff is a perfect balance for her: witty, supportive, concerned, and loyal. I have never rooted so hard for a princess to end up with an enchanted object. They are a perfect team, and the love and loyalty they share is felt and is truly the heart of this game. Seriously, the ending had me in tears.\nAs far as mechanics go, it is a standard P&C, with some interesting twists. Like in Chains of Satinav, you can perform magic. There are 4 spells you learn and will use throughout the game. The puzzles are fairly standard. Some are a tad difficult, but the game gives all the facts you need in order to solve them.\nI am so glad that I played this game. I know there will be another play through in the future. The story, the look, and above all, Sadja and her magical staff are the reasons this will become a classic.","March 13","true","12.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It is divided into two timelines: in one Geron (the protagonist from the previous game) is trying to change back his love to the way she used to be; and in the other we follow Sadja, a young woman who lived 450 years ago and tried to make her name immortal. They share a common mystery that is built with excellent pace, making you involved in the story more and more. And the solution/resolution is just perfect. It is not a happy ending, nor a sad one. It is bittersweet… it is surprising; it is everything a story needs.\nIt also helps that the voice acting is significantly better than previously. All actors (but one) had great investment in their characters and gave a new emotional layer to the story.\n\nSadly, the gameplay doesn’t reflect the greatness of the writing. The puzzles start mild, just the usual nonsensical adventure game logic. Then they threw in a forest maze (Broken Sword 2 style). After that, a long series of multi-guess combination puzzles, where figuring out the exact order of the right answers can take forever.\nTherefore, Memoria can be either a short 4-5 hour adventure or a 30+ hour one if you are unlucky with your guesses. And this can kill the mood really fast… even though this game could have been Daedelic Entertainment’s greatest masterpiece otherwise.","June 22, 2015","true","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The characters are diverse, well written and easily likable, and the voice acting is top notch. Once again Daedalic has produced an extremely beautiful, immersive point and click adventure with a wonderful new help system which is neither too vague, nor too obvious.\n\nIt explores the themes of both an established relationship and a growing one, and the building of trust between two souls. The writing of the story and the characters is so incredible that you end up finding a magical staff endearing, and there are amusing little quips and innuendos that had me in laughter. The feeling of different cultures and traditions is a really nice touch and it's a breath of fresh air to see that not every character is white. It's lovely to see a female protaginist willful and sure of herself and her beliefs, yet with a tender and forgiving side which allows Daedalic's ability to present incredible character depth to shine through.\n\nIt's honestly impressive that a game made by indie developers can be as complex and beautiful as Memoria is, and at times I have to remind myself that it was made my such a company.

It even brought me close to tears at the end. Oh, Sharisad...\nThe puzzles......... most were rather logical, but some were eye-rollingly silly, designed only to have you trying random stuff.

It carried out really well\n- Narratives were entertaining.

I would highly recommend to any fans of the point & click genre of adventure games.\n\nSound, music, and voice acting are all top-notch.  Voice acting is especially good compared to many games where the actors substitute hamminess and melodrama for a true-sounding, emotional dialogue.\n\nThe art is very nicely done, with some really breathtaking backdrops and good character design.\n\nThe plot weaves together two separate stories into a really compelling narrative that is very original.  With so many games, books, and movies out there, it's hard to find a story that's truly unique, but Memoria does a very good job, especially with Sadja's story.  There are two possible endings to Garon and Nuri's story, and at least for me, having finished both endings, it was a VERY difficult choice to make between the two.  Although I admit that I'm a sap at the best of times, it's unusual for a game to make me feel so much of an emotional investment in every main character.\n\nSo all in all, this game is well worth it.  I do recommend playing the first game, Chains of Satinav, before this one, else you lose an important part of Garon and Nuri's backstory.  It's not required to play Chains first, but it will enhance the experient (and Chains of Satinav is quite a good game as well, if not as intricate as Memoria).

I was very happy to catch it on sale. What I would say though is that I sincerely wish that it had clearer display towards the top of the store page that told how the game was a Sequal. With the title what it is there's no easy way to tell it is a sequel as there is no number,  nor is there a specific statement in the trailer that says it is the sequel. It mentions the first game in the trailer but it lists it as another game the creators made not specifically that it was connected to this one. It definitely is something that is going to have me triple checking games to see if they are the first game or not now.\n\nAside from this I am genuinely pretty happy about the game. The art, the way the story is told, the music. They all come together beautifully in a way that has me wanting more. I had to look up how many chapters there were within game so to try to keep myself from finishing it too fast. There were several times here and there I was stuck in ways I didn't feel I should have been however. I could tell generally what the overall goal was of what I needed to do even when there wasn't too clear of instruction, but because of how items and surroundings lacked sufficient information I was unable to easily decipher what to link together. Without, as the character would say, 'Random Guess Work.' One place in particular in game was irritating to no bounds for the way one would be constantly reprimanded for making a tiny mistake in a way that made it feel as though there was absolutely nothing one could do. Three characters in the same area, two shouting the third's name so repeatedly that I sincerely think I will never be happy to hear it ever again despite it originally being what I thought was a great name choice.\n\nOverall I'd say it's worth it on sale or not on sale if you like a colorful tale told in a way that makes you feel thoroughly immersed for the way you help to forge the story itself. I would also add despite being disappointed I accidentally played a sequal game before the prequel, this game could be played without the other for how it is an amazing story all on it's own.","February 2","true","16.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Amazing story, artwork and music, I played it in one setting and forgot to save in between so I have all the cutscenes and no savefiles haha. I've never been more enchanted, more captivated by an animated story than this one, I was so intensely drawn to everything that happened that I couldn't help physically reacting to it haha. I wish I could forget it all and play it all over again. I don't know what I expected when I bought it but it wasn't this. The story is intruiging, the mysteries are actually puzzling and captivating, the sound (music and voice acting) is breathtaking and the characterization is stunning. The switching perspectives between Geron and Sadja as Geron tries to uncover her story really add to the mystery and to the player's curiosity. The staff has an enarmoring personality of its own and its interactions with Sadja throughout the story are original, believable and really touching. I don't know what else I can say to make you play this without giving the story away (I went into it completely unspoiled and due to the 'riddle' status of the story I would recommend you not to spoil anything for yourself, there will be so many reveals throughout the story and you want to experience them all truthfully).

In my opinion, I would highly recommend playing CoS first.  While most of the story in Memoria is new, it is framed by the story/characters coming from CoS.  In the least, you will feel more invested in those characters while playing Memoria, which enhances the experience.\n\nI don't discuss plots in reviews much, but will say that Memoria is two stories in one. The first being a continuation of CoS that frames the story within the story.  The second story is a tale of a young princess who lived 400 or so years in the past.\n\nThe dual story device here is both a blesssing and a burden in an otherwise very good game.  You get to continue to play with characters from CoS that you care about and are invested in, while learning their fates.   Yet, that part of the story feels a bit short and unsatisfying as probably most fans of the first game would like.  The other tale though is very good with some very solid adventure type gameplay.\n\nAgain, following from my CoS review, the art style, voice acting and music are all excellent.  The art style here seems a bit more refined/modern than the more painted feel of CoS, but is no less great.  I found the puzzles in the game to be generally harder than CoS, with a good many being quite unintuitive.  There are some real stretches here.  I have to admit that my lack of patience caused me to peak in at a walkthrough at least 2 or 3 times to get moving.  But overall still very enjoyable.\n\nThe story and adventures of Sadja - in the inner tale from the past - is really very nice and satifying from begining to end.   The framing tale of Geron and Nuri, while solid, felt a bit less so, but it is still very good and marries nicely with the other tale.  If you've played CoS I think you will understand what I mean, but just don't want to comment on that directly in the review so as not to impact the objectively of a new player experiencing the game.\n\nA very solid companion piece to Chains of Satinav,  with the combined two games providing plenty of hours of strong adventure type gameplay and story telling.  Certianly a must for fans of the genre.  I hope we one day see more games to continue the main characters stories.","January 4","true","19.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I found it to be more enjoyable than the first game as well. Thus, it has become my favorite point-and-click adventure game now.\n\nThe game sort of has two main characters. Geron is definitely the primary main character, as he was in the first game. However, for practically half of the game, another character is in control. The player goes through the dream memories about a woman named Sadja. I'm glad that the developers made those dreams playable, instead of cutscenes. The story of Sadja definitely makes the game more interesting, and can keep the player wondering about how she is connected to the events of the present.\nSpoiler comment: I'm really glad that it didn't have a happily ever after ending (again). I guess one could imagine that Geron and Nuri could have that if she was changed back and  eventually remembered who she is, but it seems unlikely.\n\nThe graphics improved from the first game. I didn't encounter any glitches with this one either. No typos. Good job on the technical stuff.","January 3, 2015","true","32.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Geron the bird catcher (and ameteur magician) lives with his step father who is trying to figure out the huge influx of ravens that have appeared recently.\n\nThe city is eventually overrun by dark magic and the ravens kill people and/or haunt their dreams. With his newfound joyfull fairy friend, Nuri. Geron leaves the city only to realize the lies he has to tell her when he finds the solution for the dark magic.\n\n(Memoria)\nWhen the story ended in Chains of Satinav, Geron continues to look for a way to regain what he lost. And the key to that; is a riddle: As the stone over the scarab, so rules the scarab over the stone. Simple, am I right? If only. The riddle is solved by following the memories and observations of Sadja, a "princess" of a lost kingdom. But nothing is lost if her story ends the right way, and that is why Geron and the helpful magician Bryda must do everything to find the ending.\n\nA puzzle game  that has the soul and heart of Daedelic Entertainment. The puzzles are alluring and logical (Especially if you have a walktrough!). The characters are loveable and I will remember them for a long time (God damn it Nuri, why do I love you so)\nThe scenery is beautiful and very detailed which is what I feel adds a lot to the game.\nFor some reason Geron, the main character, is very unique. He is very quiet and nobody (except Nuri) really likes at all. The story itself flows naturally and I did not feel as if the story ended abruptly (If a bit sad perhaps)\nThere are moments where the audio or the screens screwed up a bit but such minor issues are not written in the Book of Time anyways!\n\n10/10 - Satinav is an edgy c.unt and you know it!

There were major mis-matches at a couple (non plot crucial) points. Also there was suddenly German or Dutch audio during one of the search the wood scenes.\n\nThat's genuinely my only complaint in this otherwise solid game.","August 26, 2015","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I feel like I missed out on some backstory, but I did get a good grasp of the story in Memoria without having played Chains. I expect though, that for a fuller experience it should be played after the prequel.\n\nAnyway, still a very nice game. I really liked the painted look artstyle, the characters and landscapes all look good. The voiceacting is pretty good; but it annoyed me that several characters sounded so similar; I assume its by the same voice actor, but he could at least tried some variations. At one point the colour of the text in the subtitle is the only way I exstinguished two of the characters. It's not a huge problem though, as these same voice characters almost never appear at the same time.\n\nI really liked the story, playing one character who has dreams and visions about another character, each with same style point&click world to go through. The game is mostly playable without a guide, I only had to check a couple of things for achievements iirc. Some achievements are obtained through just plying through the story, some are harder to find. If you mess around with the puzzles too much you get the filthy-casual-option of skipping it.\n\nI enjoyed the puzzles and spell usage throughout the game and look forward to the sale of the prequel.

X)\n\nPlaying Chains of Satinav is critical if you would like to get the most out of this game. It tells of Geron and Nuri's treacherous journey that eventually led to the circumstances that start off Memoria. Honestly, I think I would not be giving Memoria such a strong review if I hadn't played the prequel. The game frequently references its predecessor (inside jokes), and Geron/ Nuri's entire half of the game seems out of place and confusing without proper context. Not to mention, most of Geron/Nuri's characterization is done in Chains of Satinav, and players can have a deeper understanding of their actions in Memoria if they know their personalities. Even so, and I do acknowledge that this is one of the biggest flaws of the game for me plotwise, is that while one enriches their experience through enlightening themselves with Geron/Nuri's past, Geron's role in the game is largely overshadowed by Sadja's intense story, and he seems more like a narrator or a bystander in this game as opposed to his central role in Chains of Satinav.\n\nSadja's story on the other hand, is incredible. The story is far from conventional, a true masterpiece that is told in a very unique way. Most plot ends tie up nicely (I watched an interview and the writer said he did leave enough room for a sequel), and I enjoyed the witty remarks of not only Sadja but her staff as well.\n\nAnother strong point of this game is the beautiful artwork. Games are rarely done in the painted style of Memoria, but the artwork really adds to the folklorish mood of the game. I have a bias towards aesthetically beautiful games, so both Chains of Satinav and Memoria get brownie points.\n\nThe voice acting of Memoria is THOUSANDS of times better than Chains of Satinav. However, it still isn't perfectly polished, with lines playing too close after each other at some points, ruining the natural flow of conversation. The staff, Sadja, and Nuri are amazing, whereas Geron is still weak.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Memoria. Although I had to look at walkthroughs because some puzzles were bizarre, and there are some technical issues that bog down the game, Sadja's storyline in particular is captivating and thrilling. Kudos to Daedalic for creating such an amazing point and click adventure.","July 3, 2015","true","104.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall, I'd recommend purchasing the game on sale if you enjoy adventure games (especially if you want some nostalgia from games of old).  It is not worth its full price.  I beat the game in roughly 9 hours (with pauses due to real life where the game was left running).  If you marathoned it without getting up and are good at puzzles, you could finish it much faster.\n\nThe ending was probably the least interesting part of the adventure since your final choices are much more limited than I would have preferred.  Unlike some people, I did not encounter any crashes or stability issues.  The only problem was occassional lag in certain cutscenes and animations (which I am shocked about considering its a mostly 2D game and my computer is a monster).  Anyways, my overall verdict would be to purchase it on sale if you want to experience a more old-school style adventure game with pretty background visuals, just don't expect the story to blow your mind.","January 3","true","9.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/243200/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","This game is a sequel to The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav... sort of.  It more uses the previous game as a backdrop to space out the telling of a different story in the same universe, while resolving some hanging threads from the last game.  More on that later.\n\nJust like the last game, the artwork is gorgeous, music is pleasant but more theatrical than catchy.  Voice acting feels more robust this time around too.  Thankfully many of the puzzles are more interesting than the last game, with fewer obnoxious red herrings or arbitrary conditions for progression.  Its not to say that its a vast improvement as there are still numerous obtuse moments, and there is at least one absolutely stupid puzzle in the game (shadow wall / mirage memory recall) where the game suggests memorizing a pattern that as far as I, four other people, and a few guides I had to peruse, absolutely could not identify and may as well have not existed.  Some of the functionality for viewing possible interactions is polished a bit better, and for a few sections the game even offers to let you skip a portion where you have to navigate a fairly mundane maze.\n\nThe story in this game is actually REALLY good compared to the original.  The story of the previous game with Geron and Nuri is a backdrop for a retelling of a story of a woman named Sadja from a time long before, and the premise of that story and the cosmology around it was very compelling to me.  The weight of Sadja's story and the twists and revelations were very enjoyable and compelling.  Additionally, there's a genuinely depressing feeling and heart wrenching response from me over Nuri's and Geron's plight in a few scenes.  With the strength of both scenarios in this game, its kind of disappointing when the actual impact of Geron's scenario ends up as more or less tertiary.  Its resolution leaves me wholly unsatisfied because of how much it takes backseat to the other, despite being the hook of why you should care about this other story with Sadja in the first place.  I wonder if the dev's just didn't think Sadja's story could have stood out well on its own, and maybe it might not have, but as it is the rest of the game more or less exists to give Sadja's story one more twist to it at the end before saying 'Oh, and that stuff from Chains of Satinav, lets resolve that in just a few seconds and move on to the credits.'  That being said, the twist in Sadja's story that wrapped everything up near the end was for me on par with the oft-touted 'Would you kindly' of Bioshock.\n\nOverall... I'd still reccomend it.  Like the previous game, it clocks in at about 10 hours.  Its beautiful, its got a good setting and premise, just expect that you'd have to look up a guide for a section or two.  You play these sorts of games for the story and the characters, and its got some good ones.","February 26, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The staff turning into a weird creepy staff person? O_o And Bryda suddenly hating her life so much and deciding to basically commit suicide and destroy the world or something? I mean what the fudge was that? Where did that come from? And Sharisad's end? Beyond depressing! I know she comes back to life after "turning herself into a ruby" according to the staff anyway, in reality she probably died alone in that garden (hope that time guy isn't reading this *wink wink*) and I really think they focused too much on Sharisad and not enough on the main guy character (already forgot his name).

Such games don't have a replay value ... or at least not right after I finished it. Okay, I can forgive that, but at least after finishing the game I would like to go and get those achievements. Unfortunately, no. I can only start all over or use only my own saves (which I dont have many since it is an adventure game). And yeah no jumping to chapters.

I've even played some of Daedelics games more recently, such as Night of the Rabbit, Deponia etc.  This game falls far short of those.\n\nFirstly, it lacks the humour that the other games had.  Secondly, I felt the voice acting was pretty poor (especially how he says "Says" wrong).  Finally, the 'puzzles' were more frustrating than in any previous game, and for a good chunk of the game didn't make any sense.\n\nWhat is worse however is that the story makes virtually NO sense if you haven't played the previous game(s).  There's constant references to things that I had no idea about.\n\nI'd say don't waste your time with this unless you're really into adventure games.","January 20","false","1.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Love the graphics. This game reminds me of why I stopped playing these  adventure games. Tedious and to  my way of thinking not very  intuitive. Just one example the start of the game. Your required to fix a stick house. Now this is the tutorial of all things. I had to go online to find out the solution of all things. Really? Turns out you find a glass turn it into shards and then  place the shards on the house of sticks and then you use magic to put it into a bottle? Yes thats the solution. Did it make a lick of sense to me?? Not really. It was just the solution.\n\nAlso just another nit pick. Their is a cave with a ?? on it. When I touched it the game claimed it was probably Poison and sticky. Yet you need to use this exact thing to make glue with a dagger? Ugh. Who did the proofreading for this game? I feel like this is one of these games that you could get the exact same joy of watching someone else play the walkthru without needing to look thru a walkthru to figure out what to do.\n\nI suppose someone might get a thrill out of the guesse what the developer had in mind. Sometimes I am on the same wave length and it makes it fun. This is not of these games. Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes was one these type of games I really enjoyed. I could see what the developer was going for and it made sense. This game just seems to have solutions that I dont really get or understand or for that matter enjoy solving. Unlike Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes.  So my personal opinon I am going to watch the youtube walkthru for the game and enjoy it that way. I got this game in a very cheap bundle and I spent 5 hours on Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes and I only paid $5 dollars for 4 of these game so I got a great bargain even though this game I found tedious and not very well thought out. Time to try out the other 2 games. No I dont recommend this game.

You ask how she knew\nthe events with Mrs. Novocaine still weigh on\nyour mind from earlier in the day. Summer-Rain\nsimply texts back that it's obvious, that she's\nyour girlfriend, and that she loves you, ending\nwith an ':P' emoji.\n\nYou think of how right she was, and how, in an\neerie sense, that every single one of the words\nshe said was also the same words that Ms.\nNovocaine told you, once upon a time.

You remember how willing you were to\nregain what you thought was love for Ms.\nNovocaine, and what you were willing to do,\nbut ultimately, everything was exercised and\nlet out on the plains of New Vegas.\n\nSadja's story is full of twists and turns, going\nto dizzying emotional highs before the final\nrevelation that brought you to your lowest, to\nthe point that Ms. Novocaine even asked\nwhat had made you so upset. Memoria was\nshort, and expensive from its asking price,\nbut the game made you despondent over\neach character's possible fate.\n\nYou find yourself snapped out of your daze\nwhen someone's hand lays itself on your\nshoulder. You turn round, only to be greeted\nwith two lips planting themselves firmly on\nyour own. Summer-Rain has arrived, and\nyou feel your spirits soar ever so slightly.\n\n"You looked... lost." She smiles to you,\nhaving sneaked into your class. You give\nher a terse smile, as you feel a pang of\nregret from feeling a sense of longing for\nMs. Novocaine, based on your memories.\n\n"I was." You start, whispering so the\nlecturer won't take notice of either of you.\n"I was thinking of... old memories."\n\nSummer-Rain puts her hand on yours.\n"Starboy... it's okay.

You nod, this time sure of\nboth yourself and the future with the\ngirl before you, your Summer-Rain.\n\n"I do."\n\nMEMORIA.","August 27, 2015","false","8.6"," 6 of 26 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","6","26","0","1"

The plot is a bit convoluted, but on the whole engaging, bringing in many of the more fascinating and exotic elements of the world of The Dark Eye roleplaying setting. The puzzles are neither too hard nor too easy, and are usually of the sort where you can see the final solution in each scene, but have to solve the tricky intermediate steps first. All in all engaging gameplay.\n\nI think my major problem with this game stems from an inherent sexism that's prevalent in all Daedalic titles I've played so far. It's like they don't know how to write a female character. Yes, you actually get to control a female protagonist in roughly half the game, which is a major improvement over other Daedalic titles, I'll grant you. Only problem is, Daedalic seems to be under the impression that an independent female character with agency in her own fate must by definition also be a rude, lying, manipulative, self-obsessed jerk. It's as if the writers feel that she doesn't really have a right to decide what she wants in life, and is being greedy and self-centered by daring to make that assertion. She's also an idiot, constantly having to be told what to do by the male-souled magic staff she finds. Sadly, her being an idiot even ends up being a major plot point. In the end, she still doesn't actually make her own path; she has to be rescued from her own self-centered choices by the male characters anyway.\n\nIf you can look past the sexism rampant throughout Daedalic titles, it's an otherwise charming point and click. If that's going to be a problem for you though, I recommend you avoid it like the plague. Maybe get it on sale if you're really into point-and-clicks.","December 4, 2014","false","17.5"," 56 of 139 people (40%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","40","56","139","11","7"

My opinion of this developer was already high after Night of the Rabbit, which was itself a masterpiece (and you should absolutely go play if you like this title) and this title has raised my opinion only higher.\n\nMy only complaint would be some minor strange logic with the puzzles.  Aditionaly, at first there was some mild estrangement with the first protagonist, having picked up this title not realising it was a second story in a series, and I Initially found the a plot oddly disjointed from the second (which I found to be the greatly superior of the two), but my doubts were quickly put to rest by the stunning visuals and an intriguing and deepening mystery.\n\nThe excellence of the writing however is not fully appreciable until the two separate tales finally collide together in a finale that was not only carefully seeded from the beginning but maintains a familiar grimms fairytale/1001 nights motif while still managing to be unique and surprising. If you absolutely despise p&c adventures then it is possible this wont be for you, but to absolutely everyone else I can not recommend this more highly.

Took my 10 hours (because I got stuck a few times. I enjoyed it a lot! Time for a short review.\n\nWhat's the best thing about the game? Well it would have to be, obviously, the art. All the areas areas to explore are simply gorgeous to look at, and most of it is interactive (main character will at least comment on things you look at).\n\nWhat's the worst thing about the game? The puzzles are VERY contrived. So many times I got stuck simply because the answer to a puzzle is so difficult to figure out. I had to use a walkthrough after hitting brick walls, but I don't regret it as it allowed me to delve further into the interesting story and awesome visuals.\n\nExample of contrived puzzle : to find a gem, one has to pour wine into a mold, do a service for a mage hidden in a library (seriously, you only see his shadow), find out he can solidify things, then have him solidify the wine. I had no clue that I could use the wine for that. There's also a maze (I HATE MAZES) but THANKFULLY you can skip it after enough time has elapsed (after getting lost). And the end is, to not spoil anything, just strange.\n\nWhat's okay? The voice acting is well done, ESPECIALLY the talking staff. Music is... forgettable but it fits, controls work very well and the magic spells gives a nice twist to gameplay, though it is underused in my opinion.\n\nIs it worth it? Yeah! Absolutely. If you can forgive yourself for using a walkthrough and just enjoy the story. Seriously, the puzzles are just a headache otherwise. Some parts can be done without one though.\n\nHowever, I recommend playing the first game first, as it is a direct sequel and many things in this game will be unclear otherwise (why is the fairy turned into a raven?). I didn't play the first game, but I regret it.\n\nChains of Satinav, get that one first.\n\n\n\n","May 26, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite being a sequel, I was able to play Memoria without ever being lost, and what details I did need to know from the previous game were provided very succintly and seamlessly.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging and creative, but rarely did I find myself doing the 'try to combine every possible item and hope one of them is the correct solution because the correct answer is of a leap of logic' routine.\nThe visuals are both lush and fit well with the style of '90s point and click adventure' genre.\nI will also say that the voice acting is TOP NOTCH, especially the Staff, I often found myself clicking on him just to hear him speak.\n\nThe only bugs I noticed were occasionally the audio files and the subtitles wouldn't match up, but this wasn't very common at all.

This is one of the best adventure games of Daedalic Entertainment. I've been impressed about an ending of this game, that it has an additional story line and at the same time it's closely connected to the first part of story (Dark Chains of Satinav). You should play it, the story is incredible, graphics are amazing, dialogs are exciting, the game is being played in one breath.

I love it so much, I would reccomend playing this game even to people if they don't normaly like inventory puzzle games, as long as they love a good Narrative.  The only real question is if you play the still good, but less-amazing prequel, Chains of Satinav before you play this one.  It is definitely enjoyable without playing it, but it gives away the ending to Chains.

This is a sequel to the Chains of Satinav.\n\nMemoria tells two concurrent tales placed within the mythology and history of the world of The Dark Eye. As Geron you want to find a way to lift the spell from you faerie Nuri which has turned into a raven at the end of the last adventure. As such you encounter a gypsie which could help you out… if you help him out solving a riddle. Time is running short since Nuri seems to forget her origins and becomes more and more “raven” by time.\n\nOn the other side you play Sadja, a princess 450 years before. She is on the way to find a magic mask, of which is said it could decide the faith and outcoming of any battle.\n\nAs both plots overlap from time to time, you switch between Geron and Sadja. As Geron is reluctant and shy, Sadja is cheeky and defiant. Geron’s world is colorful and bright whereas Sadja’s world is dark with a looming total destruction by hordes of daemons due to mage wars.\n\nThe connection between both story lines is not obvious but develops from chapter to chapter. And soon you discover that Sadja is not the “princess” at all. At the end you face again, as in the Chains of Satinav, a bittersweet love story.\n\nThe riddles are fair, sometimes a bit trial and error. The environment is beautiful drawn and one can see that the developers really had a caring hand when crafting the scenery along with the dialogues and audio and lots of details and charm. The interface is beyond any doubt.\n\nA nice adventure!\n\n8/10","February 14","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Memoria does this, with it's improved performance, smoother animations, larger scope and vision of narrative, and willingness to try new things. As in my review of the prequel, "Chains of Satinav", I would almost say that I recommend playing this game simply if you are a fan of finely crafted Fantasy-  regardless of liking for point-and-clicks.  Geron the Bird Catcher's tale continues in this stunningly executed chapter in the Dark Eye universe, and it is here we are also introduced to the mysterious bits and pieces of a story set in the long forgotten past...  of a young woman seeking to overcome Time itself, and an ensorcelled staff willing to help her achieve this goal.  In summary:\n\nPros:\n+ Fun and creative puzzle solving mechanics in place that require you to consider all aspects of an environment, and think outside the box\n+ Top notch voice acting-  perhaps even improved from before. Fitting to each of the characters, with a wide variety and personality for even background/minor individuals\n+ Fantastic digital painting style of art\n+ The soundtrack! Adventurous and moving in it's execution, which sets a different tone for the setting of the narrative vs. the prequel. Play both to see what I mean\n+ Conclusion felt completely satisfying, yet still left me ready for more, should Daedalic offer it\n+ Sadja as a secondary protagonist felt well developed as a character...  and her companion the Staff was just great to listen to. The relationship they develop is a fascinating one, and the more I discovered about his origins, the more I felt myself caring about the fate of both him and his Princess\n+ Limited dialogue choices included to immerse the player in the scenario\n\nNeutrals/Cons:\n- Lip synching was still kind of off in places, and left something to be desired\n- A "certain character's" actions at a "certain point" seemed somewhat out of the blue, but may have been allowed to take place in order to highlight the corrupting influence of selfish want and desire\n- A guide or at least a few hints may be required at some point to proceed. Just as solving a tricky puzzle can make you feel good about yourself, clicking that hint button one or a dozen times, only to see something so obvious that you missed out of impatience/lack of observation can make you feel really dumb haha\n\nOverall:\n9 out of 10\n\nMemoria is a wonderful, quality adventure game with a storyline that kept me enthralled throughout.  I enjoyed playing as Sadja, and though the dynamic set in motion between the first game's protags was indeed touching, I kind of wished we had gotten to directly engage a bit more with her painful history in the same capacity as Geron's, with perhaps just a bit more epilogue. That's really just nit-picking though. Seriously, check out both this AND Chains of Satinav-  a pair of gems just waiting to be picked up.","January 7","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting is the first thing that caught me, which is usually crap in these type of games.  I found myself letting the dialog play out (they display text which you could read more quickly) due to the level of acting. I was drawn into the story with it's characters and excellent visual scenes.\n\nI recommend for anyone who likes the point and click world.","January 24","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise, you might be confused about much of the story, which is never re-explained for new players. That being said, this is an EXCELLENT adventure game, even better than the original in my opinion. Good puzzles, GREAT characters, excellent voice acting, AMAZING story...yeah. Just awesome. It strays from the original in that there are actually two main plots: 1) the framing story, which takes place with Geron and Nuri after the events of the first game and 2) an entirely new story and characters set some 400 years before, during a time of epic war. In many ways, this backstory is actually WAY better than the framing story, although they do come together in the end to make it one cohesive game. They could just as easily have made this flashback its own game set in the same universe. It's that good. I had two glitches while playing, one near the beginning that required a complete restart. It happens if you do things out of the "intended" order. The other, one of the characters' words switched suddenly to some other language for a line or two. I didn't miss out on anything due to subtitles, but it was jarring.\n\nOverall, a sequel that's as good or better than the original. A fascinating adventure game. 10/10","May 24","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
