This was so fun to play, and the music and art style were perfect. It never felt too easy, and it never got to a point where it was so hard you wanted to quit. This game was the bomb!\n\nNotice those key words; Was. Were. Past-Tense Verbs. For those of you that don't know, they had an update, and it SUCKS. The game is way too easy now, the difficulty/endless modes are gone, the game is incredibly buggy, and the art style is totaly different. And, most important, the lasers and weapons are different. That was the main reason I got this game; because it looked so cool. Now, I regret buying it. It isn't worth the price (which was a problem from the begining. $20 for a game in BETA? Really?). If they could do one thing to make this game better, it's this: CHANGE IT BACK. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.","October 11, 2014","false","2.1"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

See those screenshots? Those were the glorious days of DubWars. Now it looks nothing like that.\n\nI bought it for 5 dollars on sale, but this update makes the game worth less than that. 20 dollars? Skip it.\nHonestly, this could very easily be a simple browser/flash game in its current graphics state.\n\nSome pros and cons post-update 10/7/14\n\n+ You can actually see where you are now (before the update, it was hard to see where the cursor was at)\n+ A few weapons (very few) look better\n+ Controller support. Even though I don't use it, controller users will have an easier time.\n\n- Overall graphics are downgraded\n- The game feels VERY slow now and is way too easy\n- Main menu looks lame\n- Main menu music is gone. You can only listen to it a few seconds at the loading screen\n- Some random flying debris that looks like transparent PNG images\n- Game looks a lot more 2D\n- Game feels very unfinished, whereas before the update it actually felt quite finished except for the lack of songs\n- Speaking of lack of songs, it's been forever since the game was released (on Ouya) and there's STILL ONLY 5 SONGS\n- Some moving background parts look like they were made in MS Paint\n- Some weapons feel off-sync with the beat\n- For the most part, the backgrounds look like simple images, whereas before the background actually changed and moved a lot to make the game more exciting. For example, look at 0:20 of the trailer video. See how the brain wiggles? Well, now it's just a still image. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but when EVERYTHING becomes so still, the game just feels sooooooo slow.\n\nEarly Access is no excuse for an update that degrades a game. I wish I could get the old version back.","October 29, 2014","false","1.7"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

This level has a amazing feature where theres 2 ships at the start and whichever ship you shoot at first your ship turns the color of the ship you didn't attack and the ship you did attack starts to aim after only you. But this system is broken because whenever you die your stuck on which ever side you choose your glitched on that side and you have to restart in order to be able to choose the other side, theres also another broken feature which would have allowed you to destory parts of the ships (doesn't matter which side your on you can destory both ships whenever you please), but this feature is broken because whenever you "destory" a part of a ship you see a little sqiggly line over the that part you "destoryed" the line looks like it was drawn in MS paint, there's also a glitch where your weapons remain firing for 8 seconds after you restart from dying.\n\nEclipse: So I didn't find any bugs with this level but there things I want to comment on.The creepers are finally killable. The new spawning system for this level is floating dungon at spawn in creepers and spiders, but I do wish there was a way to destory these dungon because they do tend to spam my screen. There also these astroids at are floating that can be broken into smaller pieces and smaller pieces and then destory cool system but theres no effect when breaking apart/destorying these astroids and I do hope that gets added in soon.\n\nTough Guy: This level should be re-named "Non stop lasers" because this level is full of the same laser spam before at least it was a lighting like effect but now it's just lasers. Also the laser in the center on the level just pops into view the first time it appear and doesn't fade it like it does all the other times\n\nOVERALL: This update had lots of content but it seems rushed, unpolished, and untested and it seems as if they tried to do too much in such little time. But this does show this game has a lot of potential in the furture lets just hope the devs don't add in too much with out first making sure everything works first","June 19, 2014","true","16.3"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thaeral/recommended/290000/","thaeral","Lomyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thaeral/","338 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMarch 2015 Update:\n\nGame Video is updated, as are the screenshots.  Controllers work better.  You can see an increase in clarity of the graphics; they're better but they're still pixellated on the parallax backgrounds ("Urban" level - perhaps by design) and overall have a flash game/amateur look to them.  Again, perhaps this is by design and I just don't agree with the new direction/design of the graphics.  Most important to me, however, is the incredible disconnect between what this game is and what it should be as far as gameplay goes.\n\nFired projectiles are too slow, this is especially noticeably on the "Urban" level - but it'll frustrate you at some point on every level.  Weapon and music sychronicity need work.  I believe this should function like a reverse Rock Band.  In that game, easy has very few fret colors to hit and those fret colors increase with more difficulty.  Your game is a music/rhythm game, do it in reverse.  On easy, fire weapons like crazy.  As the difficulty is increased, lower the amount of weapons firing - or better yet leave them as is and either decrease their damage or increase the # or strength of the enemies.\n\nThis is a shoot'em up, there should be weapons and ships firing all over the place, but the weapons in this game, except during drops in the song, feel anemic for the most part  There are also far more infrequent than they should be.  There are litterally LULLS on every level, at least one, where no weapons are firing at all and there are usually still enemies around.  So you're just running away from them until a part of the song comes up where you do have weapons.  This isn't fun, its frustrating.\n\nI'm not asking for a bullet hell update - but keep it interesting and the screen activity BUSY.  And please give more attention to the projectile weapons.  Speed them up and make them more frequent.  I'm kiling most enemies with the side-firing immediate area weapons because they're more useful.\n\nI don't know.  You've made some progress, but I'm still left exasperated at this game.  Eclipse and Tough Guy are the best levels out of the bunch, though.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI don't know what happened, but scrapping everything that everyone liked about the game, including some of the music, and starting over with "all new" everything was not a good move.\n\nThe original presentation, in fact even the current demo movie and screenshots on this store page, of Dubwars was essentially Geometry Wars played to Dubstep music where the music dictated what weapons fired and when.  It was a neat idea, a gorgeous looking game, and a concept that I enjoyed - sort of a different take on Audiosurf but not with your music.\n\nAs of the Fall/Winter 2014 update - they completely redid everything - supposedly all better.  But it's not all better.  The entire look of the game has an amateurish look to it now.  Like the original developer(s) left or Mura Interactive suffered an exodus of talent and that talent took their work with them.  It looks and plays like a Adobe Flash game that someone made in high school before they got good at making anything.\n\nDid the Geometry Wars guys threaten to sue Mura Interactive for copyright infringement?  What happened?  At this point, isn't this false advertising - it's nothing like what is represented above?  I regret backing the Kickstarter for the amount that I did.  I can't imagine I will see ANY of the tier rewards I pledged for; however, I will take my bitter medicine and make the first review I've ever put on Steam to say that, at this point, you should only get this game if it's free or gifted to you.  It's not as bad as some of the "Early Access" trash that is out there, but it has definitely fallen victim to that curse.\n\nMah Dreams... :(","February 21, 2015","false","0.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

Let's start with some pros:\n\nWeapons: WOW, the weapons are extremely powerful and are different every level! They are in sync with the music, which is next.\n\nMusic: Well, it's Dubstep, but it's good. Even if you hate dubstep, you will like at least one. Mine is Eclipse, but the others are pretty good as well.\n\nThe Loading Screen: While loading, you get to hear another piece of music, which I have listened to fully, and it's not half bad.\n\nNow with neutrals:\n\nEnemies: They are pretty cool, but are easy to kill. For some of them, they have ranged, others charge. They're pretty generic.\n\nThe Radical Change: About a few months ago, DubWars changed drastically. Everything was different but the music. I like the new and fresh look, but hate that they took out features like a leaderboard, gems to continue, and a difficulty.\nIf you're new to this game, however, it won't really change anything.\n\nNow the cons:\n\nEnemies: There are some complaints I have, like when you press play again, the enemies still on the board from last game are not gone.\n\nLocked Playing: If you decide to play a game, don't press cancel, cause you'll be stuck in limbo. :(\n\nVaried difficulty: As I said, there is one difficulty now. On some levels, it's incredibly easy, but on others impossibly hard. Not good.\n\nAll in all, the pros weigh out the cons for this review. It's not complete, but it's worth a try.\n\nI recommend this game. :)\n\n\n\n\n","November 25, 2014","true","18.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The dubstep they chose for each level fits very well. I hope to see more levels soon.\n\nA few issues I had:\n\n* Crosshairs can easily get lost in the chaos when there are a lot of enemies around. It blends with everything else around you so it can get confusing.\n\n* I tried playing the game with an Xbox controller, but was only able to use the left thumbstick to move. I tried aiming with the right thumbstick but didn't work. I noticed the game was aiming for me. Not sure if this was intentional or I'm doing something wrong here.\n\n* Just like the crosshairs, the ship doesn't stand out against the rest. It blends in easily when it gets chaotic. Took about a few seconds for me to spot it again.\n\n* Enemies can spawn right on you giving you no time to dodge them. Especially the bombs which can hurt you pretty bad when in pairs.\n\n<Remember, this is Early Access so there's bound to be a few bugs here and there.

At the time of this review there are currently five songs that are playable, which is HALF of what they're offering; Ten songs at completion. Now, if they went for a $10 Early access price, and then went up to $20... maybe.. but even then. There are similar audio based games that cost less. Soundodger+ is $9, Audiosurf is $10, these games have a LOT more content and also offer personal MP3 usage in some way. Then you add in the "Controller compatibility". I thought i'd give it a try, after finishing every song at least three times. The sensitivity was comparitive to a snail, on oil. i got about 20 seconds into a song (because i had to wait for the music to actually start for the weapons to fire) before i realized.. This is what their idea of hardmode must be. it was impossible to rotate fast enough for your weapons to destroy everything.\n\n-10/10 Would not recommend.\n\nAs of now, I would not recommend this game to people unless it was free.

This is a game I have been following for a year and periodically I check in to see what has been done and give it a play. I don't know that this is the case with this game but I'm sure alot of these devs are amateur game makers and they get a creative idea and say "hell I can do this!" and they go for it. Watching these game progress is also watching a person progress. I find is almost as enjoyable as playing the game. If you do as well, get in early on games when you see the dev is actively updating.\n\nDubWars is a fantastic game with great music and has become more polished graphically over the year that I have been playing it. Each level is a beautifully themed shooter based on the particular song.\n\nYou can spend many time through enjoying the music and learning when the music will trigger your weapons to cause maximum carnage.\n\nIf you enjoy twinstick shooters and good music this is for you.","September 18, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I Donated to the Kickstarter, and the levels in the current version of the game, are the same as the ones shown in the Kickstarter Trailer. I Spoke to Ben Hale, one of the artists originally on the team, and these levels were completed over a year ago. Its still Early access, so a lot could change, but I'd wait till they have more content before buying it. I have high hopes for this game. Please don't let me down.\n\nIssues I had while playing:\n\n- The croshairs get easily lost when there a lot of enemies on the screen, as they blend into the background, and look quite similar to the enemies.\n- The sheild ability, which you can pick up while playing various levels, will not always stop enemies from hitting you. Specifically the enemy that slows your movement. This does not always happen.\n- You ship doesn't stand out very well from the enemies, and in some cases from the background. Occasionally, as with the crosshairs, I loose track of it for a second.\n- It was hard to tell if I was actually getting hurt by anything, as there wasn't a clear indication of Health, however I did die a few times.\n- Enemies sometimes seem to appear out of nowhere, giving you almost no time to react, or dodge them. In some cases they will literally spawn on top of you. This doesn't kill you, thankfully it takes a lot to kill you.\n- Due to how different all of the weapons are, it is often hard to know how to orient yourself to actually do anything to the enemies. If I were to play enough, I'm sure I could figure it out, but the more I play a song, the more I want to play a different song.\n\n(AGAIN, THIS IS EARLY ACCESS SO THESE ISSUE WILL HPEFULLY BE FIXED. THESE ARE MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS FTER PLAYNG FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.)","June 13, 2014","true","0.5"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","0"

Still, pleagued by the one issue that makes it totally unplayable. You have no idea which side your attacks are going to be from, or where they're going. If you want a rythm based game, go play osu, because it's free and actually relies on skill rather than just being luck. There's a massive lack of visual feedback aswell, you constantly have to take your eyes off the fight to see if you got hit or not.\n\nBut I guess it's nice to see the devs not abandoning their game after this long, unlike certain other titles. Please improve visual feedback, and make attacks more predictable.","December 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

The game's visuals are amazing and provide a lightshow like experience along with enemies looking different based on difficulty. The music selection is nice and full of wubs that will have your bass booming and your weapons shooting with various styles. It's amazing to see the different effects that come out of the beats and it makes each level unique and ahve different strats. The level design is unique where certain stages have interactive parts that can harm you. As for it being early access, we get monthly updates and they are usually beefy updates that include a bunch of a new features which is nice. Now for $20 this game is well worth it and it is especially worth it if you are a dubstep fan.

It was way before it came out on steam but I saw a lot of potencial. Before this new update when they put it on steam I honestly didnt like it that much it was very different than the one I played at the convention so I sent then some suggestions. Im glad a lot of the stuff I hoped would come into the game came in the new update. But alas there are still many problems with the new update. I love all the new levels and the format but the buttons are really glitchy if you click the launch button it opens the upgrades and you have to click above the button to make it work. The levels work fine but I feel like the whole new menu thing was a little rushed that whole part of the game is awesome but it also has many flaws. I hope you fix that in the next update. I was glad to see the difficulty increased, now you actually have to move other than just spinning around in the middle and destroying everything. It is also really fun to have to keep going to the side to regen and avoid upcoming attacks. When I tried to play this game with a controller it was pretty glitchy but not that bad. Overall though this new update really improved DubWars. I'm really excited for the future of this game!","October 5, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am so glad I just got it! I can more than recommend this to everyone who likes those games, even if he or her doen´t like the music (I am sure this game will change their tastes dramatically :D) I am someone who loves Dubstep, who loves listening to music, so this IS MY GAME! The concept is nice, the graphics are nice, the sync is... BEST! plus it´s really challenging, because of kinda tricky gameplay. The Soundtracks are legendary, most of them, (I don´t like Eclipse and Break it up, but that doesn´t matter at all.) Not that good is that I can´t play this for hours in a row. But don´t worry, next day I always want to play again! seriously, I am amazed of Dubwars!\n\nSo far to my opinion of the game as it is now, I was noticing this here about 2 months ago from now, so I know the "Original Version" only from videos. I can´t say (unlike many others) that I like it more, because in my view the graphics have been increased A LOT,  the Sync too, the weapons look way better now. There are only two things I like more than today: Different ship designes and the menu loop sounded better. Other than that, I can´t be sad about the "new update". I like the new version.\n\nIt´s time for the last point: Improvements. What I wish for the future are definately achievments, challenges and different ship designes. But as announced, this will be coming when Early Access is over. Other than that it was nice when after and after new levels (featuring new songs) would be added, so that it doesn´t get boring to have only the familiar ones. A nice feature for me, as a great Dubstep listener, was something like a level-editor to experiment making your own sync to your mp3´s. Not for Publish like in Portal or Geometry Dash or stuff, but for your own experience. I either would like downloadable (buyable) original Dubwars-Soundtrack. This could maybe get the game a little cheaper and disable copyright-issues.\n\nYeah, so far to my review, I wish everyone long hours of great fun in DUBWARS!","March 29","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
