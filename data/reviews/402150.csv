Score before the patch 9 / 10]\n\nRecognizing chords and matching notes to music is a fun experience in this musical game. All levels of musicianship from newbs to card carrying long hairs will benefit from this software with the exception of those with formal training in solfège. I purchased this software on day 1 because I thought the concept was cool… and I was right. I have made extensive notes for musicians in this review. On with the show….\n\nThe background music plays (BGM) and you pluck virtual strings that may or may not be in harmony. Pick the right strings and cut the bad ones. This game introduces simple 2 and 3 note chords; forget the musical theory you do not need it; just enjoy the experience. Game levels 1-20 are straightforward and can be completed by everybody. Go ahead and dive in….\n\nEach level represents 5 chord challenges which must all be correctly resolved to progress to the next level. The complexity progresses gently through increasing the number of strings in a chord, increasing the number of alternative strings, mixing the order of Majors and minors, and finally inversions. Every time I finished a level I kept saying to myself  “just one more level before going to bed”. I went to bed late, a few times. There are a total of 40 levels.\n\nThe game really takes off at level 21 with the introduction of 4 note chords, 7th chords to be precise, driving up the difficulty. I did find myself occasionally misidentifying the tonic or the third; patience and concentration is required especially when surviving chord inversions. Following the patch I can confirm that all sonic puzzles resolved to either Major 7ths or minor 7ths as per game instructions; the game will challenge you with alternatives such as Major 6ths, dominant 7ths, and minor Major 7ths but they were not solutions in these puzzles.\n\nAchievement notes: Achievements are linked to completing levels with specific BGM. Playing alternative modes changed my BGM when I resumed ‘Standard’ playthrough. Check the achievement requirements and reset the BGM manually through ‘options’ while in-game if necessary.\n\nHonorable mentions\n1. Many different styles of music are represented here and are sufficiently varied to keep us interested. Chapeau to the music director.\n2. Lots of extra game modes including Chaos and Endless.\n3. Steam accoutrements including huge numbers of achievements, cards, and leaderboards. Woo!\n4. Special thanks to the devs for opening a line of communication to allow for questions that I had about the game; they have been responsive to their players with the patches.\n5. This game is the first in its genre; genre defining. Honour this.\n\nLast words\nI often pick up my guitar while jazz or rock is playing and determine the chord progressions and spend some time improvising on the spot. This game fulfills the same role of learning the key of the sound space but just using a computer instead. I really took this game to heart and wanted to prove to myself that I have internalized all my intervals, an exam so to speak that I passed with just a slight bruising of my ego! Musicianship is great for the mind; it teaches the qualities of perseverance, gives improved memory and concentration including better academic performance, and has proven protective against the afflictions of aging (alzheimer’s and dementia).\n\nBuy this software if you are a musician at any level or the least bit curious (or shy).This fun musical game is genre defining and is the logical evolution of using computers to help us train our minds in the realm of music.\n\nMy scoring system 10 / 10\n10 / exemplary execution of the genre with compelling innovation\n9 / exemplary execution of the genre don’t miss out, for fans of the genre and the curious alike\n8 / for well done not a must play, fans of the genre and newbs will be happy it is well done\n7 / for calibrated expectations only, fans of the genre would not miss out if they skipped this\n6 / only for serious fans of the genre for whom game play with bugs is acceptable\n5 / enough bugs to make me unhappy","February 21","true","55.3"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","34","37","2","9"

I think the developers have their heart in the right place and maybe they're a little too familiar with the content to see some of the things I feel are shortcomings. With that in mind I have several criticism which I sincerely hope are taken constructively because I want to see this become the game I thought it would be.\n\nI don't feel like I'm learning anything. It might be fun if I already knew something about music, but even when I pass a tier I don't feel like I understand what I did. I wish there was more of an educational element.\n\nThe help/cheats aren't very helpful. They just give you answers. I'd consider slowing down the music, or playing the chord clearly without the music, or playing the notes in the chord one at a time to be more helpful. Using the cheats doesn't actually feel like it's helping, just postponing my next failure.\n\nAfter failing the only option I have is to start the tier over. There is no guidance for your mistake, nothing is clarified. At the very least I'd like to try it again without credit to see if I can recognize my error. I would hope for a lot more feedback. Show me where each string falls on a scale and which ones I cut/left and which ones were correct.\n\nI'm on tier 15 and I still get presented with stages that I think are easy and I cut strings after hearing them after a single pluck. Within the same tier sometimes I get completely stumped. This has been happening to me since tier 5. I feel like if this game had a suitable educational element, I'd have an explanation for this seemingly random difficulty.\n\nSome things I'd like to see in future versions:\n-I'd like to play with my eyes closed, but the interface requires a mouse. It'd be nice to have ASDF...or 1234... assigned to the strings.\n\n- More music. The music is lackluster. Some songs have too much delay before the chords. If you're troubled with a tier, the music can be tiresome.\n\n- It'd be nice to have the option to mark what I think is the root/3rd/5th as I make my progress.\n\n- There's a constant audio static which I believe is intentional (maybe like a record?) that would be very nice to shut off.\n\nOther bugs:\nthe disabled state for he 5th cheat button is the 3rd button\nThe drop shadow on the string cut button is cut off on the bottom\nall 3 circles for the play chord, mute and settings buttons have flat bottom and right sides\n","February 24","false","2.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

A complete novice could probably get the hang of things eventually, but unless you already know a little bit of music theory you probably won't really understand what you're learning. It's one thing to gloss over this in the tutorial, but even in the in-game glossary, it's not explained why the first, second, and third notes in a chord are called the root, third, and fifth except that "music theory is weird". While music theory is indeed super weird, the explanation for that is very simple - the root is the first note of the scale the chord is named for, the third is the third note in the scale, and the fifth is the fifth note in the scale(you can probably guess about the seventh). As another reviewer noted, some of the note names appear to be slightly off, but that's not really a big deal here - the point isn't to memorize the the names of the notes, but train your ear to identify the relationships between the different notes. You don't get to see any note names until you've figured things out (same goes for the scale they're in) and they flash by fast enough that you probably won't even read them. This is for ear training, not memorizing chords. Another minor gripe is that a couple songs (two out of the roughly fifteen I've played so far) have relatively long drum lead-ins, four or eight bars, before the melody kicks in. That would make sense in a rhythm game, but here you end up just sitting around for a while until you can start listening for a root note. Those minor complaints aside, I'd recommend this in an instant to any musician. The first ten levels or so are a breeze if you have any prior music experience, and you'll be worried you wasted your time and money, but things get really interesting and fun after they start with inversions and 7ths. I've played several instruments for over fifteen years, and professionally over the last seven years as both an instructor and performer, and I can't recall better, more dense training in a single session than the two hours I've spent with this so far.","February 18","true","2.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The concept is really cool and is a fun and interactive way to train your ear to hear different chord qualities. However, I do have a little beef with this game as of now. The simpler levels where you learn to identify major and minor triads are perfectly fine, but things start to get mislabled once the seventh gets involved. For example: whenever the song is in the key of A Major in these levels, your goal is to identify an A Major Seventh chord, but the chord identified as the A Major Seventh is spelled "A-C#-E-F#" (an A Major with an added sixth). This also applies to the E Major Seventh. Also, no distinction is made between a dominant seventh and a major seventh, or between a minor seventh and a minor chord with a major seventh. Sorry for my lil rant here. I just don't want people to wonder why one seventh chord sounds different than another seventh chord with the same label. Also, I've only played for about an hour, so maybe this is cleared up in later levels. :p Otherwise, this is a great game.","February 17","true","2.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Not only is the music GOOD in this game, it's the whole point!  It can be challenging to find the right string to cut, but that's the idea, train tone-def schlubs like myself to recognize harmony and chords.\nI like that the background music can be turned off easily, if the stage is really giving me trouble I find that's helpful to let me focus on one string at a time.  Lame pun alert, but this game hits all the right notes.  It's bright and colorful without overwhelming you with visuals, so you can still focus on the sound.  It's simple goal is easy to understand, but offers a challeneg for longer term play.  Basically the only thing I would change would be to give the strings a more satisfying animation or sound when you cut them, like a really good guitar string snap or something.","February 18","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This alone would make it worth the very reasonable price point, but it goes beyond that and delivers a fun and challenging experiece on top of the intriguing gimmick. I would probably characterize it as a musical rouge-lite: you must choose the outlier note correctly for each level on a tier without making a mistake and having to start over at the beginning of the level set.\n\nString Theory scratches the itch for both listening to music and engaging in challenging gameplay without having to compromise on one or the other. It has smooth gameplay and a light interface that makes everything accessible without losing utility.\n\nSave for some small bugs, I have nothing but positive criticisms about String Theory.

I thought I was terrible at doing note recognition by ear (spoiler alert: I am) but after the first few levels of this game I felt myself getting better at it. It eases you in with some really blatantly obvious dissonant notes that give you a basic idea of what a wrong note sounds like, just more extreme than the more subtle ones later in.\n\nThere are a few cop out options ( show root note and third, on the start levels using them both pretty much wins you the level, removing any kind of auditory 'training' for lack of a better term.) this minor flaw becomes redundant when more strings come into play. I think it dilutes the experience a tad but it's good they have those in there, I try to avoid them as much as I can because I'm trying to train my ear here, not complete levels.\n\nIt also highlights the chord in the puzzle once you complete it, have a notepad handy and this is a fantastic way of writing down some new chords to learn, a nice sorta 'reward' and if you were stuck on the puzzle for a while you can already recognise individual notes when you try to play said chord on your instrument of choice, they get broken down for you during the puzzle, not the manner of an arpeggio but you have to play the individual notes and recognise out of place notes. This will be very handy for tuning by ear and i seriously cannot wait to dig into this more.","February 22","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
