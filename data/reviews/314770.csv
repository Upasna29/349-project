It is not a special game, but it is good for spending some time and have fun. Graphics are nice, controls are good and 5 bucks are more than worth it.","August 7, 2014","true","0.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

The main campaign see's you do missions and depending on how well you do and what objectives you complete you earn points to upgrade your plane.  Upgrades make a huge difference to how easy or hard a mission is and your chance of completing objectives.\n\nThe game is a little buggy however, some missions see me take off with ammo and I cannot fire, but a quick restart fixes there.  There are also a few usability things such as on arcade flight mode if you take off and turn around too quickly, you will automatically land.","August 11, 2014","true","4.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Know that it doesn't offer widescreen support though. That's my only complaint. Other than that, it's a decent game. Nothing amazing, but pretty fun. Rock Paper Shotgun liked it, I like it, do you have $5 to risk?","August 6, 2014","true","1.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Very bad. There's no hope of my complaints being change with how old this game is.\n\nWhile the "casual" mode automatically gives you every single upgrade to begin with... At start on hardcore mode you can shoot down one enemy ship before you run out of ammo and/or fuel.\n\nThe landing strip - if you take off and need to turn around immediately you'll likely be forced to land again. Another gripe with the landing strip is that they clearly haven't cleared the trees right next to it so you have a good chance to crash if you try to land and miss. You don't have a choice which way you take off. The menu is un-user-friendly, for instance you can't access options in game.\n\nYou're expected to kill ground troops with a gun which is very hard since you are considered to have "crashed" if you come within the lower 1/6 of the screen, not to mention you have to point down at such an angle it's almost impossible to pull up before the game arbitrarily says you've crashed.","May 22, 2015","false","1.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
