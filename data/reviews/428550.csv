"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nuffalope/recommended/428550/","nuffalope","nuffy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nuffalope/","257 products in account","Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is good.\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is damn near the greatest pixel platformer I've ever played. It feels extraordinarly weird to say that about a game that came out in 2016, needing to compete with classical masterpieces like metroid, megaman and castlevania but its just legitimately so good.\n\nThe gameplay is satisfying and varied. It ranges from fast paced and action packed to technical and deliberate, with everything in between. There is a a plethora of attacks; cancels, dodge rolls, air dodges, transformations, lovingly hand crafted frame by frame, along with a selection of items, buffs and skills that add variation and new tactics. The animations are superb and fluid, nothing feels jerky or floaty. It has been polished to perfection.\n\nThe world is beatifully crafted. Each area has a unique color scheme and art direction that, combined with changes in music that flow dynamically, give them their own personality. Music plays when appropriate, and changes in tone/tempo and mood when appropriate, adding beautifully to the atmosphere that will suck you in so you can't stop playing. There are plenty of (literal gameplay and story based)secrets to find, narrative puzzles to put together, as well as people and things to see.\n\nMost of the story is told not by the characters in the game, and not from information about the world you find lying around, but by your emotions and the way you connect to the environment itself. This may seem pretentious, but really, It's the little things. Like watching the grass part when you shoot an arrow through it. Like watching the water reflect and distort the world around it. Little things that make you think "wow". Changes in lighting, wind speed, and the environment around you are shone in the way your outfit looks and reacts to the world around it, be it reflections, animation speed etc. The noises the enemies make range from innocent, to heartbreaking, to scary. There are signs of battle you find, signs of peace you find, the personal effects of people you'll never see. People who have died, left, or disappeared without finishing their story. There's one part where I found a woman who had all but given up, and there was nothing I could do for her. I never thought I'd see her again, thinking she was a random npc only there to add some drama to the environment; I was right, but not at all in the way I'd initially thought. No detail in this game is without purpose. There's always something more.\n\nIt will take between 3-5 hours to beat your first playthrough, and there is more than one ending.\n\nIt's 2016, it's exceedingly rare to find a game quite so complete, and quite so good, for the asking price of just ten dollars, yet here you are. This is an absolute must play for platformer fans, sidescroller fans, indie fans, etc. I would even go so far as to recommend this game to everyone, even people that aren't traditionally fans of platformers.","March 5","true","10.7"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","56","65","6","7"

It's also, for my money, an early indie GOTY contender. Between its awesome and varied settings and backdrops, its weighty combat and epic boss fights, its minimalistic story and sweeping soundtrack, its secrets and challenges, you might be mistaken in thinking this is 2D Dark Souls.\n\nIt is not.\n\nIn fact, aesthetically and story-wise, it feels like it takes a lot of welcome cues from Bloodborne.\n\nStory is pretty standard: you're a young priestess who's idyllic, Shire-y land is positively swamped with curse juices bubbling up from the big city (where all curses begin). She sets out to expel the evil with naught but her bow, her arrows, and a comically large maple leaf.\n\nAlong the way she'll talk to NPCs for some world building, purchase items from vendors none-too-perturbed by the whole doomsday curse situation, find secrets (some well hidden, some requiring backtracking once you get the necessary item/ability a la Medroidvanias), and defeat a variety  of baddies and bosses.\n\nCombat is... visceral? But it's pretty basic. Land a few blows, dodge, heal or boost your attack, rinse and repeat. Learning the patterns is half the thrilling battle, and each boss has its own style. Some are small and quick, some are massive with equally large AOE attacks. Nothing felt gimmicky, and there were no “puzzle” bosses for better or worse... well, maybe ONE boss would constitute as a puzzle but I'd rather not spoil that.\n\nEach area of the world has a distinct flavor: there's a sunken graveyard full of debris and sea creatures, a gothic city basking in a red moon's glow, a picturesque forest, and much more. There was a “fire” world that left a lot to be desired but for roughly 90% of the game I was impressed at the scope and beauty of the world Bombservice crafted.\n\nIt's just a great little game... took me about six hours to complete and I only have one achievement to show for it – lots of secrets and challenges for the achievement hounds among us. Momodora is not one to overlook, and I can't think of a single issue, not even a minor one.\n\nNot even some minor niggle.\n\nIt's just that good, and well worth a full price purchase.\n\n...\n\nAnd you can turn into a cat! That's priceless.  How many games let you turn into an adorable cat?","March 7","true","7.2"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","40","44","10","0"

The character sprites have been entirely redone in a larger size with more lovingly placed pixels than ever, and the game is set in a more properly connected world that begs to have every nook and cranny fully explored several times.\n\nI know the Dark Souls comparison does get thrown around a lot these days, but Momodora RUtM really *does* feel like Darks Souls's adorable little sister, and I mean that in the most affectionate way possible.","March 4","true","9.4"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","37","41","0","0"

The game started out slowly, with the first two bosses feeling like more polished Momodora 3 content. However, when I reached the third boss I fought I was astounded. Pardoner Fennel was what sold me on this game. That fight was amazing. In terms of mechanics, the game feels tight as previous games, but takes it in a more Souls-esque direction with the combat rolls and bell system. The general gameplay is much slower than previous games, but this game feels far better than any of the others. The platforming feels tight, the combat has weight to it, and the variety of equipment allowed me to take my playstyle in any direction I wanted. It holds tons of replay value, as after I played it the first time I went on to play it in both Hard and Insane. While I felt the game was too easy on normal and hard, insane provided the challenge and satisfaction of completing what the game had set before me. The bosses all drop unique equipment if you can defeat them without taking damage, something that I hope more developers take note of as I really loved this about Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight. The world map is reminiscent of Castlevania, littered with shortcuts like a 2d Dark Souls as you are allowed to go in any direction you want after a while. However, because everything is open the difficulty is stagnant for most of the game as nearly half of the game is approachable in nearly any order. My one gripe with the game is that the instant you learn the attacks of bosses they become relatively simple, even on Insane. My personal favorite boss, Archpriestess Choir, was a blast the first time I fought her on Insane, but the second time I breezed through as the only strength the bosses of this game have are that you do not know their moves the first time fighting them. If they improve the bosses' complexity for their next game, I don't know if I'll have any gripes with it at all.\nPros:\nGreat Soundtrack\nDecent Replayability\nSatisfying Combat\nTight Platforming\nGreat World Design\nCons:\nSimplistic Bosses\nLack of increasing difficulty\nDisappointing Final Boss\nForgettable Characters\n\n\n\nTl:dr\n\nA memorable game with all the makings for a great Souls-esque Metroidvania that has hiccups in its simplistic bosses and stagnant difficulty.\n\n9.3/10 The best in the series.","April 2","true","18.2"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","2"

I'm a pretty active "variety" player and try to keep up with new releases on Steam, so I was surprised both that I hadn't heard about it before, nor heard any community chatter elsewhere.\n\nIt's a Metroidvania style platformer with strong, responsive controls, and enjoyable combat mechanics. My first hour or so was somewhat punishing -- it's an unexpectedly challenging game, but things really clicked for me after about 30-45 minutes, and I started enjoying myself quite a lot. I did my first playthrough in one sitting, in about 4.5 hours, and realized there are multiple endings, and things I missed, so I do plan to go back for another playthrough sometime soon. I'm not usually huge on replaying games (there are a lot of games, and I like to play a wide variety), but I had such a good time with Momodora, and there's enough here that compels me to see it through a second time.\n\nOne of my favorite games so far this year. :)","May 3","true","4.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

What really makes it come together are the tight controls, great interconnected level design, and a moveset in which all the possible actions complement each other very well. It uses a setup very reminescent of Dark Souls when it comes to save points, useable items and eventually warping, and these mechanics help to keep up the tension throughout.\n\nOh, and as someone who is indifferent to most pixel art, I still have to say that this game's art and animations are absolutely gorgeous and make the best of the medium.","March 19","true","6.7"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

Most people seem to call it a mixture of Castlevania SOTN and Dark Souls, which I somewhat agree with. It clearly has drawn inspiration from the gameplay of SOTN and the story/lore of Dark Souls. But it lacks the depth of them.\n\nI just beat the game in 3 hours and 34 minutes with 97% of the map discovered, which kind of confused me. Is the game pulling a SOTN twist on me? Is there an upside down castle somewhere? Well, I got the achievement for "True ending", so I don't think that is the case, but I hope I'm wrong.\n\nThe game started hard, really hard, and kept the difficulty up even after you learned the ropes by introducing a few new enemies and new bosses with their own patterns and strategies, but after getting the first (and as far as I know the only) upgrade to your weapon about 3/4 in, every boss battle turns into a joke. I beat the final boss in a single go in less than 3 minutes, which is disappointing to me. (I'm really hoping there is a "true" final boss to be discovered!)\n\nThe OST is fantastic. Very moody piano stuff, again clearly inspired by SOTN.\nGameplay wise, it's nothing special. I hate to keep referencing SOTN, but think of that, but dumbed down a bit. It's still very fun and feels good.\n\nMy only complaint is that the game falls flat towards the end. It stops introducing new characters, throws an unnamed miniboss battle at you and suddenly you're in the last room of the game fighting the last boss.\n\nI guess the journey is more important than the destination in this case.\n\nAnd the journey was a good one.","March 5","true","4.1"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

My favorite before this game was momodora 2 because of exploration alone. momodora 3 was a great title as it was closer to a megaman zero style of gameplay. But with all that said let’s talk about Reverie Under the Moonlight shall we?\n\n**NO SPOILERS**\n\n-Exploration/Environment/Details and Secrets-\nBefore this game came out i was very worried that it would have the same fate as Momodora 3, a great game that ended too short, due to little exploration. I’m glad that the developers took note on this issue and greatly expanded the world of Momodora 4. if you played Castlevania symphony of the Night you'll feel right at home with Momodora 4.This world is also filled with character puzzles to solve, Hidden passages, mini Quests which reward you with either a weapon upgrade or an item with an effect. This open world environment similar to symphony of the night is what the momodora series needed (momodora 2 comes pretty close though).\n\ngameplay♥♥♥♥♥♥ences/art style\ni can't help it but I’m getting the feeling that Momodora 4 borrowed some elements from BloodBorne (which is a good thing) . Even the first enemies in the game can still pose a threat if you don't respect them enough (very similar to the soul’s games). When seeing the combat/dodging system in the trailer i felt like it was going to be a useless gimmick of the game... boy was i wrong! Similar to devil may cry, if you don't figure out the boss/enemies attacks and you don't dodge them right you will die... A LOT! As for references to other games i feel this game borrows elements from: bloodborne, Metroid, castlevania , and megaman zero. On that note I have to say I’m impressed by the way I found NO GLITCHES in the game so far and the mechanics of the game run solid and smooth.\n\nReplay value\nThis game has great replay value! If you beat the game with a “good ending” the game gives you the option to replay it with most of the items you picked up but from the beginning of the game! This gives the player a great chance to help a character they might have missed or choose a different method of doing things.\n\nReligion?\nLike it or not, this game is heavily religious based although it’s more of the “momodora religion” then something real. But this actually made me think “what would a priestess do?” as certain parts of the game had you choose in somewhat a religious manner. Being non-religious myself I had no problem with this element in the game.\n\n\nEndings\nLike other momodora titles you must achieve certain items by helping some characters (or if you find the item through hidden parts of the game) in order to get the True ending. This gives character design more importance and meaning as you take the time to understand each character and their specific needs.\n\n-Music-\nThe music was great as always, I feel the music this time around tried hard to be bloodborne with a momodora sytle but that’s just my personal opinion.\n\nIn conclusion I have played many a game in my day and I have to say that this one is definitely a Triple A title! I feel this game was a great mile stone in the series and it will establish an even bigger fan base. I feel this 4th installment sets a new tone for the development team as before they were small and now they put a Big game out there and for many this is their first momodora game.\n\nI don’t rate games this high often but I have to say this game is easily a 9/10.\nA damn good game!\n","March 9","true","18.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

On the shoreline, a priestess who comes from the village of Lun has arrived. She needs to get an audience with the queen to save the region. Will she get this audience in time or will it be too late?\nMomodara: Reverie Under the Moonlight, is a 2D platformer with really great pixel artworks. This game is the fourth in the series. You will take control of the priestess of Lun and you will be armed with extraordinary weapons - I’ll give it to you straight up: a maple leaf and a bow, for good measure. Every time you kill an enemy not only will he or she vanish, but pink diamonds (that’s what I will call them) appear for the taking. Basically, it’s money, and you will be able to purchase items from some characters with them. Writing this, you will come across a chest which also holds plenty of money. In some places, you will be able to investigate and you will earn interesting items which you can equip you in your active or passive slots from your inventory.  To give you an example, you might have in the active slot (three slots in total) “Bellflower” and every time you activate it, you will regenerate more health. In regards to the passive slots (of which you have two), it could be the “Astral Charm” which enables you to get more money each time you get rid of an enemy.\n\nIn terms of bosses, they are interesting, and when you find the right pattern, you will be able to eliminate them pretty quickly. Bear in mind, I have being playing this game in the normal difficulty; if you want to step the difficulty up you can do so and try the hard difficulty.\n\nIn terms of the controls, they are slick and responsive. You will be able to jump, double jump and roll to avoid an enemy or their projectiles but also get behind them for the kill. Slash your way through with your exceptional Maple Leaf or use your bow easily.\n\nGraphically, I really enjoy the pixel artworks and animations. The soundtrack is good and the levels are well-designed.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great Pixel Artworks and animations\n-	Levels are very well-designed\n-	Good and fluid controls\n-	Trading cards and achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Could be more challenging\n\nMomodara: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a very good 2D platformer.

Well worth the $10 price.\n\nMy only real gripes are that I dislike the instant death spike pits. Id much prefer if they took off a large amount of health. I think every bell should be able to be warped to and that the warping should be done on the map, where you can see the actual location you're going to. Those are the only flaws I can think of and they are reall just totally personal. The game controls great, the musics pretty good and the animations and art are beautiful. This is probably the best Souls-like 2D platformer I have played, personally. Though, the similarities are a bit minor. Its clearly more of a Symphony of the Night-inspired game than a Souls-inspired game. The bosses are all pretty fun and unique. The subtle story is a nice touch, too. I wonder why not many people seem to talk about this game? Total reccomendation to anyone that wats a simpler Symphony of the Night.","May 16","true","6.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazeyhooves/recommended/428550/","hazeyhooves","Haze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazeyhooves/","246 products in account","A game that wants to be Metroidvania crossed with Dark Souls. and it almost gets it right. I don't think it fully understands either genre at their core.\n\nIt doesn't quite get the pacing of exploration and upgrades to call it a good Metroid style of game. the map is a bit too linear, with a few obvious shortcuts between areas, and marked inaccessible areas that you can backtrack to later for secret trinkets. Though there's only one ability that really matters for exploration: transforming into a cat. The rest is just finding specific keys instead of abilities, though the map doesn't give a clear sense of direction for the non-linear mid-game. You don't really advance in power very much, as even if you find a bunch of new items, they all must compete for your 5 equipment slots. You can swap them out in the pause menu, but it's so much of a hassle I didn't bother except during boss fights. however, the offensive upgrades are so ridiculously good that every other item seems superfluous.\n\nAnd though the game goes for higher than average difficulty, it's no Dark Souls either. it's a little too easy to learn enemy patterns, since it's just a 2D platformer. for defense and maneuvering, rolling solves everything. honestly, most of the difficulty is in the damage you take when hit (on Normal or above). even with a lot of HP upgrades, you can maybe survive 5 hits instead of 3. the refillable healing items, though similar to Estus, seem more like a crutch than a feature. "I can brute force this many mistakes." In other words, it's an easy game that punishes you hard when you slip up, instead of a hard game that gives you some freedom for trial and error.\n\nDespite all those flaws, I still really like this game and think it's worth it. From the above influences I mentioned, it also does so many things right. Boss fights are fun and intense, and feel much more balanced to the game system. The platforming and action are so smooth and fine tuned. The creepy atmosphere and feeling of isolation. Fragmented and intentionally vague storyline that requires some piecing together. Very minimal use of cutscenes (whew!) but still some interesting NPCs that flesh out the setting. Well, I wish you could interact with the NPCs a little more, such as when you're a cat. Missed opportunity, I demand more cat gameplay.\n\nDo I even need to mention the graphics when you can watch the trailer yourself? It's amazing, and I'm not easily impressed. Far too many indie games go for ~rEtRo PiXeLs~ without knowing how to properly use them. some of them compensate with overly fluid animation that looks completely out of place... or worse, pseudo-minimalism. But this game is a genuine example of pixel art done tastefully. And to be honest, I really love the CaveStory-esque flat color sprites. I want more games in that style.","March 27","true","7.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stovepipes/recommended/428550/","stovepipes","Natie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stovepipes/","127 products in account","I've played through both Momodora II (a free game available off Steam) and III and have always been a huge fan of the games' visual aesthetic (which has gotten progressively better with each installment), but I always believed the actual gameplay of the series was only decent. III in particular was so close to being a great game, but the permanent death pitfalls which were prevalent everywhere didn't mesh well with the style the game was going for: a more Metroid styled game with emphasis on combat. I still consider Momodora III to be a fine game, and would recommend playing through at least that game before this to see the recent progression in the series (especially seeing as the game is currently only $4!)\n\nThe reason I suggest playing III before Reverie Under the Moonlight (RUtM) is because the progression from that game to this one is astounding. Visually, this game is staggering: I'd go as far as to say it features my favorite pixel art of any game I've ever played. The screenshots and trailer are flattering but still fail to fully express just how much of an artistic triumph the game's visuals are. Despite this, the visuals aren't the most noteworthy improvement in RUtM, rather, it's the gameplay which finally excels beyond just "good enough". The game's controls are responsive, simple, and intuitive; for example, the melee attack can be chained into a simple 3 hit combo which is powerful at the expense of (fair) vulnerability. Unlike prior entries in the series, RUtM features enemies which not only look nice, but actually present challenge to the player, especially in situations with small mobs. Most of my deaths in RUtM resulted from misplaying against enemies rather than the dreaded pitfalls of Momodora III, which to me was far less frustrating. As (many) others have mentioned, the game also draws a fair bit of influence from the Souls series as well. The challenging enemies, bosses, and active item system all are easily comparable to Dark Souls counterparts, for example, the HP-restoring Bellflowers in the game are basically the Momodora Estus flask, refilling whenever you reach a save point. This is a very good thing, as the challenges in RUtM require the player to actually "git gud" and learn enemy/boss patterns and play mindfully rather than just mindfully hack and slash away enemy hordes. Bosses have always been a strength of the Momodora series, and RUtM delivers a large handful of bosses which demand pattern recognition and are difficult, but immensely satisfying to defeat.\n\nI have few faults with RUtM, and almost all of them have to do with the game's brevity rather than its core. I'm not talking about the duration of the game (took me ~6 hours to beat and there is a New Game+ which I'll be playing through in the future), but rather aspects of the game which I believe could have been more thoroughly implemented. Passive equipment is present in the game, but there really aren't many choices and some of the passive items are blatantly superior and eat away your very limited equip slots. Additionally, the currency in the game (munny, which functions EXTREMELY similarly to Souls in Dark Souls) is abundant but there really aren't enough merchants in the game. The merchants that are in the game don't sell many items at all, having at most 3 items for sale. While exploration in the game is encouraged and there are several notable rewards awaiting more prying players, I really wish there were more "hidden" areas, especially ones which rewarded the player with weapon upgrades, good passive equipment, etc.\n\nIn short, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game which really is as nice (perhaps even better) than it looks and is the first installment in the series I'd call an excellent game. Its shortcomings simply add up to it leaving you wanting more, rather than being disappointed with the game itself. $10 is a steal for a game with this much polish!","April 2","true","6.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Enemies feel at home with the different area locations. THE BACKGROUNDS are phenominal. I loved Momodora 1 - 3, but this game with only 2 hours under my belt, feels every bit better than its predecessor, in the same way that each game has felt more and more its own, and as far from a cave story clone as you can get.\n\nMusic: right from the main menu splash screen is spot on.\n\nGameplay: Is it hard - Yes? I feel challenging is more appropriate. But the balance is more towards generic enemies do a ton of dmg per hit. Not insta kill, but enough that you should always attack first and see if their not hostile later.\n\nThank you to the developer for including a SotN style map.

All of the animations, both for the main character and the enemies/bosses are very good, and the controls are tight.  The items have flavor text reminiscent of From Software games, and the NPC interactions should seem familiar too.  It's a very short game, but that's probably for the best.  There are in-game ways to get 100% completion pretty easily, which is a big plus for me, though if you're not that worried about it you can instead use the item slots to buff your attacks ect.  There's also newgame+ if you don't care about finding everything in one playthrough, though the differences are pretty slight.  The music is also very nice, and mostly contained to boss fights.\n\nAbsolutely buy this game if you have ever enjoyed a metroidvania.","March 6","true","6.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Momodora III was a cool game but this is on another level entirely.\n\nWhat particularly striked me is the attention to details (in animations, backgrounds and other things) despite the pixel style. You can tell they really cared about polishing every aspect of the game.\n\nThe plot is minimalistic but the storytelling of the game goes beyond the (actually well written) few interactions with the characters, and seems to build mostly from the atmosphere of the various environments you explore. Also from a lot of details as I mentioned above (something as simple as the animation the character does when presenting herself tells a lot about her personality, for example).\n\nAs far as the gameplay is concerned, the various movement techs + strategies required (particularly in higher difficulties) make it pretty interesting and challenging. Good enough to be considered seriously for speedrunning.\n\nThe only thing I'm slightly reserved about is the enemy balance which could have been better imo. When playing in Insane, some of the early areas turn out to be the hardest because some early enemies are maddening. On the other hand, the final boss turns out to be relatively easy with a few dull phases.\n\nThat's relatively minor concerns though and I highly recommend the game.","March 7","true","17.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's a description you've probably read a million times before.  Now before you mentally checkout on this game, take notice that Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a legit very good game and one of the better 2D action games I've played in years.\n\nControls and Combat\nIn this type of game, the two things you're going to do most are running/jumping around as you explore and fight enemies.  M:RUM does both well.  At first, the controls might feel slightly deliberate, but you'll soon get used to them and by the end of the game you'll be flying across the screen with air-dashes as a cat and it all just feels good.  The character mobility as you progress throughout the game is great. You're never fighting the controls, and the roll dodge mechanic is worked in quite well and it's not something you see in many 2D action games.\n\nCombat is a bit simple.  You have your melee combo attack and a bow with infinite arrows and long-range.  Most enemy encounters are rather simple outside of their consistently strong character design and you're best bet is to rush and bring the offensive to them instead of sitting back and trying to gauge their attacks.  Despite that, combat just feels good.  This is completely a "feel" thing, but I never got tired of fighting regular enemies despite the general nature of encounters being rather limited in options.  It helps that no enemies are health sinks, as most enemies die after a few hits and never become a chore to fight.\n\nGameplay Design\nThe level design and interactivity is very well-done.  You can legitimately play a large portion of the game in any order you want.  You unlock power-ups by finishing each area that increase your mobility, combat ability, and give you the ability to warp, but there's nothing stopping you from doing so in any particular order.  This gives the game a lot of replay value.  Almost all bosses have unlockable shortcuts that place them right next to a save point.\n\nMomodora has an equip/item system where consumable items recharge at save points.  I really like this mechanic in games that use it and here, it mainly deals with healing items.  Equipment is varied and versatile.  There's all kind of accessories that do things like add fire to your attacks, serve as a magnet for coins, give a beep if you're in a room with a secret item and much more.  There's a ton of mix-and-matching to do if you want to vary up your playstyle a bit.\n\nOther Stuff\nVisually the game is quite nice, though I wish there were less dark areas.  Places like the forest and park look really nice and vibrant and I wish there was a bit more to the locale design color palette.  Animations are also great.  Things like rolling, notching arrows, attacking and using items look good and it doesn't look like any corners were cut.\n\nAnother big drawing point in this type of game is secrets, and there are quite a lot.  Don't want to spoil anything but there are a lot of little touches in the game that make it worth replaying.  As for replaying, there's a new game+ that lets you keep all non plot-skills and items you unlocked which lets you just blow through the game at leisure and I'm a fan of this type of NG+.\n\nNegatives\nFinally, I'll get to some of the negative points of the game, which are mostly technical.  First off, no remappable buttons.  This is weird and is something I hope gets patched in.  Next, the in-game V-Sync seems to not work and there is minor screen tearing.  This is another thing that seems like it should be patched.  The "you got hit" sound effect is also quite harsh and shrill, and I wish I could tone it down.  Oh yeah, and a dedicated map button would be nice, too.  3-30-16 EDIT:  A dedicated map button has been patched in, along with remappable keyboard controls, though no gamepad remapping is available.\n\nOn the non-technical side, my major gripe is the instant death spikes.  These things are terrible in every game they're in, and they especially bad here, since it seems like they should just do some damage and let you leap out of them, but no, you just barely tap one and you're dead.  This is by far the most annoying aspect of the gameplay, especially when you cover a decent bit of distance only to hit a spike right before a save point.  Making spikes just give a percentage of damage would make the game much less artificially aggravating and not hurt the the level of difficulty at all.\n\nTwo lesser quibbles are that enemies do more damage then their attacks suggest, which will put you on the brink of death without you realizing it at times.  The last negative is something I touched on before, enemy encounters tend to feel rather samey, though killing stuff remains fun enough.\n\nConclusion\nThat's a lot of words.  In short, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is one of the better 2D actions games I've played in years.  Non-linear level design lets you progress in any direction you adventure with little artificial gating.  Character mobility is great.  The item and equipment systems are well-done and give a good dose of variety to the game.  There's no fat or filler to hit some predetermined playtime requirement.  This is just a very good, well-designed game I'd recommend to anyone that likes 2D actions games and/or Metroidvania elements in their games.","March 6","true","9.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","2"

It came at the midpoint of a period of wide-open exploration where I could've fought any one of four bosses, all of them interesting. That battle was extremely difficult, but never unfair, and when, after more deaths than I care to admit, I realized the mistake in spacing that had kept me from winning and corrected it, I had to give serious thought to whether this was the best game I'd ever played.\n\nTwo hours later, it was over.\n\nI'd beaten the final boss (still fun, but nowhere near as exciting as that midpoint one), gotten the true ending and been dumped into new game plus with not much else to do. This prequel is the longest Momodora game, but its predecessors were exceptionally short.\n\nHow important is the length of the game? For a Metroidvania title like this, a short playtime means not just less to enjoy, but less to explore. That glorious feeling of being able to go anywhere and face anything in whatever order I wanted ended all too soon.\n\nI unreservedly recommend Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. It’s at turns beautiful, adorable, and unsettling, the controls are among the best I've ever played with, the level design is great, the boss design is better, and there's a stretch toward the middle of the game where it approaches legendary status. There's just ultimately not enough of it for it to stay there.","May 17","true","6.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chosencharacter/recommended/428550/","chosencharacter","No Problem c:","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chosencharacter/","183 products in account","Before you downvote, read this: I'm a Momodora fan. I'm totally willing to change this review if the problems I bring up here are addressed, maybe now, maybe in Momodora 5. Who knows. But these issues have been around for a while in this series and they need to be fixed.\n\nAlso, I got the True Ending and was playing on Medium.\n\nThis game is kinda a one step forward, two steps back deal. If you haven't played Momodora 1, 2, and 3, here's a quick background:\n\nMomodora is a series that follows a shrine maiden (or two) as she is sent to defeat an evil queen of ___ who is the source of a curse on their village by wrecking ♥♥♥♥ with a maple leaf. They are all platformers, and they all feature both a melee attack and a ranged attack. The first one was just a level based game, the second one (my favorite and imo the top of the series) was a metroidvania with permanent passive upgrades, and the third one featured two characters, a return to linear levels, and a new passive item management system.\n\nThis game is pretty much a mix of 2 and 3, with both passive permanent upgrades and additional charms you can equip for effects. It's also a metroidvania, but the level design is more linear than 2.\n\nSo let's talk about the goods and the bads.\n\nTheme: Unlike the other games that were a bit more chipper, this game is rather dark. Yes it has cats, yes it has cute one eyed demons, but everything else is death and misery. It's a "feel like crap" ride until the end. If you're looking for anything uplifting or cute, look elsewhere, since you won't find it here.\n\nThe story is... honestly pretty eh. It doesn't really do much to change the Momodora formula OTHER than make it darker, which just isn't enough. I don't really care about any of the chars and they don't have as much personality despite them saying more. Really story has never been Momodora's strong suite, and for some reason I felt like I cared even less about chars in this game than the other. Maybe it's because in this one they were forced more, DevArt OC melodrama style. It just didn't work. Even the evil queens in the other game seemed to have more personality, in this one I just didn't feel anything as I was fighting her.\n\nGraphics:\n\nGorgeous. Nothing bad to say here. I liked the cute chibi chars of the other games but style wise I see why the artist wanted to move on. I only have one complaints: For some reason the devs decided to turn the lights off, Binding of Isaac Curse of Darkness style, for half the levels (there's an item to get rid of this for a minute or so but it's one use until you hit the next checkpoint.) It's not even a spelunky "shroud of blackness," it's more like playing an original gameboy without a backlight. Either turn the brightness up on this game or you won't be able to see a thing. Seriously.\n\nPlatforming:\n\nIt's worse than the other games, honestly. Maybe it's the bigger hitboxes, or maybe it's the obsession with tiny platforms and one hit kill spikes in this game. The jump also feels shorter. There is a double jump, but it's Little Mac-level awful, and honestly I'm not quite sure why it's there. I feel like it used to be stronger when initially made but it was nerfed at some point, hard, and it really shouldn't have been. I often found myself jumping at a platform that I really felt I should be able to make but... can't. And it wasn't the metroidvania 'I'll get an upgrade for this later' (you don't) it was Maplestory Jump Quest level "why can't I just hit this?"\n\nCombat:\n\nIt's both better and worse, and altogether more defensive. For the first time ever, you now have a roll, and though it's a bit finnicky and doesn't quite 'feel' right to be honest, it's necessary to deal with like 3/4 of what this game throws at you. Altogether the attacks switched from platforming style 'jump/run from the bullets' to 'just roll.'\n\nYour maple leaf in this game is SIGNIFICANTLY slower and carries a whole lot less range. It also forces you significantly forward, which makes you often walk right into people's hitboxes. I mean, it's more interesting than the classic Momodora "stand and mash attack as fast as you can" but it's also more frustrating.\n\nRanged seems to be the way to go, honestly. For the first time ever, this ninja shrine maiden has a bow instead of charms, and she spams arrows as fast as the other shrine maidens spam melee. Of course they deal almost no damage, though, and it takes a while, but it's the safest option.\n\nDifficulty:\n\nRight onto it. This game is really frickin' hard. For some reason, starting from Momodora 3 this game took a turn for "you either get the easiest game ever or you pay dearly." If you pick easy, expect an almost insulting level of easy - you're practically invincible. If you pick Normal, though, prepare for what another game would consider Hard. It's not even a fun kind of challenge difficulty, it's a frustrating difficulty.\n\nThe bosses are meat shields that abuse the heck out of projectiles (roll often) or deal incredibly hard melee damage. They also seem to highlight all the issues with both platforming and combat. For example, one individual, the arsonist, cannot be attacked with melee. Why? Because though she has hitstun animations and it seems like the devs intended her to be melee-able, there is always fire on the ground around her. In other Momodora's you could stand and attack, but since attacking moves you forward in this game, you ALWAYS walk into the fire. Your only options are to either spam arrows and slooooooowly chip damage or wait for your partner (who's never elaborated on why she's there or helping you) to kill her for you (which takes a while.)\n\nIn fact, almost all the bosses in this game encourage you to just stand and spam projectiles. There's one boss with a giant sword that deals more than half your life in melee damage. I spent an hour trying to take her down the hard way, but the fact that she always broke in and out of hitstun seemingly randomly and avoiding her finnicky sometimes pixel perfect attacks was just frustrating, and I instead decided to just pelt arrows until she died. Not what I consider fun, and compared to the other Momodra's bosses? Bad.\n\nThere is also a specific collectible, the ivory bug, that is extremely hard to see. It's like 3 pixels or so and is often obscured by some foreground object. The challenge of collectibles should be uncovering the secret passage or doing the platforming challenge to get them, not seeing the dang thing.\n\nEtc.:\n\nThere are some "it's 2016 and this is the 4th game in the series so why is this still a thing" problems with this game. See, I'm sure this was brought up before because Momodora 3 had the same issue: This game needs a serious epilepsy warning, when you get hit, it flashes bright red, when you die, it flashes red and black repeatedly and it hurts your eyes. If you fall into spikes prepare to get assaulted with both the flashing red of getting hit multiple times and then the death spam. Why can't we just do a pause and fade to black, Metroid style? Or just shake the screen? Anything but this works.\n\nAlso, there aren't any recongifurable controls. I personally found the keyboard controls questionable and there were things I wanted to switch (I'd love to use space or F to roll instead of the out of the way Q) and everyone has their own opinions, so why force us to use these controls? I used the xbox controls and it gave you a whopping two configurations that switched two buttons and that's it. Again, it's 2016, this is the 4th game in the series, this problem was here in Momodora 3 too, why is this still a thing?\n\nConclusion:\n\nDo I regret the 6 hours it took me to beat this game? No. Would I recommend it? Well, if you're a Momodora fan, or you're willing to put up with some pretty questionable design decisions, then okay. But I expected better from this series. Buy it to support the devs, but don't expect gold like Momodora 2.

The music alone is worth playing this game. There are difficulty options that allow players to take in the environment and cruise through the combat as well as cranking up the challenge and getting one shot by a normal enemy.\n\nI can't exclaim enough how well the environments have been crafted to loop around and connect with eachother. Momorda feels like the designer truly thought out level placement and key locations allowing players shortcuts to savepoints and progression paths. This isnt a randomly generated map, and it shouldnt be. If thats what you are looking for then move on, as Momorda is hand crafted to feel like a world. I love it level design.\n\nEnemy placement as well as boss design is top notch. Bosses have recognizable patterns (you might die a few times before seeing the patterns) that allow for skillful dodging through abilities.\n\nThe combat has a very meaty feel. You attack with a weapon that seems like it wouldnt work, but when your character cuts an imp in half and the screen shakes you suddenly realize she isnt to be messed with. One minor gripe I have with the combat is that it is two directional. Left or Right, the player is unable to attack upward or downward (with either the melee or ranged weapon). This initially was strange but is a minor annoyance to someone who has played metroid and is used to being able to shoot in eight directions.\n\nVery recommended.","March 14","true","3.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It only took me a few hours to beat, but there were very few points where i wasn't having much fun.\n\nIt has a Dark Souls feel to it without feeling like a dark souls clone.  It uses healing items the renew at checkpoints (in addition to any other consumable item), challenging boss fights (that give bonuses give you defeat them without getting hit for a reason to go back to them), and a nice, sprawling map that loops back (with shortcuts and eventual warping).  All of these things exist outside of Dark Souls as well, but playing the game I got a distinct feeling that the devs had played Dark Souls and wanted to incorporate some elements of Dark Souls' design into their game.  There is some platforming but it never feel terribly unfair or frustrating.  And, all in all, I think it works very well and the game felt great to play.\n\nThere's no change in weapons but it didn't seem needed; the game felt well balanced around the moves and weapons you have.  I will say that some of the extra rewards for defeating bosses without getting hit break the power curve a bit, but you're not likely to get them on your first playthrough so I doubt it would cause most players any issue.\n\nI struggled the most at the beginning (mostly getting into a groove) but once I got going with few issues.  There were a few points where I was stuck wondering where to go, but pulling up the map (Castlevania SotN/Super Metroid styled) and checking areas that weren't fully explored eventually got me to where I needed to be.\n\nThe pixel art was very well done; absolutely gorgeous to look at.  The title is a particular standout though there are plenty of good touches throughout the game.  Grass rustles as you run through it, hanging lanterns move when there's anything that shakes the screen, water has refection, there's all sort of details that give the game an extra bit of life.\n\nThe music in this game was fantastic; it never overpowered the game but most certainly added to the atmosphere very well.  I don't know the best way to put it into words, but there was never a track that played that drew my attention away from the game and yet was memorable enough for comment.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this to anyone who likes metroidvania games, Dark Souls, or action platformers.  I bought it on a whim and it's been one of the most solid gaming experiences I've had recently.  It's short (I beat it in about 3-4 hours), but it never drags so I say that the length is appropriate.","March 19","true","12.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I saw two screenshots and was like, "Well, I'm buying that right now." Didn't even look at the trailer. And I gotta tell you, I'm SO glad I did, because 'Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight' is an absolutely fantastic game.\n\n-- PROS --\n\n- Gorgeous, big sprites with excellent animation (I like the little touches like the leaves that appear when she double jumps, how her legs move when she jumps (cute socks!) and the variety of attack animations)\n- Detailed, lovingly rendered backgrounds (I found it awesome how the backgrounds were SO DETAILED and yet were not distracting (this is actually pretty hard to do) - and every area has unique touches not in other areas - skulls, brickwork, trees, etc)\n- Great atmosphere. As soon as you enter the main city of the game, you know it - and the dark, foreboding tone is tangible and exciting. VERY well done.\n- Really good music - I found myself replaying areas just to listen to the music (which is always a great sign!)\n- The presentation throughout is just top notch. Gorgeous pixel art, the menus are really well done and snappy, the UI is clear and immediately understandable - Just really, really well done.\n- Interesting, varied enemies to fight.\n- Exciting (and often surprising) boss battles.\n- The pacing is also really well done. I never felt overwhelmed - and the checkpoints (which are unique, 'Smack that bell!') are placed far enough apart to be challenging, but no so far as to be unfair.\n- Finally, I just found the experience very compelling. Once I starting playing, I HAD to keep going. I had to see where this story went.\n\n-- CONS --\n\n- I don't believe the engine the game was written in supports vsync, so when I was scrolling the map around, there was some screen tearing. This was the only place in the game where this happened to me, and it's not a deal breaker, but I thought I'd mention it.\n- The game does start pretty difficult. It's by design, since it's making sure that the player understands essential things (like how to dodge through enemies to get behind them), but I can see how this could turn some people off. The difficulty cools off once you get to the city and then slowly ramps up again. So, that's good. Again, this is not THAT bad, but I thought I'd mention it. (these are more nitpicks than anything else)\n\n-- TL;DR --\n\nA fantastic, very well made action platformer with great tone and engaging gameplay. Once I started playing I couldn't stop and it took me nine hours to beat the game (with 100% completion of the map - I like to look for secrets ^_^). This is the fourth 'Momodora' game, and it's by far the most polished. (Don't worry if you haven't played any of the other games in the series, though - This one stands by itself). I absolutely enjoyed this game and eagerly look forward to whatever the developer works on next!\n\n-- FINAL GRADE --\n\n9 out of 10","March 12","true","10.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The boss battles were memorable and the standard enemies seldom feel like an annoyance.\n\nMomodora's pixel artstyle can turn a lot of people away. Admittedly, a lot of the NPCs and some enemies do seem rather minimalistic to the point where they are perhaps a little too blocky, but the work on the background and bosses is way above par.

Much darker than Momodora 1-3 when it comes to themes, dialogues and overall design. The longer story and better characterization are still left to be desired, but it's, as it always goes for Momodora games, justified by how polished it is for what it's worth. And surprisingly, RUtM shines the most in technical aspect, meaning the controls are precise, the button layout on the gamepad is nothing short of perfect and the itemization is designed to not burden the player. One game series I won't worry about, considering how every new entry just gets better and better.","March 13","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I originally found the first two games for free on the developer's website.[www.bombservice.com]It's honestly been pretty cool to see this series evolve.\n\nThe controls in every game are really simple, including this one. You can use your controller this time as well. Combat in Momo 4 is pretty neat since they added dodging. Attacking with your leaf is a little slower than in the previous games, but the animation looks really nice. There's also a ranged attack, which I don't think I've seen since Momo 2. It's really good for picking off common enemies at a distance.\n\nThe environments are pretty (more exploration, woo!), the music fits the atmosphere really well, and the art is as cute and pixely as always. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for an action platformer to play.

I love exploring every single nook and cranny to find all of the secrets and hidden collectables.

The art style is amazing and the soundtrack is atmospheric and ambient.  The boss fights are fun and the few puzzles that there are can provide quite the challenge.

I have never done a review of anything before but this made me want to do one sense I have tried my best to 100% it and all. I personally dont really like platformering pixelish games but this one cought my attention for some reason. The artstyle is really nice. In-game enviorments have some pretty cool contrasts when it comes to colouring and what not. It was really fun, the story could have been made a little more straightforward however. Alot of the world is hidden in item descriptions, and is very ugh.. ''Souls-ish'', dont really have a better way to describe it.\nGameplay is pretty straight forward, Dodge button Melee button Ranged Attack button. Then you have the activatable items wich can be anything from flowers with thorns that heal you or a bloody tissue that shoots blue balls of magic. I thought the game was very EASY and that was on my first playthrough on Hard Mode (and I'am not a very dedicated 2D platformer action RPG whatever this is player). So if you are more experienced with these kinds of games I'd recommend rushing HM and then doing NG+.\n\nSome small stuff like not being able to animation cancel might put people off but its a fun game none the less and I'd reccomend it if you want some pretty fun boss battles. \o/","March 15","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plenty of different paths await you that you can take to find your way towards the next area. The game rewards your exploration - numerous times, I would explore and find bonus items, some of which being able to be used to go and unlock other things from previous levels. The combat is really enjoyable, with each boss being challenging, albeit doable.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. There's no doubt about it, this is one of the prettiest games I've seen in a long while, and the aesthetics blend into the music perfectly. My favourite area, Whiteleaf Memorial Park, was serene and beautiful, and the music... this is a game that I could just have open and listen to for hours and hours.\n\nThe game is challenging - it isn't all THAT hard (though keep in mind I played on Normal difficulty, I'll do a Hard run soon) but some bosses can and WILL hold you up for a while. The bosses are quite charming with their variety and they definitely are quite fun to fight against, as well - you have massive witch ladies to a knight/archer duo, everything giving its utmost to take you down.\n\nThe story isn't anything special, but it doesnt need to be. You're a priestess on her way through the land to stop the spread of a taint that has reached your homeland, and that's all there is too it. It's very simplistic, but it plays well into the setting and allows for some fun creativity in abilities that you can use to sprint and dodge your way through the Kingdom of Karst.\n\nShould you buy this game? Yes, without a doubt. It's worth every single penny.","March 8","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is fantastic blend of lots of elements. It's a Metroidvania style game with a lovely art style, it reminds me a little bit of Monster World IV. The game is also quite challenging, but if you get a little stuck you can always do some exploration until you feel ready to brave whatever area got you stuck. I got stuck on a particular boss but I went off into areas of the map I had not yet discovered until I got a few more powerups and items to help me overcome the challenge.\n\nLovely art, controls like a dream, music is very well done... and definitely worth the price of admission!","March 8","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although it is rather short this game is very enjoyable and has a New Game + mode as well I do think its worth the price and the spritework is really good as well as the feel and the enviroments of the game overall.\n\nI managed to finish the game and get pretty much all the secrets in under 5 hours so I do wish it was longer cause I loved it but I saw some reviews of people that took around 8 hours to beat it so maybe I'm just really good at this after playing so many metroidvania titles.

I have never done a review of anything before but this made me want to do one sense I have tried my best to 100% it and all. I personally dont really like platformering pixelish games but this one cought my attention for some reason. The artstyle is really nice. In-game enviorments have some pretty cool contrasts when it comes to colouring and what not. It was really fun, the story could have been made a little more straightforward however. Alot of the world is hidden in item descriptions, and is very ugh.. ''Souls-ish'', dont really have a better way to describe it.\nGameplay is pretty straight forward, Dodge button Melee button Ranged Attack button. Then you have the activatable items wich can be anything from flowers with thorns that heal you or a bloody tissue that shoots blue balls of magic. I thought the game was very EASY and that was on my first playthrough on Hard Mode (and I'am not a very dedicated 2D platformer action RPG whatever this is player). So if you are more experienced with these kinds of games I'd recommend rushing HM and then doing NG+.\n\nSome small stuff like not being able to animation cancel might put people off but its a fun game none the less and I'd reccomend it if you want some pretty fun boss battles. \o/","March 15","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

She also is quite a skilled marksman with her bow, shooting volleys of arrows or rapid-firing to deal alot of damage to her foes.\nThe gameplay consists of traversing through different locations, fighting enemies, exploring every nook and cranny for secrets and fighting area bosses.

Although I was pretty confused with the story, if it even counts as a story, that didn't really detract from my enjoyment. The story is very subtle and you'll probably need to research or play the previous games to figure it out, but its not necessary.

The music doesn't stand out that often but there are some tracks, such as the song that plays when fighting Pardoner Fennel, that really take the cake.\n\nIn short if you like fun, quick games with a good amount of replayability, and a soundtrack that knows when it's time to shine, you will get many many hours out of this wonderful game.","May 20","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gotta say, Reverie Under the Moonlight manages to be even better. They really took the time to polish combat down to a brilliant shine, and it is just fun to play. Item combination keep things fresh and let you change up your style for the situation, animation is fluid and beautiful, and the boss fights are amazing. I also wouldn't be surprised if some enemy and boss designs were partially inspired by Dark Souls because some of those fights really invoke that series. If you want a good Metroidvania style game with emphasis on combat that you can finish up in about 5 hours, this is the game for you. Though you should put in the extra couple of hours to 100% the map and meet the developers!","May 28","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ao__/recommended/428550/","Ao__","lA0l 青","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ao__/","486 products in account","Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a magnificent game, I have not played the others Momodora yet but I am gonna fix this mistake soon.\n\nFirst the gameplay :  Momodora is a metroidvania, and a very good one. The combat mechanics are really enjoyable, I really felt that I can control the character as I want, that fell dumb when I say it but, I mean, some games doesn't have controls as responsive as Momodora. About the difficulty, I have played at "normal" difficulty and the first hour was very surprising, it was difficult, it looks cute but you die very oftenly, but once you got it, it's really enjoyable and chalenging. So I think replay it at "hard" would be a good experience. As I heard, there is also an "insane" difficulty, like a 2D dark soul, where you have to dodge or die.  And you can play as a cat ! As a cat, even if you don't have bow, you move faster and you have a smaller hitbox.\n\nArt :  Really charming. The background, the design, the animation.... Everything looks gorgeous.\n\nMusics and sounds :  As charming as the art and it really fit into the art and it help to create a wonderful ambiance.\n\nStory :  The whole thing is like a fairy tale, it's exatly like the title says : a reverie, a daydream.... It's simple but charming (yeah I don't have a big vocabulary).\n\nSummary :\n\nPros :\n- Good gameplay and balanced difficulty\n- Wonderful art and musics\n- Charming (and I say it again and again) world, I really liked that little journey\n- Support the french language, really surprising, I was used to play indi games in english.\n- you can play as a cat !\n\nCons :\n- Can't remap the controller's controls, but since the basic ones are good it's not a big deal\n- Maybe a little short, (it took me 6 hours to finish the game in normal with most of the secrets discovered) but not a big deal because I think replay can be fun (maybe with a higher difficulty)\n\n95/100 buy it with the ost and everything, it's more than worth the price and it's a steal if you have a discount.","May 15","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Im not super partial to the washed out Cave Story look of the sprites (probably why I didn't play the previous ones) but the art design is undeniably fantastic and the dodge roll mechanic as well as the game's plot, atmosphere and battles gives it a gleefully Dark Souls feel. I also like how solid the gameplay feels, it's polished and doesn't feel floaty or imprecise.","May 2","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not usually a fan of pixel art style but for some reason I love the look here.\n+ The audio and music are a treat and they feel eerie at times\n+ The combat is much improved from the previous Momodora games. This time, you can actually perform combos with your titular primary weapon the leaf. Accompanying your primary you also have a bow as a secondary weapon which replaces your charms from the previous. Equip-able items also makes a return with some added stat based benefits like add poison to attacks. You also have a dodge roll which allows you to roll through enemies at close range. Learn to master this as it's essential in boss battles.\n+ The gameplay is challenging, I played on Normal and found that there was a good mix of challenge.\n+ Fun and memorable boss battles. In the previous games some boss battles were kind of unfair a bit but now they've improved quite a bit.\n+ The achievements, if you're up for it seem like a blast to attain.\n+ Controls are nice and tight and extremely responsive. No slippery nonsense here.\n\nCons- There's no indication of how long you can stand in poison gas before you're poisoned. Though minute it's still applicable.\n- The map needs to be more legible with markings for what area is which. Often times you'd get confused as to which area is which when attempting to warp.\n\nIrritations+/- Boss can break out of their "hitstun" with no warning causing you to take unnecessary damage. Even though this can be avoid it's really annoying when it happens.\n+/- Your jump height feels too small often times you have to use your double jump or jam down on the button too hard just to ensure you get the extra height.\n+/- Can't warp to every bell in the game only a select few. The can prolong the backtrack quite a bit.\n+/- A bit short but I rather it be short, sweet and fun than introduce filler for the sake of it.\n\nVerdictThis is without a doubt the best in the series so far. It combines aspects of 2 and 3 with a tiny bit of Souls and a lot of SoTN for a fantastic game. Even though the game is short around 6 hours on Normal it doesn't fill like it's filled with any filler type bits nor does it overstay its welcome. I must say it's one of my favourite games for the year so far.","May 27","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No frills, no BS, you are at the whim of your own wits, and the meager handful of abilities and power-ups you nab along the way. You are not spoon-fed a story or just playing hop-scotch with the keyboard to get to the next movie, you have to infer a few things for yourself. It's there, and it's rich. And a little heartbreaking. But very, very beautiful.\n\nI have friends who tell me, "oh, Skyrim, I'll be playing that forever." Sure it's a game of 100+ hours, but if you distill the monotony of crap like character customization (aka lazy developers), level grinding (aka fake replayability), item creation (aka cooking class) and complex tech trees you never use half of, that game gets boiled down to probably 20 hours tops. At least, that's what it feels like to me. Suffice to say, if there is a distinct lack of reason that compels me to play, that game has an expiration date long before 100 hours. And don't even get me started on MMOs. It's pretty much, "click on an enemy and push this sequence of number keys and win. Ok do it again. Ok do it again." They're all boring. Scrap all of that and play a real game today.\n\nNow I'll grant you, in this genre with these kinds of platformers, they usually make the difficulty ridiculous. Nigh unapproachable, save the ninja elites. This isn't. This is hard, but not so hard you don't feel like you're getting better, or can't figure it out, or just try a different strategy and it will work. With my mediocre skills, the items you do get are JUST enough, and I like that you don't always have to go to a store or farm items to replenish your supplies. I will say though, Fennel is ALWAYS a pain in the rear. But I'm not even knocking that, she's just the illustration of why impatient people (me) will struggle with this game. There was only about 2 spots where it felt 'remotely' dirty the way I died, falling into a pit of spikes. But when I slowed down just a bit, and paid a little more attention, it was no trouble at all.\n\nPlay this game. "Recommended" is such a drastic understatement of how great it really is.

While this is true that Momo:RUtM carries elements of both in it's gameplay, the atmosphere is carried over the most. Momo:RUtM has a great atmosphere, it is dark, oppressive, and heavy, where you can feel the weight of despair that lingers in the air of this city plagued by demons and the undead. There are wonderfully designed enemies, environments, and music. The controls feel tight, the hit detection sharp, and it is a joy to continue exploring this game to see what is in the next area. I definitely look forward to playing more of the game and the value proposition of this game definitely makes it worth the $9-$10 it is currently on sale for.\n\nHowever this game has some problems. In a word I would summarize my gripes with this game as "Inconsistent." I played this on normal difficulty, and at times the difficulty sine waves between difficult but fair, and ball busting hard. Particullarly a boss called the pardoner, who I encountered in the monastery about an hour in. This is what would be the third-ish boss that I came across. I was not able to beat this boss after over ten tries of varying success. Her attacks are barely telegraphed if at all, making dodging them hard if not outright impossible. Particularly the second attack in her combo which has a massive backswing that makes jumping over and dodge-rolling through very difficult. Along with one attack which curses you temporarily locking the use of your items. the problem with this is that the start of this attack is no different than the other attacks, is VERY fast, and has an AoE that covers a sizable portion of the fighting area. The biggest gripe with this attack in particular is that the attack's AoE kicks up a purple cloud that dissappears, however this cloud can still curse you when it has almost completely vanished and is hard to tell that it is even there anymore. And being cursed means that you cannot heal yourself.\n\nBy the way bug report. There is a small black square of blank space after uncovering the hidden are just to the right of the save point in the room outside of the pardoner's room.\n\nI do feel like I take WAAAAAY too much damage from enemies, regularly loosing anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of my health in a single hit, and needing 2 of the five uses of my healing item to restore that damage. That and the insta kill damage spikes are just a kick in the nuts at times. Maybe 60% of the deaths I've experienced so far I've felt that weren't because I had ♥♥♥♥ed up, but because the game said "Okay you die now. No more HP for you."\n\nSummary: A challenging platformer with great atmosphere and some problems with consistent difficulty.","March 4","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Only complaint is that bosses are really easy with some trash mobs being much harder.\n\nOverall it took me 4 hours to beat the game and IMO was worth the asking price.","March 5","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is rather short, finished a first playthough in around ~3 hours 20, buuuut as it turns out I got a bad ending, so there is some replayability to it in that sense.\nControls are very responsive, and enemy hitboxes are quite fair in the sense that I never got hit by something that really shouldn't have. I have only two particular gripes: Firstly, No seperate button for the map, both start and select open the menu, so you have to shuffle over to it manually, minor but still. Secondly an ability you pick up roughly half-way through *probably* should've been it's own button, rather than taking an active item slot, slightly more inconvenient that the map thing, but still pretty minor.\n\nOverall? I quite highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a nice, tightly controlling combat platformer with a bit of bite to it.\n\nEdit: They have added a map hotkey, so that minor negative is now moot.","March 4","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A short game, but very fun nonetheless. I beat it on normal with moderate difficulty, im sure Hard is much more difficult. The combat felt very fluid, and while not very advanced, I think it benefits from being more simple so you can concentrate more on not dying to some tough patterns. If you like any Metroidvania, Dark Souls, or Touhou games, this is most likely the game for you.\n\nThere is one thing that I didn't like though, and it has to do with how some of the characters are involved with the story. Not much background or resolution has been given to some otherwise interesting characters. They didn't really feel too connected to your story, although I guess the gist of it is that they're all on their own path and end up going their own ways at some point in the story. Not a big deal, but it probably could have added much more to the overall experience.","March 5","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its so gorgeous, the animations are so pretty, the leaf attacking idea is just so amazing and so cute. The FX are also cute as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBut the game design is really really bad. The normal dificulty is too easy, I can kill the bosses by couching and spam-arrowing. I ain't even learning their moves.  Ok so I should move to the hard difficulty. But the hard difficulty is not smarter enemies, is just stronger hp and atk enemies, with one-hit-kill. The hard difficulty bottoms to just memorizing and practicing. Also the feeling of emptyness im this os overwhelming. Every part of it seems the same dark scenario. The game feels warm... not engaging.\n\nThis game has much to learn from Castle in the darkness. That was a true gem. The sound also helped a lot building the joyness. It looked like a true adventure.\n\nI really don't know exactly what makes a game transcend from your regular everyday normal game to a metal gear solid, or a undertale, or a castle in the darkness, those has a real catch to it.\n\nBut momodora, brothers: tale of two sons, woofle, outland.. its just a regular sameness since the very beginning.\n\nBut I think it might be quite random, its impossible to build that specific feeling, you just have to keep trying.\n\nUntil momodora 5!

I saw this game being promoted on by Temmie Chang, an artist that has worked on Undertale, so I figured hey this might be good. After seeing the trailer I immediately saved up to buy it ASAP.\n\nAfter installation and booting up I was greeted by this pixel wonder menu screen and mesmerizing music but... yeah.. Things go a little bit awry when I tried to configure the controls because there's none. I mean sure I could switch from 3 control schemes but that's about it. Admittingly I don't own an Xbox 360 controller or any sort of controller (I should get one) so that crosses out the controller schemes out the window.\n\nI looked at the button setup for the keyboard since it's the only choice I have and I was kinda disappointed because I cannot change the bindings. YES THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE BINDINGS. Not that it's a major thing that will affect the entire experience though.\n\nI started a new game and everything reminded me of my castlevanias, and that was the magic charm I was expecting to come along this game. The character controls fluidly and tight, an important factor for games like this. She has weight to her movement which is great because it synergizes with the responsive butter smooth controls. The hitbox is sweet and precise and you can feel the great force of every attack you try to land.\n\nGraphics wise it's reminiscent of ye old retro pixels which is one of the reasons why I bought this game (and due to hardware limitations). Everything is done with heart from the character animation to the little tid bits that happen in the background. I have no complaint with the overall art style and presentation. Pure bliss.\n\nThe music is superb. It reminds me of the good old days of the SNES. Not much to say.\n\nMy only gripe about the game so far is the inability to change the keyboard bindings. It's a personal thing of mine to tinker with the config and adjust the controls to my taste. I frankly found it confusing when I was engaging in battle as I try my best to press the jump button only to keep slashing the air with my maple leaf blade. Although I am not giving this game a thumbs down just because of that. The game was released just a few days ago so I don't blame the devs for that but please do hear me out and add in an option wherein we can change the bindings.\n\nThis is a fantastic game and my first Momodora game to boot.

The bosses are unimaginative and frustrating. Finally, the sound quality varies a lot, but never gets better than “average for 1995”, and frequently so bad that you’ll want to mute it (the character death and mage magic sounds in particular).","May 28","false","5.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Even though they have attack states? I had hoped we could have left this Vampire Killer/Castlevania bullcrap damage model in the 80's.)\nGetting hit pushes the character in a stun while being flung in the air (again, that 80's damage model), this becomes a problem when fighting enemies or bosses in areas where 'the floor is lava', as when you get hit but tried to do a dodge roll, will result in you flying of into the instakill areas of the map, seeing the air dash is on the same button mapping.\nBad difficulty settings curve (Easy is insultingly easy, normal is hard, and hard will make you want to smack your controller against the wall.)\nBosses have attack states in which they are not on the playing field (basically invulnerability states) so your damage buffs time out before you could properly use them while you got to play dodge ball.)\nBosses are not challenging, they are an exercise in perseverance and patience, as all the bosses for some reason needed to be bigger bullet sponges than bosses in Borderland’s ultimate vault hunter mode.\nHealing items simply heal too little, the fact you need to use 3 to even fill the standard health bar shows a lack of balancing (especially with the amount of damage even the lowest level enemies do.)\nA lot of stat boosting items are just fluff, what use is a 50% damage boost when a boss has such a massive health pool it will feel like you’re swinging a wet baguette instead of a sword anyway, same goes for the bow, why have arrows that will pierce through enemies and keep flying when there is almost never a situation where so many enemies are on screen (in a straight line no less) where that would be beneficial.\nNot enough to actually do in the world, sure you can backtrack and collect some useless worms, but there simply isn’t that much to explore and discover.\n\nNow, that ‘bad’ list seems to offset the good by a large margin, but it is also very dependent on what I find annoying and unnecessary for modern action platformers.\nThis game borrows a lot from late 80's early 90's platformers, and quite frankly, i've played those, and a lot of stuff from those games always annoyed me (player and enemy hitbox overlap always damaging the player, not both, for example), and I had hoped we could have evolved a bit from those outdated gaming mechanics, but for some reason every 'retro' styled game somehow needs to tick of those checkboxes on the 'metroidvania' must have game mechanics list.\nAnd that’s a shame, as the game does a lot of stuff right, and with a little more balancing, better designed items and better difficulty settings, it might have been a lot more entertaining to me, unfortunately, I find I have little fun playing it.\n\nSo, to iterate, it’s not a bad game per-se, but, up to a certain point it just doesn’t do it for me anymore. Now, if you have no problem with those outdated (or oldskool, depending on your preference) mechanics then by all means, get this game, if not, maybe avoid it (or atleast at full price.)\n\n\nAs for my recommendation, in all honesty, i wish Steam offered a neutral option, as it truly isn't a bad game, and recommendations are more often than not seen as a Metacritic style score/rating of either 10 or 0, which it isn't.","May 28","false","4.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

Castlevania-level quality would be nice but that game didn't need to two-shot you to be interesting.\n\nMomodora Reverie just is not at that level.\n\nIt's bog-standard with only a couple of tricks: Lifted from Dark Souls was a silly refillable health potion and other buff items system that really isn't necessary outside of a Souls-style game (Insultingly, the refillable health potions don't refill enough of your health to undo the one hit you can take. But they aren't slow enough that you have to stop the fight to heal like you did in Souls. Why not just double my anemic health bar?). Worse, you have a roll. Don't get me wrong, if you're making an action game like Shank, Dishwasher, Streets of Fury, Aces Wild etc, a roll is welcome. But Momodora is closer to a low-budget two-hit-kill Mega Man than any of those games, and your roll never feels right*, it never ends up in the right position, and, combined with the ridiculous forward momentum on the melee, the combat feels graceless and greasy.\n\nOh, and that's all you do. Because like Momodora 3 the levels are just there to give you stuff to hop over, a bit like Kirby only less fun.\n\n*Of course, thinking about it, your character's sprite is massive. There's no way you're dodging between or around ANY shots beyond one or two, so of course we need a roll with iframes rather than let you duck and weave like any other Mega Man-esque game.","March 30","false","0.8"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","5","25","0","4"

I thought that adding more story and complexity could've worked out good for this game, and it did. Since the previous Momodoras were lacking only these. Although covering up this hole, digged up another hole. This time immeasurable for me. This game is completelly diffrent from her older sisters.\n\nAt first everyone will notice that this Momodora is rather silent, it gives straight feeling that our adventure wont be happy this time. Ambients and low vibes of enviroment are the only sounds to be expected for quite a bit, this game is not energetic anymore. Unlucky for you if you want to play hard mode for bigger challenge, you will get frustrated by this "silent aspect" rather quickly. You die in 3 hits on hard and each section demand precision then, as a result ambients only frustrate you, because they make you more nervous instead of relaxing you. That was not a problem before. Conecting to this mood Momodora was usually cheerful, this time it is sad and sends only chill with melancholy down your spine. Each character you will meet along is giving you more of these negative emotions, they are desperate without hope, meanwhile others just becoming mad and posessed.\n\nI am cursing a lot during sessions with this game. Especially further in the game with RNG Water Bats which are going to be my worst nightmare from this game... popping out randomly from screen sides sometimes making me unable to leave section. Niiiice, death spikes are annoying. Save points are rare, thats good. Enemies are variant and sometimes surprising, but difficulty is not nicely balanced. Saying shortly - hitboxes. Few things are killing instantly few taking half of your hp sometimes, activating immortal mode is fun by taking hits from stepping into enemies it works great with bosses but not with other things RNG as hell. Attack from behind insta death. Boss patterns half RNG you cant predict what skill order they will use mostly. It is better to rush them. Final Bosses are damn dissapoitment, they have slow patterns without RNG.\n\n~~\nI finished whole game and I feel nothing. Its prolly because of bad end which was explained in 2 sentences, kicking me out to menu. I dont get it was that suppose to motivate? I will clean the map for 100% prolly with solution since this does not explain anything. Play time 7 Hours.\n\nSumming up I still like the game dont get me wrong. Its mysterious and you want to know more. You want to be that priestess in Game World who still has hope for saving everyone. I am being intrigued but not satisfied anymore by getting through the Game World even if it is still beautiful. Soundtrack lost energy and magic, and that is killing my joy not the difficulty I've chosen. BTW Still no swimming animations *smile*.","March 11","false","16.1"," 8 of 35 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","8","35","0","10"

The combat and platforming are completely solid, but some enemies were pointlessly frustrating. Including long sections of platforming, especially with moving platforms, with limitless spawning enemies that fly underneath you (where your weapon can't reach), knocking you into instakill spikes, was just tedious.\nI enjoyed exploring, but found it far too easy to wander into the next boss battle without completing an area, with little incentive to go back rather than continuing the story (boss battles should be the cherry atop the completed cake).\nSave points were mostly plentiful, but I wonder why they appeared after every boss except the winged girl atop the castle? It was a fun, if not rather simple battle, that I didn't mind repeating (and then going back to the previous save), but it just seemed like an odd choice.\nThe leadup to the Queen was anticlimactic, I really wasn't expecting her around the next corner with no introduction other than her name appearing on the screen. I realise none of the bosses had much of a leadup, but we'd been hearing about the cursed Queen for such a long time I thought she'd do more than appear and start fighting me in the same few seconds. We had a dialogue with almost every other boss (even if the Queen can't speak, an attempt at conversation would be appreciated, only to realise that she truly is lost in her current form).\nI deserved the bad ending because by the end I was just so over it, I just wanted to keep forging ahead as I really didn't enjoy some of the later segments (I found the latter part of the castle a bore, boss battles aside). I don't know what the right decision for Cath was, or whether it even relates to any aspect of the game. Part of me really wants to go back for completion, but I get the feeling it won't be worth it by the time I'm back in the last part of the castle.\nI wanted to get more immersed in this world than I was, and I wasn't the only problem. NPCs, once they fulfilled their role in the story, gave the same old lines, over and over again, regardless of what had changed. Someone telling me to go visit this person (after I'd already visited them) breaks my immersion.\n\nDespite all my complaints, I enjoyed it. As I said, it's solid when it comes down to platforming and combat. Platforming was never too difficult (annoying flying enemies and continuous aside), bosses and enemies were varied and interesting, the world is absolutely stunning, the OST stands alone, and it only takes an afternoon to complete from start to finish.\n\nLast nitpicks:\nWhy was water an instakill in some places when my character can quite clearly swim in underwater sections? I thought maybe 'poison/curse water', and while it's true the two bodies of water don't connect on the same screen, they're clearly all part of the cursed town...\nIf you're a witch who can warp away, why warp out of battle once, only to be shocked at your own death the second?\nIn a Metroidvania, where the character goes back and forth a lot, enemies should constantly be expecting you - not have their back turned blindly because you originally entered from the other direction. (Don't get me wrong, I abused this like crazy, but it feels a bit unfair.)\n\nI'm sorry for killing the spider when I went back to the forest. :'(","March 11","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had never heard of this series before and I'm always cautious of games that look they might be trying to be heavy on the Kawaii.  Luckily my fears ended up being completely unfounded.  The visuals in this game won me over almost instantly.  From the very first area, all the way to the last this game features stunning pixel art.  It's the little touches like interactive grass, reflections in the water as you run along the dock, and fog rolling over the canals that bring this world to life.  These details show a level of quality that sticks throughout the entire game.\n\nThe combat was fun, a wonderful mix of challenging but responsive.  Winning boss fights felt like a challenge and were very rewarding to actually finish.  The exploration works well as the maps are well designed.  There's always a reason to explore more whether you're looking for new items, more health, or little collectables.  The only thing I wasn't impressed by was the story.  it was alright but I felt that maybe I was missing out on some details since I had never played the previous installments.  Maybe this is my own fault but for a game that seems to be aimed at introducing new people to the series there were some details that would have been nice to understand better.\n\nFull Video review for those interested:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4xGkbEQ8w","March 13","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has GORGEOUS pixelart graphics with beautiful animations, excellent controls and a very nice and fitting atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nYou are a priestess that uses a maple leaf as a weapon. What's more awesome than that?!\n\nThe story could be deeper and the game itself is very straightforward. It lacks that feeling you have when you play other metroidvanias, when you need to get a new ability to reach a certain area  (you can morph into a cat to reach narrow places, that's all). It could be better in that aspect. The map is fairly large but you don't get to revisit some areas more than once. Also, the game could be longer.\n\nDespite those flaws, it's an amazing game. It's very challenging due to it's unforgiving style. Those who played Dark Souls series will immediately relate, because it's just like that: you die, you get back to the last checkpoint; unless you get used to dodging, you can get whooped in just one hit; the game doesn't tell you what to do or point your next objective on the map, it's all up to you to find out; You even have Dark Soul-esque recovery items that replenishes when you get to a checkpoint. With all these features, it becomes a very rewarding game.\n\n8/10. Solid, beautiful game.","April 1","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is reminiscent of Dark Souls, and I mean that in the best possible way.\n\nThe reason I even found out about, and decided to buy this game, was because of this video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KKT-xv_VBY\n\nAnd I have no regrets, so maybe check it out.\n","April 1","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And while that is mostly true, it completely suprised me. The quality of most of its aspects are incredibly good and they manage to create a really unique feel throught the experience.\n\nStarting with the art, being probably one of the main selling points of the game, I can only say that I found it amazing. All of the characters, animations, and more spefically, the world and enviroment of the game are all rich in details. It also has lot of personality to it. When playing through the game, there wasn't a single enemy or area that I disliked in this sense, everything seemed beneficial to the whole atmosphere presented.\n\nThe music is really solid, and most importantly, fits the other elements nicely.\nMost of what I said about the art also applies to the music. Other than that, I don't have too much to say about it. It's just really great!\n\nThe story is a little subjective. Due to the game being somewhat short, it doesn't have too much depth to it. However, the developers were aware of those limitations and kept it simple and straight-foward. This may not please everyone, but I really enjoyed it. It doesn't force too much information about the facts that take place but still conveys a strong enough message. Again, if you are looking for something with a extensive story, deep development or other factors along those lines, you will probably be dissapointed by it.\n\nThe thing that surprised me the most was the gameplay, since it managed to achieve a great balance between being simple and complex. You have a attack button, a ranged attack button, a roll button and a spell button which together end up being really intuitive. The game takes advantage of those mechanics by having enemies with different attack timings, some with projectiles, and positioning to enforce the use of the controls in a really diverse way, following the same formula. The only minor problem that I had here, is that spells and items were somewhat "limited", not adding too much choice in this regard.\n\nFollowing what I said, I felt that a lot of the items and spells weren't introduced properly, which made some of the inventory system a little awkward. Some of it has to do with the location and progression system envolved, which I found poorly timed and explained. Some really interesting options are only available much later in to the game. The other problem is that to get a lot of the items, you have to kill the bosses without taking damage, something that the game does not explain at any point. In my 1st playthrough I missed a lot of them, which would've made the gameplay a lot more interesting.\n\nThe difficulty is based around the checkpoints and your health. In a general way, it makes it so you have to be really careful around the enemies, since your characters is pretty vulnerable, being able to only take a couple hits. The checkpoints are also located somewhat far from each other, so that influences a little bit in to the difficulty as well. All that added, makes you restart frequently and have to remember and create strategies for each of the areas. I found this really fun in hard mode and super interesting in insane mode (mode where you mostly die in one hit).\n\n\nWell, with all that said, I would strongly recommend picking the game up. One thing you should note though, is that a single playthrough of the game is somewhat short, taking only about 4-8 hours. If you plan to do all the achievements and consequently, more playthroughs, you will get around 15-30 hours of play time.\n\nIf you enjoy completing everything the game has to offer, you will definitely like it, since the content is very well created. If you don't like doing multiple playthroughs and fulfilling the achievements, you will end up with a small playtime. In this case, your decision will revolve around your opinion on the cost x value proposition, as even though the game is a great experience, it won't offer you too much replayability.","March 26","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The series has only grown bigger and better with each installment, and this game is a testament to that. Reverie Under the Moonlight is by far the most refined and fleshed out game of the entire series. At first, I thought that this was going to have the more linear structure of Momodora III, but then the game slowly but surely branched out into multiple paths. The combat is incredibly satisfying; the game does a great job of letting you know that you were damaging an enemy (and that enemies were hitting you). The soundtrack is beautiful and truly lends itself to the atmosphere of the game. The enemies are laid out to actually compliment the level design and to make you think differently about each encounter. Though the power-ups themselves aren't quite as satisfying as other metroidvanias on the market, I still got pretty giddy at times. Where this game truly shines is its boss battles (although at one point the pacing falters); they give you a very good challenge without being unfair, and they get progressively more difficult to reflect your progress. Between this game and Pony Island, 2016 is off to a very good start.\n\n9/10","March 30","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's almost no music throughout the whole game to give off a certain feel/ambience but I think it hurts a lot more than it helps.

Momodora has disprovent that for me, by taking that format and applying it to the metroidvaina-style gameplay that I've always loved.\n\nNow, I've only played a little of it so far, but I can tell that this is going to be one of the games I go back to many times in the future.  Never is the game so difficult that its frustrating, but its far from easy.  They really did a good job of brining the idea that if you die, its your fault.  Ambushes have tells, traps have triggers, you'll be able to figure it out if you stop and assess a room before rushing right in.  Its a huge change of pace from normal metriodvanias, and it works well.\n\nOne thing that helps it along is the tone.  A contrast of the bright, cutesy characters set across an opressive backdrop really blends well.  I feel that it helps keep from being too stressful, while at the same time making sure to keep you on your guard, that this isn't a game where you can just turn off your brain and blaze through it.\n\nYou can see the love for both Dark Souls and Castlevania that went into this.  The developers unabashidly pull all sorts of gameplay elements from the two; from map layout, to the healing and combat mechanics, the map, even the setting itself.  But that's not bad by any means.  The game doesn't have any new gimmicks it wants to throw at you, and because of that, the developers were able to mesh tried and true mechanics and in the process, make something truely unique in the process.\n\nAlso, its like, nine dollars.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/papertank/recommended/428550/","papertank","Mostly Safe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/papertank/","107 products in account","A very fun metroidvania game that challenges you all throughout the game. It take a rather decent step away from Momodora III in most ways. Most notably is the art style. It's damn good. Everything looks fluid, colorful, and realistic for all animations making it a very pleasing to look at. Another change is the difficultly. I feel like the Dark Souls and Bloodborne was being played while making this game. The amount of dodge roll, the amount of damage you take, and the flower animation stand out to me the most but there are pleanty of other things you feel is very Dark Souls about the game and while 90% of other games try it as well, this is one of the few that does it right. Enemies feel placed in a way that punishes you for trying to rush and with the amount of damage that is done, on hard at least, makes you slow down to a steady pace that's neither too slow nor too fast. Another nice change of pace is the length of the game. Momodora III takes only 1-2 hours on your first run and can be speed runned under 10 minutes while Momodora 4 took me 5 hours on the first run and I'd imagine the speed run being around 30-40 minutes.\n\nMy only real complaints is the music and the items. Most of the music is just ambiance that doesn't stand out except for bosses and 2 areas and while the boss music is okay, the area music is forgettable. I actually only remember 2 pieces and one of those is because I died like 15 times on a certain boss and the other was the final boss fights. My other complaint is how the items aren't exactly balanced and a lot do the same thing. There's like 5 ways to boost your attack but once you get to the end, you have a deadly dou combo that makes the game too much easier. I feel like Momodora III handled these two much better and hopefully in Momodora 5, we'll get a combonation of the two games.\n\nOverall, it's a huge improvement over Momodora III. If you're a fan of the series or have just looked at the game and thought "that looks interesting" then you won't be disappointed.

I would say this is only partially correct: I honestly find it more akin to Bloodborne in setting, with its dark city riddled with plague and monsters.\n\nThe game follows the short but sweet route: most gamers blitzing the game will find it only takes a few hours to see most of what it has to offer, and will probably hit the final boss of the game by the 4th or 5th hour mark if they do not spend a good deal of time grinding or gathering every ivory bug they may miss.\n\nHowever, each area is so beautiful its difficult to describe. No two places look alike, and although every area is not exceedingly large in scale, all of them utilize incredible sprite work to give each a wonderful personality.\n\nIf  your a fan of explorative RPG platformers that prefer you see the ending a bit quicker than usual, this is a good game to give a shot. You won't spend as long as you may think in the city, but you will certainly remember it fondly for every dark corner you searched for lore and loot.","March 6","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/papertank/recommended/428550/","papertank","Mostly Safe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/papertank/","107 products in account","A very fun metroidvania game that challenges you all throughout the game. It take a rather decent step away from Momodora III in most ways. Most notably is the art style. It's damn good. Everything looks fluid, colorful, and realistic for all animations making it a very pleasing to look at. Another change is the difficultly. I feel like the Dark Souls and Bloodborne was being played while making this game. The amount of dodge roll, the amount of damage you take, and the flower animation stand out to me the most but there are pleanty of other things you feel is very Dark Souls about the game and while 90% of other games try it as well, this is one of the few that does it right. Enemies feel placed in a way that punishes you for trying to rush and with the amount of damage that is done, on hard at least, makes you slow down to a steady pace that's neither too slow nor too fast. Another nice change of pace is the length of the game. Momodora III takes only 1-2 hours on your first run and can be speed runned under 10 minutes while Momodora 4 took me 5 hours on the first run and I'd imagine the speed run being around 30-40 minutes.\n\nMy only real complaints is the music and the items. Most of the music is just ambiance that doesn't stand out except for bosses and 2 areas and while the boss music is okay, the area music is forgettable. I actually only remember 2 pieces and one of those is because I died like 15 times on a certain boss and the other was the final boss fights. My other complaint is how the items aren't exactly balanced and a lot do the same thing. There's like 5 ways to boost your attack but once you get to the end, you have a deadly dou combo that makes the game too much easier. I feel like Momodora III handled these two much better and hopefully in Momodora 5, we'll get a combonation of the two games.\n\nOverall, it's a huge improvement over Momodora III. If you're a fan of the series or have just looked at the game and thought "that looks interesting" then you won't be disappointed. Very solid 4/5","March 6","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A large part of it is that it effectively embraces nostalgia; it feels and plays like a game you might have played on Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo, but it has the added bonus of being so fluidly animated that it feels like the BEST version of the game you might have played.  It's hard, but it never feels like the difficulty is a punishment: you die, you learn, you get better, you continue on.  The soundtrack is phenomenal.  The character design is very anime-ish, which might be a turn off to some, but it feels appropriate and the sprite based animation makes it a joy to watch in motion.

Easy is a COMPLETE joke. Normal is fairly challenging. Hard looks like you get nearly one shotted by everything. It's somewhat like Dark Souls in that its pretty unforgiving if you ♥♥♥♥ up as well as the atmosphere and story; it's a pretty grizzly tale. I finished the game and the ending I got makes me pretty much certain that there are more endings to the game so I'll probably beat it again and try to figure out how to get a better ending. The pixel graphics are fantastic as well. Boss fights could use a little work, just seemed a bit repetetive, some were better than others. Nothing really stood out as far as music goes but it was pretty good. But the biggest flaw in the game is how short it is, I beat it in four hours, not going particularly fast. I will probably play it again, which is partly because the game is short, so maybe it's not that bad a thing. A little more length and more interesting bosses would make this an absolute masterpiece.

Playing with combinations of these items can help alter your approach to tackling a difficult boss or section of enemies and makes it so you never feel like you're banging your head against a wall.

Someone in the forum even said they beat the game in "2 hours". Momodora III was fun but VERY short, so I wasn't sure if this one was worth the price tag.\n\nI'm so glad I decided to buy this game, and anyone who "beat" this game in 2 hours is either cheating (has a map/watching playthrough) or they're not playing it right (playing on easy and blowing through it).\n\nIf you are a fan of challenging, old-school platformers, or even a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, don't hesitate! Get this game, put it on hard, prepare to die and have a blast while doing it.\n\nLike Souls, you will learn enemy locations and attack patterns, enemies always spawn in the same place. But one or two wrong moves and you're dead (on hard), it's back to the last checkpoint (these are far more plenty than similar games, plus you have healing items). The game never feels cheap and deaths are almost always due to a poor move on my part.\n\nIf you play the game the way it's meant to be played, a brutal RPG platformer, you'll get much more than a few hours of enjoyment from it. My first playthrough was around 6 hours, and then there's a new game +, for me replay value is high. There's plenty of collectibles and secrets and I want them all. If you're not into that, replaying the new game + is still fun and challenging.\n\nDo I wish it was longer? Totally! I would love some DLC with extra levels, characters or power ups (and I'd happily pay more for it too). But what is here is definitely worth the $9-10. I've spent $20 bucks on shorter indie games that weren't nearly as fun (I'm looking at you Firewatch), or that were good but had no replay value.\n\nBefore I wrap this up, it's not perfect either. There are some things that bother me about the game:\nScreen-tearing.\nI read the forums and there are a few suggestions that I need to try to fix it, but as it is there is some screen-tearing on my computer. This is a 2D pixel platformer that's not even widescreen, it should run silky smooth on my computer that can run most new games on high settings.\nWhich brings me to: Not widescreen.\nIt's 2016, and while I enjoy the SNES nostalgia of an old, square screenspace, I feel like all games should at least have a widescreen option these days. Wasted screenspace in a game as beautiful as this one is just disappointing.\nMoving while you attack.\nThis bugs me. In Momodora III, when you attack, you remain in place. In this installment, you move forward as you attack. This creates problems when you're attacking an enemy and then all the sudden you're on top of them and you take damage. I think the melee from Momodora III was superior. This is a small complaint though and I still enjoy the game thoroughly. It's also a far superior game to the other Momodora's in other aspects such as graphics, playtime, the dodge and arrow system, ect.\n\nDo I recommend this game? HELL YES. Grab your Maple Leaf and get ready to put the smackdown on some demonic baddies.","March 7","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the development team felt like adding anything else, I'd recommend a new playable character in the form of the Pardoner Fennel or the Knight character. Those two have reason to fight the queen just like main character Kaho does.\nIn addition, of the NPCs introduced in the game's 4-6 hour runtime, several do stand out as moderately developed characters in this grim kingdom of dangerous monsters. Askorn, a skeleton looking for his wife, receives some closure should you look for it while Eri, a girl who Kaho meets upon entering the Grave area, leaves more questions than are answered when you give her back her hope (Why do you have this item, Eri? Are you not telling us something about yourself?). Others who give you some guidance or world-building text and either are forgotten or become your next boss fight. I have not taken the Birthstone to every location in question with this statement, but it is unlikely that the cat-lady girl in the Monastery says much else than what I have already seen from her.\nOne of Momodora's greatest strengths is the fluidity of the sprites. Naturally larger sprites move less fluidly, but when many smaller characters/monsters or Kaho herself move, they do so in fairly graceful motion. I point in particular to the Pardoner Fennel boss fight, which is as close to a straight player-versus-player battle you will get.\nSpeaking of the boss fights, I would consider many of them to be very good, though also very dangerous. However, every boss has a reward item you can obtain should you not take ANY damage for the duration of the battle.This one mechanic changes some or most fights from "fair" to "time to kill yourself, you touched a pixel of the hitbox and took damage... for the 20th time in a row." In particular I now point to the Heretical Arsonist boss as well as the Lupiar half of the Lupiar-Magnolia fight. After the Arsonist fight, you obtain the air-dodge... A skill that would have made the Arsonist much easier to obtain her item early. In regards to Lupiar, on the other hand, her part of her tag-team fight becomes difficult the moment you try to no-hit the fight. The reason for this is Lupiar is immune to your (essential) arrows, forcing you to risk touch-damage on a melee-based enemy.\nIgnoring this mechanic, bosses in "Momodora: RUtM" will provide you with a fair challenge, learning their attacks and dodging accordingly. You WILL die to many of them your first time, but proper mastery of ranged combat, healing, offensive items, and leaf-smacking will see you triumph.\nSpeaking of items, I was surprised to find no items that specifically were about reducing the damage that you take, which is shockingly high. Rather, items are broken down between "do damage," "healing consumable," and "utility during travel." During your first run, you WILL have the Ring of Candor equipped to find all the secrets as you travel, right up to any given boss fight, likewise with the Cat Sphere.\nAs for the music... the less said about Karst City's "ambiance" the better. Excluding that one track, the music illustrates the nature of each respective area of the world, the best probably being the Forlorn Monastery's very, well, forlorn and echoing theme. Nothing I'd listen to when walking about, but it carries the meaning while you are playing.\n\nOverall: B+\n- Get this game is you like the "Metroidvania" style of action adventure gameplay.","April 2","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The series has only grown bigger and better with each installment, and this game is a testament to that. Reverie Under the Moonlight is by far the most refined and fleshed out game of the entire series. At first, I thought that this was going to have the more linear structure of Momodora III, but then the game slowly but surely branched out into multiple paths. The combat is incredibly satisfying; the game does a great job of letting you know that you were damaging an enemy (and that enemies were hitting you). The soundtrack is beautiful and truly lends itself to the atmosphere of the game. The enemies are laid out to actually compliment the level design and to make you think differently about each encounter. Though the power-ups themselves aren't quite as satisfying as other metroidvanias on the market, I still got pretty giddy at times. Where this game truly shines is its boss battles (although at one point the pacing falters); they give you a very good challenge without being unfair, and they get progressively more difficult to reflect your progress. Between this game and Pony Island, 2016 is off to a very good start.\n\n9/10","March 30","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is fluid and on point, the atmosphere and music are intense throughout and the graphics are stunning with some amazing animation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/plagen/recommended/428550/","plagen","Plagen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/plagen/","140 products in account","Momodora is an interesting Metroidvania type game. I'm not usually fan of this type of game, but the cute artwork and beautiful music drew me to it. I have a soft spot for cute female protagonists, what can I say? I've completed 100% of the map, but still have plenty of challenges to do, like a pacifist run and a run without dying. Not to mention collecting Ivory Bugs & completing Insane difficulty.\n\nAs mentioned above, the art and music is beautiful. The gameplay itself is also smooth and responsive (I am using a keyboard and the only issue I have is forgetting which buttons do what). Transition between the various rooms is fluid and feel rather nice. The bosses are unique and have a variety of mechanics, but for the most part you can look for a pattern and beat them.\n\nSpeaking of the bosses, they range from mini-bosses to full on kick-your-♥♥♥ bosses. The hardest boss for me so far took me around 10 tries to kill it, while before that one, I averaged about 3 tries. For the most part, you will encounter the bosses in a linear fashion but occasionally you can fight them depending on your preference. (I probably killed that hard boss before I was actually supposed to)\n\nWhile exploring the map, you'll encounter areas you can't reach yet. You will unlock these as you progress (obtaining new abilities), kill bosses, or obtain keys. You'll be backtracking a few times, but there is a lovely little map feature so you can keep track of where to go.\n\nIn your travels, you will encounter various characters that give you information or background about the world. It is a nice way to give the option of learning about the world without forcing you into too many forced-reading sessions.\n\nAll in all, it is a pretty decent game. I was able to complete it in about 7 hours in my first run, so it is definately worth the $10 price.\n\n**As a side note, after completing the game, it lets you start over, and keep most of your items & your HP increase. You lose your upgrades and key items. In this "New Game+" mode, I was able to complete the game in little over an hour. (I should add at this point, I'm playing on Normal difficulty)","March 6","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtracks are good and atmospheric, though weirdly enough the first area has no bgm and instead only have an ambience that is looped not very well. The bosses are challenging enough and identifying their patterns really feels great. There are a bunch of equippable items with varying effects that you use depending on the situation.\n\nOverall a very great, though short game.

The combat and platforming are completely solid, but some enemies were pointlessly frustrating. Including long sections of platforming, especially with moving platforms, with limitless spawning enemies that fly underneath you (where your weapon can't reach), knocking you into instakill spikes, was just tedious.\nI enjoyed exploring, but found it far too easy to wander into the next boss battle without completing an area, with little incentive to go back rather than continuing the story (boss battles should be the cherry atop the completed cake).\nSave points were mostly plentiful, but I wonder why they appeared after every boss except the winged girl atop the castle? It was a fun, if not rather simple battle, that I didn't mind repeating (and then going back to the previous save), but it just seemed like an odd choice.\nThe leadup to the Queen was anticlimactic, I really wasn't expecting her around the next corner with no introduction other than her name appearing on the screen. I realise none of the bosses had much of a leadup, but we'd been hearing about the cursed Queen for such a long time I thought she'd do more than appear and start fighting me in the same few seconds. We had a dialogue with almost every other boss (even if the Queen can't speak, an attempt at conversation would be appreciated, only to realise that she truly is lost in her current form).\nI deserved the bad ending because by the end I was just so over it, I just wanted to keep forging ahead as I really didn't enjoy some of the later segments (I found the latter part of the castle a bore, boss battles aside). I don't know what the right decision for Cath was, or whether it even relates to any aspect of the game. Part of me really wants to go back for completion, but I get the feeling it won't be worth it by the time I'm back in the last part of the castle.\nI wanted to get more immersed in this world than I was, and I wasn't the only problem. NPCs, once they fulfilled their role in the story, gave the same old lines, over and over again, regardless of what had changed. Someone telling me to go visit this person (after I'd already visited them) breaks my immersion.\n\nDespite all my complaints, I enjoyed it. As I said, it's solid when it comes down to platforming and combat. Platforming was never too difficult (annoying flying enemies and continuous aside), bosses and enemies were varied and interesting, the world is absolutely stunning, the OST stands alone, and it only takes an afternoon to complete from start to finish.\n\nLast nitpicks:\nWhy was water an instakill in some places when my character can quite clearly swim in underwater sections? I thought maybe 'poison/curse water', and while it's true the two bodies of water don't connect on the same screen, they're clearly all part of the cursed town...\nIf you're a witch who can warp away, why warp out of battle once, only to be shocked at your own death the second?\nIn a Metroidvania, where the character goes back and forth a lot, enemies should constantly be expecting you - not have their back turned blindly because you originally entered from the other direction.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stungun_wol/recommended/428550/","stungun_wol","Stungun.wol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stungun_wol/","126 products in account","Just did a runthrough of the game, 100% on Normal. Now here are my thoughts. Just a disclaimer though -- I am not a long time fan of the series, in fact this is the first I'd ever heard of Momodora, and thus I have only played this one.\n\nIf you want to know what you're getting, just look at the trailer, cause what you see is generally what you get; it does an excellent job of summarizing what to expect. But the about section definitely seems to oversell just what it can deliver in my opinion.\n\nGraphics/Artwork: Excellent style. The art style is similar in spirit to Cave Story, only not having as rigid of restrictions on sprite definition, resolution, and colors. I'd say that the artwork attempted to portray their vision using graphics that are as minimalistic as they could be without sacrificing the expression. The end result is very pleasing to the eye. Also, the character sprites (especially Kaho) are very expressive.\n\nGameplay: Don't let anyone fool you -- the combat isn't that intricate in this game. You've got chargeable ranged attacks and your melee attacks work out to just a generic three-hit-combo move. Apart from that you have roll-dodging and jumping (and later on, air dodging) as your evasive moves but the controls might wind up frustrating your attempts to take advantage of all of this at once. Items generally take some time to use (and can be disrupted by attacks) so it's foolish to use them when you're at risk of being hit -- you need space to use them. Combat is still interesting though, but you might seriously consider just avoiding the more problematic enemies rather than fighting them.\n\nDifficulty: Oh man, this game is frustratingly hard... at the start. When you first start out, you don't have many options at your disposal and the difficulty comes right out of the gates hard. Throughout the game bosses can be expected to deal a third of your health bar in damage. As you progress through the game though (assuming you explore a lot and hunt things down), the odds will swing drastically in your favor;  if you 100% the game, the final boss isn't hard at all, so long as you remember to heal.\n\nControls: When I did my first run of this game, keybindings could not be customized which I took great issue with, considering I found the default QWEASD layout for action keys to be cumbersome -- but it has since been patched so this is no longer an issue.\nYou can use a gamepad, but you're forced to use one of two preset configurations. This is bad for me since my USB gamepad's buttons map to a rather strange layout. This kind of restriction only makes sense on console games, where the type of controller the player uses can be predicted.\n\nStory: It's not as engrossing or involved as the description would have you believe, IMO. There is very little dialogue. Items can give hints towards some background of the setting, but there's still a few unanswered questions (I wonder if playing the other games would make them make sense in context?). Clearly some thought went into the various NPCs and bosses of the game regarding their personalities, motives, and feelings... but in the end it only expresses itself in a handfull of dialogue. Really, though, that's all that a game like this really needs. But I feel that "compelling personalities" is not something that can quite describe the characters of the game... in how they are shown.\nIt seems like there's a lot we aren't seeing. Stuff about the setting, the characters, and so on that's still locked away in the creators' minds.\n\nMusic: It does a great job at expressing the atmosphere of areas and events. There's honestly not much more I can say about it. One gripe I have though about games like these, is I'm getting sick of buying the soundtrack bundle only to find the game music is already there in the game's data files, in easy-to-read .ogg format -- and I just paid $2 or so extra basically for album art and MP3 tags. Please, developers. Stop doing this. Stop trying to sell us something we already bought. If you try to sell the soundtrack my first assumption is that the audio files are packed, encrypted, or otherwise not accessible as easily as just opening the folder and double clicking on a tersely named .OGG file. I may just stop buying soundtrack DLC entirely if this keeps up.\n\nReplayability: There's going back to collect anything you missed, NG+, and increasing difficulty levels. Enough to keep most people coming back a few times. And for true masochists you can always try minimal item runs.\n\nSo overall, we're looking at this game, priced at base $10 US ($12-13 if you buy the soundtrack with it which I don't reccomend, for the aforementioned reasons). So, to someone unfamiliar with the series... Is it worth the asking price?\n\nIf the gameplay trailer looks fun, I'd reccomend it, assuming you have no problem with punishing difficulty. If you have your doubts about the game from anything I've said here, I'd wait until it goes for 50% or more off. If you are prone to ragequitting, I'd not bother with the game at all.\n\nPersonally, I don't regret having picked it up.","March 7","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Metroidvania fans will feel right at home — a lot of the reviews so far compare it to Dark Souls (mainly because you can roll to dodge), but Momodora IV is actually much closer to its genre namesakes, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid. That said, rdein is a Dark Souls fan and the game's atmosphere draws a lot of similarities from it.\n\nMy controls: Dualshock 3 with Xinput wrapper\n\nGAME MECHANICS:\n+ They put a lot of effort into making all the hitboxes and attack animations feel just right. (I had a chance to help rdein tune attack hitstun animations while he was developing this game so I know he cares a great deal about how his game plays, and feedback from the community.)\n+ One of the biggest drawbacks of previous titles was clunky movement and combat, but in Momodora IV the movement/controls have been vastly improved — possibly the best you can make it with this game engine.\n+ Attacks are smooth and act like you expect them to. There's enough of a learning curve for each weapon to keep it interesting.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n+ The game is linear but exploration-based. There are enough secrets to make backtracking and exploration worth it.\n+ New enemy types throughout keep the game fresh and challenging. Boss fights are a treat!\n+ Multiple endings give decent replay value.\n+ Items have variety without being overwhelming.\n- Item management is a little clunky because you have to cycle through active items during combat.\n\nART DIRECTION & STYLE:\n+ Backgrounds for each level are absolutely gorgeous.\n+ The music is fantastic and matches each level.\n+ Unlike the previous titles, the theme and atmosphere is darker, yet it keeps the story simple. Draws similarities from Dark Souls and Bloodborne while keeping its own unique style.\n+ Characters have just enough backstory to make them interesting, and re-appearances throughout the game are compelling.\n+ Dialogue is well-written and follows the game's theme, and dialogue animations are a nice touch.\n+ Character sprites and overall character design is great — which isn't surprising since rdein draws all concept art himself.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 9/10\nI wish this game was longer!

The game length feels just right, with a 100% playthrough on hard taking me around 4 hours. Combat is simple in a good way. You have a 3 hit ground combo, an air hit, arrows, and a roll that you're invincible in. The difficulty in combat comes from timing and knowing when to dodge attacks. Items allow for some customization in your playstyle, and the variety in them is great. The game gives some nice freedom in the beginning, allowing you to visit locations and fight most of the bosses in any order before the final two ares (unreachable until you get 4 crests by beating the bosses).\n\nSpeaking of bosses, the boss fights are great. Almost all attacks the bosses have are telegraphed before they come out, making it feel fair whenever you receive damage. Most of the bosses are pretty unique battles too, so there's some nice variance in those fights (though there is one repeated boss battle).\n\nStory is... relatively light. Characters come and go rather quickly while not saying much, and the story itself is rather predictable. I'd say that's the weakest part but it is by no mean bad, just not as fleshed out as I'd like. The ambience is great too, most of the game has a very grim atmosphere to it. Easily recommendable, very fun, worth the money.","March 8","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While staying relatively short in the grand scheme like the others, easily being possible to speed run in a little over thirty minutes if you absolutely know what you're doing, a first run through will take roughly six hours. This game actually takes advantage of a non-linear playstyle much like Metroid or good Castlevania games (Metroidvania). Before this game, Momodora had only teased at most around a game that could follow this format, but ultimately felt entirely linear. As it stands, this game lays a really fun foundation for a game akin to great titles such as Symphony of the Night, with very evident nods to the Castlevania series being present within this game.","March 12","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the perspective of a guy who likes platformers a lot, this one gets the B+. The art of style aside, it plays very well. On hard, it is challenging, but not to the point you get mad at the game. The patterns are pretty clear cut which makes no part of the game feel "impossible," each time you do the same thing you get a little better. Now the art, 10/10, thats all I have to say, even the idle animation of the yawning looks great. First time I played through I didn't get the "true ending" which felt... not good. So I played it through again, got 99% map coverage and did the final battle again, and got the good ending, which felt pretty darn good.But this is why it didnt get the A; Story didn't blow my mind, and I wouldn't play it through again any time soon, but I would come back eventually. It was something simple and predictable but enjoyable, especially that fight in the monestary, by far best part of the game.

I'm not usually fan of this type of game, but the cute artwork and beautiful music drew me to it. I have a soft spot for cute female protagonists, what can I say? I've completed 100% of the map, but still have plenty of challenges to do, like a pacifist run and a run without dying. Not to mention collecting Ivory Bugs & completing Insane difficulty.\n\nAs mentioned above, the art and music is beautiful. The gameplay itself is also smooth and responsive (I am using a keyboard and the only issue I have is forgetting which buttons do what). Transition between the various rooms is fluid and feel rather nice. The bosses are unique and have a variety of mechanics, but for the most part you can look for a pattern and beat them.\n\nSpeaking of the bosses, they range from mini-bosses to full on kick-your-♥♥♥ bosses. The hardest boss for me so far took me around 10 tries to kill it, while before that one, I averaged about 3 tries. For the most part, you will encounter the bosses in a linear fashion but occasionally you can fight them depending on your preference. (I probably killed that hard boss before I was actually supposed to)\n\nWhile exploring the map, you'll encounter areas you can't reach yet. You will unlock these as you progress (obtaining new abilities), kill bosses, or obtain keys. You'll be backtracking a few times, but there is a lovely little map feature so you can keep track of where to go.\n\nIn your travels, you will encounter various characters that give you information or background about the world. It is a nice way to give the option of learning about the world without forcing you into too many forced-reading sessions.\n\nAll in all, it is a pretty decent game. I was able to complete it in about 7 hours in my first run, so it is definately worth the $10 price.\n\n**As a side note, after completing the game, it lets you start over, and keep most of your items & your HP increase. You lose your upgrades and key items. In this "New Game+" mode, I was able to complete the game in little over an hour. (I should add at this point, I'm playing on Normal difficulty)","March 6","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the development team felt like adding anything else, I'd recommend a new playable character in the form of the Pardoner Fennel or the Knight character. Those two have reason to fight the queen just like main character Kaho does.\nIn addition, of the NPCs introduced in the game's 4-6 hour runtime, several do stand out as moderately developed characters in this grim kingdom of dangerous monsters. Askorn, a skeleton looking for his wife, receives some closure should you look for it while Eri, a girl who Kaho meets upon entering the Grave area, leaves more questions than are answered when you give her back her hope (Why do you have this item, Eri? Are you not telling us something about yourself?). Others who give you some guidance or world-building text and either are forgotten or become your next boss fight. I have not taken the Birthstone to every location in question with this statement, but it is unlikely that the cat-lady girl in the Monastery says much else than what I have already seen from her.\nOne of Momodora's greatest strengths is the fluidity of the sprites. Naturally larger sprites move less fluidly, but when many smaller characters/monsters or Kaho herself move, they do so in fairly graceful motion. I point in particular to the Pardoner Fennel boss fight, which is as close to a straight player-versus-player battle you will get.\nSpeaking of the boss fights, I would consider many of them to be very good, though also very dangerous. However, every boss has a reward item you can obtain should you not take ANY damage for the duration of the battle.This one mechanic changes some or most fights from "fair" to "time to kill yourself, you touched a pixel of the hitbox and took damage... for the 20th time in a row." In particular I now point to the Heretical Arsonist boss as well as the Lupiar half of the Lupiar-Magnolia fight. After the Arsonist fight, you obtain the air-dodge... A skill that would have made the Arsonist much easier to obtain her item early. In regards to Lupiar, on the other hand, her part of her tag-team fight becomes difficult the moment you try to no-hit the fight. The reason for this is Lupiar is immune to your (essential) arrows, forcing you to risk touch-damage on a melee-based enemy.\nIgnoring this mechanic, bosses in "Momodora: RUtM" will provide you with a fair challenge, learning their attacks and dodging accordingly. You WILL die to many of them your first time, but proper mastery of ranged combat, healing, offensive items, and leaf-smacking will see you triumph.\nSpeaking of items, I was surprised to find no items that specifically were about reducing the damage that you take, which is shockingly high. Rather, items are broken down between "do damage," "healing consumable," and "utility during travel." During your first run, you WILL have the Ring of Candor equipped to find all the secrets as you travel, right up to any given boss fight, likewise with the Cat Sphere.\nAs for the music... the less said about Karst City's "ambiance" the better. Excluding that one track, the music illustrates the nature of each respective area of the world, the best probably being the Forlorn Monastery's very, well, forlorn and echoing theme. Nothing I'd listen to when walking about, but it carries the meaning while you are playing.\n\nOverall: B+\n- Get this game is you like the "Metroidvania" style of action adventure gameplay.","April 2","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The series has only grown bigger and better with each installment, and this game is a testament to that. Reverie Under the Moonlight is by far the most refined and fleshed out game of the entire series. At first, I thought that this was going to have the more linear structure of Momodora III, but then the game slowly but surely branched out into multiple paths. The combat is incredibly satisfying; the game does a great job of letting you know that you were damaging an enemy (and that enemies were hitting you). The soundtrack is beautiful and truly lends itself to the atmosphere of the game. The enemies are laid out to actually compliment the level design and to make you think differently about each encounter. Though the power-ups themselves aren't quite as satisfying as other metroidvanias on the market, I still got pretty giddy at times. Where this game truly shines is its boss battles (although at one point the pacing falters); they give you a very good challenge without being unfair, and they get progressively more difficult to reflect your progress. Between this game and Pony Island, 2016 is off to a very good start.\n\n9/10","March 30","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a neoretro platform person, every entry in the series is worth time and money (even the free ones, which should be shined up just a bit and sold on Steam, *hint hint*).\n\nThere is such a gigantic leap between the third game and RutM in terms of polish, though, that it shocks me.  The chibis from the first three were great, but the somewhat realistically proportioned characters in IV allow for animations that are just so much more expressive, and the devs took full advantage.  The sound and music are equally pro (but the audio has always been perfect, so no surprise there).\n\nI imagine it would have been very tempting, considering the immense artistic talent at Bombservice's disposal, to put all energies into little artistic touches, leaving the mechanics clunky and the game easy to compensate for imprecision -- but they went all out, polishing the gameplay as intently as graphics and sound.  The major results of this hard work are twofold:\n\n1.)  Kaho, a fragile but versatile heroine that can dodge on a dime, close with a satisfyingly *thwocky* melee combo, and fire laser-fast arrows for chip damage;\n2.)  a handful of great bosses to throw Kaho against, emphasis on the dainty, lithe and deadly Pardoner Fennel, who is one of the greatest indie bosses in memory.\n\nIt cannot be stressed enough how player-responsive and fair the gameplay is; they must have taken an X-acto to those hitboxes, because the Dark Souls-inspired dodge-rolling works even better here than in the games it came from!\n\nI played the game on hard, and it was a tough but perfectly fair challenge.  This is the setting I would recommend for people who have played this kind of game before, and if you take your time and investigate everything, you'll wind up with 10+ hours of mean bosses, precise platforming and superb exploratory adventure.  I've already drawn comparisons to earlier entries, but that's really quite an evolution from Momodora's III potential 25 minutes!\n\nNow, I'd like to give voice to two minor quibbles.  I feel somewhat sheepish about picking on such a wonderful game, but I'm going to anyway.  First, some of the English text is kind of funky.  "Expurge" is not a word (and there were a few other odd inventions I can't remember).  Also, in writing the dialog, the developers should concentrate more on precision; there are many vague or incorrect word choices that do not lend themselves well to the vibe of the conversation.  Secondly (and less importantly), I really miss the character portraits from the earlier games.  Though the animations are very expressive, static portraits would add that final touch to the personalities of the NPCs.\n\nRecommended highly!  Buy it now!  Play the old ones!  Buy all future releases!\n\n(Played as part of my pre-work "Game and Tea" series, though there was considerable weekend spill-over.)","April 16","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Essentially, there isn't as much content as I would have hoped for the price. Of course, maybe I just shouldn't want to compare it to Metroid Fusion in my head?\nStill, you only get 4+1 extra powers, out of which one of them is just the ability to warp between statues. So it's more like 4 if anything.\n- platforming is sometimes frustrating because of insta-kill spikes in the dark room so you kinda think you can fall down and you'll end up in another room, but NOPE it's spikes or NOPE it's insta death in THIS water but not that one.\nThen "Retry" puts you back to the previous save point, so if you mess something up, you have to do it all over again.\nAnd the enemies do a LOT of damage, about 2-3 hits and you're dead. Feels like playing Wings of Vi or something sometimes (and I played on Normal).\n- the requirement for the true ending is rather.. obscure.\n\nAnyways, it was fun, but I wish it had been longer, like Metroid Fusion or Cave Story. This was much shorter than those; kinda like a successful Rogue Legacy run, just with a slight bit more looking around for which way you have to go.\n\nOh, and if you hate dying a lot, you might want to pass on this because the insta-kill spikes and the high-hitting enemies would get on your nerves.","May 14","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To give you some perspective on that, that would include Transistor, Enter the Gungeon, CRYPTARK, Catacomb Kids, Teleglitch, Axiom Verge, CrossCode, the Plague Knight expansion for Shovel Knight, and The Count Lucanor, to name just a few that this game contends with.\n\n\n\n\nI, uhhh......I really like games. >_>;\n\n\n\n\nI'd really like to do a full video review of this game, since that would be a lot less rambly than the towering pillars of text I tend to type, but for now I'd just like to give a quick summary (you know, a paragraph-and-a-half in):\n\n\n\n\nThis game FAR succeeds its predecessors. The last three were alright - and yes, I've played and beaten all three - but that doesn't mean the game didn't leave me disappointed in a couple places. The music and visuals were jaw-dropping, but the story was.....mmmmmmmmmmeh. Of course, the story only refers to the overarcing main plot and objective of the game, which has always been lacking in the Momodora franchise. And mind you, Momodora's focus was never the storyline.\n\nNo, Momodora speaks in ATMOSPHERE. It envelops you in the world - speaking in small pieces of lore that, while they may not fully explain all of the backstory, still make the world around you feel much bigger than it is. And this game is the current apex of that.\n\n\nCombat is more fluid and engaging than ever before. People have used the term " 'Souls-like" to describe games of a similar genre before, but never have I genuinely felt that I was playing Bloodborne as a platformer before this game and I LOVE it. (No, not Dark Souls. BLOODBORNE. Definitely Bloodborne.)\n\nIf I could give one complaint, htough, I've noticed how far the game has strayed from it's original vision. The original one carried a much more clear inspiration from the likes of Cave Story, whereas such inspiration is barely visible here.\n\nNow, that isn't a bad thing in itself, but I realized something towards the end of the game.\n\n\n"How often had I used anything other than rolling to avoid attacks?"\n\n\nTruly, the game doesn't ask for much more of you than that in the combat. Even during the bosses, I rarely find myself feeling any compulsion to jump or duck (save for Purple McBirdFace), and that realization did leave something of a bitter taste in my mouth. It felt like you didn't really demand the player to make full use of every tool in their arsenal, even at the point where they had all their abilities!\n\nOf course, the fact it took so long for me to realize this is in itself also a testament to how well-designed this game is. Even with this knowledge, I've enjoyed the game no less than before, and am currently on my way to beating the last two bosses on Insane mode.\n\n\n\n\n\nAAAAAAAAAAND THIS IS LIKE SIX PARAGRAPHS.\n\n♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nAnyway, great game.

Much like Cave Story, I don't really agree with this. Yes, it has a map that looks like the one in Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night, but if you come here expecting something along those lines you might be let down.\n\nThis is the fourth title in this series, and it's really improved with this entry. The art is much better, and the gameplay itself feels more polished. If you played the earlier games and didn't quite like them, this might be worth giving a shot anyway.\n\nAs I said, the main focus for combat is melee. You have a ranged attack, and it certainly comes in handy, but you will probably want to be right in bosses faces, slashing away with your leaf. You've got a dodge roll also, and you will want to get real familiar with that ability quickly. Getting hit can really hurt, especially when you are fighting a boss. I wouldn't go as far as to call this game difficult, but if you aren't using the dodge roll, you are probably going to be dying a lot.\n\nThere are various items, both passive and active use, that you will find as you play. You can have two passive items equipped, and three active items. The active items refill at save points, so don't think you need to save them for later. Finding more of an item you already have will add to the total for that item.\n\nYou'll also get a couple new abilities as you go, but these aren't anything on the level of Super Metroid. I think you find two abilities that allow access to new areas, and it's always something like a tiny little side path with some item at the end. You aren't going to be coming across any dead ends as you go that you need to return to with a plethora of new abilities that enable you to explore more of the map. Much like Cave Story, the game is pretty linear over all.\n\nStill, it's pretty damn good for what it is.\n\n8.5 maple leaves out of ten.\n\n","May 3","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a nice little metroidvania treat. When I discovered it was part of a sequel I feared I'd have to play the other ones or straight spoil the story just to get what was going on, but no. The simple but effective dialogue gives you a very clear idea of what's happening.\n\nI started on Hard difficulty, being the badass dude that I am, and made it past the cinder area. It's brutal. Bosses kill you in one hit, yet the game gives you recovery items. Hard to use them if you die instantly, so I'd suggest you start with normal difficulty, even for the thrill seekers. I had fun however, and acknowledge that mostly it was my bad, but it's insulting when you do stuff for straight 10 minutes without taking a single hit, then a random boss fight happens and BOOM YOU'RE DEAD ♥♥♥♥♥! And unlike Dark Souls, you die proper and lose the time you invested.\n\nAs for the gameplay, well it's a metroidvania. You have a bow with unlimited arrows that you can charge if you want (protip, you can charge and attack at the same time) but there's also some basic combat in there. It's very simple, with a 3-hit combo, a dodge roll, a air-slash, you can stunlock weak enemies and even some bosses. You also collect money which you can use for items. However, it's not really a RPG. There's active and passive items, but there's no experience nor any ways to ''level up''. There are permanent health upgrades and probably a few key items to boost your damage, but it's not a souls clone. There ain't no 20 classes of weapons, there's no armor either.\n\nThe atmosphere is brilliant and colorful, the trailer is great and it doesn't do it justice. Some enemies are also very well drawn and fit in the environment. There is an easy setting and if you're simply drawn for the artstyle, it's also for you. There's a dark souls vibe in there of course and the story is intriguing enough. You should get it. It's freaking 10 dollars and it'll be good money spent.","April 21","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a neoretro platform person, every entry in the series is worth time and money (even the free ones, which should be shined up just a bit and sold on Steam, *hint hint*).\n\nThere is such a gigantic leap between the third game and RutM in terms of polish, though, that it shocks me.  The chibis from the first three were great, but the somewhat realistically proportioned characters in IV allow for animations that are just so much more expressive, and the devs took full advantage.  The sound and music are equally pro (but the audio has always been perfect, so no surprise there).\n\nI imagine it would have been very tempting, considering the immense artistic talent at Bombservice's disposal, to put all energies into little artistic touches, leaving the mechanics clunky and the game easy to compensate for imprecision -- but they went all out, polishing the gameplay as intently as graphics and sound.  The major results of this hard work are twofold:\n\n1.)  Kaho, a fragile but versatile heroine that can dodge on a dime, close with a satisfyingly *thwocky* melee combo, and fire laser-fast arrows for chip damage;\n2.)  a handful of great bosses to throw Kaho against, emphasis on the dainty, lithe and deadly Pardoner Fennel, who is one of the greatest indie bosses in memory.\n\nIt cannot be stressed enough how player-responsive and fair the gameplay is; they must have taken an X-acto to those hitboxes, because the Dark Souls-inspired dodge-rolling works even better here than in the games it came from!\n\nI played the game on hard, and it was a tough but perfectly fair challenge.  This is the setting I would recommend for people who have played this kind of game before, and if you take your time and investigate everything, you'll wind up with 10+ hours of mean bosses, precise platforming and superb exploratory adventure.  I've already drawn comparisons to earlier entries, but that's really quite an evolution from Momodora's III potential 25 minutes!\n\nNow, I'd like to give voice to two minor quibbles.  I feel somewhat sheepish about picking on such a wonderful game, but I'm going to anyway.  First, some of the English text is kind of funky.  "Expurge" is not a word (and there were a few other odd inventions I can't remember).  Also, in writing the dialog, the developers should concentrate more on precision; there are many vague or incorrect word choices that do not lend themselves well to the vibe of the conversation.  Secondly (and less importantly), I really miss the character portraits from the earlier games.  Though the animations are very expressive, static portraits would add that final touch to the personalities of the NPCs.\n\nRecommended highly!  Buy it now!  Play the old ones!  Buy all future releases!\n\n(Played as part of my pre-work "Game and Tea" series, though there was considerable weekend spill-over.)","April 16","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mark of a great game in my view is one that creates a sense of atmosphere and weight, making the player actually FEEL something. Like how Amnesia creates an atmosphere of pure terror and the weight of current and past events, and Alien: Isolation perfectly recreates the nostalgic, claustrophobic feel of the first Alien movie, this game creates a sense of tragedy and sadness, most impressive when many character models are cutesy, and the main character is a priestess who fights with a maple leaf.\n\nAnd talk about a badass maple leaf. The originality in the character design throughout this game, combined with difficult yet awesome and perfectly paced combat and minimal handholding, story- OR gameplay- wise, leave me with almost nothing notably negative to say about this game.\n\n+ Difficult but fair combat.\n+ Hauntingly beautiful music.\n+ Stellar sprite animations.\n+ Doesn't spoon-feed you story or tutorial elements, you learn by exploring. And failing.\n+ Perfectly executed atmosphere, emotionally moving.\n+/- I still want more, but many have said it is the perfect length.\n- Challenging, so not a particularly casual game, if that's what you're looking for.\nThough I didn't fiddle with the difficulty settings.","May 20","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Looking back on the still excellent Momodora III, it would be hard to believe that RUtM is improved in nearly every aspect. But it is. You don't have to have played Momodora III to understand the story because RUtM is the prequel to the series. Here's the backstory of the game (without spoilers, of course):\n\nThe story is about Kaho, a priestress from the village of Lun. As a curse spreads through the lands, she gets sent to the source of the corruption: the city of Karst that appears to be now under the reign of an undead witch. Kaho's mission is to seal the curse away.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels plus one that unlocks if you finish the game on hard, I think. Even on normal difficulty it's hard as hell at some points (I'm looking at you Pardoner Fennel). Anyways the boss fights are overall intese but never unfair and also very fun. You need to see through their attack patterns and use your skill to dodge and counter attack. If you just go berserk on your enemies you're as good as dead.\n\nIn comparison to the sequel, the graphics have been greatly improved. The sprites are now larger which allows more detail but the devs still manage to stick to the series' retro style. The artworks, pixel art and animations are just beautiful. On top of that there are even reflections on the water and the light effects look great. Many little details, like the waving grass, make the game very atmospheric. Except of the starting area which is a lush forest, RUtM's setting is mostly dark and gloomy which adds to the intense atmosphere. The music finally complements the atmosphere. In fact the music is great. For the first time ever I even bought the OST.\n\nRUtM is a relatively short game but it offers a great replayability. It took me approximately 5 to 6 hours to complete with 100% collectables. But to get all achievements, you have to finish it 3 or 4 times.\n\nConclusion:One of the best (or even the best?) metroidvania style games on Steam. In my oppinion it's on the same level as classic Castlevania games. Very atmospheric, nice boss fights. The title "Reverie Under the Moonlight" is just as lovely as the game and reminds on beautiful Touhou game titles like "Embodiment of Scarlet Devil" or "Subterranean Animism". For only 9,99€ (USD $9.99) it is definitely a must-have.","March 7","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Challenging, but not frustrating, and undeniably fun. Could be compared to a 2d dark souls meets metroid, but very much has its own place.\n\nTo someone who wants to see more in a game than 'just gameplay'... I could write three times this on every aspect of this game such as the beautiful pixel art graphics, the clear variation in zones, the NPC's and hidden story development that makes you want to find out how not only where your story leads you, but theirs too. The ambient and ‘intense moment’ music fits so perfectly in every scenario and is almost always there - but absent in just the right places where silence draws more thought provoking emotion than music would.\n\nTrying to avoid any spoilers, but I really hope this is not the last instalment of this. It was a very bittersweet rollercoaster of emotions.\nPocket Incense is OP :D","May 12","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/endif/recommended/428550/","endif","Cornelius Agrippa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/endif/","30 products in account","Definitely an underrated game. I wasn’t familiar with the series and this really took me by surprise like many other people here and it ended up being very satisfying. The learning curve is just right and I got so hooked on it that when I finished the game for the “nth” time I had all achievements. I think what makes it so good in terms of gameplay is the extremely fluid and responsive control, how well you’re able to control your character in combat and how you’re able to customize your offense with items and trinkets you find along the way.\n\nIn terms of level design, everything is so well interconnected and visually appealing. It rewards the player for exploration and it’s very satisfying when you find a secret. Enemy placement is just right and varies with difficulty really well. All these facts give this game a very high replay value. When it comes to achievements, I think they did the right thing with this game. Instead of having 50+ hand-holding achievements like many other games (“ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: Learning how to breathe”) there’s much less but they are exciting and fun to accomplish. As I mentioned before, visuals are beautiful and the characters are really cute. Man I would pet that witch.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, it’s minimalistic but it keeps you well aware of what’s happening. In other words, you can tell development was focused more on gameplay and design. Don’t take it as a complaint, I’m glad it’s like this and I know lots of people prefer it like this.\n\nMusic-wise, it does a great job blending with the environments and levels, and it scales with excitement really well. I do feel like some boss music’s could be more memorable (Pardoner Fennel and the last boss were my favorites). Level music is really catchy, I had royal pinacoteca’s music stuck in my head for over a week. (Also I never know how to write “pinacoteca” in English, I might have wrote it in Portuguese.) You can hear a lot of default FL Studio’s instruments in the music as well, which is not negative. I think it shows they used every resource they had as optimally as possible to produce the best results. I respect that a lot.\n\nIn conclusion, the game’s length is well worth its price. If you love platformers or metroidvania style games, go for it. Many people also compare it to souls games. While I feel like it took inspiration from them, it atmospheres its own universe. So, thanks for the short-term addiction, rdein & co. I loved it and I hope more games come these guys.","May 15","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
