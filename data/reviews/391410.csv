This is pretty bad game design IMO, as they could have just been added on the first level of the game. Or, like most games, the different tree colors could have been slowly introduced.\nThe UI is visually bad, and somewhat broken (Every level has an ESC button at the top left that does nothing?)\nThe control scheme probably would have faired way better with keyboard controls, but instead has you click and guide the rock with your mouse.\nGame only has one song, and it starts it from the beginning every time you start any level. If you're going to have only one song in the game, make it play continuously through level changes, so you don't always have to hear the first 5 seconds over and over (imo)\nEach level takes about a minute to complete * 15 levels is only about 15 minutes of game time, and that's a stretch even.\nNot enough content to even come close to 5 dollars.\nThis game a simple time waster at best. If there was more content/better design approaches this game could be much better. The concept is good, don't get me wrong! I can definitely appreciate where the dev was going here.\n\nTo be fair, it looks like it was made by just one person. That being the case, I can understand the lack of content and some of these flaws. Being a one man band is tough, so being able to make a finished product at all is an achievement in itself. I think the dev would be wise to look into game design, and to spend more time on touching up on the little things; it's the little details that often make video games pop. To be constructive, I think this game would probably kill as a smartphone app, with more levels, leaderboards, micro-♥♥♥♥-transactions, etc. If I were the dev, that's where my mind would be.\n\ntl;dr\nSimple time wasting game that you'd expect to be low priced/free on a smartphone app store. A good concept, but not enough content.","August 1, 2015","false","0.1"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","42","52","2","2"

The 15 levels come to a ridiculously short playtime; would have been better suited as a web-based flash game.","January 8","false","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yuanmingwang/recommended/391410/","yuanmingwang","wany1981","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yuanmingwang/","3312 products in account","I know this is not an earlly access game but it should be...\nRight now this game is nowhere ready for sell once the major "Cannot click Button Bug" is fixxed.\n\nI was just browsing though my library today I found a game that broke 2 record.\n1. have 0 positive review and 4 negative review.\n2. have only 11 MB in size..\n\nIf my memory serves me right i haven't seen a game that size for 25 years...\n\nSo I decide to give it a try and maybe write a positive reivew to boost status of this game.\n\nOn first glance it's simple menu and decent sound is ok...\nThere is only 1 music i find in menu and in game and it's a pretty good 1 minute repeating mono beat which is actually quite nice to hear.\n\nThen i try to start the game and that's when it hit me..\n\nI cannot click on any of the button on the screen. By move mouse around i find if you click on the empty space about 1inch from the button you able to get into the game.\n\nThe concept of this game is actually pretty good.\n1. you are a rock... (rock of ages comes to mind).\n2. you roll over trees.. Different trees give you different ablity such as speed up.. slow down.. get bigger.. get smaller.\n3. each level there are humans.. you roll over them to kill them.\n4. if you kill them all you win...\nThe controls are fine when you actually in game mode.\n\nIt's quite unique and sounds fun.\nI was able to finish the learning stage no problem.\n\nBut i cannot click and get into any of the 15 levels that's avaible in this game.\nThe button don't work and this time i search all over the screen and cannot find where to start this game.\n\nI really want to give this a thumb up as the first thumbs up for this game but until this game menu problem is fixxed i just cannot.\n\nIt's great effect for developer to create such a small game with unique concept but.. Frankly it shouldn't be ready for sell for 5 dollars. Maybe 30 cents if the bug is fixxed.\n\nStill it should be great learning experience for developer...\n\n2/10 at the moment. if i can actually play it i will revise this review.\n\nRevsion: Was contacted by the developer. It apears this game have scaleing problem right now.\nAfter i set this game to be biggest resolution the game is now playable. And i am able to get into individual stage and play the game.\n\nThere arctually 2 object to this game and you have to fulfile both to win each stage. Kill certain number of basic tree and kill certain number of people. About 30 second after you start each stage the world that you are in start getting engolfed by big chunks of rocks and if you touch them you loses.So far the 15 level available in the game is quite well designed actually.. Blue and pink tree together. 1 makes you slower and the other grow your rock.. red/brown trees together. one make you smaller and one make you faster.. so you want to be fast and big so you have to be very careful.\n\nI am actually color weak(not blind) but i can still tell those colors good enough so i can play this.ttok me about 1 minute each stage without fail until i reach 9. Then after learning each stage layout and took me another 15 minutes or so to complete the rest of the 6 level.\n\nOver all it's pretty good entertainment for about half an hour or so.\n\nHere is the flaw i see in this game so far.\n\n1. too Basic.. add more different trees with different ablity.\n2. stage too small.. make it bigger and harder to navigate puzzle instead of square space every time.\n3. too simple and basic.. it probably more suited for kids 4-8 to first learning computer.\n4. this game is kids simple so why you make rock run over human? make bad insects or something instead of human would be more game proof for parents.\n5. This game need highest resolution to make button to function. Why not limit it to just 1 resolution? or just find a way to fix the scaling bug.\n\nFor a 11mb game for effect and I will give this one a passing 5.5/10 as score.\nBut do not despire.. learn from this game. improve on it and make better games developer. You can do it!\n\nAs of right now the baseline price of over 5$ is a bit high and i recommend you to change it to 1 dollar and maybe add more levels.. trading cards and etc to improve sales.\n\nI don't however recommend this game to everyone as it's too simple and childish..\nif you are a parents and you want your kids to learn colors and mouse control. show them this game and teach them.. a little rock crushing violence though but i think there are worse thing then that out there..\n\nRevised Rating 5.5/10..","September 11, 2015","true","0.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","3"

It's a fun little game that you'll likely beat in not much more than 15 minutes, but it kind of has more fun than it has any right to have.  A level editor would be great, along with more levels.  There's a pretty good game idea here, it's just not fleshed out nearly enough.  No more than a few of the levels are even remotely difficult, but if you just barely beat a level, there is a tense moment or two followed by a smile.  I'd imagine I got this game from a bundle, so it likely didn't cost much, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy my 15 minutes with it.","May 1","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
