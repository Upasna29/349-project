"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirCabbage/recommended/288120/","SirCabbage","sir_cabbage_the_green","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirCabbage/","617 products in account","A long time ago when I was only young I played a Roguelike- This Roguelike was pretty much perfect in my eyes. It had a great mix between being challenging and being accessible. The name of this Roguelike was Castle of the Winds and it has long held a place in my heart as being the best of show out there for this genre. Now I think after many years Castle of the Winds has finally been toppled in my eyes.\n\nDungeonmans is the best Roguelike I have played in a long time- it has an easy to learn and use gameplay which is unforgivable the further out you go. The game captures everything that I loved about Castle of the Winds- the crisp but simple art, the spellbooks for learning new spells, the absurdity of monsters you find in the deep... Then it puts everything into overdrive. With Dungeonmans one of the most innovative features is the Academy which grows based on deeds, you don't simply pour money into this academy to make it better, you fill it with the blood and sweat of a ton of dead dungeonmans. As someone who always likes persistant strength options in Roguelikes, this is good, but what makes it better is the fact that all of the unlocked perks are optional to pick up. If the game is too easy for you, just don't pick up the perk at the start. No harm done. You will still do awesomely if you are skilled enough for the task.\n\nThe music of Dungeonmans is also pretty phenominal due to being the work of the great Zircon, a remix artist who makes the game come alive. The art is pretty standard, but the simplistic nature of it actually works well with what is trying to be achived. As you go deeper into the many dungeons you will find an increasingly powerful variety of loot capable of making you feel like a king- and if you die while carrying one of your favourite swords it is even possible to find the sword in a later playthrough in a more powerful form.\n\nThere is so much to unlock in this game too- you can find hidden skills, dungeons, artifacts of power and more based on how you play and what you do. I won't spoil them, but basically the game rewards you all the way in the best possible way. Overall- this game scratches many itches for me. The itch for a good Roguelike, the itch for constructing my own "x", the itch to find a game I can happily play for countless hours-\n\nFull disclosure though- At the end of this I feel that I should say I was a kickstarter backer. While I don't belive my experience has been coloured by that fact, it is possible that some of my praise is the work of a Rosetinted Glasses look of someone who didn't want to have wasted their money. So please do take my review with that in mind,\n\nEDIT: Also one slight warning- The game is best played with the numpad for movement so if you have a laptop which does not have one... keep that in mind. There is mouse control but it makes the game seem a lot more "slippery". Though, it should also be said numpad controls is just another reason why this game is rocking it CoTW style.","December 9, 2014","true","104.2"," 130 of 141 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","130","141","0","26"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/288120/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3933 products in account","I backed this game on Kickstarter many months ago and it has been one of the few games that hasn't disappointed me at all.\nI'll start by saying this is my favourite game out there, literally.\nI must have clocked in hundreds of hours since I backed this on Kickstarter last year and i've loved every moment of it.\nI've always been a fan of traditional roguelikes, even those that use a ASCII style interface and though recently i've seen more and more games being released as roguelikes none of them really seemed to feel like them to me. That was until Dungeonmans. Dungeonmans is a roguelike in the purest sense made by someone who clearly loves the genre.\n\nIn Dungeonmans You start by picking from 4 random rolled stats (Stremf, Skills, Science and Foom) and then your class from many different classes. Each class starts with different player abilities which you can choose to level up as you play on through the game.\nA key feature to me that makes it stand out is the fact that when you level up and choose new abilities you can choose any from the skill tree, even if that was not the class you chose to play in. Feel like running around with a shield as a Rangermans? Well, you're free to do so. Just...don't.\nThe game, like all roguelikes, has permadeath but that's not the end of your adventure. As you travel through the world and various dungeons you'll kill bosses and collect artifacts and books. Both of these things can be used to level up your 'Academy' which is where you, and all new-spawns will start. Upgrading the academy and bringing back artifacts unlocks things like 'all level 1 potions identified for every new Dungeonman you play with, so even though you lose your progress and level on your Dungeonman when you die, you don't feel like you're starting over entirely.\n\nI've played games like Dungeons of Dredmoor, Rogue Legacy and other modern Rogue-likes and they are great but there is something about Dungeonmans that keeps me wanting to come back and die just once more.\nAnd you will come back to it, over and over, and most likely die, over and over, but dying never felt this good before.\nI should also mention that whilst I play keyboard-only, for those who aren't too comfortable with that there is an option to use your mouse aswell :)\n\nThere isn't too much else I can say about the game, the simplicity and beauty of it is in playing it for yourself. Now that the game is out of Early Access it's content rich and even more fun than before.\nSo if you want a modern yet honest-to-the-name rogue-like with tons of loot, enemies, a soundtrack that really makes you feel epic and dungeon after dungeons after dungeon then this is the game for you.\n\nJust remember, as the developer says himself.\nDon't. Get. Surrounded.","May 28, 2014","true","45.8"," 99 of 109 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","99","109","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/recommended/288120/","SilvaOfWind","Silva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/","338 products in account","For a while now I've considered myself a fan of the rogue-like/rogue-lite genres. I've played more than a dozen of both the free and paid varieties over the years and I'm sure that number will only grow. Despite the breadth of the rogue-like/rogue-lite genres and the sheer variety of games and game mechanics contained in those terms, Dungeonmans is among my favorites. But to understand why I love this game, you first have to understand what it is not.\n\nDungeonmans is not a story-based experience in the slightest. If that's what you want, look elsewhere.\nDungeonmans is not the sort of rogue-like where starvation is a constant threat--there is no hunger mechanic whatsoever.\nDungeonmans is not a rogue-lite. You will not find the twin stick shooter chaos of Binding of Isaac. You will not find the platforming of Spelunky. You will not find the music-based gameplay of Crypt of the Necrodancer. You will not find the castlevania stylings of Rogue Legacy. All of those games are good, but they are not what you will find in Dungeonmans.\nWhat you WILL find in Dungeonmans:\nA skill system that rewards patience and emphasizes maneuvering above all else.\nSeveral classes, from the conventional warrior/mage/archer archetypes to the less common like polearm specialists who can create area of effect zones to bolster their power/debuff their enemies and berserkers with a penchant for dressing with class and drinking tea.\nThe ability to ignore the preset classes and tinker with hybrid builds as you see fit. Wizard/necromancer? Done. Archer with plate armor? Fair enough. Some dude who picks and chooses from several classes at once and potentially sucks at all of them? Rather likely in the short term while you figure things out.\nDungeons to delve and monsters to slay, from slimes and evil wizards to pseudo-British bomb throwing anarchists.\nA system of progression that allows you to build off the successes of previous characters through things like auto-identified potions and scrolls, better starting gear, or more stats to go around. Or, if you feel like it, none of that at all.\nAn overworld map teeming with dungeons to explore, towns to sell excess loot, and occasional bandit camps.\nThe roguelike staple of potentially cursed gear.\nHidden shops staffed entirely by talking bees.\nIt's not a perfect game, as no such game exists. The progression system inevitably bothers rogue-like purists, even though it can be almost entirely ignored or opted-out of. The game's sense of humor can and does rub some people the wrong way. The flexibility of the skill system can leave some players lost, or others annoyed that it isn't as complicated as say, Tales of Maj Eyal. Yet looked at strictly on its own merits, Dungeonmans is what many rogue-likes strive to be: a rewarding adventure where the risk of death comes primarily from player carelessness, where mechanics are simple enough to learn but deep enough to experiment with, and there are always more foes lying in wait to slay. Give it a shot.","October 6, 2015","true","122.3"," 53 of 55 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","53","55","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/288120/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","Underneath the silly, this is actually a pretty fun & well put together Roguelike (a REAL roguelike - not those games with permadeath and level generators that call themselves "roguelikes"), with enough unique features to keep it interesting. Its more than just running dungeons, you have your "Dungeonmans Academy" you need to bring things too to make it better, an overworld to explore, ect. Theres lots to do, many character class & traits choices. I havent played too much yet, but this looks like a Roguelike I'll have fun with.\n\nThe silly, however, is overpowering. Sometimes its amusing, but IMHO it beats you over the head a little too much. It may be funny if you're a teenage guy, I'm a 30-something chick, so I can't judge there. Still, theres lots of clever Roguelike humor for long-term rogue players.\n\nIt is out of E. A. but still seems a bit incomplete (the "help" button in options does nothing that I could see), there are gender options such as "beast" and "who cares" but the only images are of stereotypical fantasy males and females. Come on, if youre going to be silly, give us some funny icons to work with those genders!\n\nThe graphics are pixel tiles. They are colorful and cartoony and fit well with the style of the game. My one (minor) complaint is getting new weapons and armor does nothing to your tile. Like if you have the barbarian shirtless guy with the sword, he remains the shirtless guy with the sword even if youre wearing platemail and carrying an axe. Its kind of nitpicky, but Roguelikes have progressed from the days of "@", or even the tile systems of *Angband. I love games like Tales of Maj'Eyal, or Rogue's Tale where your tile changes depending on what you have equipped. It would be an asset here.\n\nOverall though, this game is defintely worth taking a look at for Rogue fans. It has a lot of content and is something a little different.","December 9, 2014","true","1.7"," 74 of 89 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","74","89","0","3"

I had already been a kickstarter backer when you ran the article, but really didnt have too high of hopes for the game. I was on a kickstarter binge for a while there, and dungeonmans was kind of my long shot.\n\nIn the time since you ran that article, dungeonmans has released, along with a few of my other kickstarter backed games (at least EA builds).\n\nThese games include:\nMassive Chalice\nRoad Redemption\nWasteland 2\nShovel Knight\nDreamfall Chapters\nElite Dangerous\nGodus (bleh)\nStar Citizen\n\nI have spent far more hours in Dungeonmans, than any of those other games. Not saying I dont like the others, they are all (for the most part) great, but Dungeonmans is up there with Spelunky for me in the roguelike genre. It is currently my 9th most played game on Steam with a library of around 300 games. Obliviously most of those dont get much play time at all, but I do game every day (95% Counter Strike), and Dungeonmans keeps drawing me back, especially when I'm in game downtime (waiting for a team).\n\nMy whole point in all of this is that it would be really cool for you guys to run a review on this game sometime. I think its fully released now, its been quite polished for some time.\n\nIt kind of makes me sad that this game didnt make a top chart once, I keep looking for it to gain some love, but I just havent seen much press on it. Get one of your rogulike lovers on it, I would be surprised if they didnt like it. Seriously, the game is like crack.\n\nI bought it for my friend who is also my main CS teammate, we talk dungeonmans builds all the time. I honestly havent even beat it yet, I'm not sure I've even gotten close.\n\nAnyway, I probably sound like I work for dungeonmans at this point (I dont, as far as I know its made by a single person, maybe two), I honestly just feel like gamers need to play this one. Its truly a hidden gem.\n\nThanks for your time\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo yes, Thumbs up\n","April 16, 2015","true","114.7"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","49","60","4","3"

It looked like a typical sprite-based permadeath fantasy roguelike-like, something I'm not the biggest fan of.\n\nAppearances can be deceiving. Having logged many hours since, I find Dungeonmans rather unique. There are roguelike elements, yes, but also a plethora of accessible game design concepts from other genres, some of which have been unjustly abandoned for years, all stuffed into the trappings of a modern indie game.\n\nRemember the simplistic visual charm of early turn-based PC RPGs, such as the SSI Gold Box D&D titles? Dungeonmans has that. How about the grand, synthesized orchestral scores of early Playstation JRPGs? That's here, too. Weaponry with dramatic prefixes and suffixes that denote their crazy powers? A wide variety of procedurally-generated dungeon styles? Humorous tongue-in-cheek dialogue and item descriptions? Skill trees? Potions galore?\n\nDungeonmans is both a parody and an homage to the best aspects of role-playing games over the past two decades, and a sort of fast-paced frustration-free approach to the roguelike model. Yes, each Dungeonmans (or gender-equal Lady Dungeonmans) gets but one life to live, but they leave behind a wide selection of enhancements for the next adventurer in line, some more difficult to retrieve than others. Defeat is quickly forgotten, vengeance is sworn, and progress resumes on the path to crush your enemies.\n\nWhile all the post-mortem handouts make the game less punishing than the average roguelike, mistakes made in combat still lead to a swift death. However, once a player learns the effect of each skill, and how they interact with statistics and potion-based enhancements, progress is limited only by how aggressively you wish to press your luck. Bigger risks bring bigger rewards, and it feels pretty great to outsmart a party of high-level monsters, see them driven before you, then return triumphantly back to the Dungeonmans Academy with many Proofs of Stremf.\n\nThe numerous skill trees lead to many different but equally successful play styles, which keeps things fresh. Speedy players can blast through dungeons as a rampaging “Southern Gentlemans”, while methodical players can become a plodding pillar of death with “Sword & Board”. Understanding the abilities in each tree is essential when taking a Dungeonmans and the Academy to the highest level, and the truly skilled will leave behind only a few grave markers on the path to ultimate success.\n\nThe visual presentation is a good fit with the gameplay, with colorful sprites and environments hearkening back to the pixel art of the 1990s. The avatar selection for the player is limited but memorable, with a range of exaggerated, comical designs to choose from. Distinct sound effects make in-game events easy to identify, and Zircon's soundtrack is fantastic, especially for fans of Hitoshi Sakimoto (Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story).\n\nSo what's missing in Early Access, as of the current v1.6c build? Odds and ends, really. Some graphics are absent, or need to be reworked to better fit the style. There are loopholes to farm stat bonuses that haven't been closed. End game content is sparse. The highest tiers of weapons and armor aren't available. However, unlike other alphas, the game is stable and highly playable. You can create characters, kill monsters, hear the lamentations of their gender-neutral life partners, buy stuff, sell stuff, read books, burn books, slam bad guys, slam potions, and I have yet to get tired of any of it.\n\nOn top of all that, the creator of the game is extremely accessible. Jim hosts bi-weekly live development streams, where soon-to-be-released content is tweaked before an audience. He checks social media and forums regularly, and I haven't seen a question or suggestion go unanswered. This is about as active and transparent as Early Access gets, and may very well be the best part about Dungeonmans.\n\nIf you're looking for a pure unforgiving RNG-heavy dungeon-crawling permadeath fix, look elsewhere. If you fancy genre mash-ups chock-full of swords, sorcery, sandals, monsters, monster blood, traps, digital die rolls, throwback charm, and use of the word "enstremfinize", then I highly recommend Dungeonmans.","October 17, 2014","true","53.7"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

You don't need a profile (xpadder) or anything, it's all fixed in-game. And it feels GREAT. Its not just him fixing keybinds and thats it, it actually plays different, left stick for direction, and you press "A" (?) to actually Move to that spot.

Saying anything else would spoil the surprises, and yes, there are plenty.\n\nEDIT:\n\nCURRENTLY *PARTIAL* CONTROLLER SUPPORT\n@Serge pointed out the fact that you can't play the game using JUST the controller (x360 etc);\n\nHowever before release the game will most likely have full controller support.","November 1, 2014","true","170.8"," 50 of 72 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","50","72","0","15"

The Dungeonmans starter area known as The Academy is the main hub of these innovations. The Academy allows you to make subtle tweaks to your experience. For instance bringing artifacts back to the academy lets future Dungeonmans use stronger weapons and armor then would normally be available to a new graduate. There are several non-player characters at The Academy who can increase new graduate advantages with the riches that your last Dungeonmans gave their life for.\n\nThis game also has a fully realized class system using an intuitive point allocation system.  You also have the freedom to build your own Dungeonmans instead of using a prebuilt starting class. You are allowed to mix and match between magic, melee, and ranged skills over your career. This game has soundtracks, sound effects, and sprite based art that helps to create captivating rogue like environments. The world of Dungeonmans is populated with towns and dungeons galore.\n\nDungeons have ominous soundtracks and gritty sprites, while the towns are depicted with cheerful music and colorful sprites. Towns provide another place to enhance your experience. Towns can be upgraded like The Academy to give you better shop items from the local merchants. The dungeons vary in size, design and difficulty. Besides being filled with monsters, dungeons can have traps, secret treasures, and ultimately end with a showdown with its powerful master.\n\nThe advantages of the Academy are completely voluntary. If you’re looking for a harsher challenge simply don't enhance The Academy and your new Dungeonmans will have no advantages when they start out. Even with the advantages that the Academy provides, you'll still find that the best equipped and experienced players will find challenges in Dungeonmans readily available. This game has provided me with many hours of entertainment. If you’re looking for a rogue like with something new to offer, but the difficulty the genre is known for then look no further.

I mean, I want to be a good mans to the developer, who totally rocked it with this one.\n\nAnyway, Dungeonmans is a great roguelike with a good sense of humor that I found quite charming. The name of the game is used as a point of humor throughout, so basically any phrase that would end in "man" or "men" becomes "mans" instead (Mans-at-Arms, Lizardmans, Necromanser, Lady Dungeonmans, etc). Also on the subject of humor, one of the pictures on the store page shows the "Beeholder" enemy, which fights like a D&D Beholder but spawns bee-type enemies to fight you when it dies.\n\nIf there's one thing I can't stop thinking about this game, it's that it feels like a really well-designed experience. Some people may say it feels simplified, but this is definitely a "less is more" type of thing. I've played ToME and DCSS, and those are fun, but this game has a much tighter scope in my opinion. The graphics certainly don't hurt, either.\n\nIt's got a good system of turn-based movement and combat, pretty standard stuff in that regard. I felt like there was a good mix of single-target and AOE abilities that kept me using different skills almost constantly. A lot of games in this genre can fall apart once you find that one ability that trumps everything.\n\nAlso, it's fairly reasonable to think that if you play your mans well, you'll get at least decent gear and be able to really kick some butt. In all the hours I played, I never once felt like I got screwed because I needed a new weapon that just wouldn't drop, or had an enemy show up that my character wasn't at least capable of dealing with (I know, I shouldn't have gotten arrogant and bump-fought that scrolled monster party...)\n\nFor anyone put off by the mechanic where you can pass along boosts to later generations (it actually can get extremely overpowered if you plan ahead), I would like to state that there's an achievement for clearing the game with a single mans, so that's a good challenge for those looking for the traditional roguelike one-life-to-live experience. That was my first clear of the game, which is probably why I had so many hours logged before it happened.\n\nTL;DR:\nBuy this game, it's super fun. If you do, maybe the developer will make more and I will appreciate you for contributing to that.","October 20, 2015","true","82.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

Each student has been trained in the fine art of monster crushing, and now sets out to go forth and crush said monsters. They can find ways to upgrade their old academy - more books for the school's library, more equipment for the alchemy lab, and most importantly Proof of Stremfs. These things let the battlemaster teach you better stats, and most importantly they mean the next graduates start out with better stats when your current graduate inevitably dies.\n\nBecause yes. It's a roguelike, and you will splat your Fightermans against an enemy with a bigger stick. Or you'll get overconfident, charge into a mob of punks, and die to their fanged pet.

The static character sprites become of little concern with all the wonderful animated effects and amazing soundtrack. It seems initially like a well-done roguelike with some cool mechanics involved. I won't get into those mechanics because it would be too hard to explain them without ranting about how cool they are.\n\nShortly after grasping the game and being on your way in a fun roguelike, you become somewhat awed by how well the game plays and how neat the Academy building, nemesis system, soul-retrieving mechanics work. Then, once that shock starts to wear off, you'll notice the many dungeon themes, each with a whole set of mobs to go with the theme, and you'll start finding new themes. It's like a whole world of oldschool Dungeons and Dragons that's just thrown down for you to explore. Towns to bolster the prosperity of, bandit blockades to raid, Scrobold warrens, crypts, mage towers, it's all here.\n\nNow, there's a few key points that I noticed.\n\nNo worrying about food or inventory limit. That's right, no worries on that. This irked me slightly at the outset, but I rationalized that inventory limits cause you to have to do a lot of backtracking and it gets boring tedious, not fun tedious. And there's a TON of loot to nab! So, removing the inventory limit was a smart move for this game. Well,  with no inventory limit, then hunger becomes pointless as it won't be long before you can just shove a ton of rations in your pack and forget about hunger for a while. It might sound odd to oldschool roguelike players, but the ramoval of the hunger and inventory limit are actually very good for this game and it really works.\n\nThe loot system, while there's just a ton of stuff you're picking up, makes it very easy to manage the stuff you're actually interested in looking at as well as super easy to offload the stuff you don't want, through the clever use of tabs and sell/smelt selections when talking to shopkeeps/smiths.\n\nThe game also has a lot of really cool psuedo-hidden "secrets". Every town is worth exploring. At lower levels, it's easy to ignore towns and, indeed, ignore many of your consumables (not to say lower levels are easy, trust me), but as you start fighting higher level enemies, you start paying a lot more attention to what you're using and how you're using it and you start wishing you'd bought all those scrolls of combat blinking and pin to win, but you didn't need them back then. You'd better grab them up with the next character!\n\nThe combat itself defeats traditional roguelike standards in every way. The skills are all unique and build awesome characters and force you to truly pay attention to what spaces you're moving to. A fightermans doesn't just bump up against a mob until it dies - you have a number of special moves and you'd better make good use of them! What's more, you can customize your characters move sets and pick new skills from any class as you level. The classes are more like archetypes, really, just to give you a start, but you can choose a custom class as well.\n\nThere's a resource building mechanic so that future characters will be more successful, but you can opt to build up those resources and still not use them in the spirit of traditional roguelikes, but they're there if you want to give yourself an edge - and in such a way that you pick which edges you want and ignore the others.\n\nThere's a legacy system as well, but I won't try to explain it, just know that it's very very cool!\n\nProcedural world, running legacies, themed dungeons - a - many, very tactical combat, tons of items and loot to find, towns to explore, libromancers to irritate, lots of enemies, champions, and named bosses, this game pretty much has it all!\n\nTL;DR I honestly cannot give this game enough praise. It's hands-down the best roguelike I've ever played. If you like tile-based, grid-based roguelikes, DO NOT pass this game over!","March 5, 2015","true","30.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

The only reason I do not recommend it is because there is not $15 worth of content or depth and gets repetitive very quickly\n\nIf it was early access and cheaper I would have bought it looking forward to what the 'finished' version had to offer.\n\n+ Humor : it has a good parody of other dungeon roguelikes\n+ Controls : nothing super complicated going on but  it works well\n+ Music :\n+ Graphics : Not incredible but colorful and fits the atmosphere well\n+ / - Academy building : You can find upgrades for your academy that then benefit your future characters. I love this type of persistance that lets you feel like you still made some progress even when you die. The con is that it is implemented pretty poorly and feels like an early access version. You max out the few levels of advancement there are very early on your first character and it doesn't make a huge impact so in the end it's pretty pointless\n+ / - : Unique character classes.. but only a handful and not a lot of depth or choice. I like having classes that play differently to try out and that is true here for the few provided.\n- : Shallow character depth. Especially a negative since the trailer advertises as 'hella character depth' instead of advertising it as casual. There are a few different trees with a few skills each, none particularly complicated.\n- : Little combat strategy.  Fights are very very light on strategy and tend to get repetitive after you get a few levels and unlock your small handful of skills. Enemies are pretty dumb and don't have a huge range of variety.\n-: Boring items. Each character has their weapon type and armor type to focus on. Everything else you find is trash which you just sell or have your blacksmith melt for more pointless upgrades on future characters. The weapons you come use only have a few tiers and the modifiers on magic items are pretty basic number booths that don't really make any difference. Loot just isn't very fun at all. The shops are all pretty terrible and all sell the same exact things. The only reason I'd bother selling loot there is to buy potions. There's an upgrade system for the towns which is a nice idea but implemented badly as the upgrades don't make much of a difference and because it limits upgrades based on how far from your academy they are, even when you upgrade a town you just keep advancing beyond it making it feel wasted.\nI love the ideas of enhancing towns and upgrading the academy.. but there is just.. nothing there. This does not feel like a finished game in the slightest.\n\nIf you like casual roguelikes, wait until it's on sale and then give it a try. If you like depth and strategy, don't bother.","December 20, 2014","false","8.1"," 46 of 74 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","46","74","0","4"

To do so, you delve deep into the several dungeons, ruins, temples and other dens of danger waiting for you to make one wrong move.\n\nIn the vein of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, the game is turn-based, with the "You move, I move" style in that sort of game, but that simplicity gives way to the dozens of skills your enemies wield to make your job a bit more difficult: cryomancers summon deadly icenados to stop you dead on your tracks, Giant Carpenter Bees block your way with ramparts, and let us not forget the Dreaded Jabber-Snap... It's up to you and your inventory to sort these motley miscreants out, whether by sword, spell or scroll.\n\nLeading these dangerous mobs are the Champions, souped-up, buffed-up monsters well capable of turning your Dungeonmans into Dungeonmash if you're not careful. Should you succeed in delaying your inevitable demise by killing them off, you are rewarded with Proofs of Stremf and Relics, oh so useful for upgrading your stats and your Academy. You read that right, the Academy: with each successful item return to the Headmaster, you are granted boosts and passive buffs to your Library, Alchemist, Blacksmith and Museum, giving future graduates a  handy leverage against the dangers awaiting them.\n\nFinally, there is the death system: when you die, and you will, your Dungeomans is dead and gone, with only a tombstone to remember him by. But fret not!: you did not die in vain. When exploring your previous place of death, future graduates may find the body and soul of the Dungeonmans, which grants you stat boosts and, were he powerful enough in his previous life, an artifact weapon, infused with the true Dungeonmans power.\n\nAs the game is, it might seem short in content at times (the developer admitted to the need for more unique weapons and mobs), but what is there is enough to leave us oogling at and begging for more. I heartily reccomend this game, if not for the sake of its quality, then for the value it brings to this generation of rogue-likes.","October 17, 2014","true","184.2"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

I'm over 100 hours in and it still provides new and interesting moments every time I play.\n\nIt's a rogue-like and that means challenging permadeath gameplay; however, the game also has the "Dungeonmans Academy" which provides limited permanence and can make the game more forgiving over time for less skilled players. The combat is highly tactical (all turn-based) and different combinations of enemies continue to provide unique challenges even after you're familiar with how to defeat each enemy individually. The main level cap is 15, which sounds low, but each level represents a significant bump in power and challenge.\n\nCharacter advancement is simple, yet rewarding. Powers can be chosen freely without class restrictions, so you can have a wizard clad in full plate wielding a giant axe if you want. Some powers can only activate with certain gear equipped and a small handful of the most powerful abilities have to be "unlocked", but those restrictions all feel quite reasonable.\n\nOne aspect of this game that's hard to describe is the humor and the overall feel. As you well might gather from the title "Dungeonmans", the game doesn't take itself too seriously. Oddball monster varieties, subtle self-reflective mocking of RPG/adventure game tropes, and humorous flavor text are woven into nearly every piece of the game. It helps balance the seriousness of the gameplay, frequently giving you a reason to smile while playing. It's also nice that the humor is unimposing and unpresumptuous--it doesn't try too hard to make you laugh. It reminds me a lot of the feel of a tabletop D&D session with old friends--occasionally serious, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, always enjoyable.\n\nThe game is highly replayable for a number of reasons. 1) You usually know exactly why you die when you die (needed to drink a healing potion 3 rounds ago, shouldn't have entered that large room at half health, etc). 2) Since the academy makes subsequent attempts incrementally easier, there is always the challenge to complete the game in fewer characters. 3) The randomly generated dungeons occasionally have hidden rooms with very challenging encounters (sometimes optional, sometimes not). On later playthroughs, you can keep it interesting by opting in to these big challenges. 4) There are enough rare/unique items that I still see new loot nearly every playthrough. 5) The developer has teased several types of end-game content which will likely be available once the game is out of early access.\n\nThe last thing I will say is that the developer has done an incredible job with the "early access" phase of this game. He is highly responsive to individual players, he openly shares progress, and regularly incorporates community feedback into the game development. He streams development on Twitch and releases updates regularly. That's exactly why a lot of gamers prefer indies over AAA publishers, so we need to make sure to show our appreciation for the ones who go out of their way to focus on community.\n\nSummaryPROS\nold school rogue-like challenge\nhigh quality pixel art with a retro feel\nboth traditional keyboard and point-and-click input supported\nawesome retro-RPG-inspired soundtrack by Zircon (of OCRemix renown)\ngreat replayability\nhighly engaged, responsive indie developer\nCONS\nPC only\ndifficulty may be frustrating at first if you're new to rogue-likes\nsprites are not fully animated (abilities are, but the sprites themselves remain static)\ndifficulty curve spikes at some levels and falls off at others (may be resolved with full game release)","November 26, 2014","true","352.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

As usual drinking and reading unidentified scrolls and potions can have negative effects.\n- Identified magically enhanced items are blue and identified cursed items are red. All unidentified equippable magically enhanced items are blue so be careful.\n\nThis game has both dungeons and towns to explore. You start at the Dungeonmans Academy where you can get basic training and upgrade later as you complete dungeons. The advantage of upgrading the Academy is that new characters star with better equipment and more knowledge.\n\nThis is a hard game don't expect your first character to survive the first dungeon, half the fun is trying out different characters and playstyles.\n\nI recommend this  for people who are tired of standard Roguelikjes and like homor in their games.\nI've not given class , monster , item or skill names to avoid spoiling the fun.\n\nAlthough the sound effects are fairly minimal the music is exceptional and very reminiscent of Tangerine Dream's 1980's period.\n\nExpect me to update this review as the game is updated.","August 14, 2014","true","486.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

As a recent graduate of Dungeonmans Academy, you are sent forth to make the world safe for ordinary townsfolk. You'll face dozens of dungeon-dwelling enemies, from strange and exotic creatures, to knights and wizards, and eventually come face to face with the Dread Purpleonians.\n\nAfter picking from among some truly abysmal starting stats, your hero-to-be can select from among several pre-built classes, or mix and match masteries to create a customized monster-bashing powerhouse. Each of these classes has a very different style of play, allowing for different tactics. Whether you favor a Wizardmans, Necromanser, Rangermans, or Southern Gentlemans, you'll need to keep an eye on important resource pools like Health, Stamina, Foom, Ire, and Deadpulses to unleash powerful attacks or invoke defensive manuvers.\n\nThe overworld is persistent -- although you can generate a new world map at any time --but each dungeon or tower is randomly generated, as are the beasts and treasures within. Defeat Champions to collect Proofs of Stremf, trophies that allow you to enhance your hero's stats and boost those of future graduates as well.

Things like when you get new skills they aren't automatically placed on your hotbar, and trying to drag a skill in icon form from the skill tree to your hotbar crashes the game.\n\nThere is quite a bit of persistance though. You are always upgrading your academy. The world map seems always the same - at least with a new character with the same academy.\n\nThe overall feel is like as if they made Rogue Legacy (a roguelite platform game) into an actual roguelike game.

Turn based combat in a square tile grid, full keyboard controls, randomly generated loot and monsters, secret passages and a progression system[levelling up] for your character. Diverse and varied classes, albeit in my opinion there is a distinct lack of classes, which I would count as a negative but hopefully classes can be added later or modded in. It also has the characteristic difficulty, if it is slightly easier than most rougelikes but, if you're not careful you can find yourself out of your element and dead quite quickly.\n\nWhat it lacks in the hardcore area it makes up for in the actual playability, graphical fidelity and clarity. While there are some elements of the UI I'm not super impressed with generally speaking its miles ahead in terms of accessability so - if you've been looking to get into the rouguelike genre I think this would be a good place to start. The only problem is that you will probably miss out on a lot of the genre related jokes but there is plenty of humour to be found here which is tucked away in descriptions and text which you only read once.\n\nIn terms of graphics its not amazing, but compared to others of the genre I feel its miles ahead, which a strong aestethic and good clarity you'll never be squinting at the screen trying to see if thats a goblin[g] or an arch wizard[Z].\n\nThe combat, in my opinion is very advanced for a game of the genre. It takes the basics of rouguelike principles and throws a few wrenches in the works. Time honoured tactics of hiding in doorways to funnel enemies in one by one work great. That is until you encounter more advanced monsters - who can fling you around the room, dash through you to surround you and knock you back either throwing you into a room filled with bomb throwing maniacs who are as much a danger to themselves as you or getting behind you turning your careful funnel into a two versus one. Additionally some monsters will spawn barricades and ice blocks to trap you in with their friends which keeps the combat frantic and yet the player must be deliberate and pray that the carpenter bee doesn't summon ANOTHER barricade in the way of the door lest the swarm of blue lizard men things do horrible things with their claws and spears to the heroes hasty behind.\n\nEach class has a distinct playstyle, the gentleman AKA barbarian builds up fury when hit and can unlease it in a tantrum, giving them a lot of buffs to damage as would be expected. The Bannerman fights with a spear and favours being fairly immobile with lifesteal and ranged purity magic - though he can get a move on when he needs to, opting for a more mobile polearm and bow style or entrenching with a heavy shield and poleaxe to cut down multiple foes at a time. You'll be spoiled for choice as each class can be played in a variety of ways. Even the necromancer doesn't really use magic as you would expect, instead generating a resource from corpses that forms the basis of all their spells. Summon the undead to do your bidding or blow up a corpse potentially chaining through an entire infested room causing utter destruction and chaos. There are meaningful choices and paths to take for each class and I think this is one of the games biggest strengths.\n\nAs for the permanent buffs that can be obtained from adventuring and making it back to the Academy alive? They are, for the most part, fairly underwhelming and are more of a kickstart to your adventure allowing you to optionally identify some of the potions and scrolls in the game although - if you like to kick it old school you can and instead discover things as you go. To be fair though, as you progress later in the game some of the artifacts can be quite awesome. Even the stat gains you earn permanently seem to have diminishing returns meaning its hard to get to the point where every character will be utter ownage and its more of a long term slight boost with each run.\n\nAll things considered, this is a refreshing and interesting title in the rouguelike genre. Rouguelike players are notoriously new-game-ophobic as they're comfortable in their habits. This title makes some great efforts to shake things up and I think it has done so tremendously. My only real negative for recommending it is the price point, I'm not sure the game feels justified at the 15$ mark[15Euro for us europeans] but I have got nearly 3 times the entertainment time of a movie ticket for around the same price so I can't complain too much. I probably would have avoided this title at the 20$ mark, but at 15$ it less questionable. If you're not sold on this review but are interested I'd recommend picking it up on sale for anything around or under the 10$ mark. At the time of writing at least, with 7 hours in.","December 12, 2014","true","16.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","2"

It's really not a well-designed rogue-lite.\n\nSo, what is dungeonmans? It's a rogue(lite) game in which you pick a character, customize some of it's stats and perks, select a class (optional) and off you go to slay random monsters around the randomly generated world. Or die horribly.\n\nWhat is different from most roguelike games is,  that unlike most roguelikes where after you die you roll a completely fresh character, is that you can eventually upgrade your starting characters with various perks by bringing back various items to the starting zone: base stats, better starting gear, you can even unlock entire skill trees from the get-go.\n\nHowever, this is where the core issue lies. The game balance is designed with this in mind. You will need to essentially farm stats for your future character to succeed. Otherwise you will literally get one shoted by higher tier monsters. And there is no way of working around it. The hordes of enemies and the lack of complex spells and abilities waters down the gameplay to "grind stats, die, start another characters, repeat" until you EVENTUALLY get strong enough to walk over everyone' faces.\n\nThe "randomly generated" dungeons are very repetitive with no interesting objects to interact with. The loot is tiered, meaning as soon as you get an item from a higher tier the other ones become obsolete. The skill "trees" are a sad joke.\n\nOverall, not a good game, not even as a "babbys first roguelike".","July 21, 2015","false","36.0"," 64 of 119 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","64","119","2","6"

There is so much room for improvement, and such an obvious lack of polishment everywhere:\n\n* There is no story(line) and there are no quests, just an open world. Which is bad, as the game lacks long-term motivation right now\n* There are no difficulty levels, which means, that some players will find the game too easy or too fast-paced, while others will find it too tough or too slow-paced...\n* The interface, in the current state, is pretty bad: unintuitive, ugly and incomplete!\n* Almost all battles play always the same: Kill everything (with your standard attack(s)), press "rest" until you are fully recovered, go on\n* Leveling is painfully slow. After the first couple of level-ups, you will need to "farm" forever to advance\n* There is little depth, little complexity (both not even close to TOME) and very little to do (besides monster hunting).\nThere are few abilities for each class, and event though they can be mixed freely, characters reach their optimal configuration very fast\n* The balance is pretty bad atm. There are dungeons that are labeled as too easy, and thats what they are. Just rush through and kill everything you see. And then there are the other dungeons, where permanent death comes incredibly fast, and is often inevitable\n* Whenever a hero has died, its name is blocked for future heroes\n* Hero creation is a painful process: Stats are randomly generated, and if youre not happy with them, you have to delete the world and hero and start all over...\n(theoretically, you can keep your world, if you can accept to have to think out a unique name after each roll, as every name of every hero you dismissed will be permanently blocked as well).\nThat rolls are saved for several turns, makes the creation of a good hero extremely stressy and time-consuming.\n* There is a very small crafting feature, in which i had big hopes, (to be honest, it was the reason for me to buy this game) but which isnt planned to be expanded, so that there isnt a single aspect, that would make this game unique among the stream of competetors\n* The game uses a rude form of humor, which i can neither enjoy, nor would i expect such a niveau from a professional game\n(f.e. "This library [...] is as barren as my miserable wifes dusty womb and as empty as your rattling head")\n* The game did NOT save my content until i had completely deleted and reinstalled the game.\nBy that time, i had spent a whole hour creating a strong hero, and another two hours playing, just to realize that my whole content was lost in the meantime!\n* On the subjective side, which is an important reason for me to to support a product or not:\nIn my personal oppinion, the dev is arrogant, unmature and unsympathic!\n(One example from the forum, where i asked for WASD key usage:\n"Also, WASD is for chumps [...]. Use the numpad and be a professional").\nI have no words for such a person and behavior, and will definitely NOT support this developer EVER again!\n\nAnd regarding the fact, that the game is supposed to be released soon, no fundamental improvements can be awaited, which is bad, as the game gets repetetive and boring fast, as there is hardly anything to do than killing enemies, which usually doesnt need any tactical behavior and isnt as rewarding as it should be.\nAnd here we got the main problem:\nIts a game about battles, almost purely, which failed in creating a decent mechanic around those. The current possibilities of hero developement are small, and many talents are just not worth using them, so that a player gets to the point, where he has reached the one optimal configuration for each class-combination fast, and after that, the motivation sinks rapidly...\nTherefore, there is -currently- no reason to spend 15$ on this title, where there is so much better stuff available (f.e. TOME, Dungeons of Dredmor, ADOM, Abadon, DoomRL, Elona...) for less or no money.\nStill, there is hope, as the potential is there, and the game is still in developement...","July 11, 2014","false","13.4"," 71 of 133 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","71","133","2","0"

The game takes a little getting used to even with a passing familiarity with the genre.\n\nThere are certain aspects of the game that are not very intuitive right now. If you clear the dungeon closest to your starting Dungeonmans Academy, you'll already out-class all the other surrounding dungeons, with no option to go inside them. You do get an option to receive a handful of loot from them, but it's typically not that great. Once you find a dungeon you can enter, the difficulty is typically much higher than you can handle with just the first cave's loot and experience.\n\nThis quirk resulted in several futile attempts at the game until I figured out that you can enter a dungeon and leave, which marks that dungeon and lets you re-enter it later even if your level "surpasses" it. Since this issue has a workaround, it's not game-breaking or anything, but I do think the level restrictions could be loosened or allow a third option to enter a weaker dungeon anyway, rather than just "auto-clear" and "leave it alone".\n\nThere are some dialog options in your Dungeonmans Academy that seem to do nothing, particularly with the museum curator. I've not run into very many other bugs.\n\nIn all other areas, Dungeonmans surpassed my expectations. The graphics are simple but look great with some nice detail, and are suited to the old-school style of gameplay. There is a variety of classes to play as to change things up if you get bored playing the game one way. The music is pretty good, and gives a nice atmosphere to the various dungeons. There are multiple dungeon "types", such as swamp, catacombs/graveyard, ruins (typical dungeon), and tower. Each dungeon type provides a different experience, and I found it a nice changeup while playing.\n\nThere are also some nice touches such as secret doors, magic pools that will randomly help/harm you, and portals that may take you to rooms filled with either monsters, secret shops, or several strong "champion" level monsters.

Everything's is much more polished, though the help screen displaying the keybindings could seriously need some cleaning up. Edit: They quickly fixed this in a recent update, just a day or so after this review. Coincidence? I like to think they saw my suggestion and listened. Makes me feel special and feel like I helped. :D:\n\nThis is a traditional roguelike with a tileset, and a persistent base called the Dungeonmans Academy that can be upgraded, and all features unlocked/improved can and will be used by future characters. In the beginning, you make a world, then you make your character. The character starts out in the Academy in your world, and you go forth from there. The Overworld is generated when you make your world, and stays the same, though the dungeons continue to be randomly generated. When you die, you make a new character, and go back to the same world with the Academy you've been working on. You can have 3 seperate worlds at once.\n\nThere are plenty of skills and passives you can unlock when you level, supporting many styles of play: Dual Wielding, Sword and Board, Magic, Two-Handers, Necromancy, Bows, Spears, Light/Medium/Heavy Armor(or Light "Armor"/Medium Armor/Real Armor as the game calls them). And I know I missed a few.\n\nThere are also unidentified and randomized names for scrolls and potions too. The large variety of potions and scrolls reminds me of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.\n\nThere's also a lot of goo humor in the game, from the dialogue, item/skill/spell descriptions, and events.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to any fan of roguelikes.\n\nEdit: Since it sorta looks like they saw my review with a suggestion and listened, I'm gonna try and help more, and give suggestions. I'll update this fairly often.\nOnly real problem now is that getting to the center of mountain ranges is a pain, since I hate having unexplored areas within my travel range. It'd be nice to have mountains traversable, but take longer to do so or guarantee us being attacked. In the Roguelike 'One Way Heroics', you have to hold the direction key in the mountains direction for 3 or so seconds, then you move onto that tile. Maybe have it so that happens, and you're guaranteed to be attacked by mountain bandits/scrobolds.\nThis was updated 3 times so far on February 8th, 2015","November 28, 2014","true","23.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This is a roguelike, but with an academy that is persistent between characters, that you can upgrade in a variety of ways in order in order to make the game slightly easier for each subsequent character (these improvements are all optional, so if you want to treat this as a more traditional/dangerous roguelike, you can).\n\nThe game includes several classes that you can play, but this is misleading, since every character can potentially learn every skill.  The classes serve more as a good starting template for a particular play-style.  You can also select the 'Adventuremans' class and build your own from scratch, if you prefer.  Classes include Warriormans, Wizardmans, Rangermans, Necromans, Southern Gentlemans, and Bannermans (as well as the blank slate which is the Adventuremans).\n\nEven though this is early access, it feels like a fully fleshed out game.  The devs are VERY responsive to problems and active in the Steam forums.  And there are more features coming in at a slow but steady pace (crafting, for example, isn't quite there yet, but it's on the horizon).\n\nEven in its early access state, this is one of the best roguelike games currently available on Steam.","July 19, 2014","true","27.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSilverHammer/recommended/288120/","TheSilverHammer","TheSilverHammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSilverHammer/","404 products in account","I can almost give this game a thumbs up.  It has a lot going for it.  It has some dynamic classes you can make, and I like the persistence of the academy where you can get previous hero's gear, id potions and scrolls and a few other things.  I also like the open nature of the world and the fact that you can customize your gear with enchants and stuff.\n\nHowever, there is something that really pisses me off about this game and I consider terrible game design.  I had several good runs just end because of total BS bosses.  Really, the final one took the cake and just was beyond stupd and made me not want to play this game anymore.\n\nAnyway, in general it goes something like this.\n1.  Open a door.\n2. Die\n\nOr\n1. Open door and enter room.\n2.  See some odd effect on a boss and wonder what it does.\n3. Die.\n\nWhen you are in a dungeon where most of the monsters, including champions don't even touch you, that the boss, while challenging, should not one shot you or wipe the floor with you as you desperatly get away.  Unless you are stupid, you should not die like this.   There is an escape scroll you can use, but it takes 20 rounds to activate. Plenty of time to die some of these BS bosses.\n\nNow let me tell you about the last, total BS boss.  It was not even a dungeon boss, just opened a door and there he was.  I guess that makes him a champion and not a boss (even worse).\n\nThe first thing this boss does is steal my weapon.  This has never happened before.  I rummnage around my backpack and get another weapon and equip it.  While I do this, he steals my armor.  Again, this is beyond stupid.  I also have a pet called a hateglacier which is fairly tough.  He 2 shots the pet.  I had close to 400 hp, and he drops me to 60 pts in one hit.  I teleport away (after having lost my really good armor and weapon to this guy).  I do through a scroll.  BTW when he hit me, not only did he do a tun of damage, but he took away nearly all my stamina too.  Then I try and run away, but he is really fast.  I am sucking down potions and teleporting, buring all my consumables. It is no use.  Game over.\n\nI spent like 6 hours on this character and that kind of end just doesn't sit well to me.  Difficulty should ramp up and scale somewhat evenly. It should not spike like a 1000 foot vertical wall.\n\nAll and all this game is somewhat repetitive (after having like 10 characters I was really bored of the first part of the game) and clearly needs some major balance.  If you are in a dungeon and you are fairly "safe" from even the occasional champion, you should not open doors to things like this.  Also stealing equipped items is just stupid (although, if he did not steal those items, I am sure he would have wiped the floor with me anyway).","August 23, 2015","false","21.4"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","13","22","4","0"

I've played dozens of hours and a decent number of characters. It's great to see this game finally get on Steam, and it certainly deserves to be here.\n\nYou can start with the ability to choose one our of a few random stat lines. You then choose a character class, complete with basic skills and gear, or you can choose a generic Dungeonmans and you get to play as you like. You can be part magic, part ranged and part melee if you really like, though I find a combination of two of those damage paradigms works nicely.\n\nThe game has come along nicely since the first public version was released. The creator has responded to feedback quickly and it's obvious that he loves this game, and he wants it to be the best it can be.\n\nWhat I love is how it's permadeath ... BUT your next characters will be better due to the efforts of your fallen Dungeonmans.\n\nI encourage you all to pick up Dungeonmans and hopefully you'll have as much fun as I have had. Or if you choose to wait, at least add this to your watchlist to see how the final game turns out. In my opinion there's no need to wait, as the game is great as it is.","May 30, 2014","true","52.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/288120/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY: A humorous, sprawling, fun, .complex, and deep roguelike game with a persistent world , plenty of player customization, and great replayability/continuing play.  Dungeonmans is a must-buy for fans of RPGs, Roguelikes, and fantasy.\n\nI've played this game through from Early Access  (ver 1.5.1 to be precise) to Full Release (ver 1.02), so I can comment both on the game and it's evolution.  The short form is "it's great and a lot of fun and you should buy it," but to really appreciate Dungeonmans, you have to go into the details - because there's so much to it, and all the elements come together to make something truly special.\n\nDungeonmans is a mix of Roguelike, mild setting building, character improvement, and humor that's quite enjoyable and good-natured, while taking some real planning and tactics.\n\nStart an academy, go forth as a Dungeonmans (the term is gender-neutral) of a given class.  Find loot, bring back artifacts, improve the academy, die horribly, come back as someone else, and venture on.  Much like Rogue Legacy and similar games as you adventure you find things that improve  things for future characters - in this case the academy, your starting character's equipment and knowledge.  Books improve the library, equipment improves the alchemy lab, knowledge improves the museum, leftover equipment lets the blacksmith make new things, and so on.  Sure your character may die, but their legacy lives on (and dies on as you burn through characters).  High-level characters that die can come back as teaching ghosts and characters can retire to teach or do other things.\n\nCharacter building presents you with plenty of choices.  You can start with a premade class or customize from the start with a general Dungeonmans class.  Pick the skills you want to learn and build, and develop your own playstyle.  My personal favorite is a kind of arcane archer, but maybe you'll favor a heavily armored necromancer, a dual-wileding trickster who creates duplicates, or a warrior armed with magical banners.  There's plenty of fun strategies you can come up with depending on playstyle.\n\nImproving the academy and towns, finding resources, and more enhances the chance of current and future Dungeonmans to live longer, venture further, and perhaps unlock the mystery of the game.  Strategic choices, management, and thoughts of the next student really weigh on your mind.  Take a special weapon knowing it may end up collecting dust with your corpse - or that it may let you survive.  Melt down enough gear to build upgrades or sell it for cash (and knowing a future Dungeonmans can buy it later)?   Options once chosen affect the game later.\n\nThere's enchanting of items as well - though unless you spend the resources to do it specifically with Upgrade Hammers (that can break overpowered items), it's random.  Still, with a few scrolls and luck (or blowing a lot of resources recovered from old weapons) you can craft some enjoyably insane stuff.  Want a sword that freezes people in place and sets them on fire?  A suit of armor that resists, well, everything?  Go ahead and make it - or use a Solvent scroll to start over.  You can even find blueprints to make special items if you have the resources.\n\nAdventuring starts out as pretty straightforward adventure-battle-loot.  Over time it evolves as you face more and more powerful enemies, make decisions about using artifacts and crafting items, or figure which towns to upgrade.  The game never becomes too complicated, but it does ramp up in complexity over time.\n\nFinally, there's a lot of depth to the game.  Right when you think the dungeons look alike, you discover something else.  A random boss gives you a chance at improvement. or death  A new monster surprises you.  An item you find is enjoyably bizarre and useful.  Modified towns have new inventory.  Character's that have passed may leave surprising legacies.  Dungeonmans is packed with things to discover.\n\nBest of all, as of this writing, the developers are actively bugfixing and improving the game.  That's the kind of commitment to quality that not only makes it more fun and gives me more confidence, but speaks to the level of commitment to making a good game.  As of this writing I'm on my third playthrough, which should give you an idea of just how fun the game is and how much is in it.\n\nAn enjoyable game with a sense of humor that delivers adventure, challenge, and surprises - all with a sense of sheer, good-natured fun. Well worth the purchase.\n\nAlso worth playing through twice.  At least.","August 17, 2014","true","132.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Dmans is just a fun game about exploring dungeons, crushing monsters and looting all the loot. On top of that, you also get a good sense of humor and rad music and visuals. The Academy mechanic allows your next character to get a leg up if you so desire. Death comes swift in most RL games, and it's nice to have the choice to let your next character slingshot through the early game. But it's your choice if you want to take advantage of the boons, or start without taking them. Dmans plays fast and fluid, and a lot of dungeons can be played on the fly.

The worlds are randomly generated along with the dungeons. Which can make for some seriously deadly surprises if your not prepared for them. Monsters can pull you into a room filled with other monsters and gang bang you in a few rounds if your not packing the proper skills or scrolls. at any time you can redo your world if you get bored with it creating an entirely new space to explore. I personally love this. There are several specializations necromanser and the archery tree IMO are a must along with the "real armor" skill as the first ability negates bleed, and poison damage when used. The game has a good balance of pwers sword and board, polearms, bows, dual wield and 2 handed each with distinct fighting style  all with a tongue in cheek tilt. The game pokes fun at all the tropes of "dungeon games" monsters range from your mundane "Skrobold" play on kolbold to the more serious bad ♥♥♥ super elite named monsters that will one to two shot you even when fully prepared and buffed *they still ahve silly names though xD*   there are still a bunch of hidden things im sure i have yet to experience.\n\nFor those lookign for a quick game during work or to waste 30 min or HOURS this game fills that niche perfectly you can stop anytime save and exit and come back to exactly wher eyou left off  a godsend for those of us with abrupt or hectic schedules.\n\nThe downside is until you get used to how the game plays and its still many bugs that will kill you in combat. You will die...many many many times. after about your 10th character you will have a good idea of what works and what doesnt work. I think im on my 100th character and even after all those deaths im still not even close to get to the end content *mainly because im a dumb ♥♥♥* but also because bugs keep killing my character either through sheer brilliance or inability my characters always tend to die becuase of a glitch. which can be INFURIATING especially when youve worked ahrd and fianlly get a character a suffient level 8+ and soemthing happens and BLAM dead.\n\nCharacter death is BRUTAL. you loose all gear, all equipment and all items GONE. when you create a new character you must level them up and attempt to retrieve w/e kille dyour previous character. btw the thing that kille dyour character takes over the dungeons as a boss and gets a serious boost so if you end up opening a secret door to a boss that one shots you might as well write off that dungeon because your not getting that ♥♥♥♥ back. if your previous character was of sufficient level you will get ONE ITEM randomly choosen typically a weapon some XP and all the quest items they had. which isnt to bad but when you spend rescources on a character and end up compeltley loosing those rescources without a way to retrieve all that great gear it puts a sever damper on your mood especially when the GAME kille dyour character and not your inability theres a difference when the GAME kills a character and when you screw up and take a bite bigger than you can chew or get yoruself into an unwinnable situation.\n\n\nstill even with those gripes i cant put this down i keep coming back to it like some stockholm syndrome patient. I sound liek some beaten wife  "it's not bad ALL THE TIME" Im kidding though Dungeonmans in my most humble of opinion is a great little roguelike title with some good gameplay and challenging scenarios with heavy ephasis on tactics and rescource managment always weighing wether youshould upgrade a certian piece of gear or take on that "Adventurous" level dungeon rather than the mundane one.\n\nThe creator is constantly updating the game and has made an easy way of sending in feedback via an ingame menu. and actaulyl takes that feed back and FIXES the bugs. not to toot my own horn but i've persoanlly pointed out about 20 or so bugs or more and they were fixed within the month!\n\nAll in all Dungeonsmans is worth the money the sheer amount of glee you get after killing a boss that has killed off countless nubmers of your heroes with a special scroll or skill and outwitting the game while rare is worht the ego boost and worth every penny.","December 20, 2014","true","279.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

He's an old friend of mine who really got me into this game, and I could easily parrot everything he said as major selling points. Instead, I'll give you my recommendation to buy this game along with a few others and to play them in a certain order. I believe that this will give you a greater appreciation for the genre and for the gem that this game truly is. Just make sure that you don't get rogue-burn from a glut of rogue-likes and rogue-likes to the point that you can't appreciate Dungeonmans. So here is the order that I recommend playing up to this wonderful game:\n\n1) Rogue Legacy\n2) FTL\n3) Dungeons of Dredmor\n4) DUNGEONMANS!\n\nI recommend buying and playing them all, but Rogue Legacy and FTL will get you used to the idea of permadeath while still letting you grind through things, and Dredmor will get you to a point where you learn to think carefully about your actions (and will punish you for irresponsible crafting, which you need to avoid in Dungeonmans). I've played an immense amount of this game and have successfully completed an Ironmans run of my own (a no-death run of the game). If you're feeling hungry for more rogue-likes and rogue-likes after playing this game, then here are some more that I would recommend:\n\n-Nethack (not on Steam, but free; this is the poster child for a true Rogue-like game, apart from Rogue itself)\n-Crypt of the NecroDancer\n-SanctuaryRPG: Black Edition\n-Dungeon of the Endless (same universe as Endless Space and Endless Legend)\n-Sword of the Stars: The Pit\n-One Way Heroics\n-Fatal Labyrinth (originally on Sega Genesis and not "truly" a rogue-like)","September 27, 2015","true","108.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Combat is fun.  Dungeon crawling is good, with a nice variety of different dungeon types.  Proceedural generation of dungeons works pretty well and there is a decent selection of monsters (though I would like to see more).\n\nI'm giving this a reluctant thumbs up though.  For me, the "unique selling proposition" of this game was the proceedurally generated overworld.  This is what Dungeonmans offered that other rogue likes do not.  Unfortunately, there really is nothing to the overworld.\n\nYes it generates various terrain, roads, towns, and dungeons--but none of this really matters.  Since there are no food or supply requirements, you don't have to worry about distance or travel times.  It makes no difference whether you are traveling through a forest, field, or road--it has no impact on the game.  Well, on very rare occassions you will have a random encounter in the overworld--and where you are will determine the terrain of the battle field, but these encounters are very rare, and you almost always have a choice to avoid the encounter anyway.\n\nIt doesn't matter how far away you are from the Dungeonmans Academy--if you need to go back, there is nothing stopping you--no time considerations, no supply worries, no real threat from the inhabitants--BUT, there is one obstacle, and that is the tedium of walking your icon all the way across the map to turn in some artifacts and id magic items.\n\nBasically what the overhead map amounts to is a very cumbersome and clunky menu where you select which dungeon or town you want to enter.  Unfortunately, instead of just selecting the dungeon with mouse and cursor, your cursor is your Dungeonman and you have to walk it slowly across the menu that looks like a map to select the dungeon you want to enter.\n\nIn short, there is almost zero gameplay to the overhead map element of Dungeonmans--its just a very thematic but cumbersome menu.\n\nIve read a number of reviews for this game that say Dungeonmans is fun, but why play it when TOME already exists.  For me the answer would be a proceedurally generated overworld, but Dungeonmans failed on this aspect.\n\nDespite all that, I have had a lot of fun with the game, so i do recommend it.

While fairly tongue-in-cheek, the game is constantly challenging you to adapt to new monsters and situations. I rarely felt that monsters got cheap shots in on me - careless mistakes were always my own fault.\n\nAlso the game features an evolving Academy, similar to that of Rogue Legacy, where each successive character that dies leaves something in the wake for the successors to benefit from, whether it is knowledge, equipment or skills. This helps cut down the whole starting from scratch and slogging through early areas repeatedly, as you become slightly more powerful each time. This keeps the game surprisingly fast moving for an RPG - I didn't ever feel that I was grinding a dungeon out in order to progress.\n\nIt's somewhat similar to Tales of Maj'Eyal and just as enjoyable.","December 17, 2014","true","102.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While fairly tongue-in-cheek, the game is constantly challenging you to adapt to new monsters and situations. I rarely felt that monsters got cheap shots in on me - careless mistakes were always my own fault.\n\nAlso the game features an evolving Academy, similar to that of Rogue Legacy, where each successive character that dies leaves something in the wake for the successors to benefit from, whether it is knowledge, equipment or skills. This helps cut down the whole starting from scratch and slogging through early areas repeatedly, as you become slightly more powerful each time. This keeps the game surprisingly fast moving for an RPG - I didn't ever feel that I was grinding a dungeon out in order to progress.\n\nIt's somewhat similar to Tales of Maj'Eyal and just as enjoyable.","December 17, 2014","true","102.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Starting over, over and over and over gets Really old after a while. Yes, the stremf point collection makes it a little faster each time, but so what? Doing the same boring crap over again a hundred times, trying to rebuild your inventory and cash supply is mind numbing.   But you know, I could actually grind through that if not for the simple fact that this game is at random TERRIBLY unbalanced, and you can't plan for it.   You can be breezing though a dungeon without issue, then suddenly you're surrounded by higher lv enemies and dead before you can respond. Why not just introduce deadly diseases if you want us to die at random?  "Oops, you died of undiagnosed CANCER! Time to start over!"  No thanks.\n\nI know it's "rogue-like" and people without imagination think that means it's supposed to be incredibly frustrating so that 90% of people won't enjoy it for long, but that's just geek snobbery. This game just plain isn't fun anymore, and I regret spending  money on it. If it were $5, Id say it was worth it. At 19.99 I very much regret buying this, as I won't be playing it anymore.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaintrix/recommended/288120/","xaintrix","Xaintrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaintrix/","363 products in account","As a big fan of roguelikes/dungeon crawl games, Dungeonmans is a solid addition to my collection.  For a bit of background, I have played quite a bit of the genre from the original Rogue and own Tales of Maj'Eyal, Dungeons of Dredmore, etc.  I bought this for full retail price, and at the time of this review have 14 hours completed over 4 characters.  So why was this worth my $14.99?\n\nStreamlined Gameplay:  Dungeonmans provides a streamlined experience with lower barriers to entry than most other games in the genre.   With about 75 skills spread over 8 or so categories you can mix and match your build to your tastes.  While fewer than Dredmore and ToME, I was easily able to understand each category quickly while providing enough flexibility to create interesting decisions during my character progression.   Another great feature is the ability to autocomplete dungeons (with a nice jackpot of loot) that would be of trivial difficulty to your character.  This cuts down the grinding a great deal.\n\nPermadeath and the University:  Yes this game features permanent character death, but unlike most games in the genre Dungeonmans has your core base of operations: the University.  The University contains lots of fun *persistent* features that allows your next run to be that much easier.  These include autoidentification, bonuses to your starting equipment, additional mob information, and free stat boosts.  This greatly cuts down on the intimidation factor since you know each successive run you'll be just that much stronger and wiser.\n\nSense of Humor:  This is hard to describe without experiencing it yourself, but this game has a cheeky sense of humor that I appreciate.  The main tips area in your University is literally a Wall of Text.\n\nAccessible Developers:  If you couldn't tell by the discussion responses, the developers care about their product enough to invest their time to address issues, concerns, and even thank those that are enjoying their experience.  I have seen one even visiting Twitch streams providing advice and support.   I would take a dozen developers like this over a Triple A company that puts out a broken and unsupported product.\n\nValue:  With so many games left unplayed, I started to valuate my future purchase differently.  How much per entertainment hour would I get?  Honestly I can't answer that question for you.  What I can say is that I am at nearly $1 per entertainment hour and the value is only getting better with every playthrough.","December 11, 2014","true","18.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For the most part it's traditional rogue-like fare, the few places where twists have been added work really well and only serve to improve the experience. There does not seem to be any of the more hardcore elements of some rogues (like hunger, involved sound/smell, etc) but the game still provides a rich, deep game play that is fairly quick and fun to jump into but involved enough to capture you for a LONG time as you experiment with different types of characters and strategies in an attempt to just not die.\n\nThe end result is a well balanced game that people new to this type of genre may find a little more "easy access" than some other offerings with various input options (that "just work" when you use them) to control your character and an easy to read/understand interface but enough complexity (and traditional rogue controls if you already know them!) and depth to keep those of us more experienced hooked for.. a long time. Just look at the play times listed for the other reviews. Great $/hr value!\n\nFinally then: expect a world map you traverse to get between dungeons and towns, expect several varieties of dungeon (warrens, dungeons, crypts, temples, towers, etc) each with their own little twists, a "spend points where you want" skill tree, potions and scrolls to identify, loot galore and equipment (potentially cursed or magical or plain), champion monsters and dungeon bosses. The rest go discover yourself :)\n\nps: art is lush and music is awesome.","December 13, 2014","true","74.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagermaestro/recommended/288120/","jagermaestro","Jagermaestro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagermaestro/","350 products in account","TL:DR\n\nAn excellent use of persistence, humor and difficulty with a nice fast paced combat that makes play-throughs seem breezy. It’s not perfect, but it’s very well done. Would love to see more content drop on this game, as I have seen little over the course of owning it.  The pros far outweigh the cons, and don’t kill the satisfaction you get from the game.\n\nPros:\n\nHumor is genuinely funny, which I find to be rare in a game. Perhaps not always the safest humor, but it’s definitely to my taste.\n\nCombat is quick and easy to execute with the num pad or mouse which can be both a boon and a curse as the game does require some critical thinking with little room for error in its tightest situations.\n\nPersistence is done well because the game is satisfying even in a losing scenario. Yes the game is not really feasible to beat in 1-2 or 3 play-throughs, but you’re playing a rogue-lite-like-“worst descriptor for a game ever”. You’re playing a difficult game with perma-death streamlined for quick play… how about that. Why do you need to feel like its fair right from the get go? Because you thought you were King The-best-at-games? If you can get past your own hubris, then playing each run to the best of your ability and feeling like you took home a doggy bag of treats for the next run feels far better in a game that was designed to be played more than once through. Sure you can just hump through the game like an idiot and probably accrue enough power to steamroll as well, but to each their own. This game allows you to get out of it what you put in.\n\nGoing to jump back on persistence here, because this is really what the hook is on this game. Having famous bosses and dungeons that killed your characters grow in fame is pretty satisfying. Going to a boss that killed 2 or 3 of your characters feels like there is cross play-through narrative and gives some context to a pretty random world. Statues in towns you upgraded with champions throws some history into the mix. Overall I would say this does an even better job at rewarding persistence than the Dungeonmans HQ even does.\n\nCons:\n\nHeavy reliance on character displacement as the key to difficulty, which can create some frustrating deaths.  There are definitely ways around this, I simply wish it wasn’t so heavily relied on is all.  It’s the single most necessary to mitigate creature ability, which exacerbates the next con on the list.\n\nCharacter development skill trees could have been a bit more diverse. There are a lot of skills, but maybe not as many as there should be designed around certain characters archetypes. It’s a bit like the game is more designed around armor and weapon as an archetype than skillsets as an archetype. You’ll probably grab wizard skills as a warrior. Hell you will probably be a wizard and necromancer. But the question is really will you use light, medium or heavy armor or dual wield, sword and board, staff, bow or lance. I know that sounds nit-picky given that that’s a huge number of combinations with just those two variables, but I would have liked more non-equipment based paths to travel.\n\nYour base of operations progression is pretty vanilla. It would have been nice to see more varied artifacts being brought in to the mix with more variety in bonuses across play-throughs through the HQ. I know it’s not a management game, but accruing marks of Stremf and storing the odd piece of equipment does feel a little lack luster. Less of a con and more of a missed opportunity.\n\nRNG doesn’t bring a huge amount to the table here other than dungeon layout, and even that isn’t really noticeable. There aren’t a huge amount of unique objects that you feel special seeing that aren’t equipment based. It facilitates replay, but doesn’t enhance it. Rarely do I feel RNG is implemented well, though, so I suppose take this with a grain of salt. I believe RNG should be used to add to narrative, and in this case the persistence takes its place effectively. Again, less of a con and more of a missed opportunity.","October 27, 2015","true","34.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I usely hate rouguelikes but the persistant elements of growing your academy and collecting/storging items and experience from your past dead dungeonmans is very awarding. Delightful bits of humor thrown in there as well.\n\nThere are most definitely some rough edges in the buggy UI, unbalanced dungeons, and incomplete academy but nothing game breaking which is a pass for me. I think once these problems get solves this will be a very solid game. The beauty is that things like balancing issues and a need for additional creative content are only going to be discovered by players and their feedback, so buy this and get dungeoning!","June 3, 2014","true","15.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Game play element blend together perfectly. Leveling up your academy, local ltowns, even as your characters die keeps you wanting more. Reminds me alot of Rogue Legecy's system.. End game isnt completely finished, but is still very challenging, and you'll probably not finish it by the time they update it further as the difficuly ramps up nicely.\n\nWriting is hilarious, and even some jokes at their own expense make the missing elements forgivable; and make you look forward to them; rather than frustrated at the wait.\n\nCombat, leveling, and monster difficuly are pretty much spot on and finished. Much better than games fully completed!\n\nIssues:\n1. Needs lots of work on towns upgrade system. It is interesting, but is very simple and straight forward. If they expanded out the towns (as well as a significant amount to the academy) this could be a real gem, and potentially one of my favorite games.\n\n2. Lots of flavor-text missing on stats/items/abilities. You quickly figure out the important stuff, but a large portion of info is missing. They clearly went with quality rather than quantity as the finished writing is very clear and often funny.\n\nOverall: Worth the price now, and if updates continue, then this could be a amazing game","June 3, 2014","true","9.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

When suddenly I got an error the game stopped (closed) and popped a window the so called crash report which says if you have any bugs explain them leave email and we will contact you or something very similar to that.\nAt first I didn’t care too much. What’s the worst your level 13 + is dead? Although he was not in any danger. Yeah that would be bad but not bad as this. I tried to load my save (city ) it says load my lvl 13 dungeonman (The 1st floor of the Villains of grimsly trail) around x5 times+ I got crash! The same window appeared with crash report and there’s nothing you can do about it. I tried searching internet to try and find a fix it, I even posted in dungeonman steam bug discussion this problem, and you can find it at page 55 if someone is interested. But no luck I did not get an answer on how to fix this game (save). Don’t get me wrong I did send my problem in the crash report with email 4 or more times. Once every week, but developer did not contact me.\nI can start a new city but what is the point? To play and farm some good gear and maybe again get this problem. That’s not fun, If any game (fighting, RPG, rouge like, driving, simulator etc. had this problem I would not recommend it!)\nThis game has smaller much smaller bugs (problems), but many people continue playing this game because they didn’t experience this problem. Or maybe they didn’t get Salty as me.\nIf I didn’t experience this bug (problem ignoring from developer or his team I would have posted amazingly good review and would recommend to play this game. I mean what’s the point of the crash report, forum etc if you will not try and help people to solve something like this. More than 4 months passed did I get an answer on how to fix this bug? NO.\nIf you wisit their official website when was the last bug fix, update for a game?\n25.09.2015","February 2","false","54.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

You spend most of your time having no problem killing individual spawns but then suddenly a champion with about 6-8 other enemies spawns, pulls you towards it, the other block you in and you're ******.\nThey really need to fix the balence to either make it so that the spawn behavior is more stable, not ages of easy spawns then a sudden impossible one, or they need to remove the enemy's ability to pull you towards them so at least you can flee when that happens and come back later.\n\nThe game also desperately needs to make it easier for you to exit the dungeons without having to travel between the various stairwells. Even in the first release of Diablo they realized to make town portal scrolls as common as muck, how come this lesson escaped the creators of this game? Travel is borrrrringgggg!!!!\n\nUnfortunately the 2 problem amplify one another since the risk of overpowered swarms means that you need a proper way to offload the loot, without this you lose a lot more progress when your character gets ganked.\n\nI'd suggest giving Rogue Legacy a try instead, similar concept albeit a platformer/dungeon crawler instead of top-down dungeon crawler. it has a more stable difficulty within individual areas though the luck element to finding new blueprints to improve your character can get frustrating.","April 28","false","4.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Yes, it is nostalgic.  Yes it is fun..sort of.  Yes if you enjoy hard games for no reason due to randomness then you will again enjoy Dungeonmans.  However, after about 7 hours of gameplay, you will notice what the developers want of you.  You are supposed to die, alot.  Hopefully with each death, you earned some symbols of strempf to turn back into the academy or you will get nowhere. Those symbols allow you to boost your stats and the subsequent stats of your future heroe's.\n\nMy issue with this, is that the map never changes, unless you opt to do that and lose the chance to find  your previous heroe's gear on the map.  The dungeons are always the same once the map is generated.  Yet sometimes you will encounter the boss mob in the dungeon and think you'll wipe the floor with him only to die in 3 hits because the game spawned an extra hard boss.  You will be completely decimating the dungeon, only to die quickly to the boss.  This has happened to me several times and is very frustrating.\n\nAt least have some consistency game, so I can enjoy myself after spending 3 hours with one hero.","July 30, 2015","false","22.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

A very nice balance between the randomness and challenge of perma-death featured in most roguelikes, yet also with the ability to keep some of your progress for future charecters with the academy system. The tactical turn-based combat is extremely well-done and has a lot to offer.\n\nSome of the negative reviews are hilarious (not that there are many, and for good reason), a guy spent 70 hours on this game and couldn't beat it and left a negative reveiw. Must suck to be so bad. I beat this game in 50 hours and left me hungering for more. That is the sign of a great game. In this game, if you die, it's your own damn fault because it's TURN-BASED, if you run into a powerful monster you can't handle then use a scroll of teleport and gtfo. Also, after about 10 or more charecter deaths, the amount of stuff that gets piled into your charecter through the academy in terms of stats is enough to snowball you through the game, but there's also other cool features (SPOILER) such as powerful charecters who become ghost teachers at your academy upon death that give future charecters skill points in certain skill trees(/SPOILER).\n\n\nAnyhow, if you feel 50 hours of quality entertainment is worth 10 bucks or so to get this game, give it a try.

Immediately.\nIt  has humour without being silly (IMO). I did not like the humour in dungeons of dredmor, I love the humour in dungeonmans.\nAcademy is a great idea, and provides some progress from game to game, even if a bit overpowered.\nLoved the GUI and 'feel' of the controls.\nBeing class-less (no rigid fighter-cleric-wizard stuff) allows many potential combos. Some are more useful than others, so there's a lot of fun (and frustration) in experimentation.\nLoot, monster types, skills, bosses, map types are all varied and good.\nCons:\nFeels kind of unfinished at times. Stuff are getting fixed, but some glaring ones still remain (shield visuals not transferring from level to level, tiles being wrong at times, loot falling on unreachable places, enemies stacked together, museum monster entries being pointless to name a few)\nStat stacking from death to death can create some really overpowered characters. After the death of a few lvl 10 chars, you'll have a mean killing machine that can tackle legendary places  with ease. Sounds great at first, becomes boring after a while. My winning player killed the final boss with 3 skill hits.\nToo few set items. In ~50 hours I found parts from only two. Several parts, more than once.\nSome dungeon types are too big. Combined with lack of autoexplore, they become *boring*.\nCity functionality is underwhelming. Could do with (a lot of) improvement.\nDungeon layouts could be better.

Also, after about 10 or more charecter deaths, the amount of stuff that gets piled into your charecter through the academy in terms of stats is enough to snowball you through the game, but there's also other cool features (SPOILER) such as powerful charecters who become ghost teachers at your academy upon death that give future charecters skill points in certain skill trees(/SPOILER).\n\n\nAnyhow, if you feel 50 hours of quality entertainment is worth 10 bucks or so to get this game, give it a try. This is a much better game, in terms of gameplay (not graphics, sound, story) than 95% of games on steam.","December 25, 2014","true","54.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strange_guy/recommended/288120/","strange_guy","Strange guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strange_guy/","501 products in account","I was a backer for the kickstarter for this because I enjoyed the demo versions available then and I like the way it has progressed to now.\n\nThis game has a bit lacking presentation quality compared some other paid rogue-likes (still above most popular free ones) using tiles so no animations, fixed tiles not changed by equipment, the help option opens up essentially a readme in another window. I was impressed when banners showed their new effects in tooltips when leveled up, but disappointed to find upgrading light armour didn't do the same.\nThe game keeps things interesting using lots of active abilities on the player but also monsters. However sometimes the list of actives to try to set up, as well as potions to quaff, can sometimes seem overwhelming, one character had 4 abilities to buff themselves up but focusing on that leaves no time to move or attack- and so I found myself focusing on the other 2 abilities that give enhanced mobility and attacks in one. Some longer, cheaper buffs are optimally constantly active but can be a pain to keep up- especially the light shield power offered by light armour skill as using it before it expires causes it to explode rather than refresh and that explosion puts a cooldown before you can make shields again.\n\nIn the kickstarter version my deaths were domiated by a few types of monsters putting out massive damage who thankfully seem to have been toned down- though the triger seems to want to take their place- and since then I've ran into some very nasty bone barons who create powerful summons as well as being strong on their own. Also unleashing ancient kings by opening secrets can sometimes lead to a quick death- unlike other secrets or exile chest which give you a prompt whether to fight them or not.\n\nWhile the game has no strict classes you still have starter options, and even going for choice with the dungeonmans (as I tend to do) you still stick within skill trees so I'll mention as few things. I enjoyed and was pretty successful on the bannermans, though I'm not convinced using banners for buffs makes all that much of a difference compared to just buffing. Southern gentlemans have a fun theme and interesting gimmick of real time that is very flavourful for a berserkerish character but I don't think being encouraged to play quick and sloppy is that good a gimmick, and their skills seem random in a way you seem to need to react to, certainly not good for a character that encourages button mashing. Playing some other characters i found myself relying on archery powers even on characters that started melee focused and wonder if the ability to kite melee enemies and not be kited by ranged ones makes ranged characters too good compared to melee. I did still manage to have a lot of success on a sword and board, so it isn't needed. I seem to remember necromansers used to be very mage related but now aren't, which is nice for options but does leave necromancers (and southern gentlemen) without and clear idea or real synergies with any weapons set up, especially as the game doesn't really say what stats their skills benefit from.\n\nOne major feature, but unfortunately one I'm not a massive fan off, is the idea of a persistant academy you build up. It lets you make characters brokenly skilled, statted and equipped in the early game, but still doesn't really let you skip the early levels. There is also a lot of randomness, or sticking to what successful previous characters have done, that can make the usefulness vary massively between different characters. As strong as characters can be early later on is still a challenge, which is obviously somewhat good, but also means very successful early characters can easily find themselves underpowered. Really not a thing I am sure about, but hasn't been deal breaking and there are neat elements like avenging dungeonmans and aquiring some of their equipment, or gathering information on enemies.","March 22, 2015","true","42.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simple, solid gameplay and mechanics which introduces some nice ideas. The Academy, a persistent base for your heroes built on previous characters blood and sweat, is a clever idea to lend depth to world and new heroes. It adds the extra dimension of trying to set up a solid legacy with a new hero while still playing as your old character. Will Fredrick the Rangermans surpass the great level 12 Wizardman, Fizban? Or will he die at level two because you weren't watching your stamina and couldn't jump away?\n\nBeginning a fresh game can be tough when you have no legacy. Its part of the game to overcome this, stick with it! That being said, the game is quite simple to pick up and play, and skills are not convoluted with text.\n\nThe main thing that will get you killed is your ambition to go one more floor of a dungeon rather than turn around and go home. It won't be until you open that next door that you'll realize you are in over your head.","May 23, 2015","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I might end up liking it over ToME because of it's humor, charm and accessibility.  Both are excellent, so if you've played one of the two and like it, the other is a given.\n\nI've spent about 12 hours with it (I play some steam-less so the hours played won't be accurate) and I've gotten quite far, yet I'm still surprised quite often.  I've barely explored the world map, but that's mostly due to my completely self-inflicted deaths.  I'm getting the hang of it now and the fact that you can combine any class skills together in combos makes for excellent versatility, replay and fun.  Right now, I'm playing a heavy-armor wearing ranger / necro hybrid.  It's awesome.\n\nWhile ToME may be rich in story / lore, Dungeonmans makes up for it in charm.  The visuals, sound and music are excellent.  I especially love the over-the-top level up screen and boss defeat animations.  This game also has some persistence; that is, if you provide your starting academy with certain items you get when completing dungeons, you'll get to assign more stat points to your future "dungeonmans".  You also find rare skill books, and if you'd rather not use them, donate them to your library and eventually you'll be able to start the game knowing more and more scroll effects.  Provide your armorer with loot that's been molten down and you can start your future dudes with stronger armor, weapons, etc.\n\nYou have your overworld map, which is randomized and contains towns you can visit to buy/sell loot, dungeons, bandit barricades and other stuff.  Random battles rarely occur when you're on this overworld map, and you can skip most but not all.  I personally like them; they're different than your usual dungeon crawling and can have variety of enemies including champions.\n\nWhat's also cool is if you die in a certain dungeon, you can go to that same area / floor with your next guy and collect some XP and possibly a weapon.  It's not game breaking but it surely helps.\n\nMouse and keyboard control work very well, but it would be nice to be able to remap the controls without delving into a text file.  Thankfully, the text file is easy to understand so remapping the entire keyboard can be done in minutes.  The file, along with Dungeonmans's savegames are located in \users\*username*\AppData\Roaming\Dungeonmans.  I think the file is keybindings.txt but if it's not, it'll be fairly obvious.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm addicted to this game.  I can already tell it'll become one of my mainstay roguelikes that I can enjoy for years.  To the developer - you should port your game to the PS4 system.  It is sorely lacking in fun roguelikes, and while PC is an excellent platform, your game would be the perfect mix of difficulty, charm and fun for the console community.\n\nWell worth the full $17 I payed.","February 20, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's just great.\nBasically old school Final Fantasy's overworld (but randomized) mixed with traditional roguelike dungeons and encounters no the overworld map. Even random villages gets placed on the overworld map, which you can enter to access shops and various things of interest.\n\nYour main hub, the Academy is the point of persistance (besides the overworld itself) between each character death, where legendary items and knowledge can be stored (such as beast info, rare weapons which take centuries to research hence cant be used by your current hero, etc).\n\nThe music is great, the artwork is great, the tiny animations are great and add so much motion to the traditional square-to-square roguelike mechanics. Just having the characters shake slightly and actually flow between the squares makes all the difference in the world to immersion and the impression of a smooth gameplay flow.\n\nPlenty of skill trees and randomized / named / unidentified potions, scrolls and items.\nWeapons use a similar system to D&D where you might find a 1d6 longsword +2, or simply a 1d8 longsword.\n\nPlenty of humour in the game, quite similar to Dungeons Of Dredmore but not quite as ridiculous. The writing is actually quite good, but you must accept certain intentional misspellings.\nUsually i'm not much for "Lulz i r write rong cuz funneh" humour, but the way they do it in this game is kind of like if it was an ancient past time when the language was simply different.\nDungeonMANS is the basis for that, your classes are called stuff like Rangermans, Fightermans and Necromanser. "The history of the Dungeonman Culture revered their legendary Dungeonmens" et cetera et cetera.\nIt's quite fine, because the non-intentionally-misspelled humour is quite good, with a certain notable reference to a librarians wife's dusty old womb. Good lord.\n\nAll in all, it is just great. Good atmosphere and feel all around. A sleeper hit.","December 27, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's still some effort to what you accomplish as one hero that will improve the chances of survival to the next. Also the game is more "classless" than most roguelikes in that you can chose from any type of skills upon level up. Started as a mage but want to wield a sword or heavy armor? Sure, just invest at level up. Well place humor laces the game through item names, description, plot and skill names and descriptions.\n\nAlso you can make your own sprites!
