If it continues to improve at the rate it has, this could be a game we're talking about for a long time!\n\nHaven't bought it yet, Number One? Make it so!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/myrkrel/recommended/328740/","myrkrel","Myrkrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/myrkrel/","166 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI recommend this to those who like space exploration / adventure games like the classic Starflight, and aren't turned off by lo-fi retro-style graphics.  I'm a big fan of Starflight and I see its influence strongly in Tiny Trek.\n\nTrue to its name, Tiny Trek captures the essence of a certain "Trek" TV series and similar space adventure concepts in a very compact format.  The retro feel of the graphics is very charming (scanlines are optional by the way) - think Atari 2600 era and early 80's PC / Commodore 64 graphics.  The music and sound is in a retro chip style (also reminiscent of C-64 tech), and nicely done.  The graphics and sound create a very nice nostalgic atmosphere which hits the feel of early 80's technology perfectly.\n\nRight now it is definitely Early Access and this means there are plenty of bugs and missing content.  Some features are not fully functional yet.  It also needs some better documentation on how things work.  The good news is that the developer is one of the most attentive and open to feedback developers I've ever seen.  He has welcomed our feature suggestions and design ideas, implemented fixes very quickly and overall is very communicative.  His passion for this project is very clear.  If you buy the game and find things you don't like about it - give him a chance to address the issues you have before slamming the game in a review.  Given his responsiveness, I'm pretty confident this game is going to turn into something great.","February 1, 2015","true","6.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Development is glacial, and it seems very disorganized. The UI is absolutely the worst, Controls are unfathomable. (Try beaming back to your ship for a serious lol.) Basically this game has a serious lack of cohesion. You have all of these elements, and they just don't work. Its an awesome idea, with some fantastic direction, but it really isn't coming together, and I can't see this getting finished for at least six to eight months.","September 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Designing ships to use on your adventure is fun and plenty of options for customization. Really gives you the nostalgic feeling of playing classic DOS games, but with modern features. As you are playing you can feel the Star Trek inspirations as you discover new planets and races. I really liked that not every interaction with a new race was hostile. Was nice not knowing what to expect as you were arriving on a new planet. Looking forward to watching this on grow out of early access.\n\n","April 2, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

What's here though, has so much charm, that I just want to keep playing it.\n\nThe atmosphere, graphics, sound, are all spot-on.  The ship customization is fun, you can customize each of your weapons to look and act how you want them to.  Space battles with other ships are so trek'y!  I love it.\n\nRight now, you can dock and walk around space stations, customize ship, characters, weapons, scan sectors to find planets and life and other ships, warp to them and pick up missions to complete.  You can orbit distant planets around alien suns (and the orbit mechanic is pretty neat!), form an away team and transport down to explore each planet.\n\nThe atmosphere again, is so much fun.  There are little "cut scenes" or chapter-intro scenes, that feel like straight out of an episode of sci-fi tv.  Multiple game modes, training simulations, etc.  I'm loving it!\n\nLots of things aren't obvious at first (you have to go left off the screen to get in your ship from the space station) , I was lost quite a bit at first, but there's some documentation and things that helped me through.\n\nAgain, early access so there are bugs and incomplete areas, but I'm loving what's already here, tons.  Dev's still releasing updates and is very responsive to questions and suggestions, which is pretty cool to see.\n\nHere's to looking forward to the future for Big Odyssey!","January 18","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
