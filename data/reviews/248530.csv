"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/recommended/248530/","kenuty","Kenuty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/","1340 products in account","After reading what this game is about, I was disappointed in what I've played and not because the game is bad in any way or form. It was just plain boring in terms of gameplay mechanic, and the simulation aspect of it all. Yes I actually just beaten this game and I banged my head against my bathtub wishing this was a more complex simulator but instead is an arcadey, tedious, and casual game that needs way more work If you're wondering why I am not playing anymore of this game, This is how long it takes to beat the entire campaign. I think this game can be better than what it is and heres why.\n\nThe game starts off with you looking at the map and seeing that there are 3 Large areas you can explore in the game, You'll start in Thailand then go to South Africa reefs, the last and final reef is the Bahamas all of which is decently sized and looks great.\n\nThe gameplay is about spearfishing, Aim your speargun at a fish, shoot, and watch it automatically get reeled in with camera gameplay and treasure hunting thrown in.\n\nThe missions consist of the player searching for treasures around the area, look around and shoot fish or find treasures for 5-10 mins, find specific fish, or take pictures of fish. These missions will repeat most of the time. You can kill so many fish but when it comes to sharks, turtles, jellyfish, morays, stingrays and so on the game will have a don't shoot box over them. When you do try to shoot them you'll shoot AIR. EMPTY AIR, even if the game says don't shoot I SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SPEAR THEM FOR THE HELL OF IT. If I do so I should also be punished for it instead such as being fined, or sharks coming back to bite me off. Something instead of empty air.\n\nThe graphics to this game is quite nice and there is a good amount of fish to see and capture, the open area in the water and the underwatercave are pretty nicely done also and each of the maps are a decent size. The sound and music to this game is also nicely done HOWEVER\n\nThe mechanic and gameplay to this game is absolutely boring and unimmersive and also very arcadelike. It is very fun during the beginning of the game for about 30 mins then it just became repetitive and boring. Whenever you shoot a fish you'll acquire xp and gold which makes this annoying coin sound as if you're playing a slot game ruining the immersion of the game completely. After earning enough gold which takes about 5 mins or less of you swimming around shooting every fish you see in sight, you can then spend to upgrade 4 different things, your camera, more usb slots to take picture of fish, speargun accuracy and length, and your swim fins, once you fully upgrade all this. You'll swim at a really fast speed and any fishy you see  can easily be minced meat  basically because you'll become the son of poseidon himself. You're basically done and gold will completely become  useless except for spending on more usb slots to take pictures of fish. Hell even the picture taking mechanic is  pretty drysince all you need to do is point it as close to the fish as possible to take a picture as long as they are in the frame, the numbers also have to be 100% or you cant get points for taking thier pictures. Theres nothing in this game that can kill you except make you lose oxygen and there is nothing challenging about the breathing in this game at all, just swim to top and your oxygen can be filled fully without a single struggle, the only way you lose is when you forget that you're not diving but snorkeling.\n\nI think the game could do much better than this in future sequel. I want to be able to control the pulling of the fish in, Taking the spear out the fish or cutting the lines once I hunt them, drag them back to the boat feeling the weight of hunting. Instead of just picking up treasures from the ground with one button players should be forced to brush off the sand and figure out how to extact the treasure out carefully. Also the fact that I should be able to shoot any animal I want and in doing so will have a consequence on my gold or what not instead.\nIf you're going to give players levels and XP in a game it should have a reason except that it was completely pointless. Right now this game has an awsome concept, but it needs to build on that concept and make itself AMAZING. I am not easily impressed because it was downright too simple, super casual.\n\nIf you think I am lieing Go download the game and play it, Congratulations you've basically played 80% of the game for free.\n\nI also want to warn you guys of the dev pulling a fast one on bundle buyers which someone has come to my attention about.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/GameDealsMeta/comments/2e9yqd/depth_hunter_2_has_been_greenlit_get_your_steam/\nhttp://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=saxg1h&s=8\n\nLong story short? Dev promised to try to get keys for people on desura etc, then turned around and rebundled game into a different name and in turn changed thier tune after getting greenlight. He didn't make a different game but took the same game and change its name so he doesn't have to give them keys. I would look up more about this company before you make your purchase in the future. This is something I do not condone from developers of breaking promises. Will not be buying anymore products in the future hell don't even send it to me for free.\n\n+Great Graphics\n+Good sized open area\n+Shooting fish is satisfying\n+Great amount of fish to shoot at\n+Sport is Extreme\n\n\n- Gameplay mechanic too simple, gets SUPER tedious\n- Can't shoot jellyfish, turtles, sharks, morays, dolphins, crabs, urchins, reefs, sponges and the list goes on\n- No multiplayer of any kind or score comparisons\n- Missions are downright tedious and boring, Find treasure, shoot a certain fish, or search out a fish with waypoints showing you directly where the fish is. Sometimes the treasure quest tells you to search in a 40km area then becomes boring as sin searching 30 mins on the ground clicking.\n\nMy advice is to shelf out 10 more dollars, head to early access and get world of diving.","August 21, 2014","false","2.8"," 187 of 244 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","187","244","2","6"

The gameplay consists of either catching the required fish, or of exploring the surroundings - either by taking "perfect" photographs of several fish, or by searching for lost treasures. There is a small element of advancing through the game, since you gather experience and money with every catch or find with which you can buy better equipment.\n\nThe main game consists of three diving locations, to which several can be added by buying the different dlc's. Every location can either be completed by fulfilling the different "mission goals" (which are mostly very basic), or can be just enjoyed swimming along in a free mode. This swimming, looking around and catching fish definitely has something very relaxing about it - this is the perfect game to play after a stressful day at work.\n\nBut the game does lack some features which would make it more attractive - I'd love to get some more information on the different fish swimming around me, and the diving-simulator part really is extremely basic. Everything is being handled automatically, which in a real-world dive surely would not be the case. Some element of action or even tension would have been incorporated here.\n\nAll in all, this is a game which offers just what it aims to do: a relaxing, nice experiencing, without any difficulty whatsoever. The Steam achievements are mostly easy to get, except for some overtly grinding ones (I don't expect too many people to spend 24 real-time hours underwater in this game).\n\nRecommended to anyone looking for a casual, relaxing experience.","May 2","true","11.1"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","5"

Music is soothing, game play is simple. If you want to take pictures, hunt for treasure and just enjoy swimming around with the creatures of the sea then, this is a good game. However, maps are small and more maps are in the version of DLCs. You have limited underwater wildlife you can hunt for and sharks don't attack. In game upgrades are all purchased with the gold you find and the credits you earn while playing the game by hunting the fish and the like.\n\nI really can't give this a rating because, this is the first underwater game I've played of this type that I can remember. I'd have to play more of them before doing so. All-in-all, I'd say it's worth the time and money if you like these type of games.\n\nIt does have a few missions in the game for you to accomplish so, it's not all just swimming around in the beginning. The missions don't seem to be mandatory but, completing them allows you to unlock more upgrades.\n\nEdit: As for more maps, I have 3 maps plus 2 after buying one DLC. Not sure how many maps there are in all though? 5 maps are a lot of exploring.  So, from what I can tell so far is, 3 of the maps are mission maps, the first three. The DLC maps are for exploration.\n\n2 more maps come with this DLC: http://store.steampowered.com/dlc/248530/\n\n\nI would also like to add that, all the pictures you take in game with the camera, it has a feature in your menu to view them and/or, make the as desktop wallpaper.

As I said the graphics are pretty. The controls are "okay". You can try to play this game with your controller, but this is hard. The assignment of keys is unintuitive. You pick up things with the same key, which you use to take photos or shoot your harpoon. The length of the story is 3-4 hours. I got nearly all achievements within 3 hours, but all Trading cards dropped after 4,3 hours.\n\nOverall this game is way too easy. There is no challenge. I want a game which is more like the diving sessions in Assassins Creed IV (+ hunting fish). This would be a great diving Simulator. I will NOT spend my time to collect 500 coins or 100 treasures, hidden somewhere on each map in this game. Same with my 2 remaining achievements: "Spend 24 hours under water" WHAT THE F*CK! "Swim underwater for 100km" NOPE!\n\nThis is an entertaining Diving Simulator (for 3 hours!) Don't try to get all achievements. This is frustrating.\nBuy it in a bundle, or while it's cheap.\n\n6/10","January 23, 2015","true","4.3"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","26","32","2","0"

As casual as can be...nothing really attacks you or anything (except for those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ crabs, but whatevr, lol). Basically, you swim around catching fish, finding treasure, and taking pictures. You can automatically turn those pictures into screen savers if you like, which is a nice feature. You can upgrade your various gear as you gain cash via all the aforementioned activities. There are also quests which are basically catch x amount of this type of fish, find this many treasure in an area, etc...\n\nEssentially, the game just gives you a nice relaxing experience with soothing music and beautiful visuals, with some stuff to do to ehance the experience. You can unlock free roam via completing areas, which then gives you total freedom to just check stuff out.\n\nAt this point, I have finished all the area quests, and probably will get the 95% accuracy achievemnt in my next playthrough. That said, I'll probably keep this one downloaded for those times where I really dont know what I want to play or just want to unwind a bit.\n\nVery much recommended.

The game offers players a chance to hunt for sunken treasures, swim with fishes, take pictures with fishes and, if they are not careful enough, sleep with fishes after forgetting to check the oxygen supply due to being mezmerized by the scenery.Now, if your idea of a fun underwater hunting simulator includes the incessant micromanagement of equipment and inventory coupled with graphic depiction of harpoons being torn out of the fishes' bodies, then you'll be disappointed by Depth Hunter 2.The game is definitely not a hardcore simulation, which is a good thing if you want to enjoy the underwater view, relax, and go for some carefree treasure hunting or a fish murdering spree without bothering yourself with the fact that you can't see your body or legs. The easiest way for you to see if you'd want to immerse yourself in Depth Hunter 2 is to download the demo.

It is meant to be a diving simulator, but is more of an underwater fishing, treasure-hunting, and exploration game. The landscapes are absolutely beautiful, there are Three major locations around the world for you to explore and each has various missions you can complete. I spent the majority of my time playing, scouting for gold coins on the ocean floor and looking for relics. The music is relaxing, the scenery is calming and peaceful, this was a very enjoyable game to play.\n\nThe underwater hunting aspect of the game, or spearfishing, is overly simplified I think. I would like for this to have been more difficult. Killing so many fish in one area should attract predators, but in this game there are none, taking away a lot of the challenge. The closest thing to predators the game offers are crabs. Still, it has it's positive qualities, the underwater scenery being the biggest one.

If you think of it as a game it is probably 7/10 due mainly to its great graphics.  If you think of it as a casual diving simulator it is, in my opinion at least a 9/10.  The gameplay sends you on quests that you must finish to unlock other diving areas.  The quests include spearfishing, photography, and treasure hunting in open ocean and caves.  You also gather coins from the ocean floor as well as from the quest rewards in order to upgrade your speargun, camera, fins etc.  In my opinion the neatest part of the game is the photography.  It is fun swimming around trying to get a great pic of a beautiful fish with a background of a wreck or coral reef.  Then later you can go through your album and make them your pc background.\n\nOne of the main cons I see to this game is working towards a perfect game.  Three of the achieves are going to be a grind now that I have run out of quests and new dive spots to unlock.  Though living as far from the ocean as I am I will probably never go scuba diving.  So for 15 bucks this was a very fun experience for me.\n\nThe graphics are lovely.  The music is a bit repetitive but peaceful and pleasant.  It is a great option for those who do not want their children playing shoot em ups and don't mind if they spear fish.  It is not gruesome.  The sharks don't bite.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/recommended/248530/","shoggofu","YouTube shoggofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/","257 products in account","I've played for two hours straight. It was overall pretty fun, but I felt that there were a few things that were a bit tedious or would be better if they were different.\n- The game is more arcade like than a simulation, you can continuously spear fish rapidly without running out of spears or space to keep fish\n- At one stage I spent 20-30 minutes unable to find required objects which was tedious, but otherwise I didn't really have a negative experience.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ZLDTmXVwAcU\nhttp://youtu.be/CYTOmTVfuEc\nSo you start in the first of free diving regions, Thailand. Each region is an large open underwater area. Within each region you will be given one specific objective after another as you complete them e.g. spear specified fish, photograph seabed, find treasure and so on. You are free to undertake these activities even if the aren't specified in your current objectives e.g. you can take photos and find treasure freely even if your supposed to be hunting.\n-----You have limited oxygen, running out will cause you to fail your current objective and have to restart it. That can be annoying if it was a long task, oxygen levels are easily resupplied by returning to the surface briefly. While no creatures will hunt you down and attack you, having contact with certain creatures will reduce your supply of oxygen e.g. spiky sea urchins, crabs and jellyfish. You can stay down for quite a long time i.e. 8 minutes underwater without breathing so it feel's more like you have a small oxygen tank that you can magically refill in a matter of seconds at the surface. I'm not sure that real divers would stay down for more than a few seconds or minutes especially if they are making such frequent dives. There really wasn't any challenge to managing your air supply.\n-----I found that I didn't really have to carefully stalk and take aim at fish while hunting. So this activity wasn't really satisfying in this way. You can pretty much spear the next fish the moment after you hit the last one and you have unlimited spears. Speared fish will be pulled towards you by the line of your speargun or vice versa depending and how big they and they will disappear when you have contact with them. There is also no limit to the amount of fish you can take and you don't need to return to your boat or anything to offload your catch. Their are certain creatures which you are unable to spear such as manta rays, sharks and those little Nemo clowns. But I basically swam around and slaughtered hundreds of fishes. Which was fun but didn't really offer any challenge.\n-----When I found my first gold coin I was very excited. I couldn't find anymore than that for while. So at first I thought it would have been challenging to find gold coins. However I soon found that there a actually many areas which have a fairly lot of gold coins scattered on the seabed. So I think it was actually too easy to find them and it was no longer satisfying. Also there aren't piles of coins. You have pick up each one individually and they didn't reward me with much cash or experience. Spearing fish provide with dramatically more experience and cash and it was very easy. So there wasn't actually a lot of point in finding the coins other than the possibility of completing an achievement.\n-----Aside from coins there are also artifacts and other valuables to find. I think the first thing I found was the 'Goblet of Doom'. I thought the idea of finding uniquely named objects was kind of cool. Unfortunately most most of the objects I came across afterwards only had generic titles. At one stage I had an objective to find 10 items of treasure around a certain location. The last items took me a long time to find and I was swimming around the same spots again and again. This became tedious, I think that task needed a time limit as some of the other missions do.\n-----You switch between your spear-gun and the camera using the mouse scroll wheel. I had to work this out myself. I don't remember an receiving an instruction from the game. A successful photograph requires 100% quality, which is achieved by swimming close to sea creatures at the right angle.\n-----Spearing, finding treasure and photographing rewards experience points and cash. Reaching higher experience levels rewards coins and at higher experience levels you seem to be rewarded increasingly more cash and experience for spearing or photographing fish and finding treasure. If you return to your boat you can purchase upgrades for your flippers/movement speed, spear gun, camera and oxygen supply. There isn't a huge selection and I basically acquired the best gear after playing for around an hour and a half.\n-----In main menu you can access a page that details all the fish that you have speared with kill count. Average weight and length of each fish is also listed even though they all look the same.\n\nOverall the graphics look good. I think effects used to make it feel undersea were adequate. There was a reasonable variety of sea creatures. The seascape look's nice and there you will occasionally come across sunken ship wrecks, planes etc. These don't really tend to have a lot detail when it comes to interiors. I was hoping that there would be an underwater cavern system and towards the end of my two hours game-play I found one. It appeared to be fairly extensive and maze-like which was cool.\n\nSo a lot of the activities would probably be more satisfying if they were more challenging or just a bit more interesting. It's too easy to kill fish, resupply your oxygen and find coins. The greatest danger in this game for me so far was getting distracted and forgetting to take ten seconds to go up for air. If you didn't have an excessive oxygen supply every task in the game could be much more challenging. Simply giving all artifacts you find unique names and maybe some as well as making gold coins less common and more valuable would be an improvement. Overall this game was reasonable but I think it could be changed to be better.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 20, 2014","true","5.3"," 58 of 104 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","58","104","0","2"

I'll admit it looked really boring and in a sense it was as there is not much variety in the actual gameplay - you catch fish, hunt treasures, take photographs, solve a couple of very basic puzzles and explore the ocean floor and that's it.\n\nHowever, saying that, it was SO relaxing! The scenery was beautiful, the background music was lovely and it was just a nice way to chill out for an hour or so after lots of shooting people in the head in other games!\n\nI got it in a bundle so only paid pennies for it and I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I'd recommend it to anyone who can pick it up cheaply and wants a nice relaxing break from all the hectic games out there.","March 26, 2015","true","11.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

This is a lower budget indie game, but the simplicity of the gameplay coupled with the good graphics engine, makes this a decent experience.\n\nEssentially you hunt fish and collect gold/treasures from the ocean floor. You can also explore wrecks throughout the 3 fair sized levels. You can spend gold to upgrade your characterâs equipment. Faster fins, a better camera, more accurate spear gun etc. Nothing too âdeepâ here, but it still adds to the gameplay. There are several fish types and other hazards to avoid. Itâs just a shame that only a handful are capable of being hunted. I was really hoping to hunt a giant sea turtle or Mako Shark :(\n\nLastly, I really enjoyed the ambient music. It gave me a relaxing escape from the usual shooter games I play. You could call this game a snorkeling simulator because thatâs essentially what it is (and Iâm perfectly fine with that).\n","October 15, 2014","true","4.5"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

Water can be quite impressive when rendered correctly and seeing how new games handle it always seems to interest me; something that began ever since I first laid eyes on the 'Nintendo 64' version of 'Wave Race'. Then I came to realize that the 'Depth Hunter' series were originally mobile games with micro-transactions up the wazoo and I was immediately turned off. Surprisingly enough however, this game is actually quite enjoyable if you're in the mood for a serene experience with a minimal challenge, and don't worry, none of those pesky micro-transactions made their way into the PC version, either.\n\nThe atmospheres in 'Depth Hunter 2' are gorgeous, the music is relaxing, the game  works with a gamepad, and the controls and character animations are quite realistic in feel. There are five areas to hunt within and challenges range from snapping photographs of creatures and shipwreck, to hunting fish and collecting treasure at the bottom of the ocean. An XP system is in place as well, although I'm not quite sure what it does, but it's always nice to see a character leveling up. Purchases can also be made to upgrade equipment, such as a larger USB stick to hold more pictures, a longer spear, bigger oxygen tank, etc. So there is some depth to the game, although minimal, no pun intended.\n\nThe two downsides to this game are the fact that the campaign is short and can be beaten in a few hours, and the lack of any story whatsoever. Personally, the lack of story didn't bother me at all though, as I don't really see how the game would benefit from one. In conclusion, I can definitely see why people don't like this game, but for me, sometimes it's fun to just turn on a game and admire the atmosphere. So if you're looking for something with some action or a challenge, look elsewhere. The price-tag is a bit high, so I would wait until this game goes on sale to pick it up, but other than that 'Depth Hunter 2' is quite enjoyable after a long day with a nice cold beer.","February 10, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

From the main menu you pick the first of the 3 locations and then start on a boat where you receive your first task. Once you accept it, you spawn underwater and have to complete the task in order to get the next one. Quite frankly, not every game needs a deep and meaningful story, but at least some sort of introduction or explanation who you are, why you're there and what you do there would have been nice.\n\nVisualsThe game was originally developed for iOS and the PC version is pretty much just a port with a couple graphics settings (brightness, resolution, fullscreen, image quality, sun shadows, SSAO, water reflection and vsync) added to it. Personally, though, I have not much to complain about the graphics. You surely can't expect next-gen visuals, but there are quite a lot native/PC-exclusive games that look much, much worse than DH2:DD. Especially the lighting works really great in the underwater scenario and some areas, such as the underwater caves with sunrays shining through cave openings, look outright beautiful.\n\nAudioThe music is really good and perfectly fits the relaxing underwater atmosphere, however, the tracks tend to abruptly end when the next track starts playing, so this can be a bit annoying at times, but it's not much of a big deal. What's a real immersion killer, though, are all the other sounds such as the chime when you catch a fish or the coin sound when you pick up treasures or coins. They're way too loud compared to the music and the enviromental sounds and become extremely annoying after a while - especially, when you're on a hunting spree.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is fairly simple and easy to get into. Since this is more of an arcade-y game rather than an actual simulation, you don't have to worry about anything else other than your oxygen level, which can be replenished by simply swimming to the surface and taking a deep breath.\n\nThere are basically 3 different 'categories' of tasks in different variations: Hunt species, collect treasures and photograph species or the enviroment. The hunting and collecting tasks sometimes come with a time limit where you have to hunt as many fish or collect as many treasures as possible within 5 or 10 minutes, however, since the game rewards you for the task itself only and doesn't take into consideration how many fish you have hunted or how many treasures you have collected, you might as well just hunt 1 fish or collect 1 treasure and let the time run out while you do something else. Since there aren't any highscores or leaderboards, you don't know how you did compared to your previous timed (treasure) hunt, so there's absolutely no point in trying because there's really nothing to win here.\n\nFor every action (hunting, collecting, photographing) you earn XP and money. While you can waste your time and search the ground for coins or treasures, hunting fish is by far the easiest, fastest and most profitable way of earning both XP and cash and if you do nothing but hunting for the first couple minutes of the game, you will have amassed enough money to completely upgrade your fins, spear, oxygen and your camera, so you don't need to worry about them later on. So much for long-term motivation.\n\nThe XP, though, is entirely meaningless and might as well not be there at all. When you level up, you get a small cash bonus as a reward, which isn't more than a nice gesture because you can easily get that amount of money by hunting 2 or 3 fish in a couple of seconds. Since you don't have any stats that could increase when you level up, this feature probably just got implemented to give the player the illusion of progress but ultimately fails to.\n\nWhile the tasks are fun in the first location, you quickly notice that you're really doing nothing else than the same things over and over again across all 3 locations, so this can get a bit boring after a while. Swimming around to look for interesting stuff is rather pointless, too. The locations aren't really big and apart from a plane or a ship wreck, there's really not much to see or explore on any of the 3 locations.\n\nThe game does feature a nice amount of species (various fish, crabs, dolphins, sharks, manta rays, ...), though, so it's probably a nice thing for sealife lovers to swim around and identify the different species or just look at them. It really does have a mesmerizing effect to see a gigantice blue whale swim around in the Bahamas.\n\nNote, though, that if you want to troll around and try to hunt a shark - you can't. Nothing else other than regular fish can be hunted. If you aim at a shark, dolphin, manta ray or such, your crosshair will turn red and a red 'Don't shoot!' note will pop up above it. It's nice that the developers obviously cared about wildlife conservation, but come on... this is a chance wasted for another set of tasks that could've enhanced the gameplay a bit.\n\nPlaytime & ReplayabilityIt took me roughly 3.5 hours to beat the game, however, I was also going for the achievements since they seemed rather easy to obtain (more on that below), but if you don't care about them and just rush from task to task, you can probably beat the game in 2 hours or less.\n\nAchievements15 of the 17 achievements are indeed easy to unlock, however, there are 2 extremely grindy ones: 'Captain Nemo' - Spend 24 hours underwater and 'Pro Swimmer' - Swim underwater for 100km. Upon completion of the last location, I was at about 33km/100km, so that means that I would have to spend another 7 hours or so just swimming around aimlessly. And another 14 hours to get the 'Captain Nemo' achievement. Uh.... nope.\n\nI wish that developers in general would finally understand that such achievements aren't funny or fun to obtain. They're plain annoying and dumb - especially in a game that doesn't even remotely provide enough content to keep the player busy for such a long time. What's worse: you can't even let the game running in the background because a fully upgraded oxygen will only let you stay underwater for around 15 minutes until you drown, so you would have to get back into the game ever so often to catch a breath.\n\nConclusionWhile the tasks are pretty uninspired, I actually enjoyed just swimming around and doing them because the enviroment paired with the music really produce an extremely relaxing atmosphere, so I would tend towards a thumb up if you're looking for a way to unwind after a hard day of work or before going to bed.\n\nHowever, the more time you spend in the game, the more you notice that it feels like a game where the developer had quite a couple of good ideas but ultimately failed to work them out properly and just left them in the game in an unfinished state. If you let the players earn cash, don't make the equipment so cheap that it becomes entirely useless to amass even more money once you have fully upgraded it. If you let the players earn XP, reward them with something that makes a difference to the gameplay. If you don't let the players hunt certain species and thus limit the interaction with the enviroment, at least tell them why...\n\nI definitely can't recommend the game at its full price. It simply doesn't have enough gameplay, content and polish to justify the pricing. I probably wouldn't even recommend it at anything below 75% off due to this. Seeing that the game has already been bundled 3 times, it's probably better to wait until it shows up in another bundle if you really want to get it for cheap.","December 28, 2014","false","3.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"

On the one hand I utterly adore underwater games and their setting, on the other I hate hunting in every way, shape or form.\nWhat I figured would happen is that there would be the fun underwater exploration and swimming around competing with the actively hurting fish aspect and that depending on which part was more prominent I'd give it a positive or a negative review...\n\nTurns out it went a different way.\n\nThere are three locales in the game, which you'll go through in order. Each has a variety of missions... which you'll go through in order. They range from catching specific fish, to catching as many fish as you can in a specific amount of time (no minimum amount for success) to finding treasures or taking pictures.\nTo summarize, these are... lacklustre. At no point did I feel challenged, engaged or even relaxed by these missions.\n\nThe hunting aspect of the game is present, but forgiveable as there is no blood, no real skill involved and as long as you're super close to the fish not even any animations... I'm not sure that's a good thing in general, but for me it was.\n\nProgression through the missions as well as capturing / photographing fish and finding coins and treasures give you money and EXP. Money is used for upgrades which make you swim a bit faster, require you to go up for a air less and to make the fishing and photographing slightly easier.\nI will always approve of an upgrade system, and I'm glad it's there... but I wish it would do a bit more. It's easy to get everything and the levels you gain do little more than unlock a few of the upgrades and then just give you bonus coins, and if I were to play a level on somebody else's profile and then be asked if he or she had all of the upgrades or none of them I wouldn't be able to tell.\n\nLacklustre is the name of the game here, and I can't say I recommend it.\nIt's better to just wait until World of Diving makes it out of early access.\n\n---\n\nI did not factor this into the review, but I felt it was relevant to point out that there has been some criticism towards the developer regarding some of their business decisions.\nDepth Hunter 1 was part of several game bundles and had promised Steam keys once the game made it here, instead it hasn't and we get Depth Hunter 2 instead which is supposedly practically identical.\nSeemingly critical updates (like adding a radar for finding treasure that is strewn about) and more than the original 3 levels are locked away in DLC (review of that here).\nI'm not saying you shouldn't buy the game because any of that, but be mindful of it.","January 9, 2015","false","6.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Creates nice relaxing ambiance. Problems :Only 3 levels, takes like 2-3 hours to beat. Most of the fish look the same. You can't do anything with the other cool animals. You use the same gun the whole game, and do the same 3 things (catch fish, take pic, collect meaningless similar looking treasures) every level. No story, you just randomly do missions at the few spots. The upgrades are uninteresting and not that helpful (besides longer breath holding). Your sprint runs out in 3 seconds, takes 30 seconds to refill, and doesn't move you much faster. Then there is a terrible part of the final level where you have to collect 10 different fish, but you don't know what you've collected, and what you have left to collect, which doesn't help since all the fish look identical. Having a list for you to see would have worked, but instead they inflate game length by having you swim around continuously looking for that single last fish, of which you're not sure which it is, while you catch more of the same fish you already have. Other pointless tasks like (collect fish for 5 min) are obvious grabs for increased game length and lack of creativity, especially since it doesn't matter how much you catch. Your levels stop mattering after like 10, but they go up to 30. I have tons of gold but had already bought the 4 possible upgrades. Just a boring repetitive game with nice atmosphere and a stupid final mission. 4.5/10.","May 19, 2015","false","6.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

Honestly, I think it's a very good example of what it is ... that's just not a genre I like too much.\n\nBack in the 90s, there was a popular screensaver that was just a bunch of fish swimming around.  This game puts you in the role of a hunter/photographer/treasure hunter in that screensaver.  It's pretty enough, if not spectacular; it just doesn't have a whole lot of point.  Like the screensaver, it's more there just to help you relax, with small goals and incremental upgrades to make you feel like you're accomplishing something.\n\nIf you want to tool around and chill in a pseudo-underwater environment, get this game.

Doing these things gets you money, XP, and eventually unlocks equipment to buy for your diver.\n\nDepth Hunter 2 is a very chill game that you can relax with and treasure hunt and spearfish at your leasure. The only thing you have to watch out for is some hostile animals like crabs and eventually sharks and so on. The first area so far only seems to have crabs as aggressive critters. If you don't shoot the manta's and other larger docile creatures they will leave you alone.\n\nAgain, I was pleasantly suprised by Depth Hunter 2.

It says "Make a _____" on just about every quest.\n\n-Small maps\nLike it says, the maps are not really that big, they are certainly good looking and a bit interesting to explore, but there isn't much map to it. The standard game comes with 3 maps which can easily be fully explored in a matter of hours.\n\n-Uninteresting treasures\nOne of the things you can do in this game is collect treasure on the sea bottom, things like ancient swords, shields helmets and stuff like that. But it's really just the same stuff scattered around randomly and with no history or story about them, i would have appreciated if the loot was unique for the map you were on and if they were real salvaged artifacts that had been re-created in the game and with a bit of history to read about them. But it's not like that, they also got silly names like "Sword of justice" like it's some sort of enchanted thing from a fantasy RPG.\n\nOverall it's a decent game to get on a sale if you enjoy underwater exploration games, but don't expect to get a whole lot of hours on it, because it's quite easily completed.","May 24","true","7.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Otherwise, at sale prices this relieves a boring weekend afternoon - If I'd paid full price this would have been a negative review.","February 6","true","3.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

Its a ok game for being a underway swimming game and some nice touches here and there. The graphics in the game are nice and like the little details they do here and there. Thereâs plenty of fish swimming around ranging from so reef fish all the way up to sharks and a Blue Whale on one mission. Mission wise the game is kinda short on that. Most of the missions, including the DLC's, are basicly all the same. You either hunt for a certain fish or spear as many as you can, look for treasure, or take pictures. On all the 3 base maps and the 2 DLC's thatâs basicly what you do. There will be a 2-4 missions that will have you stump for a bit on what you need to find but once you get it done, its a cake walk after that. If you do all the missions and don't do free dives, you'll have the game done in hour and a half to two hours. You can upgrade your character, which is a balded head man with no option to change your character, and have him swim better, spear better, and take a lot of pics. Once you done all the missions you can tackle the achievements and with the recent update, makes one of the achievements, Sharpshooter, basicly easy to get since you can hardly miss now. The maps are really detailed with you able to swim around a downed plane, a couple of ships, a sunken city, and a underwater trench. You can swim around as long as your oxygen holds out, which doubles as your health. You can swim right up to any fish and sharks and don't have to worry about getting attacked by any of them. So in short the game is fun and relaxing but gets very tedious and repetitive with the missions.","October 12, 2014","true","36.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

All you have to do to get 100% accuracy is to get close enough to the target until the reticle is green, and then left click it. The target will be reeled in automatically. This makes missions just too ridiculously easy.\n\nOther gameplay elements such as camera photography is also added, but the gameplay is still similar to spear fishing: go near until the quality is 100%, then take the snapshot.\n\nEnvironmental hazards are simply sea urchins and crabs, which will only decrease your oxygen, which can be regained easily.\n\nOverall, beautifully done ocean graphics, gameplay needs tons of improvements.","October 18, 2014","false","6.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Its like a walking simulator only for diving.  Instead of just swimming around, there is treasure to find, or take pictures, and catching fish is fun too.  The world feels very alive, the way the fish move seems very well done.  Taking pictures is very rewarding there is an excellent feature of being able to make them your desktop as well.  There are multiple places to visit for diving that have many attractions under water from ships, to planes, all kinds of things that make exploring fun.\n\nThe dev is active in the steam community, if encountering a bug or making a suggestion the dev is quick to respond.  The music is perfect for the game, gives it a feeling of isolation like being on a real dive.  Missions are as short or long except a couple timed objectives to mix it up.  Great summer game to spend time swimming around exploring the oceans.\n\n\n*This is a snorkel game so be sure to go to the surface when air is low.\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99","September 12, 2014","true","4.2"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","3"

Swim around, spear fish. Sometimes you take pictures of fish or find treasure. Not particularly difficult, no real strategy required, but it's oddly theraputic.

The controls are just right to make spearing fish challenging but not too frustrating. Underwater world is done pretty well, it's a hard thing to master but I think they did a good job. There are a plethora of missions ranging from treasure hunting to fish spearing.\n\nThis is a really casual game. Don't expect a high level of action.\n\nI'd buy this for $5 - Grab on sale\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

While subnautica has a heavy engine, really difficult to have smooth graphics, the engine of Depth Hunter 2 is way more optimized and, the diving experience is smoother.\nIn the same way, subnautica's missions are boring as hell and, scenarios lack life and interest.\nMaps in Depth Hunter 2 are closer to the real thing, as well as fishes.\n\nBut to be honest, this game has very little comparison to the real thing.\nBehavior of fishes is very dummy. Real spearfishing is way difficulter. Here you have very little chances to miss a shot.\nAir is other thing that's weird. Advanced spearfishmen go around 2 minutes 30 seconds, here you have time to build a house.\nIt lacks some other things: stealth, camuflage, fish in holes, etc. and the proper reactions of the fishes to your own movements but, ok, this is a game and, no fishment, no joy.\n\nOverall, an interesting game if you love underwater.","May 14","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its very straighforward, you get 5 areas to hunt (without dlc) with objectives (find and spear this species, find these treasures in this area, take a photograph of this species or location) and you scuba into the depths of the ocean that your in to complete the objectives. A very enjoyable game if your looking for a serene experience with small challenge. The controls are very tight, where you aim is where the spear goes and the swimming is surprisingly easy to control.\n\nThe visuals in the game are very pretty with the changing landscape, the different species of fish and the occasional wreckage here and there which adds greatly to the feeling that your actually in the ocean.\n\nThe soundtrack and the ambient noise in the game is incorporated very nicely that they complement each other, but if your in the mood to only hear the ocean you can change the preset. The sounds do immerse you into the atmosphere of the ocean, which is a good bonus for me.\n\nPros: Beautiful game, great atmosphere, different locations and challenges.\n\nCons: A little on the short side, but you can replay the levels and complete the achievements which adds to the total time played. DLC add more locations and species. If price is a turn off, you can complete the base game with 100% achievements and buy when its on sale.\n\n9/10 If you've been scuba diving this will bring back memories of that experience. Great atmospheric game.","June 1","true","10.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately it didn't last for as long as I would have wished. The game start you off very easy, catch some fish then find some treasure. After that you get to take photos of the beautiful underwater world that Depth Hunter offers. With the xp you earn from catching fish, photographing and collecting treasure you unlock upgraded equipment that make your harpoon line longer, better accuracy, zoom for the camera and bigger oxygen tanks so you can be in teh water for longer periods of time before surfacing. There are 3 beautiful locations you can dive in: Thailand, South Africe and the Bahamas. They come (of course) with different species to hunt and photograph and new missions in each location. The down side to this is that the missions involve either photographing, hunting or looking for treasure, which makes it feel a little same same. I still like this game alot, I just wished there were more to do, if you want to find every treasure in the game you have many hours here, but if you like me got tired after awhile, then it's just to do the missions or "free roam" left.\nTo summarize, a beautiful game to do little in but swim peacefully among the nice fishes and coral reefs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/248530/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Even though Iâve never even played the first Depth Hunter I only recently had the opportunity to play the sequel anyway. Depth Hunter 2 is a beautiful, relaxing game that pretty much anyone whoâs remotely interested in oceans and fish can enjoy. Itâs simple in its setup, but it keeps you hooked by letting you hunt and photograph tons of different fish, while also letting you find lost treasures scattered at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nUnfortunately there is a serious lack of diving games on Steam. I tried to find some games similar to this game, but World Of Diving was about the only other thing I could find.  Thatâs both a good and bad thing. Good as in: âoh, this will feel fresh to new playersâ, and bad as in: âI wish I could play more games like thatâ. Fortunately for us Depth Hunter 2 has just enough content to keep us occupied until the next diving game comes out.\nThe game is easy to get into. You have your basic movement controls (WASD keys) and the mouse can be used to pick up treasures and shoot your speargun. Spears are unlimited by the way so no need to worry about missing a fish (unless the objective tells you otherwise). Then thereâs also a key for the map and for your camera and thatâs it. No rocket science needed here.\nThere are several oceans to be explored.  Each level has a set of missions that you have to complete in order to unlock the next area. These consist of finding treasures, hunting fish and making photographs. Each fish you kill, treasure you find or photo that you make gives you experience points and coins. Level up and youâll unlock even more coins and stuff to buy in the store, like extra oxygen, faster/better flippers or a better gun. Leveling happens fast, however, and after 1 hour of playtime youâre probably already able to buy all the available equipment, which is a shame.\nThe missions are short and thereâs usually no time limit so itâs a relaxing game where you can just take your time doing stuff, even if there isnât all that much to do when you truly think about it. You can run out of oxygen which will return you to your boat, but if you get some air before it runs out youâll be perfectly fine and youâll be able to continue your trip without any problems.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. The sea is nicely captured with fish swimming everywhere, caves and sunlight shining through the water. It looks really pretty. But sometimes objects just pop up out of nowhere, and it seems the draw distance is rather limited. I have no idea why, really, because the game doesnât demand a high-end PC. A minor complaint that the developers might even be able to fix by adjusting some settings, I think.\nThe sounds are limited because, well, youâre in the water but the gun makes a good sound, and the level up sound you hear when you level up makes you want to keep going. That something so simple makes the game that more fun is weird, but, in a way, also brilliant. But Depth Hunter is definitely not the first game to do this. There are tons more out there. But as you can see; it works.\nThe music is subtle and soothing and it fits the gameâs atmosphere. It makes you relax and stop thinking about your daily chores, if only for a couple of minutes. I appreciated it, at least.\n\nThe missions arenât long and can be completed within minutes most of the time. And after finishing the first mission and youâll unlock a mode where you can dive and swim around at your own leisure. There are 3 maps and the first two will take about 30-60 minutes to complete, after that you have the third map. I assumed the last one would have just as many missions as the previous ones but no, there are only two of them and, like that, the game is over before you know it. I managed to finish it in roughly 2 hours which is short. I wish there were more missions and more objectives to complete. Dynamic events wouldâve fit this game perfectly.\n\nDepth Hunter 2 surprised me with its casual and, dare I say, shallow gameplay. Itâs fun, pretty and addictive all at once but unfortunately the journey ends way too soon and the last part of the game even felt rushed to me.  My extremely positive opinion of the game changed just because of that. I donât think itâs a rip-off as thereâs some content in it that could keep you busy for longer than the 1,5-2 hours that the story will take you to complete but I do think that the current price is too steep. So my advice to you is to grab it when itâs on sale, or at least costs â¬10 or less.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]","August 22, 2014","true","6.3"," 23 of 51 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","23","51","0","0"

The problem however comes from the gameplay. The only challenge comes from trying to stay awake while playing. This shouldn't be a game on steam, it should just be something that you do on your ipad/iphone while you wait at the doctor's office. There really is no gameplay to speak of. You swim around endlessly underwater while harpooning countless fish with a hand held harpoon gun (lol) while finding treasure items on the seafloor. It's like one of those point-and-click treasure finder games where you have to click around screen and find all the items, but instead of still images you actually get to do something, albeit not much. I was blown away by how beautiful everything looks. I've never seen underwater graphics in a game look better. It might have even been better had they not included the horrible treasure finding part. It isn't good when you are alt+tabbing out to the game's store page on steam to see if the game has any real objectives or other things to actually do that are fun. It also might be the smoothest running game ever. It's too bad there is really nothing fun to do, just swim around and fight off the sandman.\n\nMr. Sandman, bring me a treat. Engaging gameplay with fun objectives can't be beat. Both of which this game has none of.","December 21, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

DH2 introduces an XP and coin system, allowing you to level up and buy new equipment.  There isn't a lot to purchase mind you, but at least it (combined with the XP system) gives you a feeling of progression.  You also don't need to manually reel in the fish this time around (DH1 featured an annoying mini-game when you speared a fish).  Rather, the game reels the fish in for you automatically.  Folks who wanted or expected a hardcore diving sim won't find it here, but it's perfect for casual players who just want to enjoy the ambience, take pictures, and relax a bit.  Easy to recommend given the current price tag.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hut7PKRNIxU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD-4_14i0Uk","August 21, 2014","true","2.5"," 12 of 38 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","12","38","0","0"

As a righteous, God-fearing 'Murican, it is your duty to murder every single terrorist fish in sight. Not only does the game allow you to murder to your heart's content, but it encourages you by giving you two missions where you must murder the most amount of fish you can in five and ten minutes, respectively. The only fish you cant kill will be displayed with a red indicator on your HUD, because righteous 'Muricans only murder civilian fish with bombs. In between killing terrorists, you can also rob liberate them of their terrorist treasure. There's also a camera, in case you are a damn dirty peace-loving HIPPY COMMUNIST who loves to shoot pictures instead of bullets.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Lots of terrorist fish to murder.\n2. 'MURICA!\n3. Soothing music will help reduce 'Nam PTSD attacks.\n4, Bullets are hitscan, so us 'Muricans don't have to worry about such things like aiming or simple math.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The game uses the metric system. I suspect the developers are dirty commies.\n2. You cant murder sting rays. Seriously, they killed Steve Irwin, you don't F' with Steve Irwin.\n3. There's only one gun. Come on, you would think a standard shotgun or a rocket launcher would make it in. I guess you play an ultra black ops 'Murican who has to supply himself.\n4.

Very relaxing.  Basically you swim around and either A) go harpoon fishing, where you single-handedly reduce the Pacific ocean's fish stocks by 50% with a speargun, B) Look for treasure, which is floating around the reef floor and pick up ancient plates and statues and such, or C) take photographs of various underwater attractions, like sunken planes and ships, coral reefs and other fauna, and underwater ruins.\n\nAll three are fairly relaxing, though fishing becomes tedious quickly because of the relatively small number of fish you're allowed to spear (no dolphins or sharks or sea turtles, I'm afraid).   Trying to find every piece of treasure in a given area can get a bit tedious as well, so I would say photography mode is my favorite.  Exploring the wrecks is especially interesting.  I wish it were possible to turn off the navigation points within them though (maybe it is but I didn't see the option).\n\nAlong the way you'll gain experience and money that can be used to unlock levels and purchase new gear, like flippers that let you swim faster and a camera with better zoom or more storage, or let you go longer between surfacing for air (because apparently you aren't SCUBA diving, but are in fact a snorkler with the world's greatest lung capacity).  It's all pretty easy to do and there isn't much in the way of grinding involved.\n\nSo, yeah for three bucks it's a fun little diving game.  It's a genre that's been underserved for a long time but now there are a few games for it, the other main one being Subnautica.  That's much more of a tense survival game, but there's much more to it than Deep Hunter 2.

If you're looking for a lot of variety here, this is not for you.  You swim around, catch fish, photograph some stuff, search for sunken treasure... all of which gets you some money so you can swim faster, stay underwater longer, hit fish with your spear easier and get a better camera.\n\nHowever, if you need to de-stress, or want something your young daughter (or son) can sit on your lap and participate in that isn't uber-violent, this is great.  My daughter gets a kick out of searching out the fish and seeing the turtle and the sharks.  It is a great way to let her experience one of my hobbies without her feeling excluded.\n\nI wish there was slightly more to do and that there was a reason to search out all the coins and treasures but am still giving it a thumbs up because it was and is a positive experience for me.","September 25, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your missions are generally to swim around underwater, kill fish with spears (and gobble them up or something), and loot the place of gold coins and artifacts.  "That belongs in a museum!" - Indiana Jones, 1939.\n\nI probably killed around 50 fish on my first outing.\n\nSo, gameplay is limited, expectations should also be limited for this kind of game.
