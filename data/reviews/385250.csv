"http://steamcommunity.com/id/macatouille/recommended/385250/","macatouille","Macatouille","http://steamcommunity.com/id/macatouille/","1159 products in account","I have been a fan of the Picross puzzle games for almost a decade now, having completed all the Nintendo-produced titles on the DS and 3DS and even going back and playing Mario's Picross through the 3DS's Virtual Console. I love the simplicity of the format and how they can, at times, seem impossible to complete until you find that one tiny, little detail you missed and the rest of the picture comes into play.\n\nPaint it Back is missing a couple of the smaller details that makes those Nintendo games special but it includes a ton of puzzles, has much bigger puzzles than any of the Nintendo titles, and presents all of them with a great amount of polish, from snappy menus to configurable control schemes to solid performance. This is a really freaking good Picross game on the PC. If you like Picross games then that should really be enough to convince you. If you want more detail, I have lists.\n\nPros:\nThe game runs well on Windows 7, 8 and 10, with no noticeable load times or crashes (so far).\nIt works with multiple controllers right out of the gate, including the Xbox One pad, which is how I played most of the time.\nYou can switch between a mouse/keyboard combo and a controller at will, even mid-puzzle, and it only takes the game a second to figure out what you're using.\nIt's very challenging in spots, even more so than the hardest puzzles in Picross DS. Some of the sets are massive, going past 30x30 in size. This is where it's great to have a big screen. My PC is connected to my 40" TV and it was so nice to play wider puzzles that took up the length of my screen, all while lying on my couch.\nThe bigger puzzles can be broken down into bite-sized pieces, making them easier to digest. Instead of doing a 20x20 puzzle, for instance, you can do four 5x5 ones. You get a different amount of ribbons (the game's way to measure progress) based on whether you tackle the whole thing at once or in parts.\nThere's enough content to last over 20 hours, at the very least, and a good variety of difficulties from easy to moderately challenging to bang-your-head-against-the-wall hard puzzles, all of which you can save and come back to later if you get too burnt out.\nColumns and rows highlight to help you navigate, which doesn't really matter until you get to the latter puzzles, going past 25x25 or so, but when you do it's super helpful.\nIt's a small download and doesn't require a ton of resources so you can play on a laptop without much of a challenge. I found it just as fun to use the arrows and the z/x button combo as the controller.\nit's Picross on your PC. That, in and of itself, is an amazing thing. Even if the game wasn't built well I'd still be happy. Fortunately enough, it is really polished.\nCons:\nThere's no mode or option that you can toggle that'll mark when you make a mistake (at least that I could find). Meaning that if you screw up with a fill instead of an X or vice versa, you won't know it until later when things don't add up. Most of the time I didn't mind this, since you're filling in tons of squares and a simple slip of the thumb might happen, but the option, perhaps in a different mode, would have been welcome.\nFor better or worse, not all the achievements have detailed explanations.\nI would have liked more of the wide puzzles and less of the tall ones, since my TV is widescreen, as most monitors are, and it fits better.\nThe music gets incredibly repetitive after a couple hours.","October 14, 2015","true","36.7"," 61 of 66 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","61","66","2","3"

But with this game I can paint and erase with the flick of a mouse.  Much easier.\n\nFor those who have never encountered this type of puzzle before I'm gonna quote from wikipedia:\n\n"Nonograms, also known as Hanjie, Picross or Griddlers, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture."\n\nIt's kind of like a binary sudoku.  If you love logic puzzles, you will like this.  I quickly got addicted.\n\nHow does it work:\nYou've got a grid of squares and you are told how many spaces are supposed to be colored in on each row and column.  Use logic to choose what to color in.  When you are finished it forms a picture.  You only use black and white, but there is a colored painting that appears as you work on the puzzle.  You don't actually have to choose colors yourself, it does it automatically.\n\nDifficulty Settings:\nThere are 3 difficulty levels.  The beginning puzzles are only on the easiest difficulty, but as you progress in later galleries you can choose which difficulty level you want for each painting.  And even after you finish a puzzle you can redo it on another difficulty level.\n\nThe puzzles also come in different sizes.  From 10x10 to 30x30 and other odd sizes.  The easy difficulty splits the large puzzles into sections, so you might have to do 4 sections to complete 1 whole puzzle picture.  The hardest difficulty is just one giant grid.\n\nHow many puzzles:\nPuzzle paintings are organized into Galleries with themes, such as Portraits, Sports of Sorts, Animals, Home Sweet Home, etc.  If forget exactly how many puzzles are in each gallery, maybe about 8-10 or so.  You unlock more galleries as you complete puzzles are get the medals.  You get more medals for solving on higher difficulty.\n\nHelp Tools:\nIf you need help there are some in-game help tools that you can activate, though you might not get a medal for solving that puzzle.\n\nStory:\nYes, a puzzle game with a story!  There is a cute little story scene in the beginning.  And a small one once you complete all the puzzles once on any difficulty.\n\nGraphics:\nCute and colorful.\n\nSound:\nNice effects like paint splat sounds when you mark a puzzle.  The background music has several tracks that loop continously.\n\nInterface:\nI used a mouse.  No problems.\n\nReplay value:\nOnce you get pretty far into the puzzles you unlock Mystery mode.  Where you can try to solve a random puzzle (from one of the galleries) only it does not show you the progress in the little picture and doesn't tell you the title, either.  So you have to do it by logic only, no guessing!  You can choose any difficulty level in Mystery mode.\n\nAchievements!\nAll of the achievements are easily doable, just takes some time.  There aren't any super hard achievements (so far).\n\nA Painter is Never Satisfied with his finished product.\nThe developer listens to the fans and has made updates with new features based on ideas from fans.  It's always nice to see a dev willing to tweek his game if the fans want something.\n\nI can't remember how much it cost but it's well worth it.  And I actually bought my copy, unlike some people who got free review copies.\n\nThat's all I can think of to say.  Just about the perfect puzzle game.  A little story, nice puzzles, lots of options for difficulty.  Oh and there is humor as well.  Some of the painting titles are puns on famous paintings or pop culture references.  If you like logic puzzles, you can't go wrong with this game.\n","November 3, 2015","true","105.0"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","33","34","0","1"

There are also rewards for not using X marks, for not making mistakes, and for being fast.

It’s a really good and fun game that you can pick up whenever you feel like it.\nIt started out on iOS and is now here on Steam.\n\nStoryA ghost appeared and literally spooked the paintings away.\nSo it’s now your job to … Paint it back.\n\nSeriously that’s pretty much it and there’s no need for a fancy storyline.\n\nGameplayIf you’ve played Sudoku then the game’s pretty much self explanatory and in case you haven’t well the tutorial does one fine job explaining it.\nLet’s get into it. You start of by facing a blank 5x5 field and you have to paint the right squares while leaving others blank. Later on in the game you’ll have to repaint bigger like 16x20.\nThe game even tells you not to guess but to think. Sure you could guess your way through the early levels and the smaller painting but good luck with that for the bigger ones.\n\nYour only tool is a brush with black paint. You don’t have to worry about choosing the right color for the right square. All you have to do is to paint the right ones. The other tool you have is the right click. If you right click a square you’ll cross it out so you know that you have it blank.\nThe game, just like sudoku, gives you some hints so you know where to start and which squares to paint.\nOn the outside of the field of your painting you see certain numbers. Let’s say the upper left row starts, vertically, with a 4. That means that you have to paint 4 squares in this row and so on.\nSome fields have more than one number on the outside. The first number or in this case the outer number’s the same as before and tells you how many squares you have to paint. The second number however tells you that you have to leave some squares blank and then start painting again. Let me demonstrate on a 5x5 field.\nLet’s say the upper left, vertically, row starts with a 2 and the next number is a 2 as well.\nThat would mean that you have to paint two squares, leave one open, and then paint again two.\nSo you see you get the hang of it pretty quickly.\n\nThe game does require a fair amount of brain power though. The beauty of it is that, just as the developers name implies, it’s really a casual game that you can pick up whenever you want.\nYou can even save your progress in your current painting and come back later to it to finish it.\n\nVisualsThe game itself has a cartoonish look to it and is quite fitting. The paintings however look great.\nThe pixel art in the game’s pretty fun, good looking and for me easily the best part of the game.\nThe early painting might not look the best but they’ll look better and better in the higher levels and way more complex.\nOverall it’s a fairly nice and sweet looking game and the whole cartoonish art style was a good choice.\n\nAudioThe music just fits and manages to stay in the background while also maintaining presence.\nIt’s not too subtle but at the same time not too intrusive.\nI mean at the end of the day you’ll find yourself paying attention to the music and it will probably hinder you a bit but it’s not too bad.\nThe tracks used however are quite short which I personally actually like since the level that you’re stuck on won’t get too dull too fast.\n\nWhat else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for Paint it Back in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\n\nIt is what it is. It’s a nice game for every now and then when you feel like you need something for your brain. Overall it works pretty good and I haven’t had any problems whatsoever.\nIt’s hard though. Well hard as in some levels are truly complex and require a fair amount of time and you can’t just rush through all of the levels. At the end of the day you’ll probably get a fair amount of gametime out of it if you don’t get too frustrated later on.\n\nThe perfect game for every puzzle lover. Especially for people that just need their fix every now and then.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\n- Neku","October 14, 2015","true","6.0"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","22","33","4","5"

Since there are no cutscenes other than the initial one, I'm not gonna take this into account.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game adopts a very colorful art-style that well suits both the tone of the different rooms full of paintings and the puzzles that you complete. While the paintings get bigger and more complex the more you paint them, most of them are still very simple and lack detail.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is essentially a digital version of nonogram:  are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column.\nI had never played this type of puzzle, and it has easily become my favourite: the constant calculation of numbers and the huge satisfaction of seeing a finished work make this game one of the most relaxing and easier to get games of the year.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game's puzzles get increasingly difficult, but you can always choose the difficulty of each one (for example, for a 50x50 puzzle you can choose Normal to complete small 10x10 areas). They are never impossible to complete, and usually waiting a couple of minutes to clear your head up helps.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack to the game is quirky and relaxing, making this game one to be picked up when you want to chill for 5 or 10 minutes.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe game features a total of 150 paintings to complete and 20 Steam achievements to unlock, giving you more thane enough content for its cheap price.\n\nOverall, both fans and non-fans of puzzle games (especially nonogram/picross) will enjoy this game thanks to its simplicity, challenge, huge satisfaction and relaxing soundtrack.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 9\n\nENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 4\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","October 15, 2015","true","5.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/385250/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","IntroductionPicross. That’s the thing I keep hearing whenever I see games like this come by. These sorts of games are easily spotted, because of the large squares with numbers on the sides, and a picture of what you’re creating in the corner. I remember having played one or two of them back in the day but to be honest I can’t remember what they were like. Time to find out if there may have been a reason for this…\n\nGameplayThe story is quite simple and begins with a ghost wandering around in a museum. It finally manages to scare away all of the paintings and now it’s up to you to paint them back. It’s goofy and it sets the tone immediately. It doesn’t take itself seriously and that’s exactly what it should be like. It’s a casual game at heart, as in anyone can pick it up and play. The difficulty is also targeted at a casual audience and since there’s no time limit you can take your time until you have finally figured out how to paint it properly. However, you can also choose to play a more difficult/advanced version of puzzles and these puzzles then consist of multiple blocks merged together to make it look like one big (wide) puzzle.\n\nGameplay wise it’s relatively simple. Easy to learn, even easy to master, but it does take some brain activity to figure out how to paint the blocks exactly. The game puts a board in front of you and that board can also be seen in the upper left corner, but on a smaller scale. If you paint a block on the big board – by just clicking on it – then you will also see that block get painted on the smaller board in the corner. By clicking a block again you can remove the paint and by right-clicking you can choose to disable a block to prevent you from accidentally painting over it. While I felt this was fairly useless at the beginning it became more important later on when the boards get bigger and more complex.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=536135165\nAnyway, there are numbers written on the top and left sides of the board and these tell you how to paint the blocks. By looking at the numbers you can figure out how to paint the blocks properly.\nSo if you have a 10x10 block and on the ninth line (horizontally) is written ‘10’ then you have paint all ten blocks horizontally. It’s not a very good example, but it’s a little hard to explain without actually drawing an example. But just take a look at the screenshots and you’ll see probably understand what I mean.\n\nOnce the painting is complete the smaller board will be enlarged to show you the end result. It’s always a pixel art painting (I always appreciate good pixel art) so don’t go and expect a DaVinci painting or anything, although they do get more complex a few hours into the game.\nAlso, starting from area 3 puzzles become larger and may even consist of several parts. This means that a painting can be divided into, for example, 2, 4 or 6 parts. This doesn’t influence the actual coloring of the blocks but instead of creating just one big painting you’re then painting several parts that ultimately combine into one big painting. You do get to see the entire painting in the corner, by the way, so you always have a clear idea of what the final result will or should look like.\n\nThere are multiple areas to play through, 15 in fact, each with their own theme, but I somehow missed how these paintings exactly relate to these worlds. They seem completely random, but I guess with a little thinking you can see the or some sort of relation between them. It seems farfetched, though, but I assume that’s just part of the goofy style and humor.\n\nOverall the game feels very polished. The only thing I think needs improvement is the audio, of which there is just too little variety. With some added tracks (or at least more rotation) it’s actually pretty much perfect in my opinion.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=536135007\nAudio & VisualsSo, thus far there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of diversity as far the music is concerned. The first hour or so I heard the same song over and over with every painting I created. Then out of nowhere I finally heard another song. There seem to be more songs but they currently repeat a bit too often, which is an absolute shame, even though the focus is not the music per se. But more variety (as in: more tracks, or more rotation) would definitely help add to the immersion of being (or at least feeling like) a painter.\n\nVisually it’s a beautiful game with a great looking cartoony style. The cinematics (although I wouldn’t really call them that) look fabulous in motion and the boards animate nicely whenever you complete a painting. Other than that there’s not much animation. The pixel art shown in the frames looks great, but sometimes it still looks a bit too simple. I personally thought it would’ve been cool if the pixel art would animate upon completing a puzzle. It would give it just a little more personality, but to be totally honest you can’t say that this game lacks any. It bursts with personality actually.\nAnyway, the text is sharp, the use of colors is diverse and the graphics scale nicely: the game makes the screen (not the game itself) less wide or wider based on what is shown. It looks cool, but is a little inconsistent.\n(Please note that I’m playing on a 21:9 monitor and this may therefore not occur on your monitor.)\n\nLength/Replay ValueThere are 150 paintings to complete in total. Most of them can be completed in just a couple of minutes so if you do the math then it should take you anywhere between 10-15 hours to complete. And this is just for the normal paintings. If you choose to complete more advanced paintings then you can easily add another dozen hours to that number. Plus, there’s an Endless Mode for even MORE replay value. Oh yes, you get plenty of bang for your buck. Guaranteed!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=536135313\nConclusionOkay, so I might not remember the Picross games (maybe due to a lack of interest, or maybe I didn’t have the right age, who knows?) but I will try to remember Paint It Back this time. It has become a game that anyone can play and have fun with: a relaxing game meant to be played for just a few minutes or a couple of hours. I definitely had fun with it.\nThere aren’t many games like this available on PC (or more specifically: Steam) and so it might not become insanely popular (yet). But let’s make sure it at least gets the attention it deserves. Buy it and recommend it if you agree!\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Artistic graphics complement the style of the game\n+ Fun, at times challenging, puzzles\n+ Anyone can play it; it’s very easy to pick up and learn\n+ Extremely relaxing atmosphere\n\nMixed:\n+/- Could benefit from some extra visual effects maybe\n\nCons:\n- Music tracks repeat too often, or there aren’t enough tracks\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer/publisher.\nRating:  8.4 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nPlease feel free to join my group, DJ’s reviews, or follow me directly as a curator.\nDon’t feel like it?

The puzzles are nonogram puzzles and although they start out small, they get to the point where they are quite a challenge. However, if you like easier puzzles, there is the option to complete the larger puzzles in small pieces, allowing all puzzles to be completed at the difficultly level you feel like attempting at the time. The controls feel smooth whether using the mouse, the keyboard, or a controller, and switching between these options at any time is automatic and seemless. The paintings can be quite entertaining, and several have left me in suspense as to what the subject is right up until the end. There are a vast number of paintings, and the mystery masterpiece mode allows for the feeling of fresh new puzzles even once you've completed them all. There is a massive amount of place time availible here, making the game well worth the price. On top of all this, the dev is extrodinarily nice and responsive.

Interface is nice, and it doesn't make you spend hours doing really easy ones.\n\nMy only gripes would be that the difficulty sometimes seems a bit random and there are some puzzles that as far as I can tell can't logically be deduced. There've been quite a few where I just had to give up after doing half the puzzle because the other half was very ambiguous.\n\nThe other issue is kind of opposite to that: some squares are lighter and darker based on the picture being drawn. This, and being able to see the picture being drawn in the top left, lead to situations where it's extremely easy to guess where the squares are meant to go, which kind of ruins the challenge of Picross. I would much prefer if all the squares were straight black and I couldn't see the painting in the top.\n\nIn any case, it's well worth the money. Just a few things that kind of ruin the spirit of the game.","October 18, 2015","true","11.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are a variety of paintings and difficulties, and even the biggest paintings (30x40 or 40x30 respectively) can be played on the lowest difficulty if wished. Also, the motives of the paintings are hilarious at times.\nAdditionally, when playing for a bit you will soon unlock the "Mystery Masterpieces", which is basically a random mode that's fun even when you already finished all pictures of the gallery.\n\nFor people like me who prefer playing on the highest difficulty (which means you have to puzzle through the whole picture at once, for otherwise the pictures are broken into multiple smaller parts) it certainly is challenging enough - although there were two or three pictures that could not be solved with pure logic and needed the Mark-up mode (which means guessing, something I personally really don't like to do when puzzling).\nStill, besides that one I think the difficulty and logic for this game fit perfectly.\n\nThe only thing I really disliked was the fact that the numbers on the side / at the top already turned grey the second the correct number of black spots was there on the field (as long as it had a direkt connection with blacks and Xs to one of the sides). I usually play Nintendo's Picross games and there they only grey out the numbers when the black spots have an X (or the end of the picture) on both sides.\nSo I would really have preferred an option to either manage it like that or to maybe grey the numbers out manually. That would mean more work for me but as I prefer having 'perfect' scores (as in, no wrongly set black spots ever if possible) this turned out to be really annoying during the mystery masterpiece runs.\n\nBut that's a really minor complain for I still had a lot of fun with this game and I will certainly play it again, for the random mode is fun even if you already have all the achievements.\nDefinitely a very good Picross game - and the best version of it I have encountered on the PC as of yet!","November 14, 2015","true","45.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A nonogram is a puzzle where you are given a grid and each row and column has one or more numbers by it which tells you how many consecutive cells need to be filled in in that row or column. You will need to use logical thinking and information from other rows and columns to figure out which cells are the ones that should be filled in and complete the painting.\n\nIt's hard to explain why Paint It Back is so addicting but it is. It is definitely one of those "one more turn" type of games. You will sit down to play it for an hour to wind down and it will be past midnight before you know it. I think the main reason why it is so fun and addicting is that it is a very simple game to play but it also requires a lot of logical thinking to complete the paintings.\n\nPaint It Back offers a lot of bang for your buck. At the time of this review, I had put in over 21 hours and I still have a lot of puzzles left to complete. I estimate that it will take me at least 25 total hours to complete all of the puzzles and that's with me focusing on mainly the normal and pro paintings (the master difficulty puzzles are very time consuming).\n\nIf you like puzzle games at all and especially if you like nonograms or similar puzzles like Sudoku you should definitely check out Paint It Back.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead my full review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","October 16, 2015","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Puzzles are often quite challenging on Pro or Master mode, and unlike Picross it does not punish you for making a stray mistaken mark, although neither does it inform you of your errors, so guessers beware! Only good, logical thought can solve these puzzles.\n\nCons?

It's pretty much what it looks like - a logic puzzle game where you 'create' pixel art based on number clues given to you.\n\nPros\n+ Quirky bright graphics\n+ Easy to use interface\n+ Decent number of puzzles\n+ Sufficient level of challenge and the player chooses which challenge level they'd like for each puzzle\n+ Few additional things to aim for over and above just finishing the puzzles, if you want to earn all the achievements\n\nCons\n- I might be wrong, but I don't think all of the 'master' level puzzles are solvable through logic alone. If true, that's not great - I don't want to be forced to play out a guess in these kinds of puzzles.\n*Edit - Although I still don't agree with having puzzles in the game that are unsolvable by traditional methods, I do want to add that the developer is extremely responsive and as a result of mine and others' feedback has added a message in the game that lets you know if a puzzle requires the mark-up mode before you start it. I'm impressed by their response to constructive criticism as too often (in my opinion) devs either don't respond or respond badly it seems. Kudos to the devs on this one.\n\nWould have been nice to have\nNot exactly 'cons', but... While you're solving each puzzle there's a 'painting' in the top left which paints the pixels in colours as you progress. In some cases, this made it obvious where the next squares should go - I hid the painting by using windowed mode and pushing it off the screen, but it would be nice to switch this off. (I didn't spot this option in the settings). Also, and this is really a personal preference, but my favourite logic puzzles are ones with text puzzles to help you solve the grid, so it would have been great to see a few of these thrown in to mix it up a little.\n\nAll in all, does what it says on the tin, and if you like grid-based logic puzzles, you'll like this game.","October 19, 2015","true","119.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/385250/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: Paint it Back is a pleasant and fairly challenging collection of nonograms with some nice and curious pixel art.\n\nWhen I bought it I didn't expect Paint it Back to last over 40 hours but it did anyway. After all at its core it is just a (fairly large) collection of nonograms[en.wikipedia.org], also known as grittlers or hanjies.\n\nIn case you don't know them, in nonograms you are given a grid of boxes and a set of numbers at the edge. The numbers determine how many adjacent boxes are "filled" in each row or column. In these puzzles the solution usually is designed to form a recognizable picture. All puzzles in the game have exactly one solution.\n\nSmooth and casual gameplay\nThere is a flimsy (but working) back story to motivate using nonograms: a ghost has scared away all the paintings in a gallery. You are tasked to "paint" it all back.\n\nThe gallery has over dozen sections with separate themes each with circa ten puzzles of increasing difficulty per section. The puzzles are tiered in 3 difficulty settings pertaining to the size of the grid, from 5x5 (normal) to 40x30 (master).\n\nMouse controls work splendidly: left-click "paints", right-click marks a box empty and both marks can be reversed by clicking again. There's also a test mark-up mode that one can use to try out and find conflicts when regular logic fails (essentially required in only a couple of the master-level paintings). A neat detail is that the color picture slowly forms in the corner while you are "painting".\n\nThe art is generally good and quirky and every painting is a small surprise, so it's fun to solve the problems.\n\nPerfect for what it is\nWhen playing I like to alt+tab every now and then for small pauses. I was happy to note this didn't have any adverse effects on the game. Being a mobile port, there is the slightly redundant (considering Steam Family share) option to create up to 6 profiles for e.g. all family members. Despite this you can unfortunately have only one incomplete painting saved at the time (per profile I presume) although you can work on others, just without saving the progress if you wanted to quit.\n\nFor 100% achievement completion it took me almost 42 hours. I think that's a great amount of content for a game such as this. There's some repetition required for achievement hunters, since about half of the medals (conveniently displayed also in-game) are about the random challenges that require you to complete a random existing painting in a specific way (including quickly, without empty-crosses and/or without "wasting paint"). Still, this adds only couple of hours to the whole gametime. The more difficult puzzles can be completed on lower difficulty levels as well (by solving them part-wise as several smaller nonograms) that might add even more content for completionists though it is not required for the achievements.\n\nHowever, it is just a collection of nonograms with no twists except perhaps for the quirky art. I got it for half the price and I was happy with the content but I might have been disappointed had I paid the full price. Unless you really love nonograms you should also wait for a sale.","January 28","true","41.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The tutorial is LITERALLY amazing. It is hands down the best tutorial in a game ever. of all time. best tutorial ever. Now I came into this game already knowing how to play this type of puzzle game, so I rushed through the tutorial, but for a new player to this type of a puzzle game if they went through the tutorial all the information they need would be in that tutorial. Not only is it jam packed with several techniques and building blocks for other ones, it is very clear and precise. It also has a system to make sure you understand (which I'm very keen of).\n\nAfter playing the tutorial I zoomed by the first gallery and I was sad that this game wouldn't be challenging because the puzzles were so easy (I'm an experienced player so the normal puzzles didnt teach me anything), but once I hit a Pro picture I was like dammmmmmm gurl nice. and then when I hit a Master picture I was like YES BOYS. And while the difficulty spike in my opinion shoots almost straight up, its very very fun. I have only played a few galleries, but I'm presuming the difficulty won't be going down, so I'm sure all of the galleries are really good! For the asking price and the content of this game, and the tutorial. I'd say this is a must buy steam game for puzzle genre lovers. I've even recommended it to friends because I feel like the tutorial is so good even noobs could start playing this game and end up a 'Master' level player.\n\nThe story line is brief, and the characters at the beginning of each gallery are commical for those who know art. I haven't gone past like the fourth or fifth gallery but I was a bit sad to see that you dont actually do the color part of the painting like instead of a row being 5 in a 5x5 board it could be 1121 and each number representing a different color. That would take away from the difficulty but I think it'd be really cool and I hope that I find it later on in the game. If it doesn't show up that's fine the game will still be amazing.  The UI (menu and the board itself) still needs some work to be 5/5, and I'm not the best judge for music, it's fairly good background music for this game(although one of the tracks, not sure which one, has a misleading sound in it aka a sound from another program that notifies sometime, although it's not that prominent).\n\nOverall I'd give this game like a 4.8/5. I wanna give it the five but 5/5 is perfect and realistically the UI is not perfect so it'd be injust if I did so. Highly recommend this game!\n\nThanks to the developer(s) and everyone else involved for creating this! Definitely one of the best puzzle games I've played on steam.

It's exactly what you get. A very good Picross version with an insane amount of content and an nice artstyle. The controls are perfect (which isn't that hard, I supoose, but a lot of developers seem to ♥♥♥♥ it up anyway).","February 18","true","40.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you liked Picross on the DS/3DS systems you'll probably enjoy this a bit, but it feels significantly less polished. I'd recommend it as it has all the core gameplay of Picross (kind of scratches that itch) but overall the puzzle progression feels slow (way too easy for way too long) and controls feel clunky (probably the difference of mouse vs stylus).\n\nI'd give it a 6/10 , don't really recommend this as an intro to Picross games, try the original Picrosses first (there's a lot of them).","January 12","true","1.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it has a certain charm that is difficult to ignore.  The music puts me in mind of Mario Paint (remember that?), and though it starts of insultingly easy, it gets harder the further you progress.\nThe higher difficulty sees you completing whole paintings in one go, whilst the lower difficulty options allow you to tackle sections of the picture.  The addition of a 'helping hand' that corrects any mistakes you make always keeps it accessible if, like me, you aren't particularly good at puzzle games.\nA nice, simple, fun game to play when you get tired of blowing up bad guys ^_^","January 25","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Look no further, this game is just that.\nYou get numbers on both X & Y axis and need to fill in the corresponding blocks on the grid. Sounds easy enough? It gets harder depending on the grid size. Doesn't really sound that exciting, just like many other puzzle games until you start playing it and then... get hooked. Expect yourself to say - just one more - a lot of times. Puzzles can be saved and continued at a later time, certainly handy for the bigger ones as they can take some time to solve.\nOfcourse it helps if the implementation is well done, and there is no complaining about that here. The playful semi-cubic graphic style fits the game perfectly, as does the simple but effective soundtrack and sound effects. The game itself is funny and contains a lot of humor, pop culture references and sillyness.\nUpdates are still being made, just recently the capability was added to create your own puzzles and share them with other players. As such the replayability could be endless.\nWorks well on Linux/SteamOS and has smooth Steam Controller support, enabling both relaxed play through the Steam Link on the couch or directly on your PC. The game doesn't require a lot of resources, so I imagine it runs smooth on about any configuration you might have.","May 3","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
