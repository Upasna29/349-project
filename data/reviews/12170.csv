While almost every action gives points, the intended way to progress is to raise the score multiplier, usually by completing missions. These missions are barely anything more than a random set of objectives, tied together with some immature and politically incorrect, yet not too controversial flavour text with some (black) humour and social satire.\n\nThe game is easy in many regards– enemies aim terribly, the police are quite ineffective, and all tasks can be described in a few words– but many small annoyances can ruin gameplay. For example, there are no mission retries, and when even the player dies in one hit, it is easy to fail a task on the first try.\nThe best way to approach GTA1 is to think it as a memorisation game: learn the city layouts, weapon locations, and the mission objectives, and it’ll go smoothly. Just don’t forget that there is no save, so each stage has to be completed in one sitting.\n\nThe game engine is ancient and difficult to run on any modern system. On top of that, it can cause nausea with the jerky camera movement and wonky frame rates. And when it works, the player can enjoy the interesting physics that turn every vehicle into a bouncy bumper car.\nStill, if you can live with these limitations, GTA1 can still hold itself on its own as a good arcade game that can warrant a replay from time to time.","February 17","true","16.2"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","34","39","3","2"

Released in 1998, this classic title started jump started the future for gaming. I don’t recommend this game just because it’s classic, I recommend it because it genuinely has good gameplay. The world is rather large for a game of the late 90s, and gameplay is actually better than a lot of Indies of today. Multiple mission routes mean endless replay value. If you’re not the type to follow story, just go around stealing cars and killing ♥♥♥♥♥es, hoes, and pedestrians for mad points. It’s a real shame the developers gimped on the graphics of Grand Theft Auto. Even for a late 90’s game, the graphics for Grand Theft Auto is god awful. When my avatar leaves his car, I can’t tell the difference between his front and backside; this makes shooting quite chaotic and confusing at times. If you look pass the graphics, there is lots of fun to be had from this classic title.

This game truly is a sandbox, which can be fun to play around in, but the lack of direction prevents it from holding your attention for too long.\n\nThe graphics are decent for the time. The sound can get obnoxious quickly, and there's no music. The controls aren't very good, and I found it imposible to play with a controller.\n\nAt the very least, the price is right.

This is free to play off the Rockstar Classics site - so no doubt get it for free if possible, but this really started open world gaming. You need a set million X points to progress - get it with missions (easiest way) or by doing whatever you want - police are agressive, top down view is fast and frentic, and it is damn hard in later levels!

No saves, so you die too many times, you lose and have to start over form scratch. Missions are pretty simple, no money system, but points system that acts like money. sports/morobikes are too fast to even drive, so you will most likely crash to everything. no minimap so you will get lost most often. This game is pretty okay for a old game, but I just can't play a game with no minimap or some type of map. 6/10","April 29, 2013","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

GTA was one of the first games I played on PC and while it lacks the 3D graphics of today's era it is still tons of fun. The modern iterations of the GTA franchise focus too heavily on story and never on an arcade pick-up-and-play style game. GTA was just that.
