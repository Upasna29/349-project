It's not a *bad* game, but it certainly takes some getting used to.  The control scheme, at least with an XB360 controller, take some fiddling to get just right.  It's very atmospheric (OK, not Alien: Isolation atmospheric, but for a budget indie game it does a pretty good job).\n\nThe story is interesting enough, at least enough to keep me searching for messages that other survivors have left behind.  No spoilers, but the intro video (which is one of the trailers IIRC) spells out an encounter with an unknown object which kills most of the crew, and then a parasitic/carnivorous infestation that basically wipes almost everyone onboard out.\n\nThe protagonist, a nameless Ensign, is a forgettable character that gets the job done.  The voice acting is serviceable, with cringe-worthy moments.  My wife says she walks like a dude...\n\nCombat is simple to the point of being almost meaningless, at least in the ~1 hour I've invested so far.  Maybe it'll improve as I progress.  I *hope* it improves.\n\nI did encounter a few glitches while playing.  One that sticks in my mind is that elevator buttons didn't work unless I jumped and hit the Interact key on the way down from the jump...  And the first time I did that, I clipped through the elevator floor and fell down the shaft.  Good thing there are plenty of save points.\n\nOn sale?  Sure, pick it up if you like 2.5D side-scrollers.  Otherwise you're better off spending your hard-earned cash elsewhere.","July 23, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The concept of the game is highly interesting. It really does have potential. However, the ending is not only obviously slapped on, it's put in place in such a way that the game makes you feel like "Hey, I did it, I got out of this section of the potentially huge ship, and will soon move to another!"\n\nNope, you're done, that was it, you get to watch a cutscene that makes almost no sense at all, pertaining absolutely in no discernable way to the game you just played. This is largely because the greater portion of the story is completely missing. The gameplay felt pretty solid to me, but it just wasn't enough.","August 29, 2015","false","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The side-scrolling action is bookended by [nicely done] story boards that bring you into the story and provide a nice summation of the intended story, and you have the ships AI as your narrator companion throughout the ship. He's kind of like if Harbinger were nice.\nThe side scrolling is more flashback than contra, with limited ammo and rate of fire and health. The mechanics of how the aliens react to light is cool. You 'craft' ammo and medpacks at 'crafting stations' throughout the levels from resources gathered from alien carcasses.  I found it easy to farm resources early in the game and then resources weren't a problem for me. The actual combat was a little sparse.\nThe game plays smoothly with no bugs.\nThe only thing really missing from this game is more levels. It just feels like a demo. If they ever complete it I would recommend it.","August 22, 2015","false","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really do. It pains me not to. This game was fun to play, and had a very interesting story to tell. But ultimately, the game is just... incomplete.\n\nI'd find locked doors with enemies on the other side that I thought would have to be backtracked later. I had mission objectives that I couldn't complete yet, and thought I'd loop around to it. I'd see undiscovered areas on the minimap that I thought would reopen later. But ultimately, none of it amounted to anything. It was just incomplete.\n\nAs a game, it was fun. I'm sure the developer is just as miserable about this as we are. Dark Matter could have been amazing, but he just didn't manage to get enough kickstarter funds to make it happen. I feel for him, and I do actually hope you readers buy this game, if only to support a potential sequel. But at face value, upon completing this game, can I recommend it?

Most of this has to do with it being incomplete; what you do have is a bit light, if shallow, in substance and ends rather abruptly before it gets anywhere particularly interesting and memorable.\n\nWith another year or two in development, this would have really come around to be a good, memorable title. It set the stage for an engrossing sci-fi horror story. I was most impressed with the narrative. I was drawn in. Almost enamoured. But overall I felt rather let down, even after the ending sequence was later added to the game as a free update.\nPerhaps they can give it another shot in the future, or this would translate better as a book.\n\nAlien design, sound, and visuals - was all fairly average. But I won't really get into it - upon some reflection, I don't really know if this is even worth reviewing, considering it's not clearly not a finished, or ready, product. And with that said, it's probably not worth buying or spending time on. It's a real shame I am saying this.\n\nIf you haven't already, stop and take a moment to enjoy what I consider to be the best part about this game - the opening cinematic trailer, right here on Steam. Then move on and look for something else.","January 22, 2014","false","7.2"," 104 of 115 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","104","115","0","0"

It is part one of a series of games that was abandonned before this one was even sold, meaning the full game being advertised was already canned before it went on sale.\n\nIt's still an interesting play and can have a little fun playing it, but it's short, and like I keep re-iterating, it's not finished.. From the very beginning it starts foreshadowing an ending you will never reach, a move up through the ship toward the command section that never gets completely out of engineering, so it's part 1 of a 4 or 5 part story that barely gets started.\n\nThey came around, due to the outrage on the forums and eventually put in a super-brief, cinematic excuse for an ending, but it's still not what was advertised and does nothing to bring a conclusion to the story that the game starts.\n\nI want to like it, but all I can feel about this game is ripped off.\n\nAt less than $5, I'd say go ahead and give it a try if you can like this sort of game, but more than that is horribly over priced for this short teaser of a game that never will be.","January 22, 2015","false","8.7"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","46","50","0","0"

I liked most of the game, and I don't mind the movement or the move-and-shoot-stuff others mentioned. I mean, you're not a marine, you're some random crew member just woken from cryosleep crawling through a ship infested with aliens, who, after such a long time, don't expect any attack. So to me there's no reason why you shouldn't succeed where the marines failed, even though you're not a trained fighter.\nAnd I don't mind reading a little. It adds to the feeling of a) the game being retro and b) nobody being there on the ship.\nSome minor bugs annoyed me like the go-here-markers on the minimap didn't always work which ended in me crawling through the level to find where I'm supposed to be. But that's just a minor thing. On the other hand, I like the way the game works with light and the overall feeling this creates.\nDespite of the following issues, I recommend the game. It's nice to play and I totally liked the atmosphere.\nWhat really bugs me is that you get the feeling that this game should have been longer.\n\n* Medium Spoiler Alert *\n\nNot in comparison to the price, but there is nothing indicating the ending. You literally open a door and there it is. And you have just gotten the last piece of equipment and have used it once to clear an obstacle. I can't shake the feeling that there was like 15 more minutes of gameplay planned but then the budget ran out and they put the ending behind some more or less random door.\n\n* Major Spoiler Alert *\n\nOh, and the ending explains too much. Seriously, I could have lived with not knowing what the Angels were. What I gathered so far was enough: Weirdly powerful aliens, the real threat. Or have the info seeded into the game proper.\nI always try to fix things so here is my try on this: Just imagine your mentoring voice telling you 2-3 times to meet him in the Toxic Materials section and how he longs to meet you in person. And that he's got a way to escape from the ship. This way there would be a build-up to this point. You could even have a little twist like him not indicating he's a sort of AI, but saying "I dug in here and have a means to escape, but I can't do it alone." Of course people would wonder, like why someone is still alive. But that's not a bad thing. Having a feeling that things just don't add up. And then the ending would come as a relief.

I'm partial to dark and spooky, this game is just that but not overboard.\n\nSecond, when I review, I don't like to talk about cons, because there are enough people who complain about what's wrong with something. I'd write a NEGATIVE review for that.\n\nSo when I was a kid (you can now tell my relative age with a little thought) I played three games Dark Matter reminded me of.\n\nMarathon - Bungie - Apple System 6.x-7.x:\n-The last hope after a horrible catastophe inflicted by a hostile alien race, you are guided by a self-aware AI.\n-Suspended animation has taken it's toll on the memory, and some other higher level functions, What else to do but follow the (potentially quite disturbed) Aritificial Intelligence?\n\nI thought it was a great trip back to my childhood.\n\nMetroid:\n\n-Samus Aran was one of the first non-BS female protagonists; tough as nails with an amazing drive for survival, enough to rival any manlydudebro to hit the cookie cutter hero lineup.\n\nThe Ensign is just that character - although nameless at this point.\n\n-The maps, the hallways, the enemies, the weapon system. VERY Metroid feeling.\n\nAlien 3 - Activision - Sega Genesis:\n\n-Just the overtone; if you've played this game you'll know what I was thinking.\n\nMy overall thoughts on the game:\n\n-Slow but not crawling, just enough action to keep you on your toes.\n-Enemies are not fear incarnate, meaning that the more squeamish gamer can still enjoy it.\n-Storyline is immersive but not overloading, narration is commendable.\n-The save system is much better thought out: you can manual save OR use the checkpoint system, so you have more than one option to extricate yourself from untenable situations\n-The crafting system, while not amazing is a nifty little addition to the game.\n-I recommend it - it's nice little time-passer reminscent of a 29 year old circa 2014 and I will update when I complete the game.\n\nI know TL;DR - Thanks for reading if you made it this far!","December 28, 2014","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The concept of the game is highly interesting. It really does have potential. However, the ending is not only obviously slapped on, it's put in place in such a way that the game makes you feel like "Hey, I did it, I got out of this section of the potentially huge ship, and will soon move to another!"\n\nNope, you're done, that was it, you get to watch a cutscene that makes almost no sense at all, pertaining absolutely in no discernable way to the game you just played.

The side-scrolling action is bookended by [nicely done] story boards that bring you into the story and provide a nice summation of the intended story, and you have the ships AI as your narrator companion throughout the ship. He's kind of like if Harbinger were nice.\nThe side scrolling is more flashback than contra, with limited ammo and rate of fire and health. The mechanics of how the aliens react to light is cool. You 'craft' ammo and medpacks at 'crafting stations' throughout the levels from resources gathered from alien carcasses.  I found it easy to farm resources early in the game and then resources weren't a problem for me. The actual combat was a little sparse.\nThe game plays smoothly with no bugs.\nThe only thing really missing from this game is more levels. It just feels like a demo.

It's the kind of desperate buck-passing that I might have found funny had I not paid to play it.\n\nI have to say I'm disappointed that Steam brough it back after it was pulled.

I'll start with those. The visuals are gorgeous. It's dark and creepy with detailed interesting backgrounds. Sometimes you see things skittering around in the background or even in the foreground. Lights flicker, fleshy growths pulsate, and monsters look good. The overall theme of the game is well done. You feel as though you are alone on a dead ship with an infestation of ravenous alien lifeforms. I have no complaints about the sound or soundeffects and was very pleased with the voice of your AI guide. It sounds gritty and electronic with just a slight hint of emotion to it which I thought fit the mood very very well.\n\nGameplay has some nice features. Your light has some impact on the creatures in the game. Some traps close when light is shined upon them while others explode or release poison gas when lit up. Hive tunnels spawn creatures when light shines on them. Additionally because of this dependency on light you can shoot out hallway lights, flares, etc... to make the area dark. I was dissapointed, however, that there was no mechanic for placing flares or something to create a light source even if it would only be temporary. You can collect resources from enemies and use it to create new ammos and weapon upgrades as well as med kits which are absolutely vital to playing this game. You can also collect scrap and convert it into usable resources. However, you lose some of the scrap when converting with a smaller loss the more scrap you have. I enjoyed this feature as it encouraged you to save up scrap but in a bind you could use it early.\n\nYour starting weapon has clips of ten shots which when they run out you can reload endlessly. It has unlimited ammo. It is not explained but probably the gun uses laser shots or some such thing. It is the weakest gun but acts as a backup weapon or a cheap alternative in the event you are low on ammo for the other guns. I appreciate and fully support this feature of gameplay.\n\nSadly this game falls short in most other areas. Movement is a little awkward and clunky. The Ensign's (Your Character) movement animations end up detracting from the visual beauty of the game. her jump animation is especially bad especially when you slide along the ceiling with your head while jumping when sprinting. Additionally a glitch is possible when sprinting. If you jump while sprinting your sprint gauge fills while in the air at a faster rate than it is depleted by your running allowing you to travel through the ship very fast if you have already cleared the area.\n\nThe objectives are sometimes unclear or simply don't make any sense. For example, you need to activate some sort of purge and then after have to manually deactivate it. I do not know what the purge was for, nor why it would not deactivate, or even what my deactivating it did. It seemed to have no impact on the gameplay. The further into the game the worse this got. It seemed very much to be unfinished. Explanations were missing or sections just completely skipped over.\n\nTransitions between areas were problematic. At first everything worked fine but later in the game there were a couple of awkward transitions that seemed to drop you from the ceiling. I happily ignored those. Then I found some transitions that you could only use in one direction with no clear explanation for why and I suspect is a bug. Finally I eventually realized that going through transistions to new areas reset your character to the last time you saved meaning that if you crafted a type of ammo, didn't save, and passed to a new area, all of that ammo or whatever you made disappeared. Your equipped gun would sometimes also not match what you were using before the transition. This continued to get worse as the game progressed.\n\nIn some areas of the game specific weapons or ammo are required. For example, a vine like growth blocks a hallway and has to be shot with flame ammo to be burned away. I like this type of thing very much. It acts as an interesting barrier to prevent me from progressing beyond a certain point until I finished the intended content first. The problem, however, is that any time you leave that area the vine grows back and can't be passed without once again shooting it. So if you clear the area beyond it and run out of flame ammo in the process you are stuck unless you can craft more. Of course if you are out of resources and creatures to kill at the same time than you can't craft flame ammo and are permamently stuck unable to progress.\n\nMonsters have little variety which I don't mind too much because it is a side scroller and there are plenty of other things to be occupied with. However, there are also very few of some of those limited monster varieties. For example, you fight a fantastic monster called a Samurai at one point. It is accompanied by a stomping sound which fits in nicely with it's size. It acts as a sort of boss fight I suppose. You never see this enemy ever again. The same is true for what can only be called the final boss which is honestly not that difficult of a fight. Some monsters lend themselves well to the idea of a zerg-like swarm but generally you only see 2 or 3 of these enemies together. Some monsters you fight can't be effectively fought without pretty much just taking damage and spamming medkits. It really destroys any semblance of tactical battle for me which is a shame because some of these enemies would work very well for that kind of purpose. The entire game gives you the sense that you will likely be fighting a particularly named creature at some point but you never even see one.\n\nThe game ends abruptly with an artistic scene of panels in a storyboard fashion, but oddly the art did not quite seem the same as the rest of the game. The ending also added more questions than answers, was not led up to well, and generally left me feeling very unsatisfied.\n\nOverall this game was one I want to like and found interesting but simply does not pull it together. It feels like a beta but claims to be finished. Sadly releasing a game in such a fashion usually means I will be avoiding all games from that designer in the future. Such is the case with Dark Matter.","August 19, 2014","false","8.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/251410/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: Dark Matter is a potential gem of a sci-fi themed story driven platformer. I mean it oozes style and class, something that most indies dont bother with.  Unfortunately it died prematurely as a result of stillbirth, for the game was released unfinished due to a lack of funding.  After receiving alot of bad press in the steam forums the developer revisited the game and gave it a hurried cutscene ending to provide minimal closure.\n\nIf I had to describe the game it has a System Shock vibe, with story similarities and exploration style even if this game is side-scrolling. If you've played The Fall then this will feel familiar.  Its pretty short and uncomplicated but you will have to pay attention when you are navigating its levels. Some areas will need to be revisited when you have better equipment.  The fifteen or so levels provide enough of a challenge with their varying their size and complexity which are populated with respawning enemies to keep combat satisfying.  Basic crafting allows medical packs and advanced ammo types to be created.\n\nOverall its a real shame the game is in this state because the core elements which were experienced, hinted at an excellently paced action game with a interesting story and enticing exploration, with  a fair amount of equipment to interact with.  What I particularly enjoyed was listening to the cold if sympathetic voice-over of the ships computer, guiding you on your journey to discover what happened during your time in stasis.\n\nDark Matter may fall short of what was promised though not through a lack of effort from the developer. I would dearly love to recommend the game but only consider purchasing if you are okay with it being essentially an extended demo, albeit a decent one and when on sale.  Otherwise I would have recommended it wholeheartedly.  Maybe one day someone will create something similar or complete the job.  I hope so! :)\n\n\n... More info below ...\n\n\n01. GENRE: A side scrolling sci-fi themed quest-driven platform shooter.\n\n02. SETTING: On board an alien infested spaceship in the outer reaches of space.\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: You are the sole surviving member of a spaceship infested with by a deadly alien race that has killed your crew and taken control of the ship.  Awoken from statis by the ships A.I. [reminiscent of the classic System Shock games] you must set out to explore the shop, collect the equipment and weapons, interact with vital ships systems in the eventual hope of destroying the enemy.\n\n04. GAME MODES: Would have been great to have experienced the full story-based campaign.  It really just needed more levels.\n+ What there is, is actually fun to play.  If only for a short while.\n- Single short campaign consisting of x number of joined levels.\n- Unfortunately incomplete due to the developer rushing the game out earlier than planned.  Likely to ruinning out of money.\n\n05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: Overall GOOD.\n+ Only the developer(s)/designer(s) know how their vision would have panned out.  What there is of it hints of a fanastically designed game.\n+ Starts of with nice small refined levels.\n+ Beautifully drawn and lighted locations.\n+/- Faced with harder enemies when revisiting certain areas.\n- To much retracing your steps, if you get lost or lose orientation.\n- Becomes a mess of criss-crossing routes to get to objectives.\n- Interface doesnt do enough to help player remember where they have been.  Causing some confusion.  Despite having a decent mini-map.\n\n06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: AVERAGE.\n+ Exploration is the game's best feature by far.  I mean who doesnt love skulking across an alien infested ship alone right!?\n+ Scavenging scrap from dead enemies and searching lockers adds another dynamic to crafting.\n+ Weapons and equipment, upgrading and crafting.\n+ Boss combat is satisfying especially with the heavy weapons such as assault rifle and grenade launcher. :)\n- Simplistic combat inc: Wayward aiming, audio prompts.\n- Terrible multiple enemy spawning, sometimes on top of you.\n- Needs more interaction with the ship systems, terminals and dead bodies.\n- More RPG elements for the character also would have been good.\n\n07. ENEMIES: GOOD.\n+ A nice selection of different enemies with their own abilities.\n- Im sure we would have seen more with a fuller game.  Oh well!\n\n08. A.I: FUNCTIONAL.\n+/- Okay if a little minimal.  Enemies spawn and attack when your character gets to close, there is to light etc.\n\n09. CONTROLS: FUNCTIONAL.\n+/- K/M they work without issue.\n- Targeting seems a little lacksidacical as enemies can reach you faster than you can align the mouse to your targets.\n\n10. GRAPHICS: GREAT.\n+ Along with exploring the ship and audio, its its best feature.  The engine creates some smooth, colourful and quite beautiful backdrops.\n+ Light auras and glow are used to great effect providing a dark, moody, sombre and somewhat eery asethetic.\n\n11. AUDIO: GREAT.\n+ Minimal but captures the mood perfectly.\n+ Movement, firing weapons, squigging through alien environment are all impeccably done. Together they add up to enhance the overall aesthestic.\n+ The dialogue expunging narration of the ship central A.I. is excellent.  One of the best Ive heard in a while.\n\n12. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: GOOD.\n+/- The gameplay is fairly basic as you would imagine in a platformer.  Despite it being an incomplete game the is just about enough to call the game a challenge.\n+ Difficulty scopes very well.\n+ The game is very forgiving as you auto-spawn if you die at the last save-point terminal used.\n\n13. ACHIEVEMENTS: VERY GOOD.\n+ Well-paced.\n+ Varied, in type and difficulty.\n- Only one achievement didnt appear to work properly.  Kill x amount of crab aliens can be done in a few minutes though by standing next to a few chosen spawning holes.\n\n14. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Given its incomplete state I think that Dark Matter will only appeal to fans of the genre (dark sci-fi/lone platformer.)  Those who fancy a cheap game on sale might also be tempted.  What there is of it was incredibly fun, apart from getting frustrated a few times when I lost my bearings.\n\n15. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: Don't expect to get more than .  Ten - twelve hours is more than enough to complete the game unless like me you get stuck alot and have to retrace your steps frequently.\n\n16. ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: Its singleplayer only.  The community has long since been assimilated into the alien hive! ^^\n\n17. SPECS/OPTIMIZATION: STABLE.\n+ Nothing taxing for my Core i3/Radeon HD5700 PC.  Low end PCs will be able to run it no problem.\n+ I think I only suffered one CTD the whole game.\n\n18. SUPPORT: NONE.\n- Given the developer closed down dont expect any patches for the few bugs there.  There is at least one game-breaking bug with an elevator that doesnt respawn if you die.  If you dont have a previous recent save then youll have wasted alot of time.\n- Expect no DLCs either.  If they added some to extend the game I would definitely buy those however.  Maybe Ill contact the dev!\n\n19. PROBLEMS: Overall NEGLIGIBLE.\nA few times changing level/room will bring up a blank screen but the save system is robust and you can load manually.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Unfortunately unless you really want to enjoy the game for what it is I would not recommend getting this game even on a sale.  There just not enough of it.  However if the genre and game features are enough for you to want to try it there is a very good game here.  At least those funds may help the developer with their next game. :/","March 24","false","24.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","2"

Before it went to Steam though I was sent a copy of the beta (v14) because I was one of the backers on Kisckstarter.\n\nI picked up Dark Mater on Steam when it went on sale and installed it to see how it would be and I was eagerly awaiting this game.\n\nI would classify this game as a Metroid type game. Its definitely a side scroller shooter. There is 3D depth to the game and the storyline is pretty good.\n\nI was really impressed with this game during the Kickstarter campaign and followed the development of it.

It might be a little overpriced but I picked it up on sale and think it definitely a good buy.\n\nThe concept behind the game is nice and the story as well. Finding some similarities to movies like Pandorum which is not a bad thing :) The graphic is good and totally adequate for this type of game. The are some minor mistakes but nothing that breaks the game. The atmosphere is nice, dark and foreboding. The difficulty level is spot on at the moment. Tend to die allot but that is because I'm stupid, not the game.\nThe controls are a little bit clunky and I'm having a hard time getting use to the aiming since it all get down to on what side of the character the mouse pointer is at times. Slightly awkward for me but I can't see any other way they could have solved it and with a little practice.\n\nOverall a nice game that I can recommend!","December 18, 2013","true","3.0"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

I wish I didn't feel that way because the game is quite good, for an indie in an overpopulated genre. Combine Dead Space with Castlevania and mix in a little System Shock, and you get Dark Matter. The game mechanics are interesting and well implemented to the point that the game is worth playing, though the story pretty much fades away by the time you start exploring the ship, in favor of having to kill tons of aliens.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is still a mess even after all the controversy with the original ending has been resolved. You'll see on a regular basis code markers throughout the ship that indicate something is going to happen or was supposed to happen - such as a spawned enemy, or something should happen with the camera. None of these appear to have been hidden from player view. That's not a big deal, though. The real problem is that past a certain point in the game, the save points  flat out stop working. Sometimes you can get them to work by manually saving the game, but be warned - If you do not save at a "save station", the game is not saved. I'm not entirely sure why there is a save function outside of those points, because manually doing so literally does nothing. I have lost entire sections of the ship explored because of this that I had to repeatedly do over again and frankly, I got tired of it enough that I gave up on the game. Excuse me for dying. You may not experience these issues - clearly other people have beaten the game so it's possible.\n\nOther than that, there are some UI issues if you use a controller because certain parts are simply impossible to navigate without a mouse. Honestly if you want to buy this game, and I'd want you to - I hope there could one day be a console release with all the kinks ironed out. However, InterWave is pretty much gone so.... Until then, unless you're brave enough and have a high tolerance for nonsense, avoid it.","April 29, 2014","false","9.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Unfortunatly not long after you start to make your way towards freedom and escape the horrors on the space ship the cracks start to show.\n\nThough the visuals do look good with some really nice lighting effects there are some ugly bugs that pop up here and there, and i'm not talking about the purple ones that actually look more cute that terifying , i'm talking the kind where you jump and your character suddenly glitches half way up a few stacked up crates, not to mention falling through elevator floors and down to the bottom of the shaft. Animations also seem to be missing here and there and i don't know what is wrong with my character but she seems to have been roughly cut out of a magazine with blunt scissors.\n\nThe story is alright, as far as trapped-on-a-alien-infested-spaceship stories go, but there have been numerous times where  i found the ship's AI dialogue to be un-computer-like and even annoying. He quickly begins to sound whiny and needy and you just want him to shut up. Maybe i'm missing some big twist about the AI actually being human or something but i don't think so, i just think it's "méh'' writing.\n\nBut when it comes to gameplay and controls that is what finally just made me lose my will to play on and put down my controller  to move on to something else. I will give credit to the idea of when to use the flashlight and when not to use it, but this feature doesn't feel as fleshed out and interesting as it could have been, and that actually goes for the whole game. The controls couldn't have saved it even if they worked properly. They feel slightly awkward and unpolished and even broken at times, to the point where i have to use my mouse to be able to click on a elevator button because my character isn't able to reach it when i use a controller for some reason. Perhaps the game plays better with mouse and keyboard, the options menu and inventory screen certainly seemed to think so, but  i have lost all interest to even care by this point and i have already moved on to enjoy Deadlight, another 2.5D platformer that does most, if not all, things mentioned above right.\n\nBut if after watching Alien or playing Dead Space you still feel the need on surviving on a hostile spaceship and the new Alien: Isolation is above your budget then by all means, give Dark Matter a go, just be sure to play it with keyboard + mouse and  to get it while it's on sale.\n\n\n\nThere is one other thing, that i can't really complain about for i haven't finished the game,  but i've heard people complain about the game not being finished or just suddenly ending. Now i don't know what the truth about this is but the developer has said that there might be more Dark Matter to come in the future that will continue the story, in other words they are saying it's episodic. That is all fine and dandy but have failed to see that mentioned anywhere on the game's store page. Frankly i think the developer has realized that his product isn't finished and is using the episodic idea as damage control. But hey, that's just what i think, someone who sadly didn't enjoy the game as much as i wanted to and didn't even care enough anymore to finish it. I just hope that the people that did manage to enjoy it get a proper and honest end to this game's story.","November 26, 2014","false","2.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

It tries to be like Metroid, but fails in a lot of ways. There are far too many flaws in the game design, as well as flaws in the execution to make this a good game.\n\nPros:\n\nGood atmosphere, adequate enemy design. It was fun exploring parts of the ship. The map I feel was done well.\n\nCons:\n\nI mentioned metroidvania-esque gameplay but this game is mostly linear. Not much reason to backtrack except for collectables and secrets. Due to the linear level design, whenever there's an enemy that's too strong to be easily killed, you're always forced to just power through it. There's not even a way to avoid enemies; jumping over them just hits an invisible wall and lets them get off a free shot. When you first enounter an armored enemy, you're at the the elevator to the next area and can't get past them, so the computer tells you "find some better ammo" but that's in the next section.\n\nThere are numerous points where you will get killed if you don't know what you're doing, but I wouldn't call them "puzzles." They consist of "don't shine your flashlight on this" and "you need to shine your flashlight on this" and "uh oh there's a light shining on this thing, there shouldn't be light on this thing, shoot it." They're not puzzles.\n\nGame design issues:\n\n- It's repetitive: go through corridor, climb ladder, shoot enemy, rinse, repeat.\n- Enemies are really stupid -- if they're offscreen they won't attack you.\n- When the computer's doing a voice over, sometimes there are enemies you're shooting so you can't hear that important piece of dialog, and you can't repeat it either.\n- Certain points in the game function as enemy farms, so there's basically infinite resources. Why even bother counting resources if they're infinite?\n\nTechnical issues (could be fixed):\n\n- It's really poorly-adapted to controller despite touting "full controller support." The UI is next to impossible to navigate with a controller; I knew it was going to be bad news when I was trying to set the options using the controller and I was on a button in the top right of the page, pressed LEFT and then was on a button on the very bottom of the page.  Wouldn't have been so bad except every UI in the game behaves like this. A little bit of controller testing could have prevented this guys.\n- There are entire map sections where the FPS just took a nose dive. Once I did some exploring in one of these rooms and found an easter egg that was extremely beautifully animated with detailed models. WAT? This shouldn't happen! Obviously the game isn't designed to stop offscreen animations, resulting in poor overall performance.\n- Killing tentacles on the ceiling results in the loot spawning above the ceiling, which can't be collected.\n- Killing tentacles in the scene background results in loot spawning in the background plane, which can't be collected.\n\nThe verdict: This game is an unfinished mess.","August 10, 2014","false","4.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Sure, it's no great example of flawless game design (I was a tad confused about my main objective half the time), or perfect plotting (if that was the "new-and-improved" ending I just played, I dread to think what the OLD one was like), and there's less than ten different enemy types and only four weapon types (the last of which arrives just in time to be used on precisely two occasions before the game unceremoniously ends), and no, it's certainly not going to go down well with the "this game wasn't hard enough" and "this game wasn't long enough" brigades (which generally consist of exactly the same people, in case you hadn't noticed)...BUT...(pant pant)...as an attempt to create a highly atmospheric - if not particularly "scary" - cross between 2D platforming and old-school "survival horror", it's surprisingly successful...and like the even MORE flawed Motte Island (which uses an intriguing top-down perspective), proves that there is definite potential for spooky horror games which AREN'T presented in the usual first- or third-person formats.\n\nAnd I don't know about you, but such a notion gets me kinda hot-and-bothered, I gotta confess.

Finding the logs gives you an interesting insight into what happened to the ship, and I rather liked story where an AI will help a human to save both. Horror level is very low, a good thing in my book. Exploration was fun, though it did get slightly long-winding towards the end.\n\nThe end of the game is abrupt, though I hope the extra content will one day be added / created, even if this is in "Dark Matter 2".\n\nPlaytime, finding all logs, unlocking all achievements: a bit over 10 hours.

Gameplay is fairly fun though and it can offer you a few hours of enjoyment but it's far from perfect.

Nice, not great, but still a pleasure to play, primary for the atmosphere in it. If you love Alien and old school c64 games (DM remembered me of many old classics like project firestart) then you have a reason more to buy it. The story is very thin, but enjoyable, it let you feel a myster that you cant solve. Nice the artificial intelligence that guide you, it seems human and not human at the same time, well script! The light play a huge part on the game, attracting enemies and activating/deactivating enemies traps. Some part of the game seems like a low budget Dead space cousin and you will try to imagine the often spoken (by the AI, not by you...) angels, a strange lifeform more cruel than our "normal" aliens around! The game is just right hard, you will die if you not pay attention, but if you take your time you can survive almost every encounter. SAVE OFTEN! now... the "not so good" part\n- The main character is plain like a white sheet of paper. Maybe this is a designer clear decision, but I would love to see my Ensign (her name... sigh) play a little with the AI. nope... not a word! Is like running around a dumb android.\n- The main character animations are a little rough, notthing too bad, but I expecially miss some more animation for actions like hacking/reparing. Ensign just stay blocked while doing such actions, a little atmosphere killer!\n- The comands... I played with a xbox controller... must time all ok, but the menus are a pain in the "you now what" to navigate and often Ensign stopped to move with no apparent reason, leaving me ready to be killed by the monsters! A little more work on the movements would have been appreciated!!!!!\n- The bugs. Nothing that can ruin your game, but often it happen that more than a trigger are put in the same place, so if you want to open a door you have to move a little around becouse first it says "no power" than, a pass or two on the right, it says open... painful if you dont know this! other minor bugs around (like triggers than shows off but that must be invisible) but again nothing awful.\n- This game is well done, but if you search for perfection... not a game for you. it seems like... well, a indie game (and it is). a little more work here and there to clean some roughness and it would be perfect!\nfinal verdict 7.5/10\nSorry for my english, Italy here!!!!","April 13, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

First off, the story is very interesting and I immediately felt a connection with the characters. The introductory scene and narration had me aching for more right off the bat and the rest of the story does not disappoint! As for the gameplay, it is fluid and smooth for the most part. The only exception being that sprinting and jumping seem unresponsive at times (mostly when trying to jump over enemies or around them), which honestly doesn't affect the gameplay all that much, it's just a bit disappointing when it happens. The difficulty is perfect aside from an overabundance of resources in the beginning which allows for a ridiculous amount of health packs.. but I guess I can understand this decision because most of the damage taken and deaths occur from huge damage spikes or traps that insta-kill, so it doesn't have too big of an impact. I also loved the music and ambient sounds. They did a terrific job of complimenting that dark and hostile environment I was talking about and helped to create an immersive experience. All in all, Dark Matter is a pretty good game and I had fun playing through it. I would recommend it, especially to fans of Metroid and Deadspace. I felt that it had an undeniable resemblance to these titles while maintaining it's own unique style.","January 15, 2015","true","4.4"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","12","25","2","0"

It's not a *bad* game, but it certainly takes some getting used to.  The control scheme, at least with an XB360 controller, take some fiddling to get just right.  It's very atmospheric (OK, not Alien: Isolation atmospheric, but for a budget indie game it does a pretty good job).\n\nThe story is interesting enough, at least enough to keep me searching for messages that other survivors have left behind.  No spoilers, but the intro video (which is one of the trailers IIRC) spells out an encounter with an unknown object which kills most of the crew, and then a parasitic/carnivorous infestation that basically wipes almost everyone onboard out.\n\nThe protagonist, a nameless Ensign, is a forgettable character that gets the job done.  The voice acting is serviceable, with cringe-worthy moments.  My wife says she walks like a dude...\n\nCombat is simple to the point of being almost meaningless, at least in the ~1 hour I've invested so far.  Maybe it'll improve as I progress.  I *hope* it improves.\n\nI did encounter a few glitches while playing.  One that sticks in my mind is that elevator buttons didn't work unless I jumped and hit the Interact key on the way down from the jump...  And the first time I did that, I clipped through the elevator floor and fell down the shaft.  Good thing there are plenty of save points.\n\nOn sale?

The concept of the game is highly interesting. It really does have potential.

The side-scrolling action is bookended by [nicely done] story boards that bring you into the story and provide a nice summation of the intended story, and you have the ships AI as your narrator companion throughout the ship. He's kind of like if Harbinger were nice.\nThe side scrolling is more flashback than contra, with limited ammo and rate of fire and health. The mechanics of how the aliens react to light is cool. You 'craft' ammo and medpacks at 'crafting stations' throughout the levels from resources gathered from alien carcasses.  I found it easy to farm resources early in the game and then resources weren't a problem for me.

I liked most of the game, and I don't mind the movement or the move-and-shoot-stuff others mentioned. I mean, you're not a marine, you're some random crew member just woken from cryosleep crawling through a ship infested with aliens, who, after such a long time, don't expect any attack. So to me there's no reason why you shouldn't succeed where the marines failed, even though you're not a trained fighter.\nAnd I don't mind reading a little. It adds to the feeling of a) the game being retro and b) nobody being there on the ship.\nSome minor bugs annoyed me like the go-here-markers on the minimap didn't always work which ended in me crawling through the level to find where I'm supposed to be. But that's just a minor thing. On the other hand, I like the way the game works with light and the overall feeling this creates.\nDespite of the following issues, I recommend the game. It's nice to play and I totally liked the atmosphere.\nWhat really bugs me is that you get the feeling that this game should have been longer.\n\n* Medium Spoiler Alert *\n\nNot in comparison to the price, but there is nothing indicating the ending. You literally open a door and there it is. And you have just gotten the last piece of equipment and have used it once to clear an obstacle. I can't shake the feeling that there was like 15 more minutes of gameplay planned but then the budget ran out and they put the ending behind some more or less random door.\n\n* Major Spoiler Alert *\n\nOh, and the ending explains too much. Seriously, I could have lived with not knowing what the Angels were. What I gathered so far was enough: Weirdly powerful aliens, the real threat. Or have the info seeded into the game proper.\nI always try to fix things so here is my try on this: Just imagine your mentoring voice telling you 2-3 times to meet him in the Toxic Materials section and how he longs to meet you in person. And that he's got a way to escape from the ship. This way there would be a build-up to this point. You could even have a little twist like him not indicating he's a sort of AI, but saying "I dug in here and have a means to escape, but I can't do it alone." Of course people would wonder, like why someone is still alive. But that's not a bad thing. Having a feeling that things just don't add up. And then the ending would come as a relief.

I'd write a NEGATIVE review for that.\n\nSo when I was a kid (you can now tell my relative age with a little thought) I played three games Dark Matter reminded me of.\n\nMarathon - Bungie - Apple System 6.x-7.x:\n-The last hope after a horrible catastophe inflicted by a hostile alien race, you are guided by a self-aware AI.\n-Suspended animation has taken it's toll on the memory, and some other higher level functions, What else to do but follow the (potentially quite disturbed) Aritificial Intelligence?\n\nI thought it was a great trip back to my childhood.\n\nMetroid:\n\n-Samus Aran was one of the first non-BS female protagonists; tough as nails with an amazing drive for survival, enough to rival any manlydudebro to hit the cookie cutter hero lineup.\n\nThe Ensign is just that character - although nameless at this point.\n\n-The maps, the hallways, the enemies, the weapon system. VERY Metroid feeling.\n\nAlien 3 - Activision - Sega Genesis:\n\n-Just the overtone; if you've played this game you'll know what I was thinking.\n\nMy overall thoughts on the game:\n\n-Slow but not crawling, just enough action to keep you on your toes.\n-Enemies are not fear incarnate, meaning that the more squeamish gamer can still enjoy it.\n-Storyline is immersive but not overloading, narration is commendable.\n-The save system is much better thought out: you can manual save OR use the checkpoint system, so you have more than one option to extricate yourself from untenable situations\n-The crafting system, while not amazing is a nifty little addition to the game.\n-I recommend it - it's nice little time-passer reminscent of a 29 year old circa 2014 and I will update when I complete the game.\n\nI know TL;DR - Thanks for reading if you made it this far!","December 28, 2014","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Unfortunately, the studio failed to fund this project to completion - I would say it really should be appreciated but I'm skeptical it will ever get the additional development effort it deserves.\n5/10","June 15, 2015","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It also has a compelling story with several naratives to be found when exploring the game, and it's up to you whether you want to explore or not.

This thing is full of bugs and weird behaviour. When one of the alien things take a strike at you, it takes a full second for your character to react.

Objects that are obviously there to interact with can't be picked up, like the spinning pile of luminated scrap metal, that no matter how much I try, cannot be picked up. Also, the character movement is SLOOOOOOOOW - Takes ages to go up and down ladders and navigate the hallways.

It might be a little overpriced but I picked it up on sale and think it definitely a good buy.\n\nThe concept behind the game is nice and the story as well. Finding some similarities to movies like Pandorum which is not a bad thing :) The graphic is good and totally adequate for this type of game. The are some minor mistakes but nothing that breaks the game. The atmosphere is nice, dark and foreboding. The difficulty level is spot on at the moment. Tend to die allot but that is because I'm stupid, not the game.\nThe controls are a little bit clunky and I'm having a hard time getting use to the aiming since it all get down to on what side of the character the mouse pointer is at times. Slightly awkward for me but I can't see any other way they could have solved it and with a little practice.\n\nOverall a nice game that I can recommend!","December 18, 2013","true","3.0"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

I wish I didn't feel that way because the game is quite good, for an indie in an overpopulated genre. Combine Dead Space with Castlevania and mix in a little System Shock, and you get Dark Matter. The game mechanics are interesting and well implemented to the point that the game is worth playing, though the story pretty much fades away by the time you start exploring the ship, in favor of having to kill tons of aliens.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is still a mess even after all the controversy with the original ending has been resolved. You'll see on a regular basis code markers throughout the ship that indicate something is going to happen or was supposed to happen - such as a spawned enemy, or something should happen with the camera. None of these appear to have been hidden from player view. That's not a big deal, though. The real problem is that past a certain point in the game, the save points  flat out stop working. Sometimes you can get them to work by manually saving the game, but be warned - If you do not save at a "save station", the game is not saved. I'm not entirely sure why there is a save function outside of those points, because manually doing so literally does nothing. I have lost entire sections of the ship explored because of this that I had to repeatedly do over again and frankly, I got tired of it enough that I gave up on the game. Excuse me for dying. You may not experience these issues - clearly other people have beaten the game so it's possible.\n\nOther than that, there are some UI issues if you use a controller because certain parts are simply impossible to navigate without a mouse. Honestly if you want to buy this game, and I'd want you to - I hope there could one day be a console release with all the kinks ironed out. However, InterWave is pretty much gone so.... Until then, unless you're brave enough and have a high tolerance for nonsense, avoid it.","April 29, 2014","false","9.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

This is my review for Dark Matter. The game's lighting is excellent, the story however is a bit cliched with you waking up on a derelict ship and you must fight your way off of it, that whole jazz. Gameplay is fairly fun though and it can offer you a few hours of enjoyment but it's far from perfect. The game was originally planned as a multi-part storyline which was the reason for the initial abrupt ending.

However, there's not much more beyond that.\n...but where it falls flat is the environments: Technically they look different, but somehow they all look the same. Without any variation, the game just ends up becoming one big maze. This means that you can easily take a wrong turn and end up missing the shotgun in the game, so you find yourself asking yourself why you need to glitch-kill enemies from off-screen in order to proceed.\n\nThere's also a good amount of various bugs.
