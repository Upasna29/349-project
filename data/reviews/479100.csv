( Illuminati ♥♥♥♥♥es ;-p )\n\nI definately think it has TONS of potential , the customization thing is fun and easy if you take the time to understand the mechanics .\nIve allready created my musician friends and their bands along with the top 50 venues and 20 Festivals of my home country (Denmark)\n\nBUT !\n\nThat being said it just seems unfinished. . This is what I would expect from a late Beta.\n-- Inabillity to Full screen play it is just . . bleh." Full screen" is marred by a large grey bar in the bottom of the screen.\n-- No Manual or pop-up tool tip and the menus can get pretty extensive and downright confusing at times\n-- Layout .. For a "text" game the accessibillity of the different menus are key . . For me anyways :) The navigation just seems  "off"\n-- A deal of minor tweaking is required in the percentiles aspect ( A MAJOR ASPECT OF THE GAME IS IN THE PERCENTILES) in regards to Sales, concert goers, and Artist stats.\n-- Its very hard to start a record label from scratch . .\n" Yeah I just won 10mil $ in the powerball and want to be a mogul!\nI got the name "Boogie Down Productions" 10mil in the bank and a go get em attitude! and im ready to scout for talents!  Whats that you say ? Unless I get a number 1 single in the US in 9 weekse my reputation takes a hit ? But . . But. .\nScouting for talents takes atleast 2 weeks ! And thats like rushing it! I want to be thorough!\nI want to have them rehearse together a bit too !\nPlay a few low level gigs in their region (europe)\nBack in rehearsel to up the morale/chemistry\nAnd then hit the studio!\nNo you say ?\n(After 6 weeks)\nyou took a 2% hit to reputation. . .\nNEW GOAL: Get a 50% Reputation in Latin america\nWait. . .What?\n\nSO ANYWAYS!\n\nI really want this game to succeed but I don´t think its quite there yet!\nHope It will continue to develop, cause this kind of game is sorely needed\nIt doesnt represent value for money 4/10","June 2","true","13.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

Streaming needs to last longer than sales, and slowly drop.\n\n- Sales in the US also need to be adjusted, 10,000 copies for #1 is not realistic\n\n- The bugs addressed by fans in the forum need to be fixed\n\nIf you're a hardcore fan of the series, get this, but if you're new to the game, wait till these issues are fixed.","June 2","true","0.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

After an hour or so of playing I have to say I'm pleased with the game so far. It's early yet and my opinion can change, but I like the changes I see from MWR -- that said, I largely skipped MWR2 because of bugs involved with modding near the beginning of its lifespan, so I don't really know which features are completely new here.\n\nThere are a few gripes I have with the game, though. The lack of fullscreen is pretty detrimental to the overall experience, which is a huge shame. I find it to be an odd design choice in 2016. Also, the outdated DRM is rather curious as well, but I can forgive this because the game designer has eliminated the machine activation limitation due to the negative response to this choice. Unfortunately the DRM seems to cause Steam to count the game as "running" even after you exit, which is a moderate annoyance. The pictures for all of the artists in the game, seen in screen shots, do not show up in my game at all.\n\nI also think there are some balancing issues that definitely need a second look. For example, I put a decent amount of money into an unknown artist's first single. It bombed, which isn't too surprising, but I then released a rather successful music video for the song which is seeing about a million views a week while the single itself is selling about 4 copies a week with no signs of growth. The exposure from a popular music video would definitely have a much larger impact on a single's success but that doesn't seem apparent.\n\nThis is just my early feeling toward the game and that can easily change with updates. In the future, I'd like to see some progress made toward correcting these issues as well as ensuring that mods work as painlessly as possible. I like simming really long games and to have MWR2 crash constantly after adding a few acts to the game was rather disheartening (my reason for sticking to MWR1). Overall I feel pretty positive toward the experience so far and I'm optimistic toward the future of the game.","June 3","true","6.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/j0shle0/recommended/479100/","j0shle0","CMDR_Leonard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/j0shle0/","103 products in account","I am checking yes because of the thought that went into the game and the potential it holds.  As of now, it is fun for a few hours as you figure out the mechanics (there is no tutorial), but after that it is tedious and impossible.  It is in dire need of tuning, which I will address below, but as stated above, I believe there is potential here for a fun management sim, especially if modding is allowed which it appears to be. However, right now the game is just not there.\n\nThere are a few points that are easily correctable that I believe would make the game orders of magnitude better.\n\nFirst, the constant goals popping up with unrealistic timeframes need to be fixed. Maybe there is an option to turn them off that I missed. When you start the game as a new independent label, and then have 12 weeks to produce a #1 album in the USA… you’re not going to make it.  This in turn causes your reputation to go down, which makes it even harder to sign acts, and that leads me to my second point.\n\nSecond, there needs to be some tuning on the act signing / talent searching.  I understand that you should not be able to sign Justin Beiber (he sells a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of records) when you just start your label, but if you spend 9 weeks and $2,000,000+ on a talent search; there should be a chance for you to uncover a star.  I ran several talent searches and the results were formulaic.  Very few artists excelled in more than 2 areas. If they were good singers and had sex appeal, they weren’t mainstream.  If they were mainstream and had sex appeal, they couldn’t sing, etc…\n\nFinally, and this is by no means the end of my list of corrections I would like to see but it is the end of this list, there really needs to be some corrections made to the double booking.  If you hire a manager and then turn around and book a tour for an act being managed, the manager can then book a tour on top of yours.  At one point I had an artist playing in Toronto and Los Angeles on the same day. Obviously this is logistically feasible, but it is not something that would be allowed to happen in real life.\n\nMinor points, better feedback on what your artists and doing/accomplishing (ticket and record sales) on the home screen would be nice; hints or advice or even questions from your staff would be nice.  I have many more things I could list, but I am doubtful the developer will read this, so I will stop now.\n\nTo sum up, I would recommend buying the game, IF you have the money and want to invest in something that could be fun a few weeks/months from now.  If you are one of those people who think it’s the end of the damn world to spend $13 on a game that isn’t AAA, or who ♥♥♥♥♥es about DRM as if you have more than one gaming computer that YOU use (not your brother/sister/wife/gf/friend), then this game is not for you, and also you should go drown yourself because you are what is wrong with the gaming community.","June 1","true","6.0"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","17","29","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scsag/recommended/479100/","scsag","The Guy In the $6300 Suit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scsag/","549 products in account","I’m a huge fan of both business sims and music, and you’ll be hard pressed to find many games that crossover into the music industry. There’s some out there, and while many of them are good, they sacrifice the large scale industry side of things to show a more personal, smaller scale side of the music industry, usually focusing solely on one band or only allowing a couple dozen artists to be simulated at a time. I say all of this because the Music Wars series goes against this trend, choosing to simulating the entire music industry, and Music Wars Empire is the newest, largest, and most polished game in the series to date.\n\nSeveral big new features have been added to this latest iteration, including expanded regions (now supporting 129 subregions worldwide), digital streaming for releases, new charts, release types, buying out competing record labels and managing multiple labels, the ability for your artists to go Solo, as well as the ability for your artists to form their own Side Projects in new genres, remix songs, and online compete online via online leaderboards. In addition to these features, the game has been optimized to load faster than previous entries in the series, even when using large mods that would bring previous iterations down to a crawl.\n\nIn addition to these new features are returning features from earlier entries, several of which have been entirely re-tooled specifically for Music Wars Empire. Collaborations have been made easier than ever, while relationships and artist social networks affect who they will and won’t work with based on their opinions and experiences with those individuals (including record CEO’s, cough cough).\n\nThe combination of old and new allow the player to leave their own unique mark on the game's world. Whether you start off with a small indie label, or begin big with an already established international label, you truly feel like you’re running an empire as you start to expand and control several labels and recording studios.\n\nThough if rapid expansion and heading a large WMG type company isn’t your preferred playstyle, don’t worry. Because Music Wars Empire is a sandbox sim, you get to play at your own style and pace. So indie purists, stay small and independant if you choose, or just expand as you feel comfortable.\n\nMusic Wars Empire is an ambitious and successful attempt to simulate the music industry. If you’re not a fan of text based games - like Football Manager, Hollywood Mogul, or Showtime - then this game clearly isn’t for you. But if you are a fan of the genre, or are interested in a record label/music industry sim, you can do no better than Music Wars Empire.\n","June 6","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
