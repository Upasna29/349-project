This is one of the coolest concepts I have ever seen destroyed by an unusable DRM scheme.\n\nFrom Dust is a work of art. Watching the form of the earth change and mould as the player manipulates it brings back memories of Black and White, but with a sense of visual awe that comes from being a much more recent game. It is something that I feel any gamer owes it to themselves to experience at least once. Sadly, I can't recommend buying the game, as I have an ethical objection to UPlay. The alternative, a Chrome app that is free in the Chrome Store, is okay, but ultimately Ubisoft's disingenuity has ruined, or at least limited access to, what I consider to be an actual art piece.\n\nFun fact: Ubisoft actually patched the game to remove UPlay. I had been hoping that would happen and bought it shortly after. Only a few months later, I had been happily enjoying my new game when I launched one day to find UPlay had been patched back in.\n\nUbisoft, I know you're not listening, but stop punishing your customers for buying your products. You did the right thing once before and removed the DRM from this game. Now that the DRM is back on, I would not be surprised to find the number of seeders for this game on torrent sites has spiked. No one wants a content management system inside another content management system, especially if they only have one or two games in the "nested" one.","October 15, 2015","false","2.5"," 135 of 154 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","135","154","2","6"

It's sort of an update on Populous. Way better looking than Populous, though.\n\nI enjoyed playing From Dust through about half of the game's missions. Figuring out how to manipulate the environment to advance your tribe through a series of goals is fun and challenging. But after about 5 levels, the game's challenge became less about figuring out a strategy, and more about executing it with the awkward controller scheme. After about 8-10 levels, it just became too awkward to play. The strategy elements of the game outgrew their clumsy control scheme.\n\nI might recommend this, though, if it's on deep sale. It's pretty to look at, and I had a good couple of hours of fun before deciding the juice wasn't worth the squeeze.\n\n...That damned level with the burning trees.

What other game has free-flowing water, sand, and lava that can all be mixed together to create rock, land, volcanoes, mountains, earthquakes, and tsunamis? If you are hoping that the very end of the game unlocks a no-strings-attached sandbox mode, however, you may be slightly disappointed. The sandbox mode that you get at the end is another level where you get to use all the abilities you gain across the rest of the game to beat the level. After you beat it, you return to the main menu. From there you can choose to play it again, but it doesn't feel at all like a truly free sandbox mode.

While annoying, this is doable and not the only game like it. Wish I had read more of the steam reviews before buying. I would not recommend this game and if you already bought it, my sympathies, but it is not the next Black and White. Buy at own risk, I cannot stress this enough.\n\nControls and Mechanics: Saw a lot of complaints about this. Some buttons are counter intuitive or not 'the norm' but you can grow accustomed to them fairly quickly there's only two really weird ones. UI is spare so you aren't overwhelmed with options. Movement of the cursor corresponds with the movement of your avatar and 90% of the time this is fine and you get used to it fast. The other 10% of the time it will go too far too fast or something at just the wrong time and Bad Things will happen because of it (this has caused me to restart at least one map). Similarly 1-2-3-4 isn't hard to remember, but when the powers attributed to them shift around you have to constantly check the menu to make sure you're using the right power.\n\nThe AI of the people is actually fairly decent - when it works. When it doesn't you get dozens of annoying little voices screaming at you from the top of a hastily erected pillar as rivers of lava flow around them, voices which you cannot stop until either that lava does, or one of your powers comes up, etc. Furthermore idiotic people have cost me wins before, causing me to have to restart some maps several times or making simple tasks very hard.\n\nCamera: Similar to dungeon crawlers, up above and slightly behind the avatar with the option to zoom in a little or to zoom in completely (and not be able to do anything) on just one of your humans. Like the controls 90% of the time this is fine, but when it goes wrong it can be very frustrating giving the fast liquids you are working with.\n\nNow to the reason I am writing this review: some spoilers ahead (I try not to name names).\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly interesting premise and I genuinely wanted to see my people through and to find out more about what had happened before me. The cut scene between maps gets annoying overtime since its pretty long and just the same footage over and over again but that's not game breaking. What is game breaking is the end. The last level. First of all the game froze just as I was about to complete it so I had to go back and do it all over again (first time this had happened). I hesitate to detail what exactly happens but suffice to say that I was extraordinarily displeased, felt that absolutely NONE of the plot points were tied up (they didn't even try to softball something in or if they did it was too subtle for my shock and disappointment to see it), we weren't given any revelations or massive info dumps, its one giant screw you to the idiot stupid enough to waste their time on this game. Before the end I was willing to give this game a pass and say there were some levels worth redoing, some content worth getting every little bit from, but afterwards I uninstalled the game without second thoughts.\n","February 25, 2014","false","7.0"," 58 of 90 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","58","90","0","2"

Tasked with guiding a primitive tribe on a quest for answers about their past you are given control of the environment, picking up dirt, water, and lava, to clear paths or build them, while fighting off nature itself.\n\nVisually From Dust is appealing with beautiful tropical islands to arid deserts and lava crusted mountains. The way your powers mold the environment also looks very good. The campaign is just about the right length with a lot of extra content in challenges or open worlds if you're craving more in the end.\n\nFor the most part everything works as expected. Occasionally you will drown or burn some of your people but almost always it's because of your own mistake. That being said, occasionally the AI has some pathing issues that lead them into unnecessary danger and get them killed. More common though is having trouble telling where the AI will allow you to go, mostly involving how steep a slope they will walk up. This can cause problems when you think you have a clear path but the AI refuses to move and reverts to complaining about how much they are now on fire. It was never bad enough for me to make me stop playing though.\n\nFrom Dust is a nice change of scenery and play style that is definitely worth your time.","January 15, 2014","true","15.3"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","0"

Set your cities, plan them to be safe, form rivers around them to let your citizens not be eaten by lava. Follow the individuals to get ancient signs and bring themm safe home.\n\nAll in all.

Every mission is essantially a puzzle to solve and with increasing difficulty it results into about 10 hours of top notch entertainment. Some people throwing temper tantrums because of the uplay, I had no problems with it at all (I never had uplay crashing or anything those guys are "experiencing").\n\nThe important thing is that a review that only lists problems with uplay is not a review of this game at all. The game is an overlooked gem, it has amazing aesthetics and so much charm most of the other titles would be envious. It's not a groundbreaking title, as this was done before, but it's done really well.\n\nTwo reasonable criticisms - mouse controls are not that good, and while your villagers aren't exactly lemmings, they can be pretty dumb.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mazian/recommended/33460/","Mazian","Mazian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mazian/","264 products in account","While this is a recommendation in favor of From Dust, it comes with a lot of qualifiers. This is not a game that is worth full price. Yes, the graphics and production value are above average. And yes, this is a well designed God Game. And yes, because of the dynamic way in which the world behaves in reaction to your choices can drastically change the playthrough of any particular level. And ultimately yes, the levels (what few there are) are well designed.\n\nBut that brings me to my first complaint: There are only 12 levels (not counting the finale which doesn't really count since you can easily win simply by not using anything but the Breath of Earth.) For a full priced game, this is scaled more as a tech demo and paying full price is outrageous. (And I mean that to be a bit dramatic, because Fromt Dust is offensively short.)\n\nIt took me roughly 6 hours to beat the game (And I had to play at least three maps over.)\n\nWhich leads me to my next complaint:  There are no saves. If you fail, you have to start over from the beginning of the level. That's not horrible, but it is made painful by the unskippable cutscenes and monologues at the beginning of each level. If you're not beating the level in the first or second try, the tedium of unskippable cutscenes is likely to drive you slightly mad. The cutscenes are "cute" the first time through, but after that they start to grate on your nerves. Your followers don't speak English. Everything is subtitled. While this seems like a novel idea at the beginning, people speaking gibberish at you on the start of each level (coupled with the fact that you cannot bypass it) quickly becomes annoying. This annoyance is mercifully mitigated by the short "single player campaign." (Of questionable value, since it also means there isn't much meat on the bones of this game.)\n\nMy third complaint is that it requires Uplay, Ubisoft's DRM. Ubisoft's DRM is draconian. There are multiple features in many games that simply do not work if you do not have an active internet connection (as opposed to Steam, where that connection is only required on first activation.) Additionally, Uplay fails to install correctly when installed through Steam and you have to jury rig it to work (I put a guide together under From Dust for anyone who buys this and runs in to the installation problem and goes looking for the solution.) While Ubisoft has removed some of the other unpalatable elements of Uplay DRM, it still remains the poster child for "what not to do" among game producers.\n\nHowever, if you catch this on a sale ($5-10 tops) and you can tolerate dealing with Uplay, you will find yourself faced with a few (very few) enjoyable hours with Fromt Dust.\n\nThe gameplay that derives from wielding god powers (water, warth, fire and life-- no air here) is enjoyable. The sense of urgency that derives from the interaction between floods and earth washing away, or between a lava flow steadily working its way into your followers-- these interactions are compelling and interesting.\n\nUnlike Molyneux's "God Game Remake in Godus" there is no farmville experience here. You really are left solely with Godly concerns. How do you unlock your next power?, how do you expand your followers across the world in the face of looming environmental disaster?, how do you help them escape the world before the tenuous balance you've maintained comes crashing down around you and your followers?\n\nThe story is nothing special. It starts as a question, and it ends as a question.\n\nThe graphics are pretty spectacular (for what it is). There's not a ton of individualized follower behavior (You typically zoom all the way out and do your best to stay on top of the floods, or the tsunamis, or the volcanos  that are poised to end your followers.) But the environmental effects are pretty interesting. Water that is volumetric and looks like water. It has waves, it feeds plant life, it cools lava. Lava that is equally volumetric, and which cools when it thins, leaving behind a layered rock strata on which the next wave of lava will rise over it. Each river, be it water or lava, is unique and behaves according to physics which seem realistic (so long as you don't analyze them too heavily.)\n\nThe game performs well (one crash of the game, one crash of Uplay before I applied the installation fix I mentioned earlier). The audio is well designed, if a bit shallow and repetative. The digeridoo sounds are thematic and interesting (but if you don't like them, they become fairly constant in late game and that is likely to get on your nerves.)\n\nAll in all, despite its many flaws, I would give From Dust a positive rating-- at a much lower price point.\n\nIf you happen to see this on sale and feel like a few hours with a novel take on the God game genre, then give this a try. (But don't get it except on sale, because there just isn't much under the hood to justify the cash expenditure.)","November 30, 2014","true","8.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I'm not saying that the graphics of From Dust were ugly, they are not. But you watch the world from high in the air, and the tiny people of this world are just that: tiny, tiny people. But that's not the problem of the game. I admit, I was hoping for a modern version of "Populous". A proper God-simulation. But your powers as a God in this game are highly limited. Everything in this game is highly limited. Your tiny people have to discover or populate around certain obelisks before you can work wonders. Those "wonders" allow you to manipulate the world to a degree. I'd say 80% of the play time, you pick up sand and drop it somewhere else. This way you create land for your tiny people, or you dig ravines for controlling the flow of waters. It's actually quite fun for a while, but pretty soon it gets old. You are doing pretty much the same all the time. From Dust clearly is not the new Populous. The old hit from 1989 beats From Dust in the categories fun, length and complexity. The world of From Dust provides only roughly one dozen maps, and those are not really huge. Between the maps you watch the same boring sequences again and again, you do the same things again and again, move tons of sand from A to B so that after some settling you can get your tiny people to make it to the exit of the world. Maybe that's why we only got a dozen or so maps (of which the first few are pretty much meant as tutorial maps...), because the developers realized that the game concept is simply not complex and entertaining enough to motivate for more than 10 or so hours. French games are often pearls of innovation and creativity, but this one sadly, is not.","August 10, 2014","false","11.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can manipulate earth, water, and lava to reach village points and to reach the next level. The goal is to find out where these villagers came from. As levels progress they start in island places with lots of water, next to big volcanoes, or in a stretch of dry desert. The villagers have a unique appearance to them, along with their art and music being of unique looks. Controlling matter is easy and the land and water physics is handled very well. These points add for a special experience.\nThe problem lies with the later PC release. As this was made for consoles it wasn't well optimized. Ubisoft requires to use their DLC along with Steam just to use it. The performance is abysmal, but the art and music are sure to please.

This creative platform tickled me a lot; I've never seen another game quite like this. Some levels were challenging and frustrating but satisfying in the end; others were a little easy but over all it was well balanced.

So if it's something that's somewhat challenging.\n\nArtwork is great and is probably the strongest point of the game. It's a shame that you often can't appreciate it as you're mostly staring at it from afar.\n\nIt's certainly worth your time and money for an update of Bullfrog's epic "Populus: In The Beginning", even thought the reworking on shines a veneer rather than get anywhere near the depth of its spiritual predecessor.","December 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

It is as fascinating to watch as it is to play. The fantastic idea gives you the power of being the protective creator of a tribal group of people by modelling nature and landscapes. Even if the main action of piling up and excavating the level's territory may not sound spectacular, I already played it through several times. Not least this is due to the physics which grant sensible effects from all my godlike actions. You have the power over lava, earth and water with which you can shape the landscape in favour of the tribe. The goal is to create a save passage over the map to some ruins which grant access to the next scenario. In this sandbox nature is your persistent opponent. If you are not careful fire burns your village down or flood washes your people away.\n\nA real downside of this game is the story. Actually there is no notable plot which could be called a storyline. Other than the campaign you can also play in custom empty map where you can build your own landscapes.\nIt has also to be stated, that the game requires UPlay since it is an Ubisoft game.\n\nSo it is a game that is different. Unfortunately it is not complete, neither by its extent nor by its plot. Nontheless, it reminded me as well of endless hours in the sandpit during childhood. Not least thanks to the still pretty graphics I recommend this terraforming god game.","November 5, 2014","true","11.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I was worried that I'd get overwhelmed by a complex, totally freeform sort of experience where deep mastery is required to have any fun at all.\n\nI'm pleased to say that this title avoids that problem. You're generally allowed to ease into the mechanics quite gently, and you also tend to get a lot of warning about things potentially getting away from you. Thoughts like "Oh...what I'm doing with this volcano won't be very helpful in a minute" are much more common than "What the heck just happened?" Your goals are easy to identify, and mistakes are usually correctable. Even when you completely fail, you can usually see where things went wrong.\n\nI also felt that the general mysteriousness of the game world was highly compelling when combined with what you do find out. It all left me wishing that I could have discovered more regarding the goings-on.\n\nIt's true that the behaviors of the people you're trying to help can be a bit less than helpful, especially given their tendency to be finicky about where they can and can't go. (There's also the whole problem of them managing to drown in something like one foot of water.) Even so, the quirks aren't so bad as to ruin the game.\n\n"From Dust" is a slightly quirky but ultimately interesting ride.

Before the later stages, it was relaxing, like playing in a sandbox, yet reasonably challenging without being frustrating or punishing.\n\nUnfortunately, as I got to the later stages, difficulty arose due to a certain totem being placed in a very tricky, high and near-lava location. You have to rely on the individual pathing of the AI, but there's not much indication if they'll be able to get up slopes (when there's multiple potential routes to a location) so trying to get them to this totem without having them try to cross lava is an exercise in frustration. The AI pathing tends to be annoying to deal with as the stages get harder. Also, depending on how you may have tried to build walls in stages with lava, you may find yourself having spent a lot of time on a stage but in a sitation where you'll have to try to destroy some walls to let your villagers get to a totem. Doing this is tedious because you need to use explosive plants (if you made rock walls). I don't understand the point in letting players manipulate something in such a tedious way instead of providing a less time-consuming method.\n\nOverall, dealing with the lava is quite frustrating, especially with how it can completely wipe out villages if so much as a particle touches some of your greenery. I understand having a challenge makes things more fun, but the way this challenge is presented is more frustrating than entertaining, because a small mistake can reset your entire stage progress.\n\nSlight variation on the level design and the lava mechanics would've probably made the game fun, but as it is I can't recommend it because of the unpleasantness of the later levels. Challenge should not come from dealing with the stupid AI, and mistakes shouldn't make you feel like you've just wasted a bunch of time, because that's no fun. Towards the end it just became not pleasant to play anymore. It's a shame because the sandbox mechanics are very entertaining to interact with - it's almost like they weren't sure whether they wanted to frustrate players with hard challenges or provide a relaxing, slow-paced sandbox game.","November 9, 2014","false","5.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

It has been qutie awhile since I played this but here is what I remember.\n\nThe Action\n\nGod mode game you must protect your people from dying from basically natural disasters, mostly floods and volcanoes.  You gain abilities to pick up water, earth, lava and mix and match them to build islands or escort your people to level exits.  There is a story mode and a competitve mode (leaderboard type deal).\n\nThe Good\n\nNice graphics and music, pretty sure the majority of the games budget went to these two.  There are some entertaining cut scenes of your people running around doing tribal type stuff.\n\nPhysics are pretty accurate and the water/lava simulations are pretty sweet and can be fun to goof around with for awhile.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe game is really short, I played through the story and spent quite a bit of time in the competitve mode but it gets boring pretty quickly, well maybe not boring but there just isn't much to do, especially if you don't have any friends on Uplay.\n\nPricey- this goes in with the length of the game, I feel like off sale it's just overpriced even when its half off I'd be hesitant to recommend it\n\nUPlay- Ubisofts version of steam, I didn't like it at all it was buggy, clunky, and right after I played this game they had some sort of data breach so that put me off and I just don't buy ubisoft any more\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe game itself isn't necessarily bad but I just can't recommend it unless it's on a hefty discount sale and the UPlay requirements were removed","November 25, 2013","false","10.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

'user experience' much?)\nIt IS NOT a spiritual ancestor to Populous because the title itself is fairly limited. It reminds me somewhat of the Black and White series (and a similar one-gimmick game play). If you like pretty graphics and pressing Space Bar, then you'll like this game though. It is about right-priced if you're OK with annoying.\nAlso see: http://www.1up.com/news/from-dust-drm-removal-steam-give-refund","August 24, 2011","false","5.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

They obviously didn't think it through and I might even think they didn't even play through it themselves before putting it out. The point in making a game is so you enjoy playing it while having a bit of a challange.

First off, they give you the SMALLEST tutorial on earth with the worst controls ever. Then, after that, they spawn in random characters who you believe you can control but NO! You can move dirt and sand around them. To make things worse, you can't drown them. This game is based around you moving sand around people so these unhelpful, mentally ill and poorly controlled AI can move to a temple. I thought this was going to be a building game because it was titles "From Dust". Sounds like a civilization type game, huh? I'd give this game a 1/10 because sometimes you can put the people in sand and watch them crawl out like ants in a hill.

COntrary to his most famous creations which were side scrolling adventures, From Dust is a God-game.\n\nTo make this review short, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I spent about 18 hours with the main missions, not touching the challanges, so it has plenty of content to keep you satisfied. Plus the game looks amazing. The only gameplay-related minus is the lack of a sandbox mode, but that's alleviated by the fact that the last mission is exactly that: a sandbox mode. Though I think it should have been a separate mode, not locked at the end of the campaign.\n\nNow, to speak a bit about its technical problems. I will start by saying that I had absolutely no problem with any of the problems most people bring up when talking about From Dust, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.\nIts most common problems are:\n- bad mouse and keyboard controls. I was not affected as I played with a gamepad. If you own a gamepad (and most PC users do nowadays), do yourself a favor and play this game with it. It wills ave you a lot of frustration and it will help you enjoy the game.\n- locked framerate. Yes, the game is locked at 30fps and there are no excuses but: it hasn't bothered me at all since this is an incredibly slow paced game. In this case 30fps is completely acceptable and doesn't realy break the game or the immersion in any way.\n- uPlay. Everyone and their mother are complaining about uPlay. It didn't bother me at all, and to be honest I don't see how anyone that isn't a kid would be bothered by it. It is just another UI layer that didn't bother me at all. It just loads with the game and remains in the background while I play. Just like steam. To be bothered by one but not by the other is completely immature in my opinion.\n- Always online DRM. By the time I played this game, Ubisoft removed always online DRM so right now this is a non-issue.\n\nIf you like god-games, do yourslef a favor and play From Dust. It's not really as good as the pold Populous games (nostalgia may be a factor in my case), but it is still pretty good and offers a lot of content. The game is also pretty cheap nowadays (you can get it in a sale for 5 dollars or euros).","November 30, 2015","true","19.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You're a god, sure. With powers over nature, sure. You lead a tribe of people, sure. But this is really a puzzle game. You move dirt and lava and stuff around to make a way for your people to reach new village spots. That's it. Oh and there's no real progression between levels. If that sounds fun, have at it.\n\nI expected more, and I guess that's my fault for not reading enough reviews.\n\nBUT, the mouse controls suck. I'm four levels in and I still hate how the mouse controls. I regularly pick up water instead of the dirt I want that's next to it. Directing my people to a new spot is hard because getting the mouse to settle on that spot is hard. There's some really weird acceleration going on. And the game forces me to use uPlay. Despite my admission that I shouldn't have bought this game, I think this paragraph still warrants a thumbs down, because I tried to enjoy it for what it is and these frustrations stopped that.","September 2, 2014","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

This game has a lot to offer in terms of beauty and inspiring animations where it comes to the forced generated into the environments.\nThe problem is that this game feels like it was supposed to be more, couldn't reach its high-end goals, and so settled for being a simple puzzle game.  I wanted to care about the little tribes people, but, because I could really do nothing more meaningful with them than build them paths and tell them to go somewhere, they never really became all that endeared to me.  I mean if they had even been better programmed to be more interactive just with one another and their environments, it would have been sufficient for me to feel like an actual all-powerful god watching over my people.  Fact is, they just threw up cookie-cutter village spheres and then sat around waiting for me to do something.  I would have greatly enjoyed watching them fish and farm and hunt or just about anything which made them feel alive to the gamer.  I really think that, with the bare bones nature of your godly influence in the world of From Dust, this game needed more content and variety within its little living world.\nAnyway, going from scripted event to scripted event works well enough for a FPS or arcade modes in other genres, but it does very little for a game like this, in my mind and while many of the natural disasters you are trying to aid your little pointless people in surviving are rather glorious, they actually leave you, a god, feeling rather small and futile when faced with their might and splendor.\nI wouldn't really recommend this game for more than a cursory playthrough and a few moments of drooling over the fluid physics.  It's pretty, but its pretty blank as well.","March 6, 2015","false","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not another Populous if that's what you're looking for here, it's a game about a deity that protects its tribe against the forces of nature as they trace their heritage across a harsh world.

It has fantastic atmosphere and it just looks and feels great. It is a story that is not directly put in words or told to you. It is an experience. A journey.\n\nYou act as a god of a tribe assisting them in their search for their ancestors. The gameplay is really interesting and is based entirely on modifying the terrain in various ways and it works really well. The gameplay revolves around grabbing materials and objects and moving them elsewhere. It sounds boring when described but it very satisfying in-game.\n\nThere are also tsunamis that cover the entire map, and spontaneous volcanoes to mess up your finely tuned plans. Sometimes the game gets seriously difficult. I remember trying to beat a few levels for several hours.\n\nThe graphics are stunning and it has good replayability. I've played the game through twice and it's really easy to pick up waste a few hours every once in a while. After you beat the game you unlock a sandbox mode where you can create your own small world.

Each level/map consists of completing a terrain puzzle to capture control points, which opens the "portal" to the next level. The terrain physics are fun, but this game is too easy and short for me to really enjoy it.\n\nThe puzzles are too simplistic. In each level you have only a small set of powers available to you (which can change from map to map) which you use to adjust the landscape of the level to complete your puzzle. In my first playthrough of the game, there was only one level I had to stop and think about how to solve. I was expecting more difficult puzzles from a god-mode game and more interesting maps.\n\nThe landscape is not as "pretty" as I would expect from a game focused completely on *the landscape,* so I was expecting the art in this to be a bit better. It's not bad...just not what I think it should be for a game all about the ground and things coming from it.\n\nI was deeply disappointed in the last level of the game.\n\n\n[[[[[[[[[[SPOILER]]]]]]]]]]\n\nThe very last level is all the level building tools now opened to you as "god" to build a world for your people. There is no challenge. You just throw some dirt down. How is that a good last level for any game like this?? There is no puzzle and no challenge here. Why did you "teach" me different ways of manipulating the lava, water, and rock mechanics and then not have some kind of ultimate challenge level that requires I use my knowledge gained from all the prior maps?\n\n[[[[[[[[[[/END SPOILER]]]]]]]]]]\n\n\nKind of a let down.

The only problems are Uplay and the length. I believe the problems with Uplay that meant that this game couldn't be launched have now been fixed (at least, I've never had any issues since I bought it), so that's something.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially a puzzle-based god game, where you control the elements earth, lava and water and are able to give basic directions to a handful of villagers in order to help your tribe survive. Levels generally focus on one or two problems building up - an incoming flood, or an impending volcanic eruption - and require you to take action to protect your village from the same.\n\nThe game is, though, far too short. It feels more like a tutorial campaign. What little is there is very nice, with great music and atmosphere. If in future the mechanic is expanded upon, that's something I'd definitely pick up. For now, this is a great game that's on sale often enough, and is definitely worth a shot when it's at about half the asking price.","January 31, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Either the avatar would move too much for delicate movements and then hardly at all for broad movements. This makes manipulating the environment exceptionally difficult, especially in areas with running water. Overall, great concept but poor implementation. 1.5/10\n(June 11th edit)\nI'd like to make a note here that I tried playing this game again, but only with a controller.

I've had some of my best moments introducing friends to game using this one. I dont know how the game is typically marketed but I say its a puzzle game, and you have to do a specific set of thing to get your tribe (or whatever) from one mission to another. After you beat a level you can go back to completed levels to mess around and I tend to have the most fun messing around.\nOn the otherhand the interface can be frustraingly difficult to work with (enough so that I've had people give up before getting past the 2nd level) and a lot of people wont have fun playing because of it. The AI of the units you have to control tends to leave them standing at cliffs and rocks that are difficult to cross waiting for the people to make them a path over them instead of walking around them on the simpler path and on some occasions they wont take a control point claiming there is an obstruction when they are standing right by it. The only game mode is the puzzle mode starting you off in increasingly more dire situations which can make play exhausting.\n\n","July 11, 2014","true","46.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Furthermore, it was not revealed until after the game was released that it would only run on a very limited number of GPUs.\n\nThis is a perfect example of what a company should not do to gain fans, especially among the somewhat picky PC crowd.

As you tame the wilderness, rivers will change paths, hills will erode, and the lava shapes new land. It's definitely fun to play with, and it's very rewarding to see a ruthless wasteland turn into a peaceful grove once you correctly divert the hazards.\n\nThis game's weak point is everything else (except the game's mythos; that's cool too). The story is way too short (beat it 100% in <3 hrs) and rather easy. With such cool tools to use, I really wanted more of the sandbox-type story levels, to really show off what I could do. Huge disappointment. There's a challenge mode, which I beat in about another 3 hours.\n\nI'd still recommend this game at $15, but be prepared for the short length.

I was hoping for something creative and sandboxy, but it ends up being extremely linear and you can only play with what they want you to play with.  There is no sandbox mode, just a somewhat frustrating story (Like when you get to the fire tree level) and challenges (which are only unlocked by playing the story mode.\n\nThe game looks terrible on PC..  Very limited graphics options and 30fps cap.  It doesn't seem to run very smooth for me either.  My biggest issue with From Dust are the controls.  It doesn't have the typical RTS type feel.  Your curser is very sluggish with all the objectives that require quick mousemovements, it is very frustrating to get your "breath" from point A to point B.  Also, you move both your curser and the entire screen with the WASD keys, while moving your mouse only gives you a small amount of room to play around before the entire screen moves.

It is not Populous (to which it has been compared to in various reviews) or Black & White or even Dungeon Keeper. And this is why people hate From Dust, they compare it to the wrong genre. Although you can't slap your people on the face, drown them intentionally or crush their homes and dreams (well, you can, but then it's game over) From Dust does have similarities to these titles. It has puny little humans and an omnipotent player that controls the surroundings and as such, indirectly also these puny little people. And it is beautiful and it has a physics engine unlike any other game. But in my view, From Dust is most reminicent of Lemmings: guide your people (the puny little humans) to safety via manipulation of the world around them. Raise the earth to create a bridge over water or drain a pond. And it is actually pretty cool. A bit repetitive in the long run perhaps, but a nice niche game.","October 2, 2011","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The aim is to help the tribespeople establish villages in each level with you playing as a godlike figure who can pick up and deposit earth, fire and water to help them. Its quite interesting because theres no traditional enemies but rather nature itself is the enemy with tsunamis and volcanoes etc making your progress difficult but you can also manipulate them to your advantage. Some levels are quite challenging without ever being punishing.\n\nGood points:\n- Interesting idea where you have to fight and manipulate nature itself to beat each level.\n- Theres also a challenge mode where you have can beat challenges in the fastest time possible.\n- The game has a nice look and feel to it and reminds me a lot of the Populous game.\n\nBad Points:\n- Requires Uplay\n- Gameplay gets a bit repetitive towards the end\n\nOverall this is a decent game might be worth picking up if you enjoy godlike or puzzle games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/micbemac/recommended/33460/","micbemac","micbemac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/micbemac/","146 products in account","From Dust brings the term sandbox game into a whole new meaning.  You are literally dropped into a giant side box.  A sandbox that you can control and manipulate in order to help your tribesmen find the promised land.  Developed by Ubisoft, and release in August of 2011.  From Dust gives you god like powers over the elements.\n\nThe premise here is simple.  With your various powers over the sand, wind, water and fire, guide your tribe from totem to totem in order to unlock a portal to the next zone.  Each level gradually introduces you to new powers and concepts.  The first few levels are pretty straight forward and act as tutorials to help you develop an understanding for the game's basic mechanics and controls.  You can literally take your godly hand and scoop up areas of terrain, or water, or even lava to mold and manipulate the land.\n\n\nAs you proceed farther into the game, these powers are used not only to lead your tribe forward, but also to protect them from the earth itself.  Whether it's fire, floods, giant waves or massive eruptions, you must continually alter the earth in order to keep your tribe safe.  This is where the interaction of the various powers comes to fruition.  Though sand can be piled up and prevent waves of water from flooding the area, the force of the water can eventually erode the sand away.  Combining lava and sand can create rock to solve this problem, but accidentally redirecting lava in the wrong direction can be even deadlier.\n\nThis balance of powers, and the addition of various power ups as well map unique quantities like hidden underground springs and other surprises keep you adapting often.  The maps often adapt as well.  Several levels in From Dust change part way through and throw new obstacles your way.  In a first play through these events create greater challenges as now your well planned out modifications to the world need to quickly be changed before your tribe is flooded, or burned alive.\n\n\nThe look and feel of the earth and it's elements is also just a lot of fun to play with.  Terraforming the earth with your various powers is intuitive and the elements react in fairly realistic way.  Water and lava combine into clouds of steam, cooling into ever growing mounds of rock.  Rivers slowly cut their way through sand at the lowest points creating rivers and peninsulas.  It's truly a wonder to just play in the sandbox that is From Dust just to see what will happen.\n\n\nThroughout all this, a charming story of the cycle of life unfolds.  From Dust is definitely a game you want to give a full play through of to gain the full experience.  The beautiful graphics and physics hold up today against more modern games.  The story, though a relatively simple one of life and death is told mostly visually as you proceed from level to level.  This is a great game, and a gem to try if you have a chance.","July 26, 2015","true","74.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like looking at a 640x480 game zoomed in to a 50'' screen, that's how bad it is, so it will be really noticeable if you look attently (fortunately you don't have to play a lot of time, it's short), that being said it's a straight up port from the consoles.\nThe game concept is really interesting, but it's really simple, for a god game if you have almost no power at all over the world. Basically controlling the "forces of nature" (lava/water/land) around your island, e.g. building natural barriers to block tsunamis/volcano eruptions, creating bridges to block rivers.\nIt has a simple campaign format where you play maps with an increased number of powers each, but there's not much of a change in between each, and almost no interest to move on.\nAfter a while it just gets old and tiring and the lack of good sandbox game features make it pretty stale, I'd say get it if you like the idea of the game, which is pretty much terraforming an island, but don't expect a sandbox game like black&white.","June 12, 2013","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Furthermore, it was not revealed until after the game was released that it would only run on a very limited number of GPUs.\n\nThis is a perfect example of what a company should not do to gain fans, especially among the somewhat picky PC crowd.

The nature effects, such as the crashing of waves on the shore, flow of water down a natural river, and flowing lava are amazing. The story mode is challenging and requires you to spend extra time on the map to fully unlock all the story/challenge 'memories'. Sadly, this suffers from bad console port syndrome, as there are some graphical anomolies, sound weirdness, cutscenes abruptly ending, and some control weirdness. The game is still very playable and lots of fun. I would've liked to see a sandbox mode, where you can start with a blank slate and just start building your own land mass and/or make your own maps to challenge friends. Definitely worth the price point. I estimate the game story mode takes about 4-5 hours to complete.","August 21, 2011","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A simulator where you can manipulate terrains on a whim? Groundbreaking! But despite its enormous potential, this title ends up offering too little.\n\nFrom Dust is no more a simulator than it is a puzzle. In its (short) story mode, you are tasked with occupying totems scattered throughout several islands. Your opposition comes from the destructive forces of storms, tsunamis, and magma. Against these, you must utilize your godlike abilities to construct a safe haven.\n\nOutside the campaign are dozens of challenge maps. Here, you are given a limited set of abilities with which you'll use to accomplish an objective, be it migrating tribes or saving them from extinction.\n\nOnce the campaign and challenges are completed, that's it. There is little to no reason to replay this game unless you really enjoyed it.

The main story tries to fit in between levels and in bits that aren't shown as you play. The gameplay is amazing with water/lava/sand physics to make you ♥♥♥ that are just flawless. Really strategic the more you play and the power ups are never explained more past just what they're called and you have to figure out what some do by using them which is fine. You have no real enemies except the elements, but the villagers are a pain in what they accept as a path to walk on and a small amount of water can stop a village to be built. Lava never wants to build as much as it should and seems to just flatten what you put it on. Natural disasters are mainly just annoying but if left unchecked will destroy you. Sandbox mode is fine but you'll just put things to the extreme, big pile of sand or big lava spawning, and not really use it after that.

Instead of leading a civilization into expansion, you're instead trying to guide them through the world, "fighting" against the forces of nature themselves.\n\nTech-wise, the game looks gorgeous, and more importantly has this fantastic physics system in which fluid and dust settle realistically. This is important, because those are what you'll manipulate most of the time, be it to open a path, to let forest spread, to stop fires, whatever is needed. It's an experience unlike any other game out there.\n\nHowever, as much as I like it, I have to say that it's best to pick up the console versions. For a very simple reason, the PC one brings the uPlay DRM, a highly incompetent piece of software developed by Ubi that has a 50/50 chance of denying you the game you just bought. Myself, I had to spend just under an hour tinkering and watching "update" bars fill up before the game worked. Even if it was worth the trouble in the end, this sort of abuse with your honest customers is simply ridiculous.\n\nIf you do want to pick it up on PC anyways, good luck, and have a pad ready. K&M controls here are a love-or-hate thing, and you might want to try both out to see which suits you better.","January 13, 2014","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every level is creative and interesting and I never felt like I was just repeating the level before it. This game gets top marks for game design.\n\nFurthermore, the presentation is top notch. The water and lava flow beautifully and everything is tied together nicely with a distinct visual style.\n\nCON:\nThe problem with this game mainly comes from the fact that it was designed for consoles and poorly adapted for PCs. The mouse vertical/horizontal axes control a little pointer that tracks the terrain rather than the screen, making it needlessly difficult to click things on uneven ground.\n\nThe game is also filled with unskippable cutscenes. Between levels you repeatedly watch the same cutscene. The scene is only about 60 second longs, but it's still annoying. Also, periodically in a level the game takes control of your camera to slowly pan around the new objective, even if you've played that level before and already seen the cutscene. It breaks the flow of the game and, worse yet, the world doesn't pause for the cutscene. I've lost villages while my camera was seized from me. It's not the end of the world, but it's a ridiculous thing for a game studio to overlook.\n\nThis combined with the mouse issue leaves me sorely disappointed in Ubisoft's user interface design. Do they have a QA department?\n\nThere's also no real story to speak of. You just follow a tribe around different levels. The lack of story doesn't seriously detract from the game, but a quality story or just some kind of world building would have certainly added to it.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThat said, the game is still engaging and unique. It's short*, but that's just because it's all quality content that they didn't pointlessly recycle (unlike 90% of all other games out there). If you really want more after the "story", there are challenge maps.\n\nYou've probably never played a game like this before. It's worth it on that basis alone. Better still, it's actually quite engaging. This is the best game I've played from Ubisoft that I can remember.\n\n* I consider short a pro, since I don't have 100 hours to blow grinding. But I understand that other people feel differently. If you like long games, don't let this game being short dissuade you.","February 7, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, by making a new path over a river by dropping sand. Throughout the game, you get to help these "citizens"... (or whatever you wanna call it) ...to build villages. But in order for them to survive, you need to control and keep an eye on the nature, so they won't get killed by, for example, a flood.\n\nAs you move on in the game, you get to control more and more elements of the nature, as the missions allso gets even harder.\n\nIn the long run, this game is awesome!

The story is basic (and not the focus of the game) and there are no real characters besides your virtually identical-looking natives and the only narrative is that which you hear at the begining of each stage. However the voice-over does stand out as it is spoken in a Bahasa Indonesian language that is neat to listen to and don't worry, there are subtitles in English.\nThe real fun comes from the gameplay where you gather up sand, lava, water and more in an effort to keep your people alive and help them to build and maintain their villages in ridiculously dangerous environments such as within the crater of an active volcano, hot damn! These scenarios can defintely be challenging as you will be forced to stop and think in order to plan the best course of terrain alteration or disaster will befall your villagers and you'll be forced to re-examine your strategy or even re-start the stage.\nI also have to point out the level of realism attached to the various elements in that lava flows like you'd expect, water from tsunamis flows down from elevated portions of the land to pool in recesses, etc. Thanks to this you'll really feel like you're crafting a believable world and perhaps even learn to appreciate how difficult it must be for certain people (both past and present) to struggle against the elements.\n\n8/10","December 3, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise I suggest getting the game somewhere other than steam. Thankfully I got mine on sale and the money wasn't wasted for someone like me who doesn't have a home console and only PC.

It's kinda being some sort of god helping out its people. I would totally recommend this game for 10 USD, get advantage of the black friday deals and get it, its a must play exprience. You are what is called "THe Breath" and you are supposed to change the shape of the world and manipulate it in order to help some people to survive, cool.\n\nGraphics: From Dust has very good graphics for the type of game it is, its pretty decent and is attractive to the eyes, never to say is a 2011 game.\nGampeplay: I'd probably recommend getting this game for consoles, be it XOne or PS4, because its easier to play with a controller, you could also get a game controller for PC and use it, its kinda tricky to play with mouse and keyboard, nevertheless the left and right click mechanic work very well.\nPlot: I'm still playing the game, but the game has some actual story regarding nature, its not a tolkien novel, but its good.\nSound: It's awesome! I really like the way they handled the sound,  the way you pick up and drop stuff is made easier with the help of sounds indicating you how filled or empty your grab is.\nSpecial: It's a one of a kind game, you cannot find this experience in any other game, so GET IT.\nValue: 5/5 it's totally your money's worth, go ahead and grab it, very well spent 10 bucks.\n\nUPlay: Yeah you have to use UPlay to play this game, but its an easy process.\n\nOverall this game is 4/5","November 28, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every level is creative and interesting and I never felt like I was just repeating the level before it. This game gets top marks for game design.\n\nFurthermore, the presentation is top notch. The water and lava flow beautifully and everything is tied together nicely with a distinct visual style.\n\nCON:\nThe problem with this game mainly comes from the fact that it was designed for consoles and poorly adapted for PCs. The mouse vertical/horizontal axes control a little pointer that tracks the terrain rather than the screen, making it needlessly difficult to click things on uneven ground.\n\nThe game is also filled with unskippable cutscenes. Between levels you repeatedly watch the same cutscene. The scene is only about 60 second longs, but it's still annoying. Also, periodically in a level the game takes control of your camera to slowly pan around the new objective, even if you've played that level before and already seen the cutscene. It breaks the flow of the game and, worse yet, the world doesn't pause for the cutscene. I've lost villages while my camera was seized from me. It's not the end of the world, but it's a ridiculous thing for a game studio to overlook.\n\nThis combined with the mouse issue leaves me sorely disappointed in Ubisoft's user interface design. Do they have a QA department?\n\nThere's also no real story to speak of. You just follow a tribe around different levels. The lack of story doesn't seriously detract from the game, but a quality story or just some kind of world building would have certainly added to it.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThat said, the game is still engaging and unique. It's short*, but that's just because it's all quality content that they didn't pointlessly recycle (unlike 90% of all other games out there). If you really want more after the "story", there are challenge maps.\n\nYou've probably never played a game like this before. It's worth it on that basis alone. Better still, it's actually quite engaging. This is the best game I've played from Ubisoft that I can remember.\n\n* I consider short a pro, since I don't have 100 hours to blow grinding. But I understand that other people feel differently. If you like long games, don't let this game being short dissuade you.","February 7, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only problems are Uplay and the length. I believe the problems with Uplay that meant that this game couldn't be launched have now been fixed (at least, I've never had any issues since I bought it), so that's something.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially a puzzle-based god game, where you control the elements earth, lava and water and are able to give basic directions to a handful of villagers in order to help your tribe survive. Levels generally focus on one or two problems building up - an incoming flood, or an impending volcanic eruption - and require you to take action to protect your village from the same.\n\nThe game is, though, far too short. It feels more like a tutorial campaign. What little is there is very nice, with great music and atmosphere. If in future the mechanic is expanded upon, that's something I'd definitely pick up. For now, this is a great game that's on sale often enough, and is definitely worth a shot when it's at about half the asking price.","January 31, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It skirts the line of being a tech demo instead of a full game though. There's only one, fairly long and unskippable, cutscene after every stage. I would have liked to see at least twice the number of story missions, some variety in people, and a mind bender or two for the puzzles.\n\nOverall, good buy when its on sale, not so much for full price. There's little story, limited variety, and irritating controls at times. On the other hand, it's absolutely beautiful and fluid dynamics play very well into eachother.

Instead of leading a civilization into expansion, you're instead trying to guide them through the world, "fighting" against the forces of nature themselves.\n\nTech-wise, the game looks gorgeous, and more importantly has this fantastic physics system in which fluid and dust settle realistically. This is important, because those are what you'll manipulate most of the time, be it to open a path, to let forest spread, to stop fires, whatever is needed. It's an experience unlike any other game out there.\n\nHowever, as much as I like it, I have to say that it's best to pick up the console versions. For a very simple reason, the PC one brings the uPlay DRM, a highly incompetent piece of software developed by Ubi that has a 50/50 chance of denying you the game you just bought. Myself, I had to spend just under an hour tinkering and watching "update" bars fill up before the game worked. Even if it was worth the trouble in the end, this sort of abuse with your honest customers is simply ridiculous.\n\nIf you do want to pick it up on PC anyways, good luck, and have a pad ready. K&M controls here are a love-or-hate thing, and you might want to try both out to see which suits you better.","January 13, 2014","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically zero control over the citizens, but instead you control the elements.  Not an RTS like Populous, but different and interesting.\n\nUnfortunately it forces you to make an account and I think you always need to connect to play it (screw you, Ubisoft!), but just make a junk account and play it.  Worth the trouble IMO.","November 5, 2012","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
