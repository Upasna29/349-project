For all of the love arcade style games like Xortex and Space Pirate Trainer have gotten, I cannot believe that A-10 isn't more popular. A-10 is a great shooter that isn't quite like any of the other VRcade games I've played thus far, yet still very intuitive and comfortable. Given the super low price point for a very replayable game, I would say everyone should pick it up, play it with their friends, and start battling for the highest score.","April 7","true","1.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The weapons are simple but with a great feeling of power. One is a one hit instagib type railgun, the other is a slower full auto plasma gun.\n\nThe way to get high scores is by not missing so put the railgun in your dominant hand and when you have time line up your shots for maximum combo scores. When things get out of hand (and they do, oh boy they do) spray and pray with the plasma gun.\n\nIts a simple game with no story and very little depth, but for the same price as a pint this is amazing value for money. Well done dev for putting a realistic price on your title. And well done for making something that is polished and perfectly playable.\n\n9/10","April 12","true","2.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Jebooman might be a better shooter but there is more of a learning curve there.\nA-10 is very intuitive and the learning curve is purely in aiming skills.\nFor the price, it is definetly the first shooter to purchase.\nAlso, it is one of few "games", rather than demos, that is ideal to show VR to curious friends and family.","April 28","true","1.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

My VR library is at nearly 50 titles now and I have to say that this is easily in the top 10% of what I play. It is very simple to play making it easy for newcomers to VR to enjoy. There's no real "movement" going on, so it is very unlikely to make anyone feel queasy.\n\nThe only downside is that it is "the thing you do" forever. It will get harder, sure, but you'll be doing the exact same thing - shooting flying targets. Still, between guests and my roommate and so forth, I've gotten my money's worth several times over.\n\nOverall, if you like Space Pirate Trainer, then you should probably buy this game as it's somewhat like it. And if you didn't like Space Pirate Trainer, then you may still want to give this game a look as it won't have you dodging and ducking as much as SPT.","May 28","true","130.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
