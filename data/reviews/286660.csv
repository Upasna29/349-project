It's a simple premise, and Avoid: Sensory Overload really isn't breaking any new ground. But what begins as a rather mediocre addition to the pile of retro-inspired games available on Steam quite rapidly develops into one of the toughest games in your library, and what's more, it's addictive. At advanced levels, the game's pace is breakneck, and the course is littered with pitfalls and obstacles. Leagues harder than comparable titles like Audiosurf, Avoid: Sensory Overload is a no B.S. test of skill and reaction time. Your average gamer probably won't make it through the Medium levels, and most of us probably won't make it through the Hard levels. Even if you're the kind of Ulillillia tier savant it takes to make it through Extreme difficulty, you can pile on a fresh challenge by playing the Endless mode for a randomly-generated infinite run. At the fair price of $5, Avoid: Sensory Overload scratches the itch for a simple game at both extremes: It's fun enough to pick up and play for a quick session, and difficult enough to provide a challenge in the long term.","January 4, 2015","true","2.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

The easy levels are very completable, and the game is quite fun.  It is definitely comparable to Super Hexagon(or the Impossible Game, etc) in terms of difficulty once you are finished with easy.  The difficulty curve gets steep and fast.  But at least until you get up to hard and extreme it's not unreasonably hard, just very unforgiving.\n\nI also warn against long play sittings: the visuals can induce nausea if you are sensitive to strobe lights and flashing colours.\n\nThe music is electronic/trance/synth, so if you dislike that music style, I'd avoid this game.  But it is good music, but I will note that in playing the levels, the music gets incredibly repetitive quickly when it's the same 60 seconds of music for 8 levels(or more if you have to go through a level multiple times).\n\nI definitely recommend the game if it's on sale(as I purchased it).  It's a pretty cheap game, and good future fun if you like to climb the scoreboads and replay the endless levels.","December 28, 2014","true","4.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Well, here we are a few dozen hours later and I guess I have to revise that.  New review: this game is one of the most intense experiences I've had on Steam.  While it can be frustrating at times, the game is very "fair" and levels that seem to require inhuman speed actually just require incredible timing.  The game is less about hitting buttons fast and more about figuring out a plan and executing it at the proper time.  And trying not to have your brain melt after 10+ hour sessions when your eyes are bleeding and you can't remember your own name anymore.

Stay in school, kids.\n\n\nActual Review:\n\nThe Music  can  wear on you.\n\n\nThere are 4 different Tracks to progress down, each with their own visual and musical themes.\nEach of those Tracks has 4 different Tiers (difficulties), each with 8 Levels;\nEach subsequent Level in a Tier adds to how far through the musical track you get through -\nEach Level within the Tiers is different from the last, though they appear to be static (i.e. you can memorize the layout).\n\nThe different Tiers within the same Track have different Music to accompany them.\n\n\nTracks:\n===Electronic: The advertised image is the Electronic track; the cylinder you're shooting through appears to surround a visualizer, reacting to the Music. Avoid sets of Orbs bouncing between two points.\n===Minimal: The obstacles pulse to the Music. Avoid Rival Ships that fly down the Track with you.\n===Laserdance: A pulsating corona within the center of the Track responds to the Music. The obstacles are the same color as the collectibles. Therefore, the only thing to (")avoid(") is Sliding Platforms.\n===Synthrock: Another pulsating corona (though to a lesser extent). The Tracks are much more, er, angular (diagonally inclined). Avoid Spike Traps.\n\nMind that these summaries are only from the first (and sometimes second) Tiers; I've no doubt that with each subsequent Tier, more obstacles and features will be implemented.\n\n\nYou can customize the color scheme of your ship.\n\nYou can play with keyboard, controller and even the mouse - the only controls are "Move Left; Move Right."\nKeyboard, of course, offers better responsiveness.\nMouse seems to allow your ship to move slightly faster, at the loss of some precision.\nHave yet to try controller.\n\nThere are different (")power-ups(") to collect, such as a Shield that allows you to survive one collision, a "Drop" that lowers all obstacles in your line of sight, a [unknown] that fills the gaps in your path for a(n extremely) short period of time. These power-ups are Track specific.\n\nWhen selecting a Track, there is a "?" - Click it to see all of the Track specific obstacles/power-ups/etc.\n\n\nIf you wish to chill while being stressed: Avoid Sensory Overload.\nThe overall feel of the game is the most relaxing (rave-induced) trip you'll ever experience; the (")checkpoints(") - which aren't really, as any time you crash, you'll respawn a little ways before then, invincible for a few moments - are points at which the speed of things is increased. Break out in a stress-induced sweat while calm. How strange.\n\nI was torn between this and Race the Sun.\nI don't regret my decision.\n(I got Race the Sun in a Bundle soon after; it is amazing too, in its own right - hardly comparable to Avoid, except in that you're flying down a track.)\n\n*EDIT*: Were it not for the (almost) assaulting visuals, I would argue that this game should've been called "Muscle Memory Trainer." It claims reflexes are necessary; I claimed "you can memorize the layout [of the tracks]."\nFalse; your first several runs will be to get a feel for the tracks; your golden runs will be to put that muscle memory (which I guess could be called "reflexes," at first) to use.\nThis is not necessarily a criticism, I will keep coming back to the game when I'm pondering what other game to play.\nJust. Fair warning.\nMuscle Memory Trainer WHILE Avoid(ing) Sensory Overload.\n\nAlso: There is an Endless Mode on each of the Tracks with different difficulty levels; Leaderboards. I'm fairly certain that the Endless Mode is randomly generated; it is here that reflexes are actually necessary, *nodnod*.\nAlso: I think the music is not necessarily bound to a certain Level/Track/whatever; it might be random what music plays when. Maybe.","December 30, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You're speeding forwards at an ever-increasing rate, and you control your little ship and steer it around to collect score multipliers and powerups while avoiding walls and holes in the track.\n\nAccessibility: The easiest mode is very accessible to casual players, while the harder modes require lightning reflexes. There are a lot of flashing lights, so if you're sensitive to that then you might not want to pick it up. The controls are keyboard or gamepad, which is a bit of a shame as I'd love to play this with the mouse. They are rebindable though.\n\nGame modes: There are fixed levels, where you replay them to try and get perfect runs, but to me the real appeal of the game is the randomly-generated Endless Mode. Naturally for a game like this, there are leaderboards for all difficulty levels. There are also currently 3 "themes" as the devs put it, which play slightly differently and have different aesthetics.\n\nGraphics/Sound: The visuals are bright, bold, and striking. It's also got a lovely electronic soundtrack.\n\nPrice: It's 4.99 right now, and it's got trading cards that are fairly high-valued at the moment if that makes a difference to you.\n\nAll in all, a really nice little indie game that I think deserves a bit more exposure.","April 17, 2014","true","8.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You move a "ship" around the screen, trying to avoid obstacles (usually blocks or pits, a few moving parts).\n\nAround you is a neon lighted strobing light tunnel and the course itself is only a few meters visible, building itself as you race along.\n\n\nWhat makes the game so interesting is the way the music meshes with the gameplay, the way you can, or rather must, lose yourself until there is nothing but the moving ship and the gradually appearing course.\nYou don't have to think about what you do, you just have to DO it. If you start to plan ahead, you'll likely to crash into a block.\n\nMinimal as the gameplay is, it has a soothing effect - you have to be calm to get good reactions, after all.\n\nThe controls react instantly, and there is no need to familiarize yourself with the way the game is handled. You might need a few tries to get a feeling for how the "ship" reacts, but it doesn't seem to have any personality at all - you push the left key, it goes left. No delay, no sliding. Ideally it'll be as if it reacts to your thoughts.\n\n\nMy only regret is that the music restarts when you die in endless mode. Since I die often, it means I don't get to hear the rest of it.\n\n\nI'm not entirely sure how much I think this game is worth. I bought it for 1.25 Euro, and I certainly don't regret spending that money.\nWould I have paid more? Might be. I don't know how much I'll end up playing it, but even if I didn't play it any more, I'd consider it money well spent.\n\nUnfortunately there is no demo version available for the PC, which IMO would be a good idea, since you can only experience the game by playing it - viewing a video dosn't tell you halfway enough.","May 17, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Controlling a small racing hovercraft ship thingy, you fly into the screen on a series of obstacle-course-like tracks, which become faster and more evil as you progress.\n\nThe game has four level 'styles': Electronic, Minimal, Laserdance and Sythrock. As you may have guessed from the names, each of these level styles has its own musical style to go with it. Each is also unique in terms of graphical and obstacle style, too. For example, Electronic sees you speeding across bright, colourful stages to electronic music, dodging occasional glowing orbs, whereas Minimal levels have a march darker and minimalist theme (and are, I find, the most distracting, graphically speaking).\n\nAfter choosing a level style you are then able to choose from defined levels or 'endless' mode, which sees you endlessly racing across a randomly generated track in your chosen style until you crash or fall off the track. If you choose the levels option, then you'll find that your chosen level style has four difficulty groups of eight individual levels each, ranging from Easy, through Medium, Hard and Extreme. These are pre-defined tracks, each of which always plays the same, so beating the levels is a matter of skill and memory, especially as you progress through the harder stages.\n\nPlaying through the pre-defined levels, you are graded on how well you do collecting bonuses and not dying. Each track gives you two extra lives to begin with, so you can crash or fall off the track twice; on the third such event, you lose the level and must start again.\n\nAt this point I have completed all 32 Easy levels with full points (collecting all bonuses and not crashing or falling off the track) and all 32 Medium levels with varying degrees of success. I now find the difficulty is about at my limit: I've only completed two or three Hard levels, and only one of them with full points. I now usually find myself playing a level or two and rage quitting.\n\nThe controls are very simple -- just move left or right -- but they feel a bit slow. And when you're on the edges of the track, especially, it can be hard to gauge where your ship thingy is; I've crashed or fallen off the track numerous times when I thought I was correctly in position. I think a higher and further-back camera angle would have been a better choice for the game.\n\nGraphics are simple, but do the job. Music is pretty good; I think I even recognised an instrumental version of a popular song or two in there, but I may have been mistaken.\n\nSo, do i recommend this game? Yes, if you can pick it up on sale or in a bundle for the right price. It should keep you entertained for a couple of hours, at least.\n","March 26, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But I did find myself getting an almost high off the colors and movement, so if you're susceptable to such things, don't play for long periods. Otherwise, great game! The colors are the nice, the music is a nice mellow tone that goes well with the in-game environment. It's a bit of an irritant at times, but not so much that I regret buying it.","November 28, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With this set up it just becomes repetitive failure while you learn where to be, zero skill required. Tie movement into movement of the mouse then it becomes a game of skill.

I've easily hit 20+ since I bought it. I have gotten more than my money's worth for this title.\n\nI think how much you're into the 'navigate obstacles at high speeds' genre will largely determine whether you'll find this game worth your time and money. It's far from the best on offer, but it's solid in most respects and can make for many hours of weirld relaxing-yet-hectic fun provided you're willing to look over some issues.\n\nFirstly, the difficulty. It's unbalanced, and quite noticably so. These are the 4 difficulty settings, with what they actually feel like:\n\nEasy = Very Easy\nMedium = Very Hard\nHard = Extreme\nExtreme = Muscle Memory Master from Hell\n\nYou will have quite a difficult time navigating the narrow pathways of the harder settings while also managing to avoid projectiles, gather multipliers and avoiding dying. It is a mess, in an overall good way.  It's well conceived, but doesn't have enough middle ground in terms of difficulty for more casual players. It'll either put you to sleep or make you want to punch your monitor. Not much in between.\n\nGameplay is your standard stuff. Avoid walls and holes while grabbing multipliers which increase the rate at which your score counts up per amount of time, along with powerups of various kinds which are level-dependant. nothing new or exciting, but still solid and fun for short spans of time.\n\nControls are solid and seem to fit the level design as they should. At no point have I felt a death was unfair due to shoddy controls. It's tight and handles well, to an extent that all the dying you'll be doing (a lot), madding as it is, is not likely to feel overtly cheap.\n\nAesthetic is kinda basic with no surprises. Strictly 'arcade' with a few different techno Tron-inspired layouts and color schemes, with a lightshow in the background which keeps a beat to the music.  Nothing spectacular, but I can't complain.\n\nMusic is hit and miss. Each difficulty setting per layout has it's own track, with some having two tracks each which alternate. I found about 65% of the music to range from boring to annoying as hell, while the other 35% was decent and kinda catch and enjoyable. YMMV on this. Rather standard techo/electronica with scarce variety. Not in my opinion noteworthy.\n\n\nOverall I would fully recommend this game when it's on sale to people who already at least somewhat like the genre. They won't be disappointed in having another game for their collection to load up here and there for some casual fun. Nothing new here really, but nothing really bad either. You'll likely come away satisfied for at least a good 6-8 hours spread out over a few weeks.","February 13","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
