Throughout the game, you lead a squad (sometimes 2) of Blood Angel Terminators through a space hulk, which seems to be a ton of spaceships that have fused together in ridiculous ways.  You're given a different objectve in every mission and as you attempt to fulfill it, Tyranid Genestealers spawn from multiple spawn points in an attempt to overwhelm your squad. In order to complete your mission, you have to take and hold positions against the Genestealers and accomplish the objective, quietly hoping you never have to assault through them.\n\nAt the beginning of each mission, you're given somewhere between 2-12 Terminators, each with their own equipment and abilities, and an objective to fulfill.  Each Terminator gets 4 action points at the start of a turn, and the whole squad shares a pool of 1-6 extra points called "Command Points", which allows Terminators to perform actions outside of their allotted 4 points.  You'll move your Terminators through the narrow corridors, carefully stacking them in formation, always being wary of lines of sight and lanes of approach to reach whatever your objective maybe.\n\nThis is a game about positioning, planning, and risk management.  With the exception of a couple of missions, you'll never be able to kill all the genestealers, they simply keep coming and coming until you accomplish your objective and/or all of your troops are dead.  So, you have to establish a good defensive position, preferably with long lines of sight.  Overwatch is the most powerful ability in the game, and one that allows you to shoot at all approaching enemies as long as your bolter doesn't jam (On each shot, you roll two dice, and any time you roll doubles your bolter jams).  This allows you to dominate corridors, though a Genestealer can still slip past if your roll low enough consistently. Sometimes, the most tempting positions are ones that are only a few squares long, and you have to decide if the risk of only having a few squares to shoot at is worth sparing only one Terminator for that position.  If the overwatch fails, you could find yourself overrun.  Or, you can use 2 Terminators to guard 2 longer corridors, removing one from use in another portion of the map.\n\nIt's a fun game, and the dependence on luck makes it incredibly tense.  Granted, you can mitigate risk, but you'll never be able to remove it completely.  My understanding of the game is that its relsease was filled with all sort of weird glitches and problems, but I haven't encountered a single one yet. I haven't had a chance to try mutliplayer yet, so I can't comment on that.\n\nIf you're a fan of careful, deliberate, tense strategy, I highly recommend this.  I'm nearly done with the main campaign and enjoyed every minute of it, and I'm looking forward to moving on to the DLC.\n\nWhat I paid for it: 10 dollars\nWhat I would pay for it: 25 dollars.\n\nFor context, I know very little about WH40K and didn't even know the board game existed until playing this.  All of the above impressions were based on playing on Normal.","January 4, 2014","true","12.0"," 248 of 265 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","248","265","0","10"

This is, quite literally, a digital version of the classic board-game of the same name, which was made by the lovely chaps at Games Workshop ages ago. What does that mean for you?\n\n- It means NO customization. Units come equipped "as is". That's it.\n\n- "Slower" gameplay (Tactical Dreadnaught Armour is heavy). Game speed can be adjusted to make it play faster, however.\n\n-  An emphasis on what limited resource actions you have, and doing what you can with them. Thus adding to the general "survival" aspect of the game, which is very fun actually.\n\n- Unlike Xcom, this is a straight up, old-school ranged (marines) VS. melee (aliens) fight. You CAN go into melee and hope the Emperor grants you favor in such dire situations. However, your xenos enemies are masters of close combat and generally win the trade off, even against your own melee specialists. But again, it's quite fun to try and succeed at it.\n\n- No health bars. You either survive an attack, or you don't. This makes games faster and more direct, which is a good thing since health bars would make each game last longer than it should.\n\n- Unlike Xcom, you have very limited combat actions. No elevation bonus, can't climb ladders, etc.. Just you, the flat surface, and the xenos filth before you. Fire away and hope it works!\n\nAll of this makes Space Hulk a very good game actually, just for different reasons. However, people jumping into this title thinking it's another Xcom clone will become sad pandas very quickly. This is NOT even close to Xcom's depth.\n\nHowever once more, people who want a "simpler" turn based game LIKE Xcom that they can just hop into, without all the freaking variables and near-endless, headache-inducing customization and combat will indeed enjoy this title. Always remember that this is essentially a digital version of the board game, and not much more at all. Simple as that. But it is beautiful in its simplicity, as you'll soon find.\n\n\nHonestly? A solid title. Full Control set out to make a PC version of the board game point-for-point, and succeeded near flawlessly. It's not Xcom, but it wasn't trying to be anyway. It's just itself. And that is indeed good enough. Maybe not for everyone, but then again Xcom isn't for everyone either.\n\n\nIf you wish for a more Xcom-like version of this title, Space Hulk: Ascension is more like what we all kinda hoped for in the first place, and is currently available through Steam as well. However, it currently lacks multi-player.\n\n\nOverall: 4/5. Better graphics/models and voice acting would have been great for this little gem, but I'm not complaining.\n\n\n-Thanks for reading and I hope it helped you with your decision. :3\n\n\n~Mystyx~","February 10, 2015","true","41.4"," 127 of 130 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","127","130","0","0"

It's dice-based. It's a bit rough around the edges. And it's a very tactical game.

This game is a recreation of the original board game, including all of the messy dice rolls. Genestealers are very, very powerful. Your bolter jams when you don't want it to. Close combat is probably going to kill you. If you're expecting real-time combat with refined battle mechanics, you won't find it here. This is the pure tabletop experience.\n\nThe game is a little rough around the edges in places.

This IS Space Hulk, if you played the board game years ago you will ADORE this game, it's a massive dose of nostalgia in modern format where the termies even fall over like you toppled the piece and the fact you can jam 3 times in a row, then get mauled to death even though you have a lightning claw is both perfectly feasible and horribly likely at the critical moment. That's honestly what MADE the original board game, and this has been kept as true to canon as possibly COULD be in a video game release.\n\nThis is a title for all of you out there who had the board game and lost it, just want to play long distance with a friend (co-op now included btw, awesomesauce) or who those of you who have the board game already, 200,000 points of army for your favourite chapter and just about every game ever released with the 40K banner on it. Fanboys will want this, just because.\n\nHowever, I also feel a whole new generation of gamers out there, especially those of you who already dig the indie vibe and don't expect AAA UIs as long as the game itself plays well, are also in for a treat. This game, back in the day *points at apartment block and mutters something about fields* pretty much defined a generation of gamers, and we're the ones making the games you play now, so give a moment of your time and you will likely be pleasantly surprised by the tension, frustration and pure gaming experience this title has to offer.\n\nThe game is limited, yes. Of course it is, because it IS a board game. To call this a legitimate criticism would be like saying an online game of monopoly should have more realistic money and offer experience upgrades to your character so as to improve your chances of landing on certain tiles....that wouldn't be monopoly then, would it, and complaints would arise I have no doubt. Don't expect a video game reimagining of a board game, if you want that then go for Space Hulk - Ascension instead, there you will find a PC game retelling of an old classic. If you like to immerse yourself in the classics themselves, then buy this game.","October 16, 2014","true","1.8"," 94 of 103 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","94","103","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedarkchaplain/recommended/242570/","thedarkchaplain","DarkChaplain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedarkchaplain/","2659 products in account","A pure adaption of the boardgame classic, Space Hulk comes with all you may be used to playing with on the tabletop, with none of the setup troubles, boxing the tiles and pieces after a long and tense session. It comes with an online multiplayer mode, which allows you to take the missions to the internet and test your wit against friends too far away to come over to sit around the table with you!\n\nFull Control Studios are, without a doubt, fans of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and Space Hulk in particular. Despite the bumpy launch the game had, their dedication to the project shows.\n\nSpace Hulk is a turn-based strategy game involving two factions - the Space Marine Terminators and the alien Genestealers.\nBoth sides play vastly differently - from the amount of actions a unit can take per turn, to how it achieves its goals.\nThe Terminators are slow, hulking figures who rely on ranged weaponry, area denial and re-rolls to fight the Xenos, while the Genestealers are numerous, fast and require to close the distance to attack a Marine with their diamond-claws. They can easily outmaneuver the opponent, and receive reinforcements every turn.\n\nTo make things worse, the number of dice a normal Marine rolls against the 'stealers, is limited to one, against the aliens' three, and the highest result wins the combat - and kills the enemy. There are no life points in this game - if a character gets wounded, he is considered dead for the rest of the game.\n\nTo balance this out, the Space Marine player receives 1 to 6 Command Points per turn, determined by (virtual) dice. Those can be used to enact additional actions beyond the 4 allowed action points of a Terminator. Even though limited and unreliable, these points, if used well, will offer a lot of tactical flexibility to the player.\n\nThe inherent strength of the Terminators lies in their weaponry - their Storm Bolters are deadly and their close combat specialists allow them to deny the Genestealers the highest of their rolls or to re-roll one of their own. The flamer can bathe a whole room or section in fire, easily burning the aliens to ashes if stepped in, denying whole parts of the map. However, its use is limited to 6 shots per mission! The assault cannon is equally limited to 20 shots, and acts like a much stronger Storm Bolter.\nOverwatch, costing 2 action points, will ensure that your Marines will also shoot on any enemy that crosses into line of sight, or moves within it, giving you an advantage over the enemy's fast tactics.\n\nThe objectives are determined by the mission. They may range from simple kill count goals to evacuating a certain amount of squad members. All the main missions are adapted from the boardgame.\n\n\nYes, Space Hulk had its share of problems at launch, and probably still has some of them, but more than a few can be attributed to just how close this video game adaption is to the boardgame it was meant to represent.\nBugs and performance issues have been significantly reduced by now, the game runs smooth, and a new, albeit short, campaign has been added to the game for free.\n\nA criticism that was brought up a lot at launch was the "sluggish" movement of the player's Terminators.\nWhile personally I very much enjoyed the hulking Space Marines move through the corridors like that, I can understand that not everybody has the same attention span and some may like to move on more quickly (although, once an order is issued, you can move ahead and issue another to the next Terminator of your choosing - they will enact them simultaneously).\nSince then the developers have introduced a new setting to the options menu, allowing the player to toggle the animation speed, resulting in a good boost in unit movements.\n\nAnother criticism leveled was the lack of satisfying squad customization - one I can understand, but not feel quite as strongly about.\nThe characters in the game are directly inspired by the 3rd edition boardgame set, released in 2009, which I own. Having invested a lot of time in painting the miniatures of Sergeants Gideon and Lorenzo, Brothers Claudio, Zael, Omnio and all the rest, I can attest that the ingame models are very much like those little plastic figures. They are so faithfully modeled, I felt a bit sad that the boardgame miniatures are stuck with static (though dynamic) poses.\n\nCustomizing a squad's loadout also would not work with the way the missions are written. The game presents you with a short mission context and your objectives, all presented via Terminator-like voice acting (though not of the high standard of Relic's Dawn of War II games, it is still suitably grim), a neatly animated map and iconography.\n\nWhat new players may not realize, however, is that the missions, have been written with certain restrictions and loadouts in mind. There are no differences between individual Terminators apart from their equipment - changing any one of the Power Fist + Storm Bolter Terminators to another Flamer, an Assault Cannon or close combat gear would undoubtedly unbalance the missions and remove a big part of the challenge.\n\nSpace Hulk is a challenging game. Some people, myself included, would even go as far as to call it a strategic puzzle game. Knowing your pieces is vital to success, being aware of all entry points of the enemy's Genestealers is crucial. A wrong move can easily unravel your whole deployment, and turn your structured progress into a desperate run for the exit.\n\nThe randomness of the dice adds a layer of unpredictability, but similar to Blood Bowl, minimizing the risks of the dice and thinking your moves through is the key to success. A dice roll may turn sour, but there are certain contingencies to make up for the randomness, if the player is smart enough to use them. In addition, the game itself takes care of all the manual tasks and notetaking of the tabletop version, keeping you informed of your resources at all times.\n\nThe learning curve may be a bit steep for some players, I admit, but unlike the boardgame, the video game adaption offers three short tutorial missions, which should do a lot of good in making you aware of the key strokes of the game.\nThankfully for new players, the 2 minute timer the Terminator player is subject to in the boardgame (unless the players decide not to use it to add even more pressure to the Space Marine's shoulders) is turned off by default and not enforced in singleplayer games. Purists can still play the game on hard difficulty and use the timer, but I am glad they made this optional.\n\n\nThe level editor is still in the making, I'm afraid.\nIf the current 18 missions (three tutorial missions, 12 for the classic Sin of Damnation Campaign and the 3 new missions on board of the Messenger of Purgatory) aren't enough to sate your appetite (which is unlikely, as missions are very replayable and usually not beaten on your first try), there are two new DLC Campaigns available right now (Sword of Halcyon and Defilement of Honour), both of which feature a set 5 missions each and are directly inspired from old first and second edition rules of the boardgame.\n\nSquad customization may or may not be added in the future, but first I assume there will be the teased and promised Chapter Packs, introducing more than just the Blood Angels to the game - all neatly modeled according to lore and current miniature kits. Full Control have also said that they would include those Chapter Packs with new, Chapter-unique (historical) campaigns and flavor. This is DLC I can get behind and will support.\n\n\nConsidering that the first priority for Full Control was using the license to recreate the 3rd edition box set of Space Hulk, which was only produced in very limited quantities back then to begin with, I can acknowledge that they did an incredible job at capturing the game's aesthetic, tone, sound and, obviously, the rules.\n\nThis is, without a doubt, Space Hulk.\nFor the Emperor!","November 28, 2013","true","12.1"," 113 of 132 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","113","132","0","3"

That's not to say the game is bad. But, like certain foods, it has to be consumed in a certain way. Namely, that way is to occasionally play a mission, but never more than one at a time. That is the optimum way to play this game in my opinion.\n\nOther than that, think of it as a sort of low-tech XCOM in terms of the combat. It's based on a system of action points for moving and shooting and overwatching and guarding. Generally a must have for any 40k fan as supporting 40k games can only encourage more of them, right?

I understand that is a straight conversion of a board game and it suffers from the limitations imposed by that. I played it right through to the end, and its the end that ultimately tips this over into a "can't recommend".\n\n\nQuick list of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\nI enjoyed the tactical challenge of planning your best route to the objective,  working out where to place your terminators for maximum advantage and how to get to the objective asap without being eaten.\n\nThere were some good missions fighting a tactical retreat to an extraction point.\n\nFlamer throwers - you only get six shots but they are a great tactical unit and actually kill what you aim at (most of the time).\n\n\nCons:\n\nIf you try to shoot something with the standard bolter you will almost certainly miss unless you are using a chaingun. You only get 4 actions points, you will probably miss every time because genestealers can... duck. I'm guessing the Terminators can't aim lower than a 90 degree angle in those mechanical suits or something. That doesn't explain their inability to hits doors though. Those doors are tricksy buggers.\n\nChainguns are more likely to hit something, but you only get 10 shots and then you have to reload. If you reload there is a chance your terminator will explode. Yes really.  Wtf. These guys have been fighting for 9000 years and have not managed to design a gun that you can change ammo in without blowing up.\n\nStandard bolter guns don't need reloading. They jam instead. I think that they don't need reloading because the Terminator using it is always going to be dead before he runs out of bullets due to his face being eaten while he tries to clear the jam.\n\nRecognising that your standard Terminators can't shoot doors or anything lower than waist height, the braintanks invented a unit with spikey gloves. This guy presumably shot his instructor in basic training and was banned from using guns ever again. Genestealers are close combat enemies, they jump on you, they eat your face. Mr Spikey Gloves is just there to die, tactically speaking he can be thrown out to slow down a genestealer for 1 action point while it digests his nose.\n\nYour squad members have names, but there is no continuity between missions. If they die, they are still there in the next mission, or you might be told that people you carefully preserved were lost in the fight. There is no squad development, they never improve. I kept everyone alive (even Mr Spikey Gloves) through all the missions but the plot didn't recognise this.\n\nThe best missions were ones where you have to reach an objective and then fight a retreat to an extraction point. Too many missions were instantly complete when an objective was met. There was no incentive to plan beyond guy A getting to position X. The whole squad could be on the point of being eaten with zero probability of survival but as long as someone got to position X it was mission complete with 5 out of 5 survivors. Sometimes you had to complete a mission with at least 3 terminators getting to an extraction point, and the game would end as soon as 3 were safe. I want to try to rescue all 5, not have the game decide its mission over because  3 got out.\n\nThere is no tension - I had Space Hulk on my old Amiga, it was a tense scary game, turning a corner was trouser changing event.  This game never takes you by surprise, every enemy is faithfully revealed on the map either as a unit or a blip that could be 1 - 3 units. You know where they are even if you can't kill them.\n\nThe ending - this is what really tipped this over into a thumbs down. The end left a really sour taste in my mouth. I thought it was a bug. I finished the 3rd mission of the 3rd "campaign" and instead of the next mission or campaign unlocking, I could only go to the menu. I replayed the mission hoping it was a one off unlock bug, but no, everything still locked. Looked it up on google, and it turns out that was it, game over unless you buy the DLC. The game is SHORT. I played the game, restarting every mission where I lost a man. If I hadn't done that, and there was no reason to, I could have finished the game in a weekend easily. As far as level design goes, there is no excuse for the developers to put together such a short package. The designs are simple and a computer could happily randomly generate them. I can only think that the the voice over guy giving the mission briefing broke their budget.\n\nSpace Hulk Ascension sounds like it deals with most of the above points, I'll probably buy that if it comes out cheap in a sale.","April 12, 2015","false","17.5"," 87 of 104 people (84%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","84","87","104","30","3"

If you're a fan of the original Space Hulk board game or you're a fan of Warhammer 40k in general, then I would recommend buying it when it's on sale- $30 is far too much for what's offered here.\n\nSpace Hulk is pretty much a 1:1 reproduction of the Space Hulk board game, but with a few extra bells and whistles attached. The animations are well done, the voice acting is adequate and the atmosphere of the game translates well. The campaign is interesting and offers a great number of varying objectives aside from 'kill all the Genestealers', but it would have been more interesting to offer a Genestealer campaign alongside the Space Marine campaign.\n\nMy issues with it are that even with the varying objectives in the campaign, playing against the AI feels a little hollow as compared to the multiplayer experience. The AI can't substitute for a real opponent, as to be expected with board game translations, so it doesn't feel like the AI is really adapting to your strategies as much as an actual opponent would.\n\nOverall though my biggest issue is that this game has a $30 price tag. It is definitely not worth that; though they have a few campaigns to offer, it still doesn't feel like enough to justify the price tag. Plus, all of the maps look the same aside from layout; there's a lot of blank space, and it feels wasted as opposed to claustrophobic as the developers intended.","November 28, 2013","false","5.0"," 103 of 133 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","103","133","0","2"

REALLY .. wanted to like this game.\nThe original Space Hulk was the game that first brought me into the whole warhammer 40k world (that and the original role playing / skirmish rules). An insane future and hugely rich storyline.\n\nBut this game unfortunatley does not build upon any of that wonderful background.\nIt may be an honourable reworking of the original boardgame rules, but when you have so much more power and potential at your disposal simply trying to emulate a boardgame seems like a real waste of opportunity.\n\nProblems :\n\nThe basic gui and interface is somewhat confuzing and I've often found myself wasting crucial movement / action points on needless turn arounds and minor positioning and placement. When it's really life and death between each round these positioning issues become very anoying. Some may say the game punishes you for being unattentive, but I kind of feel the game punishes you for not being pixel perfect in all your clicking.\n\nThe ammo for heavy weapons also is never enough and often I've found myself much rather having a standard trooper with a storm bolter then an assault canon (since bolters don't run out of ammo).\n\nThat said, bloody hell for all their high tech guns these guys use they sure friggen JAM a lot !!\nI've had some missions end in minutes because every gun jammed everytime it was used.\nI realise this is just rolling doubles, but I've played a lot of role playing games and rolled a LOT of dice in my time, and I don't ever recall rolling that many doubles !! Seriously programming guys, can you check your randomizers in your code 'cause I think you've forgotten to remove a rem statement or two.\n\nA one on one battle between a marine and a stealer pretty much results in the loss of your trooper. Having a guy survive an attack is exhilerating but often short lived as usually in the very next round their gun jams and they die anyway.\nI totally except this as the gene stealers are meant to be hugely deadly (read their description .. it's horrific), however their overall depiction in the game is more chibba-manga rather then 'holy crap this thing made my toughest guy crap his pants'.\nThey need to be made bigger and scarier, as from the overall look of the graphics it looks more like the marines should be wiping the slate with the dudes rather then this being a knife edge battle. Maybe too much time was spent animating the marines and too little on the stealers.\n\nThe space hulk graphics look great, but there is zero interaction with anything. This is an example of my 'missed opportunity' anoyance from above. Why not drop some fun extra's around the map and allow the marines to interact with the environment. As it stands the overall look at feel could be totally replaced by the tactical map as everything you see pretty much means nothing anyway.\n\nLastly some of the missions could be aimed more on holding key points and just having fun blasting wave after wave of stealers rather then pushing forward constantly. A real strength in the game should be your marines, but you never really get a chance to use their abilities as your constantly on the backfoot no matter what. Why not drop in a couple fun rounds which just play on the 'theme' rather then being totally based on the 'strategy'.\n\n\nGood bits :\n\nKilling wave after wave of stealers during those few instances when the guns aren't jamming.\nThat never gets old.\n\nMarines .. look .. AWESOME\n\nWinning is rewarding.\nIt should be made much clearer that your not only trying to beat the stealers but also fate itself as the dice play a critical part in the overall outcome of the game. Beating BOTH of these is awesome and keeps the game flowing.\n\n\nOverall I think the metacritic score is harsh, but it is also fair.\nThis game will not appeal to everyone, and is actually a very stark introduction to the 40k universe.\nIt should have been more accomodating to new players and contain more of the huge and awesome background of the 40k universe. This to me is a huge oversite.\nThe gameplay is very linear yet still brutal against even minor positioning errors.\nIn that light it's just not something I can see someone who isn't buried in the 40k world would be able to pick up and play.\n\nRecommended, but only to those who are familiar with the 40k world and who will appreciate the time and effort that's gone into this game. It's a game made for them. But for anyone else I can totally understand if they just don't 'get it'.","March 12, 2014","true","8.4"," 68 of 91 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","68","91","0","0"

The "feel" of playing a board game makes up for how slow and clunky it can be.  With this game, you just get the slow and clunky.  There is simply not enough to do each turn and if feels very restrictive.  The single space hallways also make tactics very limited.  With turn based games, tactics are everything.  If you are an enthusiest of the origional board game, you may still get a little enjoyment from this title.  However, if you are not, as a turn based strategy, X-com beats this hands down.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/242570/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","01. GENRE: A Strategy, Sci-fi, Boardgame adaptation.\n\n02. SETTING: A faithful recreation of the Games Workshop boardgame of the same name set in the Warhammer 40k universe.  Two mortal enemies fight to the death on maps that represent floating space hulks; Humanity's defenders - the Space Marines against the vicious alien horde - the Genestealer.\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: In the far future Humanity has reached and conquered the stars.  An immortal god-like emperor rules over the vast expanse of human empire that fills the galaxy.  Alas there is no peace only war.  Numerous alien species fight against each other for dominance and survival.  Among these are the Genestealers, alien swarms that use the bodies of other species to procreate their numbers.  These parasites move from planet to planet on the captured spacesships of other races.  They spread their numbers by traversing the cosmos over 100s & 1000s of years until they are pulled in by the gravity-wells of unfortuate planets on the same flightpath.  These spaceships house tens of thousands of aliens.  Once detected a chapter of space marines are sent to combat the threat. Space Marines are the genetically enhanced super-soldiers of the emperor, who don the toughest "Terminator" armor and most destructive weapons known to man, in order to stand a chance against such overwhelming numbers.  They are the thin line that protects humanity.\n\n04. GAME MODES: The base game contains two singleplayer campaigns totalling 12 missions, each of which can be replayed in multiplayer.  Additional dlcs provide 5 mini-campaigns of 21 more missions.\n\n05. GAMEPLAY: Consists of tactical, squad, turn-based combat.  One or more squads of five space marines are deployed on missions to complete one or more objectives.  Action takes place using IGO-UGO alternating turns.  Players issue orders up to the actions points available for each unit.  Actions include: movement, shoot, melee attack, psyhic powers, placing marines in overwatch or defensive stance and interacting with doors or mission objects.   Missions are not linked so losing marines does not affect starting positions in the next mission.  (The spin-off sequel does that.)\n\n06. MECHANICS: All combat successes are determined by die rolls.  Squad leaders provide additional action points through a pool of Command Points which can be used to give any marines to augment their actions in a given turn.  Though generated at the start of every turn, if a squad leader is still alive they can attempt to re-roll how many command points available at the start of a turn.  Understanding Command Points is essential to beating the game as they are needed during the enemy's turn as marine weapons can jam as they are used.  If they do Genestealers can overwhelm the affected soldier and kill him easily.  Marines must be given the overwatch or defensive stance commands during the players turn in order to re-act during the A.Is turn.\n\n07. A.I: Overall the A.I performs adequately.  Though there does not need to be anything too clever to control the enemy aliens as they spawn from fixed locations. All the A.I has to do is close in for the kill and overwhelm the player.  However the challenge presented is manifest by the limitation on Space Marine movement and actions.  More often than not a marine not in overwatch, defensive stance or with a jammed weapon will die.\n\n08. GRAPHICS: Isometric Fixed/Rotateable 3D, with short action-oriented cutscenes.  Space Marine units are well modelled and distinct.  The maps and genestealers do look the same however.\n\n09. CONTROLS: Keyboard and/or mouse.  Good and functional.  All actions can be performed by point & click.\n\n10. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Suitable. Together the add to the overall ambience of the setting. Weapons fire and death cries (from both sides) add to the immersion.\n\n11. VOICE ACTING: The voice-overs provided for the space marines add to the immersion.  You can imagine mission briefings being given by a suitably stiff, no nonense genetically enhanced super-soldier from the future.  Voice excerpts of marines confirming your orders or during the heat of combat give that feeling that they are human and part of a team.\n\n12. DIFFICULTY: Game played on normal difficulty.  Overall the missions are fairly straightforward but making a mistake is unforgiving.  Harder mode does not allow saving, unless you quit the game & continue later during a turn.  Enemies spawns may have been larger or more frequent but I did not notice that much of a difference.  An easy option is available but I did not play this.\n\n13. PLAYTIME: The base game has around 20+ hours worth of gaming if you play through the main campaigns and the other dlc mini-campaigns.  This can be extended by replaying missions on other difficulties or in multiplayer.  Getting all the in game achievements took me 55hrs but it could take double that and more.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: No problems stability or otherwise were encountered during my playthrough.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Most achievements are given for completing missions from the main campaigns. Some are given by completing combat feats using space marines armed with certain weapons.  All but one achievement can be gained through one playthrough of the main campaigns.  A few others may require playing through the campaign missions repeated or better still playing through the dlc missions.  If you fail to gain any achievements you can replay missions that you have beaten at any time.\n\n16. DLC: The DLC on release were expensive but on a sale should be a fairly resonable price.  The optional genestealer skins are not required, the Space Wolves chapter replaces the standard space marine units with different soldiers and models providing a totally different experience than in the base game.  This is optional but a must have if you wish to replay the game as much as possible.  The dlc campaigns however are a must if you want to play more of the same, if harder missions.\n\n17. APPEAL: Will appeal to fans of the franchise or original boardgame.  It will also appeal to strategy gamers or grognards who are looking for something a little different in tactical turn-based sub-genre.\n\n18. ENJOYMENT: Very enjoyable if you liked the Space Hulk boardgame given its such a faithful adaptation.  Also enjoyable if you dont mind a challenge and dont mind losing against a pretty competant A.I, or if you like short tactical games where the options are limited and missions fairly repetitive.\n\n19. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: Limited though with dlc less so.  Each mission has been designed to be replayable but fixed objectives and maps mean that only the genestealer spawns and attack routes may change.  Otherwise only in multiplayer where a human controls the genestealers can there be any replayability that isnt linked to the difficulty level. Space Wolves dlc allows replay of all campaigns with a differently styled and equipped group of soldiers.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Fair.  The base game is a fair price but given the DLCs are quite expensive I personally would opt for the complete collection or get all items on sale.\n\nVERDICT:  Overall for a Full Control game its rather good.  Space Hulk is a simple game.  It is modelled afterall on a boardgame.   Yet the graphics and sound captures the setting perfectly and the spirit of the boardgame very well, at least from what I can remember of my few games playing it.  Missions and tactical options may be limited in scope but there is a very enjoyable if somewhat repetitive challenge to be gained from playing through all the missions and then changing to the a different set of soldiers.  A solid purchase for any strategy gamer or fan of Warhammer 40K.*\n\n*The spin-off sequel: Space Hulk Acension does the above but with linked missions and RPG elements.","March 16, 2015","true","56.0"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","0"

There is one small campaign included in the purchase, which will take you less than 20hrs to complete based on your skill level.  The frustration begins when you realise this campaign cuts short and you are welcome to BUY the complete campaign by dropping more money to the developer. To compound this, the multiplayer for this game is extremely clunky and unintuitive. It took me several games to figure out how the turn order would go (mainly because connections are poor and you or the other players will drop, not to mention people simply leave matches).

I bought this game over the mediocre pro reviews and general antipathy toward the game mainly because of a sale, my fanboy status, and because, as a strategy fan, I thought I might be able to get more out of the experience than the average gamer. Ummm... no.\nThe developers obviously care about the source material and let that interest outstrip their collective ability to code. This game has been in the wild for months now and the general level of polish evident in the game is poor, even for an indie game. The many updates, apparently needed due to the rather shoddy state it was in at launch, dont seem to have done much to fix glaring issues such as marines shooting through walls and floors instead of at their targets, or obvious clipping issues as they move through the narrow corridors.\nBeyond the technical issues, this game shows a lack of flair or dynamism in the design work. The marines are plodding and slow to move. Their movement is apparently designed to mimic a board game piece, moving in halting steps and awkward about faces on a per point basis, all leading to an excruciatingly laconic ballet as a marine saunters to your chosen position, clipping through the edges of crossroads as they go. I can understand the attempt to faithfully recreate the board game, but the developers seem to have overlooked that board games make up for their static nature through tension generated by the close proximity, and occasional caustic banter, of friends. The video game scene works in a far more solitary fashion. Imagine watching your favorite board game play out by yourself, and you'll get a good idea of the feel of this game. The marines themselves feel weak, with inneffective weaponry that, although supposedly surviving for millenia and defeating the most horribly effective and despicable foes of the 41st millenium, jam and miss repeatedly for no good reason. This weakness is probably due to the need for balancing in the board game, but these are supposed to be the Emperor's finest; They feel, instead, like obsteperous 6 year olds with nerf guns and foam noodle swords. Finally, the maps are samey and run together after a while. All consist of narrow corridors lacking in any real character or distinguishing features, through which your marines lumber through and, all to often, die needlessly.\nOverall, then, a real shame. This game could have been a fun diversion but for the lack of technical polish, slavish adherence to an entertainment mediium that dosen't translate to video games well, and an inability to innovate.","December 11, 2013","false","11.1"," 47 of 72 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","47","72","0","0"

Still sounds fun to you? Well, if you're enough of a masochist, enjoy, otherwise, better keep away.\n\nThe experience of the game:\nIf you play any Warhammer as a tabletop game, with a friend, or fellow players in one room, every move, every single dice roll can build up sweet tension, your strategy vs. your opponents, your luck vs. theirs and every time one of you makes an awesome move or seems to beat the odds, it can be hillarious.\nThe game might translate the mechanics perfectly, but no matter what, it can not translate this feeling and at least for me, this is doing a lot and seems to turn the whole game into an ok puzzle at best and a boring random number generator at worst.\n\nSometimes there might be a positive feel to it, if you pull of a good move, strengthening your position, or barely getting out of a tight situation. But, most of the time there is no feeling of achievement, when just another one of the hundreds of generic enemies you encounter dies, nor if you complete a level, really. On the other hand it can be rather frustrating, if the randomness turns against you big time, like a single enemy running down a hallway, all overwatch shots missing, the bolter jamming 4 times in a row and then your unit is dead and the whole mission might fall appart. Bad luck, rinse and repeat?! Meh.\n\nIn addition to that, both visuals and sounds are just bad. Again, if it's tabletop, your imagination might fill in cool effects and so far, no graphics engine can beat good imagination. But, if a program shows you, how your unit is shooting the wall, while an enemy in the hallway next to it falls in a weird splash of red, that might be funny the first time, but in the end is just, well, really bad.

Everyone who knows me that my two favorite universes are Lord of the Rings and Warhammer 40k, so I may be a little biased, but I thoroughly enjoyed this game. It's tactically interesting, and it plays well. However, one of its greatest strengths is that it FEELS like a Warhammer 40k game. The universe is, of course, based off of the tabletop miniatures games, and Space Hulk is one of the first Warhammer 40k games I've played that felt like I was playing the tabletop version. That's really rare. Other 40k games, such as Space Marine or Dawn of War, are great in their own right, but Space Hulk manages to capture that special nostalgia I get when playing the tabletop version and digitize it.\n\nThat being said, Space Hulk is not a very long game. It took me about five hours to beat. The remaining twenty hours were spent grinding to get 40,000 kills. Yep, 40,000 kills is a /lot/. And the grinding SUCKED. Normally, this would be an instant disqualification from being recommended (40,000 kills?! COME ON!) but because I had lots of fun and enjoyed the atmosphere very much, I'll recommend the game -- with the caveat, however, that if you're achievement hunting, you're gonna have a bad time.","May 22, 2015","true","25.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

As such, it will likely be most appealing to individuals immersed in the Warhammer 40K universe and who are familiar with the original game's mechanics.

The computer is very easy to aggro and will always push ahead with its blips, rather than holding them back as lurkers ahead of the marines' line of advance.  This makes the original 3e campaign fairly easy to complete with careful play.  The DLC campaigns seem to recognize the A.I.'s weaknesses and work to compensate for it by forcing the marines to be more aggressive through time limits and other stressors.\n\nI found the game to be achingly slow on a non-gaming laptop, but it motors along at quite a nice pace on a dedicated platform.

Rather than having to figure out a tactical plan and then execute it, there's nothing to be "solved," the plan is obvious from the first time you see the map and you just reload again and again hoping the dice work out this time. I recognize this is meant to be a simulation of a tabletop game but it's on a computer now so it's gonna get compared to other computer games. Resting everything on a d6 is fine for a tabletop game but it turns out computer games don't need to be constrained like that.\n\nAfter I got through the tutorial the other campaigns have maps that are bigger and so far some of them are more challenging. It's only crashed-to-desktop on me twice once I got it working. At that point (like a couple hours in) it feels worth it to fight the controls but I can't recommend a game that takes 2-3 hours to "pick up" while you reload over and over.\n\n\n- Initial install problem: I knew the bad reputation this thing had but I figured since it's hugely discounted it couldn't hurt to try it. It took two tries to actually install the game and then for the first 2 hours I couldn't even get it to launch, just says "Oops! The game crashed" and then whatever happened to the failed install immediately broke all the other unity games I had.\n\nFull Control needs to do a lot better with their other games before they get them on Steam.\n\n- Editing to respond to tendoncutter: This thing was a buggy crash-to-desktop ♥♥♥♥in nightmare from when it was first released, I avoided it up until now, and then I let a bunch of friends talk me into buying it during this sale.

The initial build of the game was OK(ish) - good core gameplay, but quite a few flaws that needed to be (and were) sorted out with later patches. As this Space Hulk was so close to the board game, I was dissapointed that the original board game expansions (Deathwing and Genestealer) were never added to the base game as DLC, but you can't have everything I guess.\n\nThe game mechanics are solid, there are a good set of scenarios linked into a story, the AI opponent is competent and - most importantly - the scenarios are well designed and balanced. If you play well you will win (probably, unless you have some very bad dice rolls). If you play badly you will lose (and lucky dice won't save you). Only downside is you can't play scenarios as the Tyranids against the computer's Terminators on solo.\n\nPersonally, so far, I prefer this Space Hulk to Space Hulk:Ascention.

Simple premise, for a simple game. Space Hulk is easy to learn and has both co-op and versus multiplayer if you want to play it with friends. It does suffer from niche-itis, in that the space marines' oversized armour restricts their movement(This is a key part of the game, positioning them right so they aren't flanked), and the inherrent dice and chance based things as are common in many Warhammer boardgames are not something everyone enjoys playing with. These space marines will die if they get jumped by a genestealer, are slow to move, their guns may jam, and they may miss six times or even more in a row if you just don't have the luck.\n\nBut that's part of the fun and gameplay, your goal is to get these marines to do a mission and preferably without them all getting slaughtered, as this is turn based and a most mechanics use chance you will find that tactics and positioning will allow you to win the day more often than just being lucky. Being lucky helps, of course, but if you position things to reduce how much chance is involved then it is only a small factor in leading your squad to victory. This is not too difficult in single player, but becomes a lot tougher when you go online and allow a player to control the genestealers.\nIn the end, it's pretty good but it is slow, clearly based on a boardgame, and has chance based mechanics. If you do not mind this then it's a fun title to play some rounds with or against friends, complete the single player campaign and just generally enjoy.

Unfortunately it turned out to be a frustrating mess in which it felt like I won more through luck than strategy, which meant even when I won it didn't feel like an accomplishment, and whenever I lost it was usually due to the game's randomness not playing in my favor.\n\nWhen I go to play a strategy game, I expect a reasonable challenge in which I win through craft, out-thinking my opponent, and as one might expect, through strategy and skill. This game is too simple to the point that once you've got the basics you know what you should do for every scenario, and even when you do just that, there's a good chance you'll lose anyway just because the computer decided that you'll miss 8 shots in a row, and decided arbitrarily to throw 8 'nids at you en masse.\n\nNow I'm not the end-all, beat-all game critic here, but I came into this game wanting to love it, and left sorely disappointed.

It's missing character customization, which while not necessary, would have been a big draw. 2. It's missing a good narative. They could have made the campaign feel more continuous by having some cutscenes or something, but instead the game feels very 'instanced', and you kinda have to figure out the story through the mission briefings/missions themselves.\n\nNow, aside from those things I think this is a good, smart game. It feels like the movie Aliens meets WH40K- you root for some of the biggest badasses in the universe to mulch some xeno filth and get out alive, but of course the aliens are smart, agile, and extremely deadly if they get close to the humies. So, the game retains the feeling of dread at finding out exactly how many genestealers are around the corner, and how likely you are to be pressed for AP/CP (the action points you use to command your units to do anything). The game is difficult, but never seems outright unfair. The Terminators and Genestealers feel suprisingly balanced considering one's ranged profficiency, and one's melee profficiency. Providing the map isn't nothing but corridors, the genestealers have plenty of chances to get the drop on you and eliminate your troops one by one. Genestealers actually have some interesting abilities. While their units don't have special attacks, or really any variation (except for the broodlords), they can choose to either be stealthy, or to play the waiting game and build up forces, or to just rush the Terminators every turn so they can't continue through the mission, and pray units get through to cut them in half. This is because the Genestealer player (or AI) can choose to put units at any number of spawn points, can choose whether or not to reveal units at certain times, and can make big moves each turn due to having more AP.\n\nOverall, I feel like the game is a good buy. The Terminators are weighty and have heavy firepower, which looks and sounds great. The Genestealers are appropriately creepy, but could probably have benefitted from some better move animations and dodge animations, but otherwise look like a fearsome foe. The game knows it's theme and keeps to it. Even though the game deals with a lot of hallways which could have been a lot more boring, they find ways to keep them interesting (flickering lights, gore, weird tech, ominous mists and steams, all the usual wrought metal and skulls you love from the Imperium, etc.). The gameplay is fun, with different objectives on each map for the Terminators (rescue, destruction, retrieval, escape, etc.) and so it stays fresh through the campaign.\n\nFinally, the shoulder cam is awesome, the emperor protects, and I rate this game an 7/10.\n\nDLC 1: Sword of Halcyon: Ok so for some reason I can't figure out how to write a separate review for the DLC packs, so I'll post them at the bottom of this review. The first DLC pack I played through was the Sword of Halcyon campaign. I played through singleplayer as the Blood Angels. In total the 5 missions took me about 5 hours to play through on Normal difficulty. The campaign has it's pros and cons. Essentially, the gist is that you are on the ship Sword of Halcyon which has just crashed into a space hulk in the warp, and you are responding to the influx of genestealers within the first hours after collision. What I find cool about this is that the main game took place 600 years after the space hulk Sin of Damnation was infested, and the terminators are slowly and methodically manuevering through that space hulk to their objectives. In this campaign, time is no luxury. Genestealers are quickly moving through the ship and your terminators are tasked with securing vital areas of the ship like the armories, bridge, and the inner sanctum of the ship full of holy relics, all in order to attempt a defense. It feels climatic because the briefings and missions run into each other in a logical, continuous way. In addition, the missions challenge the player by forcing them to keep pressing forward, with two missions actually tasking you with destroying or sealing off genestealer spawns, forcing you to run straight at the genestealers which can be nerve-wracking and potentially disasterous. This could be a really fun campaign to play in co-op or versus I think.\n\nNow, that's all well and good, but the campaign also has some weaknesses. Though each mission mixes up the squads, it only does so aesthetically with name and model changes. Aside from the first mission, each scenario has two squads of 5 terminators; 1 seargeant, 1 heavy flamer troop, and 3 regular storm bolter troops. This is a sore point for me because I kept waiting to see an assualt cannon troop or a Librarian, and it never happened. You'll get familiar with using those units, and that's not really a good thing. I would have rather had changing squads making me have to adjust and adapt more through the campaign. The two other main beefs I have involve the lack of broodlords and the usage of bulkhead doors. I really thought I should have fought a broodlord or two on the final mission; it just would have felt right and ramped up the challenge of the last mission. Bulkhead doors are only in one level, and the store page makes it sound like they'll be a key feature of the campaign, but they aren't. Bulkheads are a great concept hardly touched.\n\nAltogether, I grant the Sword of Halcyon DLC campaign a 6.5/10. Dissapointing, but still somewhat enjoyable, and not a waste of $5, especially if you have someone for MP.","July 15, 2014","true","26.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I've played since the second edition of the board game and I also purchased the third edition of the board game.  Space hulk is a remarkable game clearly taking inspiration of the claustrophobic combat in Aliens, so when I heard it was being made as a PC game, for the third time, and that said new game would be more true to games like x-com I was very excited.  The developers this time opted to make an almost 100% faithful conversion of the board game into a PC game.  In this way Space Hulk delivered something that I've been waiting for over several decades.\n\nHaving purchasing this game however, it's hard to say that they have done a perfect conversion.  The single player works very well even if the AI is sometimes extremely stupid.  The main point is that after many patchs the single player game space hulk was everything I wanted and justifies a 5- 10$ purchase price.  As a multiplayer game this game is a buggy broken mess.  I have had multiple disconnects during the game and lag that is completely unjustifiable and intolerable in a turn based game.  The developers CLEARLY rushed this title and are also mainly concered with getting it out for iOS as fast as possible.  In all honesty, they should just delete the multiplayer option.  It doesn't work at all depsite any claims the developer may make.\n\nI would say that if you enjoy turn based games and games workshop pick this title up, but don't pay over 10$.  Also avoid all the DLC.  The DLC has clearly been rushed out as a cash grab, the new missions are easy and uninteresting, and the addtional features it provides really add nothing to the overall game.","December 29, 2013","true","48.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Do I get to become Dux if I win? Is that what happens?\n\nSpace hulk, by comparison, while ostensibly set within the same universe, didn't have the same feel to it - it was more a aliens-vs-space marines one-on-one actual board game that you could play with your friends on an afternoon free, without having to, you know, Study it. Like it was some kind of Work or something...\n\nTo an extent I feel this game is how Xcom: Enemy Unknown should've been - not, you know, just random and boringly pretty, which is what it was. One suspects that if Xcom had dedicated half the time it spent on it's graphical cutscenes to actually solidifying the gameplay aspect, they might've come out with a good game, and not the buggy, unfair one they did.\n\nTo illustrate, I spent about 3 hours on the third mission I got assigned in Xcom, due to the game unexpectedly throwing a randomly-hard level at me, which took, I ♥♥♥♥-you-not, 20 iterations to complete, and then only because I figured out the singular path that wouldn't kill all my squadmates in five turns.\n\nBy comparison, I have also spent about 3 hours on the third mission of Space Hulk, but I don't mind. Because I know, every time, it's not because the game gives me unending varieties of ways to complete the mission - or because the game is doing unexpectedly random things - it's because I'm not doing it right. You know this because the rulebook is thin, terse, and because it takes place in non-randomly-generated corridors, there are limited ways in which to complete a mission, and it becomes much more obvious which ones are actually smart, and which ones are dumb.\n\nI don't have to sit through a 3 minute cutscene every time I begin a mission, I don't have to watch a 'reveal' jumpscare video every time an alien pops up (there are in-game battle sequences but you can turn them off), I can just strategise, iterate and learn.\n\nThat's the way it should be. However, there are some downsides.\nFor some reasons, the graphics engine is woefully slow for what it's rendering. Not enough that it becomes annoying, just enough that I disrespect it. The graphics are okay, but not that great - which is fine. The control system is simple and easily understandable, but somewhat clunky to use - I'm not sure why this should be, but the mission overlays sometimes get in the way of just jumping in there.\n\nAnd lastly the gameplay difficulty level is somewhat balanced against you, to the extent that I'm considering dropping down to 'easy' - I don't remember the boardgame being this hard, perhaps it was. There will be many who like this.\n\nLastly I just wanted to say "thanks" to the devs for actually including a save button. You know, a regular save button. A meaningful one. One where I save the game and the game is saved. I can go back to washing the dishes now. I can structure my games around my life, and not the other way around. How it should be.\n\nBest of luck to the devs, whose company has folded, but apparently without hardship. I hope to pick up their sequel some day.","October 2, 2015","true","11.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","0"

I got this is a 6$ bundle, and that is a lot less than the 110$ asking price on ebay.\nSingle Player: You play as a Space Marine Terminator sargent against Genestealer AI in a campaign identical to the board games. Each turn you command your terminators in a tight space, and its never seems like there is a best choice. It is honestly difficult to weight what choices to make each turn, and one bad move can end the game. After you move and order your terminators with a small amount of command points (4 per terminator and 1-6 extra command points depending on a dice roll) the Genestealers get a turn, and although they are weaker than terminators you are outnumbered, and even a seemingly good move can give the GeneStealers all they need to break you. This game is unforgiving. The AI is good most of the time, but sometime makes REALLY bad moves.\nMultiplayer: Same as the single player, but one player controlers to Genestealers. I have never played it with anyone but myself(had to test it) but it would be much harder than the single player as AI will never match the human mind.\n\nSummary: This is a really good buy for anyone that likes hard board games and a fan of Warhammer 40k. I always wanted the board game but the digital version is cheaper and has a single player mode.\nCons:LUCK. its is really determined around luck. A bad dice roll can negate a good move, and a good dice roll can make a really stupid move look like tactical genious.\n\n8/10","November 3, 2015","true","9.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qwiddity/recommended/242570/","qwiddity","Quiddity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qwiddity/","525 products in account","This remake of Space Hulk is a return to a video game implementation of the classic tabletop board game. Gone are the controllable first-person elements from Space Hulk: Vengeance Of The Blood Angels, which in themselves were an attempt at providing further immersion than the original Space Hulk video game (a blast from the past from 1993!) .\n\nOf course, the graphics quality has been gently ushered into the modern age. Copenhagen developmers Full Control Apps have done a quite decent job modelling environments and characters, and an excellent job of remaining completely faithful to the tabletop edition in terms of gameplay. The music and sound-effects are very atmospheric, and immersing yourself into the feel of Space Hulk (especially the first time in the dead of night with the lights off) is really fun. Franchise fans, will find the horrific aspects of this sort of video game is very appealing in experiential terms, and the immersion in a no-way-out survival horror is probably high on the list of reasons to play.\n\nPlayers can roam the hulk "Sin Of Damnation" (an expansion set for the board game) as either fearsome Genestealer Tyranids, or heroic Blood Angel Space Marines. The single-player campaign clads your squad of four in classic Warhammer: 40,000 Terminator Armor with all associated weaponry. They carry out your orders with appropriate battle cries of "For the Emperor!" and such-like. When squad members inevitably fall in close-combat with Genestealer, their death throes are accompanied with sentiments to the effect of "Avenge me, my brothers!". You will need to do a lot of avenging in the course of the campaign if you set the difficulty up high.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is also punishing in terms of performance. Though many actions of the AI are based on six-sided dice rolls of only a few dice, the psuedorandom number generator used might well  be using floating point variables of many significant figures, for the eternity it takes to decide upon death without recourse. However, if you roll bad dice in your turn resulting in any mistake including death, there's always the Undo button. If you're terribly frustrated with a particular mission (stupid chapter artifact, why can't these pansy marines pick up a dumb chalice?) you may find yourself in a situation where spamming Undo on your turn will be the only thing which seems to get you through a difficult spot other than reducing the difficulty setting. Considering the requirements of the game, framerates go low and slow (especially with higher numbers of pixels on larger displays). This can be remedied acceptable by reducing graphics quality to medium and changing other settings. There's no pressing need for high framerates, because this a clear turn-based strategy. But smooth-scrolling around the map is necessary to keep track of what's going on. Especially when dropship teleporters malfunction during deployment! A stranded, lone Terminator faced with corridors on several sides makes an easy target for voracious Genestealers. They run in packs, don't let them get close, or even ol'lightning claws can have regrets.\n\nThe animations of Terminators heroically firing weapons gets repetitive before the end of the second map in single-player. This is quickly and easily solved by turning it off entirely in the options. The animations still play, but the camera doesn't zoom into each Terminator while firing. However, the animations still go on too long. When placing a Terminator with a Storm Bolter into Overwatch mode over a long corridor filled with Genestealers, it's time to go make coffee as literally hundreds of rounds are fired with no way to skip over the animation. It's worth marveling at this once or twice, but quickly becomes boring. The same can be said of the movement, although this can be sped up. However, at maximum speed, Genestealers are more frightening than necessary, and Terminators clump around with like humourously inarticulated style of LEGO-figurines, so fast is as fast as fast goes with that.\n\nOf course you can always play online, and the matchmaking server will set you up against any number of eager opponents ready to kick you around the board until you just can't take it any more. I'm sure it's a long-forgotten personal motto of Blood Angels chapter librarians that in order to know the sweet ambrosia of victory one must drink of defeat until the very last bitter dregs, or something to similar effect. Whatever the cost, the Blood Angels shall redeem themselves, as their hands are mere extensions of the Emperor's will, etc. etc. So to keep things interesting, new maps and characters and campaigns must be provided for these extensions of the Emperors will, or the warp will make devils of idle hands. Or something. In typically mercenary Games Workshop style, these sorts of expansions are sold at a premium as DLC for Space Hulk. Just like the board game, so while it's a depressing monetary vacuum for fans, that Games Workshop have licensed an all-consuming Eye Of Terror for bank accounts isn't surprising. Fellow chosen of the Imperium, we must turn back this tide of Chaos! We must invoke... the Emperor's discount! In all seriousness, AU$20 is expensive for what Space Hulk offers. AU$10 would have satisfied the Emperor's chosen far more. The current asking price of AU$5/each for DLC packs is far too much. The best advice here is to wait for the bundle sale before deployment. Like the migration of Tyranid hives, a percentage off will inevitably intersect our space.","April 5, 2014","true","9.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I have many fond memories of playing Space Hulk with my dad. This game was a huge nostalgia trip for me. It is a very faithful recreation of the game down to the most intricate detail. It's a lot of fun to own your friends over the internet.\n\nAll this being said, it is very poorly optimized and the system requirements on the Steam store page are a flat out lie. This wouldn't even be an issue if you had the option to turn on and off individual graphics settings but the only options you get are automatic (low, high, ultra and so on). Needless to say, I would NOT have made this purchase if I knew I'd be playing most of the missions at 10 fps or so. If you have a newer video card none of this will effect you but Steam needs to get them to change the "Recommended" specs to something like GTX 200+ series instead of the advertised Geforce 9000 series.\n\nIn short, it's a great game wothy of your time but perhaps not the asking price. If you love tactical, turn-based strategy and the artistic stylings of the Warhammer universe definately get this one on sale.

The combat is extremely slow, the movement is sluggish, and the only type of customization you can get is for your banner. No equipping marines, no decal changes, no ranks, and not even MUSIC for during the rounds. Not to mention how just plain boring the combat is. This is combat: You engage enemy. You both roll between 1-6. Enemy gets 3 roll attempts to try to beat yours, and if they do you die. No damage, just dead. The same goes with range combat: You roll between 1-6, and if you reach a #, based on the weapon, or above you insta kill the enemy.\nThe ONLY thing that even SLIGHTLY makes me happy about the game, is the little camera in the upper right which shows "First Person" what your marine is looking at. Except, apparently, they don't LOOK at their enemy when shooting them. They "Aim" by staring off to the left at a wall, unable to even see the slightest bit of the enemy.\n\nI would give this game a 0/10, with absolutely nothing fun about it what so ever. No good combat, no good music, the sound and ambience is terrible, no customization, no ANYTHING other then just roll the dice. If all you want to do is roll the dice to win, I'd recommend Life, Monopoly, or RISK. To put this in prospective... I would like to RETURN the game to them.

Being a fan of the original, I've enjoyed this remake since it does stick so close to the rules and gameplay of Space Hulk. This version is not, however, without issues.\n\nMy biggest gripe is not with Space Hulk's gameplay, but with its poor optimization. A game like this simply shouldn't suffer performance issues when zooming way out of the gameboard, or during "action cam" moments. The framerate tends to bottom out in certain specific situations and, while it doesn't ruin the actual gameplay, it is extremely jarring when it happens.\n\nDisregarding the technical issues, Space Hulk still isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. Just like the original, the PC version of Space Hulk can be quite difficult to win, and tends to favor lucky die rolls over strategy. Even the most well-executed advance can be ruined by a series of inopportune bolter jams, or a catastrophic autocannon failure. It's simply the nature of the game. However, there's nothing unusual about a boardgame that relies heavily on random die rolls, so I don't fault Space Hulk for this.\n\nIf you're a fan of the original Space Hulk, or if you enjoy these kinds of boardgames in general, then you'll likely enjoy this PC remake. But if you're the sort who can't stand to have victory snatched away from you by a random die roll, then Space Hulk may not be the game for you.","February 22, 2015","true","27.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not first video game review first review EVER.  So I haven't reviewed a fridge, a bacon sandwich or a book on the Easter bunny.\n\nTo begin, some things I like about this game\n\nThe tutorial.  Not only is any kind of tutorial great, especially for games like this.  But an actual good one? Priceless.  The tutorial in this game got me up to speed on how to play this game and introduced new mechanics well.\nSound/Music.  Now I must confess I am a GW fan boy but in my opinion they got the sound effects in this just right.  The music is great to boot.\nArt direction.  Again I believe they have nailed it, Gothic Sci-fi, will skulls all-over.\n\n\nThings I'm not so keen on\n\nThe graphics.  This is a small issue but I just wish they were a bit more polished.  They are nice, just not amazing.\n\nThe meat of it....BBQ Chicken, tastes great but can be messy.\n\nThis is a turn based strategy game. In which you carefully move and manage a team of the finest Blood Angel Terminators, to circumvent and vanquish terrible Genestealers, and accomplish various objectives.\n\nIt is set in the famous 40K setting from GW.  This is a grim future where humanity's once advanced technology is in decline, beset by foes on all sides, no hope, no final victory only a slow and painful decline.\n\nThe section of the universe this game focuses on is groups of highly advance indomitable Space Marine Terminators undertaking boarding actions on vast Space hulks.  Fending off the lightning fast Genstealer menace (think xenomorph).\n\nIts very much an elite group of butt kicking stone blocks, versus overwhelming deadly, agile, supreme killers.\n\nNow as I have mentioned I am a huge fan of this Universe so I would whole heartedly recommend this game!\n\nNow from a point of view of someone who knows nothing about this 40k nonsense and doesn't know his Bolter from his Las pistol, this game is still worth a look in.  Some of may go over your head or seem a bit grim and weird, but I think a good time can still be had with this and you never know it might get you into the geeky miniature painting gaming stuff :)\n\nBuy this if you are a fan, give this a chance if your not and it happens to be on sale.","June 28, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a slow-paced game based on an old board game, so yes it even uses an algorithim based on 6 sided dice.  If you are a hardcore Warhammer 40k fiend like me then go ahead and get this game.  It is fun and nostalgiac.  But wait till it goes on sale.  It is not worth $30 in any form or fashion.  I got it for $5 and then I bought the DLC which brought my total cost to about $24 for everything.  I have some buyers remorse.  The DLC should be about 50-75% cheaper as well.   Plus lets face it, Games Workshop has been cornholing us for years on thier games and miniatures.  They do not deserve the money anymore.   The only good thing they have left is the Black Library novels and the RPGs Deathwatch and Dark Heresy.   The universe is great for video games also if they can keep a good publishers and not eff up thier games like the did Space Marine multiplay....   SPace Marine is/was one of the best games EVER!  And BEAUTIFUL!  A truly wonderful 40k experience, but they hosed the multi-play and ruined the game and lost money...\n\nSorry for the related tanget.

As a fan of turn-based strategy games and the Space Hulk: Death Angel card game, I anticipated this title with what I thought were reasonable expectations, though this game did not come close to meeting them.\n\nThe graphics and animation have no notable qualities. The game is ugly, sluggish and plays like an iPhone title. One can easily waste a turn making a misclick and watching their lumbering character turn to face the wall.\n\nThe gameplay is pitiful in comparison to any recent turn-based strategy game. There is nothing to a lot of the maps other than setting up an overwatch, waiting for the genestealers to come to you and getting the requisite kills to complete the mission. The map layouts are simple and linear and would have been much better with an element of randomization like the card game mentioned above. That feature would have also added some replay value to this, which currently has none. There is no sense of exploration or cautious advance that XCOM: Enemy Unknown provides and no sense of personality or team relationships that is featured in Fire Emblem Awakening. There is also no character progression system that allows you to customize or favor individual units such as those systems offered in XCOM, Fire Emblem or Battle for Wesnoth.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone; all, including Space Hulk fans, would be much better served playing XCOM, Fire Emblem or Battle for Wesnoth and passing on this one.\n\nLuckily, I bought this game on a Steam sale and only committed $6.24. I do not even believe that payment was worthwhile as that small amount could have paid for a lunch. I cannot believe the list price of this game is $29.99. A $.99 price point seems right for what is offered, but even then, one’s time could be better spent in other endeavors.\n\nUnfortunately for the player, but I guess fortunately for the developer, a demo was not offered for Space Hulk. Playing a demo of this game would have allowed me to realize these issues and avoid the expenditure of any money on it.","May 31, 2014","false","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's very slow paced, there doesn't seem to be that much strategy to it, besides setting your guys up to guard hallways and "hoping" you hit before the enemy can reach you.\n\nIt also has a very BAD system of "dice rolling" which is basically the "chance" system in this game which is pretty stupid in my opinion. I guess they were trying to make this "feel" like a tabletop visual board game... it doesn't work that well.... and I'd much rather have a % shown of my likihood of success then "you need to roll a 6+ to break down this door" wtf? i'm not rolling any dice, there's no reason for that to be included in the game.\n\nI'm not going to say it's "bad" until i finish the game, I actually enjoy turn based strategy games like this, and will continue playing it however....\n\nI can not reccomend this game to others, simply because it's so far off from what a Warhammer game should be, and most will likely be extremely upset at how much it resembles a very confined slow version of XCOM rather than a action packed Warhammer experience.\n\nEdit: Just found out this game was actually a reproduction of the board game "Space Hulk" which is probably why I have such mixed feeling about this game.

I'm not sure why so many people are down on this game.  The board game is out-of-print and sells for over $300 dollars, and if you were to invest in it, what are the odds you'll find someone to actually play it with?  For a tenth of that, you can play on your own or join with other fans easily.  Plus extra content?  It's an easy sell.  I'd say the only complaint I have is that so few other races aren't represented.  Space Hulks effect the entire universe, and some races actually use them for their own purposes.  Future Add-Ons that feature defending the Hulk as Orcs or Chaos, or even cleansing it as Tau or Eldar would be so much fun since they have their own rules and squads.  It would make for a much more dynamic game with lots more replayability.  Either way, what you get is a lot of fun and worth it.","December 14, 2013","true","3.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It looks like the board-game, plays like the board-game and I've never eaten the board-game so the comparison now stops. This is not a"modern" style computer game, so if you buy it expecting all the "usual" AAA features then you will be disappointed. No cut-scenes, no character progression, and the editor is still on its way.\n\nThere were terrible bugs upon release (including a "no possible win" scenario). The devs responded with three patches in just over 2 days. (small patches so they could find any new problems easily. Good idea when you are releasing without time to do full testing). They were incredibly apologetic and, more importantly, very quick with the fixes. This gives me a lot of hope going forward. Co-op play and editor are promised as "no more to pay" add-ons.\n\nThe multiplayer has a lot of woes, with the match-up system pairing you against people who are offline. If you know someones email address, you can "pick" them that way and be assured a match. I have played multi-player sucessfully & it could well be the best feature of the game, as nothing compares to a living, thinking opponent. Also, if I get beaten, its because they outplayed me, not that their twitch reflexes are better.\n\nTo my friends, I think you would enjoy it if you already know what Space Hulk is. If you don't, then not so much. But drop me a line or give me a bell and I will happily elaborate.","August 26, 2013","true","99.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I'm glad that I did.\n\nThe game is pretty much exactly like the Space Hulk board game that I remember playing when I was younger, except the dice roles are handled automatically (although you can see the dice rolls if you like). In the single player campaign, you play as the Blood Angel Space Marines whilst the genestealers are controlled by the computer AI. The game doesn't particularly add anything that wasn't in the board game, which could be considered a bit of a missed opportunity but fans of the board game will probably be pleased about this. Personally, I felt that the option to change your squad setup for each mission could have added some variety to the game, and could have increased the replayability.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing through the single player campaigns currently available, and would certainly recommend this to anybody who likes the board game or turn-based strategy in general. There is a mission editor planned, as well as additional DLC campaigns, which will help to provide additional content once you've polished off the main campaign. It also features multiplayer options, allowing you to play online against your friends.","December 26, 2013","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It looks like the board-game, plays like the board-game and I've never eaten the board-game so the comparison now stops. This is not a"modern" style computer game, so if you buy it expecting all the "usual" AAA features then you will be disappointed. No cut-scenes, no character progression, and the editor is still on its way.\n\nThere were terrible bugs upon release (including a "no possible win" scenario). The devs responded with three patches in just over 2 days. (small patches so they could find any new problems easily. Good idea when you are releasing without time to do full testing). They were incredibly apologetic and, more importantly, very quick with the fixes. This gives me a lot of hope going forward. Co-op play and editor are promised as "no more to pay" add-ons.\n\nThe multiplayer has a lot of woes, with the match-up system pairing you against people who are offline. If you know someones email address, you can "pick" them that way and be assured a match. I have played multi-player sucessfully & it could well be the best feature of the game, as nothing compares to a living, thinking opponent. Also, if I get beaten, its because they outplayed me, not that their twitch reflexes are better.\n\nTo my friends, I think you would enjoy it if you already know what Space Hulk is. If you don't, then not so much. But drop me a line or give me a bell and I will happily elaborate.","August 26, 2013","true","99.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have heard that many of the bugs have since been fixed, but it really isn't good enough to sell a game as a full price release offering just ten or so missions, which is not even fit for purpose.  I played for 7 hours and that was really enough for me.  The initial experience has probably soured my opinion of the game permanently.  There is some strategy and enjoyment here but the game is slow, repetitive and looks terrible.  Perhaps the greatest failing for me was the complete lack of customisation or any connection the player feels towards his marines.  You can't even choose the marine's loadouts or name them and they don't increase in ability in any way in between missions.  This means you have no attachment to any of the marines and don't care when they die.  All in all, not enough time was spent making this game and it lacks any real innovation or little touches that would have made it an enjoyable title and done the IP justice.","April 2, 2014","false","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So beneath the fancy exterior it's just a boardgame. So are you not a fan of the original Space Hulk game this is proberbly not for you.

I had seen, but never played the original Space Hulk, and have never got into the table top original.\n\nAfter seeing it initially I thought oh, if it is like Incubation then I will still love it. It still did not have the variation that Incubation gave but I played through a few hours before having a copy purchased for me.  As such I can honestly say I knew what I was getting.\n\nThe Good:  To the best of my understanding it is a reasonably faithful recreation of the table top version and has the feel of a Warhammer game initially.\n\nThe Bad:  It is a recreation of the table top game with tolerable graphics, bland sound, and no atmosphere in either.  the game play easily gets repetitive and most stages can be completed by holding corridors with ordinary bolter armed dreadnoughts on overwatch. It is the height of Rinse and Repeat.  You have no sense of involvement in the squads or their members, meaning i feel no personal loss when a team member goes down other than annoyance, The price is too high for the game and I feel it should have been in the $15 range.\n\nThe Personal:  Having had it purchased knowing the faults you may wonder why. Well.....\n1.  Warhammer, duh!  A fan does it and just fills in the blanks in his mind.  I imagine the sounds that\nare missing, I picture the graphics being better and my imagination puts me there.\n2.  Squad Tactical Turn based game.  I love them and so will forgive some.\n3.  Despite there being very little variation it still is interesting in the begining each each turn in\nplanning out deployments and deciding how to achieve the objective. after the first 5 minutes\nthough it is all auto pilot.\n4.  I grew up playing games on an Atari 2600, then Nintendo Famicom, Sega 16bit, and early PC\ngames like Wolfenstein and Blake Stone.  Graphics and sound are not the only things that attract\nme I want solid game play mechanics and while simplistic this game feels solid in that aspect to\nme.\n\nI give this a personal score of 6/10 and only because I am ignoring the (personally feel) high price.  If i had to calculate the pricing into my view of the score i would make it 4.5/10.","April 6, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Space Hulk is a game you can play for hours straight, but you don't have to. you might as well play it in a few minutes of spare time (although you will WANT to play more!)\n\nthe combat uses dice mechanics, which really gives it that great feel of a board game - so you will need a bit of LUCK, but a highly strategic approach is equally important, as it can dramatically impact on the probabilities. and while it's certainly not everyone's favorite, if you're into that kind of gameplay it is immensely fun, as even the same mission never plays out the same way twice.\n\nfinally, the developers are really active on updating the game constantly. since I started playing (on day one of the first release) it has made great progress performance-wise as well as on additional features.","May 20, 2014","true","26.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am invested in the background.\n\nHere are my first impressions after about 6 hours of play. I will update this as I complete more of the game and the DLC.\n\nThe game sets you up with a series of missions with very specific and very basic objectives and perameters. I feel like the missions are varied within the confines of the game they developed. Unfortunately, that means that I am typically slowly moving from point A to point B killing and meeting objectives along the way. Overall, this is a good adaptation of the board game and enjoyable to play. As a player, I enjoy the methodical setup of killing fields and ensuring that all of my marines exit the level safely, and that I have completed the special objective as per the steam achievements. There is so much that could be better though. Please let me outfit my terminators and develop them from mission to mission. Let me be more connected to the game in this way and it would increase my playtime.\n\nGraphically the game is fine. There are some animations that are silly, I have terminators shooting eachother with overlapping overwatch. The animations can often cut through the walls and through each other. This is a problem that should be fixed. I really like the camera view they offer to show what the terminators see. The atmosphere and levels are good.\n\nWe can see what is going on behind the scenes with the dice rolls. I feel like I really understand what is expected of me to hit an enemy, and my chances in combat. I almost feel like I could recreate the board game from this virtual one, and that transparency is great. With it coming down to calculated probabilities and chances, the difficulty of this game is moderate/moderate-low for very strategic gamers. I am by no means awesome, and I can get through each level with losing no one when I put my mind to it. Everything is up to these calculated risks. This is where another gripe comes to mind with this game: the undo button.. I can undo and retry combat and get a different roll/result. If I were to abuse this, it would be game breaking.\n\nSpeaking of game breaking - the game is very stable!\n\nSo.... enjoy this game, and remember to overwatch! Leave a few command points to spare - these terminators have the worst storm bolters in the world!\n\n===== More to come\n\n","January 3, 2014","true","9.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're hunched over Space Hulk on your PC as if it's an adrenaline-filled FPS, you will be driven mad by the slow speed.  Trundle would be the best description of the speed.\nI use it on my lap-top while watching sports.  Relax and enjoy.\n\nMissions\nThey are consistent with the WarHammer40K universe but have a limited amount of variations.\nOk length for the prologue mini-campign.\nMain campaign has 9 missions that get longer with each one.  Sufficient(but at what price?)\n\nGRAPHICS\nBog-standard average graphics. The Space Marines are very good with attention to getting it right.\nBut the gene-stealers are a failure.  Look like Quake models - very primitive.\nThe Map is pretty good but you usually miss the fine detail because you are moving about\nCut-scenes are OK\n\nWORTH IT or NOT\nSadly the WarHammer40K fandom is used to over-paying for any WH40K content.\nThis falls under that category.  When you have finished the Campaign, you will have had enough.\nBut the tension during each mission is very good and it's a great feeling when you have won the mission.\nSolidly designed and if you are a WH40K fan, it's a solid gaming experience that is worth the time.\nFor non-WH40K fans - wait for a steam sale.  Relax and enjoy.\n\nRating\nI already gave you the rating - see above.  If you're obsessive about numbers, I mock you.

It is tactical, not strategic (in other words, you control individual marines and have short-term goals, instead of managing an empire and setting long-term goals). To me it captures very well the atmosphere of the Space Hulk boardgame and the challenges of surviving and completing a mission with limited resources.\n\nThe "can be improved": Mission selection can be confusing, I initially thought that the game only had 3 missions!. The "Continue" button does not advance to the next campaign, just to the next mission in the campaign (there are 3 campaigns and the first one has 3 missions).

The game itself comes down to figuring out how to push certain units through sometimes endless waves of enemies.

The slow-moving gun-toting Terminators and the vicious Genestealers. The main campaign is composed of a series of missions, each one with different objectives. There are many classes of Terminators which serve to spice up the gameplay such as the melee-crazed ones and those with a flamethrower.\n\nThe drawbacks are mainly with regards to animation, there are a few clipping issues and generally it doesn't hold up with games such as XCom or Fallout. Graphics are servicable but won't really require a lot of processing power, on the other hand of course it will run on decent laptops. I bought this while it was on a sale and if you like the concept, it may be worth picking up.","January 21, 2015","true","27.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What I wasn't expecting was a relatively poor metacritic score and a flurry of negative reviews, which effectively dissuaded me from purchasing it at the time.\n\nHowever, seeing the game go on sale at %80 discount I figured ♥♥♥♥ it, and picked it up anyway for £1.90.\n\nMan, never have I felt the need to defend a game so vehemently. I can pretty much sum up the negative reviews in one comment: fools who never bothered to read one sentence beneath the game's title and came up with "Hurrr! 40K! I can be haxxorz uber space marine! Derp derp derp..." As far as I am concerned, the game delivered *exactly* what it promised in a very short description. It is a slow paced, tactical, mission-based survival in line with the board game. Your squad move slowly because Terminators walk slowly. You die frequently because being outnumbered and in the dark only suits the Genestealers. Have people forgotten the movie Alien already?\n\nThe missions, while short, give a nice sense of having to overcome terrible odds by out-thinking your enemy. Each forray into the depths of the ship feel like gamble after gamble on the part of the Blood Angels. I feel the game does an excellent job of quashing the tired notion that Space Marines are invincible, by putting them in exactly the environment that cancels their prowess. I like the fact that they move slowly and have to spend AP just to turn around, because it highlights the weakness of their cumbersome armour in corridors they can barely squeeze through, and creates a feeling of vulnerability because let's face it: the Genestealers have the jump on you.\n\nThe game does not, however, ruin the Space Marine's reputation for sheer force of will. Your troops gladly stand unfaltering in the face of the enemy hordes, declaring faith for the emperor as they take down legions of aliens even as they meet their doom. A big criticism of the game from some reviewers is the gun-jamming mechanic, which seems petty, because it can only occur when the Marine's are set to overwatch mode. In a nut-shell, this stance allows you to literally gun down wave after wave of Genestealers as you stubbornly hold your ground. This is immensely satisfying, but as I mentioned it can cause your bolter to jam. For me, this only adds to the feeling of desperation that you cannot hold out forever and brings a touch of thrill and uncertainty because of the random chance.\n\nThe game isn't without it's faults. As I mentioned the missions can be quite short depending on the objective, and also quite quick (especially on hard mode with the timer) because you can often sacrifice your Terminators against the oncoming enemy to ensure completion of the goal. Again though, this adds to the desperation and realisation that this is almost a lost cause. The animations could use a little more variety too, especially in melee, because battle after battle can start to make all of your deaths feel the same. However, my largest criticism is the game is a touch on the easy side. This is mostly because the game tells you precisely where the enemy is likely to attack from. Because of this, you can set your marines to guard choke points whilst your other guys go off and find the goal. I would have prefered for there to be no indication of where the threat might appear, forcing the player to constantly watch their back to avoid being picked off one by one from the creatures in the dark...\n\nAll in all this is a top game undeserving of the flack it recieved. I am aware that some of this was due to bugs in the early access version but I can assure you that as of now, the version I'm playing is polished and has yet to throw up a single glitch. Highly recommended, and if you're unsure about what the gameplay might be like, you only need to go to the store page and read the game description.\n\nThe Emperor is your shield!","June 24, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is tactical, not strategic (in other words, you control individual marines and have short-term goals, instead of managing an empire and setting long-term goals). To me it captures very well the atmosphere of the Space Hulk boardgame and the challenges of surviving and completing a mission with limited resources.\n\nThe "can be improved": Mission selection can be confusing, I initially thought that the game only had 3 missions!. The "Continue" button does not advance to the next campaign, just to the next mission in the campaign (there are 3 campaigns and the first one has 3 missions). It is necessary to go further back and selecting the other campaigns.","January 2, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And that's the problem I think...\nLike a board game this game is actually rolling dice. Do I hit or miss? How many extra actions do I get? Does my gun jam? Can I get the door to open?\nI don't like having all these random factors determine how well I play. It works well for board games, but not so much for a PC game. I have no influence on the outcome of most things. I just place my models and hope for the best.\n\nThe Space Marines are (like their armors) incredible clunky to move around. Moving one around a corner and getting him to turn around seems like a chore. Again in a board game I would just pick the model up and place him.\n\nThe graphics are "nice" but nothing special. Frankly the 3D models looks a little dated. This game has only so many different models and models on screen at a time. I would have preferred a little more attention to polish. You especially notice this in the "action-scenes". The death animations are just sad. That is unacceptable for a game from 2013!\n\nAll that being said. Actual gameplay isn't bad per se. I disregard it was ever a board game and judge it on it's own merits. It's pretty exciting to manage your marines with the limited amount of actions each turn. A lot of planning and strategy is involved. It's more like a puzzle game in many ways. And that's it really.

It's been all that and more.\n\nSpace Hulk is a strategy and tactical game that emphasizes the strategy and tactics without adding lots of gimmicks or complicated options. Random dice rolls keep things a little unpredictable and can make a level easier or harder depending on which way they land. It's similar to other random + skill games like backgammon, cribbage, or other tabletop RPGs. I also liken it to Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea, Valkyria Chronicles, and Archon, as far as the importance of unit movement and positioning goes. The downside to its simplicity is that it can be a bit repetitive at times. To help with that, it offers the ability to speed up some of the animation, and later introduces units with different capabilities. The combination of units on any given level are predetermined, which creates different challenges like a limited number of ranged weapons compared to melee or finite ammunition weapons.\n\nI've seen several reviews and comments about the game being too hard and melee combat being nigh impossible (which it kind of is). Many of those players however, seemed to miss key elements of the game, or were trying to play it the wrong way. Much like how open combat must be avoided in the Metal Gear games, melee combat should be avoided in Space Hulk. But that's part of the strategy and tactics. There are several other aspects that a good RTFM takes care of, such as the rules for Genestealer movement, weapon ranges, and automatic weapon unjamming. It's definitely worth a read-through to avoid some frustrations while playing. It can be fun to figure out all the details of the rules through gameplay, but chances are that if you're the strategy/tactical gaming type, you'll eventually want to know all the quirks and check to see what you might have missed.\n\nFor me, each level takes about 30 to 60 minutes to play through; YMMV. Once you get the basics down, the relearning curve after putting down the game and coming back to it after a couple days or weeks is minimal. That makes it a great game for a somewhat casual gamer, but I've also given it multi-hour spans and gone through several levels at a time. I frequently forget that you can save the game in the middle of a level, but it just feels wrong to leave one in the middle uncompleted, especially given that 30 to 60 minute timeframe.\n\nMaybe it's just the way I set up my strategies, but most of my play throughs seem to be either dismal failures with perfect storms of consecutive horrible dice rolls against a single point of failure, or 100% clean-sheet victories with multiple redundant safeguards to ensure success. There are a handful of levels where I encountered the middle ground of escaping with half my space marines alive, and those levels are just begging for a replay.\n\nAside from random elements such as Genestealer spawning and dice rolls, some of the choices that can affect the outcome of a level are: What order should I deploy my units? Should I make a run for it or stand my ground? Will my melee unit be able to hold out long enough to protect my flank in this corridor? Do I have enough command points if my bolter jams and the number of enemies around the corner is 5 and not 3? Should I destroy that door for a longer line of sight, or leave it closed to delay my pursuers? If I turn this corner, will I have enough range to defeat the next wave, and what is the likelihood they will  be able to close to melee range and if so what are my chances of survival? If I lose my flank, will I still be able to clear the level?\n\nYou can look to other reviews to cover things like music and graphics and animation; I've no complaints with any of it. If you're looking for a fast-twitch gaming experience or a game where you can just hit "attack, attack, attack, defend, magic, attack" over and over, this isn't the game you're looking for. If you like puzzles, puzzle games, strategy and tactics games that require making correct choices in advance of where they become critical, planning, or tabletop games, then Space Hulk is worth purchasing. I don't remember what I paid for it duing the sale. $5? Definintely. $10? Sure. $20? Maybe if you're a Warhammer 40k fan or tabletop player.\n\nAnd a final note: A well executed Space Hulk level where your Terminators have their backs covered, plenty of command points on reserve, and clear lines of sight to mow down legions of Genestealers is incredibly satisfying. Hearing, "Bolter jammed" followed by, "Weapon functional. Flank secure" in that calm Terminator voice over a floor littered with the bodies of expired Genestealers and their blood, will be music to your ears.","September 12, 2014","true","25.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I loved the original ps1 version which is what got me into this in the first place. The most frustrating thing to the game in campaign mode is my terminators seem to die far too easily, especially when I've set them in either "guard" or "overwatch" mode and facing the direction of the potential threat. When I do this as a prudent commander should, a genestealer will most certainly almost always come around the corner, engage my terminator, and make swiss cheese of him...CONSTANTLY. And on the mission I happen to be stuck on; Messenger of Purgatory: Cleanse, which is the THIRD mission into the whole campaign, the mission is failed as soon as I lose ONE terminator. Overall a real stuck and deflating experience.\n\nEDIT: After playing it more extensively, I have come to enjoy it more but ONLY ON EASY settings. To play the game on anything higher in difficulty can be maddening as you just don't seem to have a fighting chance given gun jams and how your terminators can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn on normal difficulty or above.","November 12, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

When you complete the later missions you feel as if you truly earned the emperors respect because along the way you have to push forward against unimaginable odds, guard your key areas, and you WILL need to sacrifice many of your units just to get that one guy through that counts. I even sent a heavy flamer who ran out of ammo in the opposite direction as a decoy to lure the enemy away, he didn't get very far, but it was far enough that I could get the rest of the guys in a good position and win. That mission left me with 2 survivours out of 10 and 130+ of the enemy dead (If you've played this, you KNOW that's unheard of).\n\nSure, it's not perfect, there are no cutscenes, and the narration gives you very little to run on in terms of story. It's also overly dependant on luck which means you can have the best strategy and still lose (which I hear they vixed in ascension?) but most of the time you can "undo" your last move that missed and try again to even the odds a little (I only figured this out on the last campaign, wish I had known earlier).\n\nI got the ultimate pack with all the content while on special so I'm not sure what is original or DLC but the full package has at least 20 hours of game here if you're man enough to stick with it. Some of the later missions (harbinger of torment for example) have an absolutely insane difficulty and a single mission can take you over 4 hours to get right. Thankfuly you can save any time you like but trust me, it doesnt help as much as you think it would, especially if there is a turn limit on the mission.\n\nNote: Ascension is not the same missions with a new engine, it's a totally different game with no links to this one. I'm currently waiting for it to come on special but you can be sure I'll pick it up when it does. If it's even half as good as this, I'll be happy, and it's supposed to be better and with a lot more missions!","December 11, 2014","true","30.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Being a player of the tabletop games that this game is an expansion of, I felt that this game is worth the money, as aforementioned. I really liked the game mechanics, so I also enjoyed the single player campaign, even though it was quite short.\n\nI would give Space Hulk  :   8.5 / 10\n\nOne of the few problems with the game in my opinion are that the quite good DLC's that you can buy cost $5 a piece, and you need to spend $20 to buy the full campaign and even more to get other Chapters, banners, weapons and maps. However, The developers are doing a great job at bringing updates, regularly adding content. They are also very active and responsive on the steam forums.\n\nIf you liked this game, I would recommend XCOM: Enemy Unknown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 21, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It is pretty unforgiving to mistakes, and that is just fine with me.\n\nGreat game...10/10","June 23, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The developers of Space Hulk should play that and find out how this genre should be done.\n\nSpace Hulk itself is OK. Glitches (bullets firing into the void instead of down corridors, sometimes camera panning going in weird directions) and funky controls (click/drag to change direction can be easily accidentally triggered, especially when trying to move 1 sq forward/back, and ridiculously sensitive camera controls) take away from the experience.\n\nThe 3D graphics just aren't that good. The marines look OK, but the genestealers look like kids toys and the general quality is more 2003 than 2013. The graphics themselves make the game mechanics look stupid. Bullet trails passing through a corridor of enemies but only rolling against the first is an example.\n\nIn AA your marines persist between missions, increasing in rank and receiving awards. The 2D graphics are much more to the point and easier to interact with. The UI is vastly more intuitive and quicker to work with. It's just a better game even though it has the same mechanics. Space Hulk is not worth the full price (£19.99 at time of review).

Originally, Space Hulk was a board game that was released in the 80s and recieved very high critical acclaim. This success would later on adapt to Warhammer 40K, which has gained a massive following since its inception.\n\nThe game has several different campaigns with two of them being DLC. The missions are varied enough from destroying a certain room with a heavy flamer unit, to escort type missions, to even simply destroying the enemy.\n\nThe campaigns in Space Hulk follow the Blood Ravens, a chapter of the Space Marines, that are seeking revenge on the genestealers for acts against them nearly seven centuries ago. The genestealers are horrifying monsters with lightning fast movement and can tear through armor as though it were paper.\n\nAlthough not the best story I've seen in a strategy game, it is adequate enough considering that this game is an adaption of a board game from the 1980s.\n\nVisually, Space Hulk is appealing with its dark, mysterious setting. The Terminators look really cool and are modeled well as if they were Warhammer 40K action figurines themselves. The genestealers also look great and show inspiration from other works such as the Alien franchise. The maps are varied throughout the game and allow the player to play in several to different ways.\n\nThe gameplay itself is easy to jump into and plays exactly (from what I've observed) the same as the board game counterpart. You won't even need to look at the rules for Space Hulk as it is easy to just hop in and start playing with your friends or against the computer AI.\n\nThe problems. The game plays dreadfully slow even with the speed setting turned up all the way. Space Hulk only allows for most stages to have one or two ways of actually winning, often time with just placing units on overwatch, puppy guarding genestealer spawn points. The only unlockables in the game are used to customize your multiplayer banner, which you will sometimes recieve. It's a 25% chance really if you're playing on normal difficulty.\n\nSpace Hulk's developers are very engaged with their community however and I'm sure that within the future, we will see a few changes to Space Hulk and it's gameplay mechanics.\n\nAs a video game itself, Space Hulk might be something less than desirable from a strategy enthusiast. It's great adaption however of a classic board game and should be played like a board game. Not like the much more popular Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War series, which is an RTS, but a board game. I would wait for this one to go on sale for less than $20 and then grab it.

Looking forward to the rumoured bio-morphs for the genestealers to make them even nastier in MP - heheheh.\n\nRecent patches have added a lobby to the MP side of the game, allowing for greater flexiability in terms of match making.\n\nGraphics aren't the best, and occasionally still glitchy, but the developers are pretty helpful in the forums in terms of feedback and possible solutions.\n\nSpace Hulk didnt get the best reviews at launch due to its bugs and glitches, but has greatly improved over the journey, though I would recommend this game to mainly 40K and Space Hulk fans, as some one new to either might be put off by the games earlier 'issues'. If on sale, I would recommend to buy but not if they are still asking around $30.\n\nRating 7.5/10 for Space Hulk / 40K fans about 6/10 for other parties.","July 24, 2014","true","117.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's pretty much a pure port of the board game, which is probably the main issue I have with the PC game.\nI played the board game about 10 years ago and really enjoyed it, and this is a nice way to play the game if you don't have any humans nearby to play with. But, like chess or monopoly, the human interaction is part of the fun; playing against a computer is...well...souless.\n\nIn my opinion, what this game needed was some RPG elements, like gaining experience points to upgrade your squad, or a more engaging storyline. Something to elevate it beyond the boardgame in a way that compensates for that lack of human interaction.\nAs it is currently, there is no sense of attachment or engagement, which makes the level by level progression of the game feel a little unfulfilling.\nThe game also feels a bit too unfair - the terminators cannot move very much in a turn, their bolters jam at every oportunity, you have a 1 in 4 chance of winning/surviving close combat, the bolter has a 35% chance of killing in the first shot, and the more reliable weapons have very limited ammo. As far as I can see, your only option is to constantly play defensively: placing your men in key positions and setting them to "overwatch" or "guard"; which is difficult when playing an offensive mission.\nThe odds are against you, you will lose often (even in the early missions) and it will start to become boring after a while since it is a machine beating you, and not your buddy who you can laugh with afterwards. You also can't switch and play as the Genestealers in the campaign, so you are stuck as the lumbering terminators with unreliable weapons.\n\nIn short - if you want to play the Space Hulk board game alone, this is a good option. If you want a fulfilling gaming experience, move along. The regular price is a bit too much for what the game is. If you want to check it out, wait for a sale.","July 12, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yes, this is a faithful adaptation of the 1989 board game, right down to telling you exactly what the Space Marines and Genestealers rolled on their six-sided dice each turn.  And that's a problem.\n\nMovement grids, turns and six-sider-based combat mechanics are all  useful approaches to creating a game that can be run on the limited processing power available in a group of human players.  On a computer that could do so much more, it just seems rather pitiful.  The grid based movement and action point system make your tactical options very limited while the randomness of the six-sider engine ensures that even an optimal strategy can be overwhelmed in one or two turns of bad (simulated) rolls.  (And, conversely, sloppy strategy can still triumph, if the dice favour you.)\n\nIn the original game, seeing your squad crushed without recourse because the dice simply turned against you was an accepted part of play.  Playing with a group, seeing a friend suddenly get demolished by a run of bad luck could be a source of hilarity.  But playing solo, in a computer game that didn't need to rely on something as crude as a handful of d6s, allowing victory or defeat to lie in the hands of virtualized plastic cubes seems inexcusably lazy.\n\nThe setting is cool.  The graphics and sound are adequate.  But the mechanics of the board game needed a major overhaul to make the transition to a digital environment, and they didn't get it.","August 21, 2014","false","2.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The video game however? That is up for debate.\nAs a person who has never played the table top version of this game, I'm somewhat on a mid point opinion about the video game itself. It being a Warhammer 40k game, sure made me interested to buy it. But the gameplay itself?\nThe gameplay takes its roots from the table top version, as in, everything is decided by the dice roller. This offcourse can lead to massive ammounts of RAGE , when a unit of yours misses a door, in front of which it is standing of (literally, one tile away), more than one time, which can cause you to miss the entire turn for that unit, and any unit standing behind it (offcourse, when I say door, I mean on one of those mailfunctioning doors that need to be shot open, or knocked open). This can really screw up whatever strategy you might have come up with , which can increase the difficulty, or just make you have to replay the mission/game from the start.\nConcerning strategy, the game itself is placed within a Space Hulk (for those that do not know what that is, it's a massive, ancient, space ship, that is filled with tiny corridors (atleast for your Terminators (Space Marines with extremely special suits))). And this is the part what the game does really well, it really makes you feel claustrophobic. Terminators are slow, sluggish, bulky, and the corridors are really really small, wheareas genestealers are fast, agile, and come in large numbers. If you dont cover all accesses , you are going to get slaughtered in close combat. And loosing even a single Terminator can pretty much change the game outcome, whereas genestealers just keep coming and coming. But then again, if you zone in on the genestealer spawn zones, you are going to spend your game watching a cluster ♥♥♥♥, watching the same kill cam cinematic over and over.\nThe graphics are not anything special, theyre really lame , especially if you compare it with DoW 2 graphics. Animations are simplistic, literally 2-3 animations that just keep going on, and on, and on. But, atleast the character details are done well, the Terminators especially. BUT, Voice acting is awfull. Just awfull. You will hear one voice, with the same tone, throughout the entire game. Hello? We used to play DoW 1 and 2, and them both had great voice acting, so why limit us with such horrible voice acting in Space Hulk? I would have done a better job with Audacity. And even the sound effects in this game are stuttering, buggy, and sometimes even missing out. But that will probably/hopefully be patched with time.\nSIngle Player will get repetitive, and booring, after a while. The multiplayer however, mixes things up, because youre going up against another player, and in my opinion, a players intelligence > an artificial intelligence. And, there is some customization to be done, to the banner especially. But then again, who cares about banners?\nIn the end, this isnt a very good game. I'd give it a 6 out of 10, JUST because im a Warhammer 40k fan. I'd reccomend this game only to players who like the gameplay, and can cope with the lame graphics, effects, sounds, and pretty much everything else that isnt the gameplay itself.

Yes, this is a faithful adaptation of the 1989 board game, right down to telling you exactly what the Space Marines and Genestealers rolled on their six-sided dice each turn.  And that's a problem.\n\nMovement grids, turns and six-sider-based combat mechanics are all  useful approaches to creating a game that can be run on the limited processing power available in a group of human players.  On a computer that could do so much more, it just seems rather pitiful.  The grid based movement and action point system make your tactical options very limited while the randomness of the six-sider engine ensures that even an optimal strategy can be overwhelmed in one or two turns of bad (simulated) rolls.  (And, conversely, sloppy strategy can still triumph, if the dice favour you.)\n\nIn the original game, seeing your squad crushed without recourse because the dice simply turned against you was an accepted part of play.  Playing with a group, seeing a friend suddenly get demolished by a run of bad luck could be a source of hilarity.  But playing solo, in a computer game that didn't need to rely on something as crude as a handful of d6s, allowing victory or defeat to lie in the hands of virtualized plastic cubes seems inexcusably lazy.\n\nThe setting is cool.  The graphics and sound are adequate.

It is the feeling of "stopped time" that is so appealing to me. That I have the whole of eternity (or until my laptop battery dies) to decide the fate of my soldiers for the next turn. I prefer this to RTS because, frankly I do not like the save/load system that tries to compensate for some of the tactical/strategic mistakes one might make due to rash actions and/or lack of a proper plan. And also, it is the nervous tingling you get when watching the enemy turn unfold, this lack of control for a moment that creates excitement should your plan be successful or despair as you see your best strategy go to waste by a simple stroke of bad luck. In any good game, there must be a few factors that are uncontrollable, this is what makes it interesting after all. Turn-based strategies are great in this aspect, they give you full authority for a moment, just to take it away in the next, delivering it in to the hands of chance and enemy tactical sense. This is, after all, why chess has made it this far.\n\nPerhaps this is why I like "Space Hulk". No matter what table top fanboys might say - this game is deeply entertaining, true to the roots of best turn-based strategies like "Incubation: Time is Running Out", but it is criminally short. For a genre that is in agony (thanks to the latest XCOM, there is a faint hope of ressurection), this is like a bandage applied to an open wound.\n\nThe price is just right and do not listen to anyone who complains about it, this is way better than spending some US $200 on a Space Hulk starter kit from Games Workshop. Actually, I do not get people who play TT in digital age, or people who buy miniature plastic models for hundreds of dollars when 3D Printing and clay is practically widespread, I'm sorry. And this is despite the fact that I myself am guilty of buying things from GW in the past, but as it turns out, digital versions are much more entertaining and they are much (MUCH) cheaper too.\n\nA little more missions and wargear would have been nice. Actually, a lot more. Also, different chapter model and colour sets and perhaps more diversity in objectives. As for TT fanboys hating on it, if I was the developer, I would make two game modes, "TT faithful" and "Video Game oriented" (you might say /tg/ and /vg/ respectively) to keep everyone happy.

Not the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop strategy game - just plain ol' Space Hulk.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Space Hulk...  It was a spin-off from Warhammer 40,000.  It featured Space Marine Terminators making their way through cramped corridors and fighting Tyranid Genestealers.  Heavily turn-based.  Very slow-paced.  Not a whole lot in the line of character development or depth.  Think of it kind of like a 40k version of chess\n\nThe videogame does a good job of porting that to the computer, while updating the visuals to match what we've become accustomed to with recent Warhammer 40,000 releases.\n\nIt's still a slow-paced game.  Still heavily turn-based.  There's not much you customization or character development.  There isn't a whole lot of storyline.  You've got Terminators plodding through cramped corridors and killing Genestealers - just like the boardgame.\n\nIf you've enjoyed the boardgame and you're looking for something you can play solo, you'll probably be pretty happy with Space Hulk.\n\nIf you've been enjoying the other Warhammer 40,000 offerings on Steam and you're looking for your next hit, you'll probably be disappointed with Space Hulk.","November 18, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I played space crusade on board some time ago and I was expecting something like that, that could entertain me as a tactic strategy gamer. Despite being a DoW fanboy I found this game more focused on luck than on skill.\n\nThe corridors have one man wide, which could be as in the original, but cripples the chance of positioning an to cover your troops with other troops (like in chess), and this is needed because the weapons stuck 1/6 of the time. If that happend, when a genstealer manages to reach a regular troops, they are mostly dead. They could parry a hit or two, but the genstealers have a big amount of points to spend them on mele attacks. Your comander could survive a couple of hits, but its mostly dead the next turn also.\n\nI find it unforgiving because a tiny error in positioning can make you restart the level, but unlike XCom, I find this game cruel because everything can go wrong despite being doing a flawless strategy. That being said, I particularly don't enjoy the games where the hp of my troops are in binary (alive and death), so I enjoyed more Talisman, Bloodbowl (despite knowing barely the rules also) and Aarklash legacy (this one is not from GW but the french company rackham, which owns Confrontation) than this game. And about a tactic turn based game, XCom is as unforgiving as this one, but you have more tools to avoid being brutally murdered.\n\nMore things about the game: You can customize the look of your chapter through unlocking new stuff everytime you beat a mission. I also read in the reviews that the game looks unfinished, so clarify that a couple of weeks before the launch of the game I saw a video where they confess that they didn't finish the animations yet. OST is good, but the sounds may sound repetitive. The menus are fluent and cool. The intros for the missions are pretty apealing, because you can see the terrain you are going to fight in, with a voice talking about why you need to do that mission and marking you the important points. Brilliant inmersion wise.","August 7, 2014","false","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Perhaps not. Are the graphics going to blow you away ... probably not. Is the voice acting limited? Yup. Now, would I recommend it? Weirdly, for under £20, yes.\n\nThis is simply a faithful recreation of the Space Hulk board game, right down to the "oh, you have got to be kidding me" dice rolls, narrow corridors and Storm Bolters that seem to jam more often than a jam sandwich with added jam and a side-order of jam (1 in 6 odds btw); it can be frustrating and fun in equal measure at times. However, if you ever played the original board game, and enjoyed it (which I did), this is a worthwhile little game.\n\nIf not, and you feel like trying a fairly slow, turn-based tactical game set in the Warkammer 40k universe, give it a go - but possibly wait until it's on a Steam sale, this game is not to everyone's taste.","November 21, 2014","true","30.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Even then it's unpleasant to find that there's very little gameplay to be had before you're asked to shell out for more content. Not cool. The game itself I like - it's faithful to the board game and I'm forgiving of some of the little animation glitches and rawness here and there because of this - but they should have put a whole lot more into it before shoving in the paid-for content. Definitely wouldn't pay full price for this - if you don't already own it then Xcom Enemy Unknown would be a much better investment.","January 13, 2015","false","13.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Too much like a board game (I know it's roots so don't flame me, plz). I played Space Hulk on the Commodore Amiga and I liked it for it's play style: I would plan my movement and actions of my Terminators and the AI would plan for the Genestealers...but we both executed our moves at the same time and  I could actually control any one of my terminators! HUGE difference fighting for your life face to face with a Genestealer, lopping the top of their skulls off or, blood flying all over the inside of your helmet and you realize you are doomed BUT, if your Terminator has the heavy flamer, he can blow himself up and take nine squares (and anything in those squares) up in a conflagration of fire!\nYeah, to me, this game doesn't have none of that. Can't fault the devs, they made SH beautiful and not one crash. For anyone who loves the board game, you may love it. For anyone who played SH on the Amiga, pray that one of the dev's come across it and copies it's gameplay.\n\nI would give it a "C" for atmosphere and gameplay.\n\nI know it's clice' but, "I really wanted to like this game" but was spoiled by my Amiga.","June 7, 2015","false","14.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This was never the intention, instead, Full Control's faithful recreation of the classic boardgame is in fact one of Space Hulk's greatest strengths to a true Space Hulk fan.\n\nGenestealers, the environments, and each individual terminator, are rendered in intricate detail, right down to Terminators being adorned with swinging scolls and battle honours, along with realistic lighting and shading effects on terrain and units. Both Terminators and Genestealers are fully animated and life-like in their movements, and these animations are accompanied by fantastic audio and a fitting sound track.\n\nA faithful and beautifully designed recreation of the original Space Hulk.

Tactical RTS, shoot-em-up or puzzle. Corridor builds make it pretty straight forward, and usually allowing only one way to play the level, which doesn't leave anything to replayability in the campaign. Just click, like you were meant to click, or you will die. The random things though, can always kill you, meaning that no matter the skill - you can still loose due to the weapons jamming or just missing stuff, or winding up dead with your melee character that just rolls a bad number. Movement tends to get used to as well. Only thing this game gives, is some nice Warhammer setting. Though it has buggs, like sometimes sound of autocannon not playing or shooting wrong direction (visually). Overall, I'd give it about 6/10. If you are a fan of the universe - 7/10, and 8/10 if you are a fanatic. Because the title rides on the story and setting. I reviewed the SP part only, so if you are looking for competetive multiplayer, it might be better.

Same mechanics, not anything else. No persistent campaign characters, no unit veterancy, no choosing squad loadouts. Just Space Hulk. Whether that is any good depends on whether you like Space Hulk or not.  With its simple campaign it doesn't compare well with X-Com, and it doesn't want to, so don't come expecting that. If you arent familiar with the board game, then you would feel like could probably spend your money just as well elsewhere, but if you buy this you will find some very neat mechanics and streamlined gameplay. Playing vs a human opponent with the space marine turn timer is the best way to do it, as the timer and encroaching horde of aliens makes for great tension.\n\nAs for the single player, it isn't too difficult, and the AI is forgiving. It seems more geared to keeping you interested than winning, as it will gleefully send single aliens to their death for no benefit, so if you dont mess up your overwatch, only some REALLY bad luck will lose you the game.\n\nThanks to recent patches this game is, as far as I have seen, as bug free as any game gets. They also now have an animation speed slider so if you find the animations a bit slow then you can speed that right up.  The dev seems to keep the game fairly well supported so far.\n\nOverall probably not something for everyone, but if you are a 40K fan, enjoy board games, or turn-based strategy then this game is worth a look.","January 6, 2014","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Tactical RTS, shoot-em-up or puzzle. Corridor builds make it pretty straight forward, and usually allowing only one way to play the level, which doesn't leave anything to replayability in the campaign. Just click, like you were meant to click, or you will die. The random things though, can always kill you, meaning that no matter the skill - you can still loose due to the weapons jamming or just missing stuff, or winding up dead with your melee character that just rolls a bad number. Movement tends to get used to as well. Only thing this game gives, is some nice Warhammer setting. Though it has buggs, like sometimes sound of autocannon not playing or shooting wrong direction (visually). Overall, I'd give it about 6/10. If you are a fan of the universe - 7/10, and 8/10 if you are a fanatic. Because the title rides on the story and setting. I reviewed the SP part only, so if you are looking for competetive multiplayer, it might be better. Seeing as human player is always the best opponent, and this game might be mainly tailored for that after all?","August 26, 2013","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Go get a soda instead.\n\nReview:\nHonestly... I have been craving space hulk since it came out, thinking OMFG this is nice.\n\nThe story of the game is pretty lacking, but then again so was the original board game.\nWhat ticks me off, is the chance to hit, the lack of strategy, the horrible control method and the fact that in the tutorial my guys die in 1 hit from the enemy, and the specific mission no matter how i tried, they were gonna take a hit.\n\nThere is most likely a way to finish it, but it gives you two space marines versus atleast 15 randomly generated and positioned tyrranids. The first guy is placed behind a broken door and if I destroy the door in order to move i'll be much closer to atleast one of the xenos beasts, and even if i manage to take out the first 3 or 4 the 5th is going to take me out.  So i decided not to destroy the door. Figured, let the tyrranids do it and then i'll be waiting there with my massive gun.\n\nMy guy missed the tyrranid with a freaking storm bolter on a distance less than 2 meters away, tyrranid steps in and one hits my terminator. I tried this mission 3 or 4 times and then i just gave up. There were no other alternatives to what i did, there was just too much random chance in the matter.\n\nStrategy != random chance. you may have some random elements or procedurally generated content to make the game renewable and interesting.. But in this game it is really all about getting lucky.\n\nconclusion: not interesting and just horribly made.","November 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","3"

Never have I seen such a convoluted mess trying to play a game; the "Action Points" system is totally whacked, the animations are goofy-looking and worst of all, the controls are terrible.

Its pretty much only going to appeal to either a hardcore TBS fanatic or a hardcore Warhammer 40k fanatic...or both.  But I really enjoy it, I have found pretty decent replayability as well.  I was worried about that at first but It seems my worries were put to rest as soon as i ran through the game a second time and found that nearly each stage was a completely different experience than the first run through.  Im not too sure about the multiplayer as I have yet to get a match beyond the lobby going.  But the AI seems good enough a half dozen play throughs at least and the DLC was pretty good too.

Having owned pretty much every version of Space Hulk over the years, i'm glad to see its a faithful reproduction of the board game. Managed to complete the tutorial missions during the first hour without any difficulty (having played the board game lots probably helped), but it served its purpose to get me into the game once more after having not played it for years. Had just enough time in the first hour to play the first and well known, Suicide Mission - completed it but lost one team member due to overenthusiastic flaming! Oh well. (Just missed the achievement!)\nOverall, i'm looking forward to playing this game more and gunning down xenos from one end of the space hulk to the other.\n\nFifth Hour - Making steady progress through the first supplied campaign - on the fourth mission. Loving the sound of the assault cannon, very thematic. Generally enjoying the ambience of the game as mentioned earlier, the game feels claustrophobic and very much like the board game I knew and loved. The game has some fun achievements to try and earn if that's your bag.\nI like the slow clunky movements the tactical dreadnought armour makes - but if you find it too slow, you can always speed up the animations. Also had a few instances where I misclicked the wrong move - the undo feature on the interface is very useful in that regard.\nAlso enjoying the ability to view the tactical map (reminds me of the board game even more) and rotate/zoom the view to catch all sorts of interesting angles. Overall, still very much enjoying it.\n\nTenth Hour - Still finding it enjoyable and about halfway through the first campaign, mining it for achievements, getting one of them took a little while and multiple replays - but yes. Not much else to say. Saw the assault cannon blow up in game by rolling a triple on the dice following a reload. Sad times.\n\nGameplay - 7 / 10\nIf you liked the board game (not Death Angel, which is way different) - you'll probably like this game. If you haven't played Space Hulk before and are interested in a slow paced strategy / puzzle game pitting man against ferocious alien - its worth a try.\n\nMusic / Sound - 7 / 10\nMusic is very orchestral and keeps in the theme with the Warhammer 40,000 universe, as do the speeches the marines quote as the move or gun down the enemy. Listening to the Genestealers scream as they get gunned down is very reminiscient of Aliens.\n\nDifficulty - 7 / 10\nIf you're a veteran of strategy games, this one is reasonably challenging but there are harder games out there. I'm currently playing it on Hard (which gives you timed turns and limited command points) and finding it enjoyable without too much struggle.\n\nLongevity - 7 / 10\nAs mentioned above, by the tenth hour - I am halfway through the campaign but i've replayed a few levels to get the achievements which means you could probably be this far in perhaps 6 hours or less if achievements don't interest you. Based on my progress, I reckon the game will offer you perhaps 18-20 hours of gaming, not including DLC or replays for achievements.\n\nOverall - First Hour 8/10.\nFifth Hour 8/10\nTenth Hour - 7/10","June 4, 2014","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rules are taken from its precursor, board game. Good turn-based strategy, which gives long play and a lot of fun. About 6-7 DLCs, but onyl 4 are with missions. Other are skins and additional team.\n\nTeam planning/arming: Generally, it's based on preset settings of squads. No possible to rearm or reconfigure teams. No editor for missions. This is minus of this game. There is no progress for characters also. It means, each mission you start with the same preset characters and weapons. There is DLC called "Wolves chapter" which gives other one team, more prepared for close combat. And it gives more fun of playing, even if you finish campaing. But still, no possible to adjust or rearm team.\n\nMissions: Be prepared for more costs if you want to get more missions. Basic campaign got 12 missions. DLCs cost much, and gives you about 3-5 missions. To recompensate it I can tell than missions last long time, about hour sometines. And to finish it you have to play many times to find out good way how to make it.\n\nBugs: But this game is fixed often and refined to the top. A lot of bugs/issues which you will find in forum, was already fixed. I didn't experience any problems.\n\nAI: There is only sometimes AI "hanging", by stopping units in some corner, piling up and waiting. But this is not often, and happens in some missions in some cases only. The game very depends on AI pressure. So if there are not units running on you or spawning on your path, game from hard tension massacre changes for a walk. So, in some missions you struggle for survive but in some you have a heavy armored terminators just walking from entry to exit through whole map, maybe killing something on pass, but then you even do not notice a threat.\n\nLong play: Prepare youself for long and hard play. Even in normal level, it is hard to finish base campaing. It took for me about two weeks to make it. One missions can last from 20 minutes to more than 1 hour.\n\nRules/chances: This game is based on dice rolls. It means all the time you can calculate your probability of kill/miss. Even if it looks like "chess" play, due to fixed number of action points, it has got command points and some random behaviour of opponent. It gives you mission not exact the same all time. However, playing a mission is kind of following general stratecic plan which is based on calculations. So it's "chess" plus some luck.\n\nCheats: You don't need any cheats in the game. This game got already cheat inside. By making "undo" on you action you can repeat last dice roll. In example, you move and shoot. When you miss, you can "undo" and repeat it untill you will not get it success. Real good players do not make it. Me also. And it pist me off that this possibility is, because it's not quite fair and good. It induces you, so sometimes you will want to use it. It is up to you. Play normal and "fair", or repeat every move many times.\n\nGraphics: It is not the main case for such kind of game. Some predefined scenes for action like shoot/kill/die are shown where character is doing something. More its like top view of map. It is nice that this top view is not exactly ortogonal, but king of twisted which gives more expression on it. You can't rorate it freely rather than that, you can turn by full 90 degrees.\n\nClimate: It is dark and deep climatic game, where you can feel terror and panic struggle for survive. Some actions require to sacrifice someone on mission. But even then you can try to save the character in very drastic situation. So this is fun.\n","June 13, 2014","true","81.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaigns are very atmospheric first time through.  Not much fun in repeat visits, once you've cracked a campaign theres not much satisfaction going back through it again.  Multiplayer is ok but each map seems to have a distinct advantage to one side or the other.  Its good not to have a timer for each turn so you can spend a bit of time typing banter into chat.   Theres no skill tree or advancement or even equipment choice for your marines, they come as they are.  But that makes for very balanced and challenging combat.  It can be frustrating when you know your doing all the right things but the dice just won't give you a break.  But you can't odds bad luck as the bookies say.

The underlying mechanics use simulated D6 rolls and the mission maps for the main campaign are even ripped straight from the manual.  Hard to say if it was GW or the devs, but there was some missed room for improvement and refinement of the formula.\n\nThere are no hybrids or patriarchs as in the original, instead we have the broodlords form the newer version.  It reduces the variety for anyone wanting to play genesteelers, but I suppose it makes it easier to balance.  Ultimately, there isn't too much room for strategy on the geensteeler side, which is why it's fitting the campaign plays from the Terminator's perspective.\n\nIf you enjoy the boardgame or have nostalgia for the original, there's something here to enjoy.

Lack of variety of enemies is a little disappointing, but the missions are varied enough that the game remains challenging and interesting, with some very intense scrapes if you push for some of the achievements.\n\nIts a little disappointing that you only get to use terminators, as they start to feel very plain, especially against the very scary genestealers - you almost forget what killing machines they actually are in the broader 40k conext.  I'd love for Full Control to get a chance to remake space crusade, so that we could use a wider variety of units - scouts and space marines as well as terminators against the likes of the orks, eldar and chaos as well.\n\nI hope there is a long tail of content for this game, more campaigns and hopefully a map editor and painter tools for custom campaigns.

Anyone who played Vengence Of The Blood Angels on the Amiga/3D0/Sega Saturn will look at this with a sense of nostalgia, but ultimately thats the whole problem with Space Hulk.\n\nThis game is old skool.  unless you are prepared for an old skool (with a k because its THAT old skool) turn based combat game that IS NOT FAIR, then yes, you will love it, but I think that todays gamers will see this as an inferior product to X:Com as they expect something more visually stimulating and engaging, and to be honest, I can understand the numerous comments about bolter jaming....\n\nIf anything, this is an incredibly faithful conversion of the old board game, of which I am a fan (40k and all its incarnations od spin offs are, in general, brilliant as a social past-time) but it shows not only its age, but the age of the actual board game with the limited rule system and the fact that its just not fair.  The AI is meant to throw everything at you.  No learning where they attack from, no, random encounters, multiple deaths and much swearing will ensue....\n\nYou would think someone (Games Workshop?) would come up with rules for development of a bolter that doesnt jam, or at least a method of investing points into keeping your equipment working.  Simple touches like that would expand the playability of this.  as faithful as it is, its showing its age.   A much needed revamp by GW is needed before anyone considers trying to put it on a computer or console.  I love space hulk for its atmosphere, and its nice to see some investment after the horrible THQ situation, but we want multiplayer FPS based missions with the ability to develop a character in the 40K universe, and this is just a nod to nostalgia.\n\n","June 27, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thorvindr/recommended/242570/","thorvindr","thorvindr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thorvindr/","361 products in account","Meh. A bit of a retro take on the 40K IP. Apparently, Space Hulk was one of the original Warhammer 40k board games, and was released in 1989. I can't be sure (having never played the board game), but I bet this PC version is exactly like it.\n\nIn a departure from recent entries into the W40K series of games, Space Hulk goes back to the game's turn-based roots. I don't know if anybody remembers Chaos Gate, but this feels a lot like that. You deploy a handful of Space Marine Terminators (for those not familiar with 40K, a Terminator is a decorated veteran Space Marine that gets to wear huger armor and is therefore able to carry even blammier weapons) to undertake missions against swarms of Tyranid Genestealers.\n\nAs far as gameplay, there's not a lot of variety, and absolutely nothing innovative or unique. This is essentially the same as the old Fallout series. The different missions keep things interesting enough, but the fact that there is just the one type of enemy is a bit of a let-down. Don't get me wrong; it's fun to mow down hordes of Genestealers. But it gets old. It would be nice to throw in the ocassional... I dunno. something else.\n\nThe tactics of the game are fairly straightforward, with little (that's not to say "no") room for variation. Cover your flanks, spend your action points carefully and make sure you leave your outward-facing dudes in overwatch mode.\n\nSo, not a "bad" game, but I was expecting a lot more out of a modern re-vamp of a twenty-four-year-old board game. An XP system to improve my marines would be nice, and needn't be very complicated to be very satisfying (something along the lines of small accuracy bumps or die-roll bonuses). Some variation in units (both friendly and enemy) would also have been nice.\n\nWhile I do recommend this game, I don't recommend paying full price for it. To be honest, I think you'd be better off to find a copy of the actual board game. Good luck with that, but I think it would be far more rewarding than this PC port. At least you'd get the excitement of rolling dice and the ability to change the rules to make the game more interesting after the third or fourth go-around.\n\nSo if you're a huge fan of 40K, you'll probably enjoy this trip down memory lane. If you're a fan of squad-based tactics, you'll find something to occupy yourself for a few hours. If you're neither of those things, don't bother. I can't imagine ever buying any of the DLC for this game, and I'll be shocked if the developer ever gets to make anything else for Games Workshop.","December 20, 2013","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's for people who like the board game, or want to try it out and don't want to drop $250 on a physical copy off eBay.  If you have no idea how Space hulk works, you probably shouldn't even bother. You'll just be frustrated by the randomness of the whole thing.\n\nThat said, I really enjoy it. I didn't at first, however. If you have no idea of what you do in Space Hulk, the game will feel impossible as a single Genestealer completely rips apart half your squad in one turn. Space Hulk is a dice game, where luck is a major factor. Where in the actual game, missing 5 shots in a row as your friend slowly advances a Genestealer would be just hilarious, in the video game it just becoems frustrating. Or if your weapon jams 4 times in a row.\n\nAnimations are slow for the Terminators. So you're probably best disabling the timer, as slow animaation aren't something you have to deal with in the actual game. you can speed them up, but they just look silly. The first-person shoulder cam is cinematic, but isn't used often enough, and needs an option to be bigger. Graphics-wise, it's nothing too impressive. The astetics are perfect, you really feel like you're trundling through the tight corridors of a space hulk. Sounds are good, but possibly repetative over time. I'm mostly listening to something else when I play, so I don't notice.\n\nThere are a few differenced from the board game. They don't really hurt the game, in my opinion though. They just help ease some of the frustrations.\n\nTL;DR, If you like the board game, or like the Warhammer 40k universe, and don't mind the random element, you will probably enjoy this.  Otherwise, you may want to stay away.","December 25, 2013","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each have their own little bits and pieces that make the game shine out a bit.  The old one had the first person shooter (kind of) and presented another aspect of the game rather than just strategy.  This new one lacks that part, but seems to be a bit more challenging with its strategy.  I generally don't compare graphics as that is "all natural" to have better graphics than yester-year.\n\nI wish they did have something that would allow you to grow your fellow terminators however.  A leveling system for each terminator would be great to have so it doesn't seem so "same same" and ruin the replay value of the game......","December 30, 2013","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can safely ignore the metacritic score, if you ever paid attention to it, for this reason. The game is fully functional at this point.\n\nThis game is very similar to the XCOM games, except that the game is set in the War40k universe. You command a small squad or squads to wander the decaying halls of a space hulk. Your enemy is the Tyranid race, specifically Genestealers. The area is really cramped, and you are forced to send your squad through the halls one at a time, covering the flanks and rear. The mood is very tense, and you can be sure that you are not at all safe.\n\nYou will probably die a lot until you figure out how to optimally position your squad. The UI is really simple and clean, so that will not be an issue. You gun will jam frequently due to the fact that enemies have a tendency to start pouring out of nowhere en masse whenever they feel like it. This will leave you vulnerable, unless you learn to prepare. Any enemy coming within melee range has about a 60% chance of killing you.\n\nBasically, this is a Space Hulk game. If you know what that is, you know everything there is to know about this game. It's a digital recreation of the game with voice acting, which is alright.\n\nThe game's standard price is a little bit high.","December 20, 2013","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like the WH40k universe, you are more likely to be forgiving of any perceived shortcomings. It is a digital reproduction of a boardgame; if you don't like boardgames or their mechanics, you might not like this. There are dice rolls, meaning luck is involved. If that bothers you, perhaps this game is not for you. It is turn based, meaning planning and tactical thought are essential to victory. This game is about close quarters battle in very confined spaces. This results in a very particular style of play which may not appeal to everyone. Tension is only elevated and enhanced by the element of randomness and luck. Your opinion may differ, if so....I think you already know the answer.\n\nPut yourself in the mindset of a Space Marine. You are not failing if you lose Marines. If the objective is accomplished by the last man, victory is yours. Space Marines are supposed to die, they expect to die. Get out of the mindset of preserving your squad...the deaths do not carry over to the next mission. If a Marine holds a corridor alone and ends up overwhelmed, but in so doing bought enough time for the mission to be accomplished? Victory. Preserve your strength if you can, but do not be afraid to spend the lives of your Marines if it leads to victory. Fear only failure.\n\nLook to your battle gear and it will protect you.\nWe guard it with our lives.\nAs your armour guards your life.\nAs it has my fallen brethren.\nHonour the craft of death.\nWe serve only the Emperor.\nHonour the battle gear of the dead.\nWe ask only to serve.","December 22, 2013","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far the game seems to capture the feel of 40K pretty well.  It is kind of like the Dawn of War series in that regard, but focused solely on Terminators and Genestealers.  Hopefully they will expand the game in the future using other units and/or races from 40K (which were given some rules in old White Dwarf articles.)\n\nIf you don't know about warhammer 40K or Space Hulk, this is still a very good squad based game.  It is turn based, which until recently had been hard to find.  While I believe something like XCOM is a better turn based squad game, this one is also quite good, but limited compared to that game.  There in not advancement, force management, or other features.  This is pure turn based mission execution.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a turn based squad game.

Rules are taken from its precursor, board game. Good turn-based strategy, which gives long play and a lot of fun. About 6-7 DLCs, but onyl 4 are with missions. Other are skins and additional team.\n\nTeam planning/arming: Generally, it's based on preset settings of squads. No possible to rearm or reconfigure teams. No editor for missions. This is minus of this game. There is no progress for characters also. It means, each mission you start with the same preset characters and weapons. There is DLC called "Wolves chapter" which gives other one team, more prepared for close combat. And it gives more fun of playing, even if you finish campaing. But still, no possible to adjust or rearm team.\n\nMissions: Be prepared for more costs if you want to get more missions. Basic campaign got 12 missions. DLCs cost much, and gives you about 3-5 missions. To recompensate it I can tell than missions last long time, about hour sometines. And to finish it you have to play many times to find out good way how to make it.\n\nBugs: But this game is fixed often and refined to the top. A lot of bugs/issues which you will find in forum, was already fixed. I didn't experience any problems.\n\nAI: There is only sometimes AI "hanging", by stopping units in some corner, piling up and waiting. But this is not often, and happens in some missions in some cases only. The game very depends on AI pressure. So if there are not units running on you or spawning on your path, game from hard tension massacre changes for a walk. So, in some missions you struggle for survive but in some you have a heavy armored terminators just walking from entry to exit through whole map, maybe killing something on pass, but then you even do not notice a threat.\n\nLong play: Prepare youself for long and hard play. Even in normal level, it is hard to finish base campaing. It took for me about two weeks to make it. One missions can last from 20 minutes to more than 1 hour.\n\nRules/chances: This game is based on dice rolls. It means all the time you can calculate your probability of kill/miss. Even if it looks like "chess" play, due to fixed number of action points, it has got command points and some random behaviour of opponent. It gives you mission not exact the same all time. However, playing a mission is kind of following general stratecic plan which is based on calculations. So it's "chess" plus some luck.\n\nCheats: You don't need any cheats in the game. This game got already cheat inside. By making "undo" on you action you can repeat last dice roll. In example, you move and shoot. When you miss, you can "undo" and repeat it untill you will not get it success. Real good players do not make it. Me also. And it pist me off that this possibility is, because it's not quite fair and good. It induces you, so sometimes you will want to use it. It is up to you. Play normal and "fair", or repeat every move many times.\n\nGraphics: It is not the main case for such kind of game. Some predefined scenes for action like shoot/kill/die are shown where character is doing something. More its like top view of map. It is nice that this top view is not exactly ortogonal, but king of twisted which gives more expression on it. You can't rorate it freely rather than that, you can turn by full 90 degrees.\n\nClimate: It is dark and deep climatic game, where you can feel terror and panic struggle for survive. Some actions require to sacrifice someone on mission. But even then you can try to save the character in very drastic situation. So this is fun.\n","June 13, 2014","true","81.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you come in expecting a fully fleshed out, original stratagy game like X-Com but with a 40K theme then you'll be sadly disapointed. However, as a boardgame replica it does a very good job.\n\nThe graphics are rather un-polished and the animation speed is a bit slow on the defiault setting (you can change this in the options menu) but it does what it's suposed to.\n\nPersoanlly I don't think it's worth the $30 asking price, but if you can grab it on sale and are a fan of the physical game then it's probably worh it. I cant stress this enough: If you've never heard of spacehulk beofre now this game will probably not be for you! You will probably hate it if that's the case, so be warned! If however you are a fan of the original and don't mind the steep price for what it is then you may very well enjoy it.\n\nMy largest complaints are the steep price tag and the DLC which seems a little too costly as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CNYGamer/recommended/242570/","CNYGamer","CNYGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CNYGamer/","62 products in account","There have been a large number of negative reviews for this game. In terms of the arguably too-early release of the game, I can't speak to that. I understand there were major bugs when it was released. I came a bit late to the party and by the time I bought Space Hulk it was in 1.3 and I have witnessed no bugs.\n\nIn terms of the negative reviews that imply the game is boring, to that I can say this: Space Hulk is a computer implementation of a BOARD GAME. Yes, a board game that has turns and die rolls and a big rulebook and moves about as quickly as you would expect a board game to move. So in the same way that no reasonable consumer should expect a computer implementation of Monopoly to be fast-paced and action-packed, the same expectation should hold for Space Hulk. IF YOU DON'T LIKE BOARD GAMES IN GENERAL OR THE SPACE HULK BOARD GAME IN PARTICULAR THEN YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS GAME. It is not a "translation" or a "computer game inspired by the board game." It is a direct, rule-for-rule, turn-for-turn implementation of the Space Hulk board game. If you do like board games in general or the Space Hulk board game in particular then you likely will find a lot of fun here. As a lifelong board game enthusiast and Space Hulk lover, I find this game to be near perfect.\n\nThe $29.99 price tag on the game is, in my opinion, reasonably worth it.

When it came to Steam, I didn't hesitate.  But for non-hardcore fans, there are a few things you should be aware of about this version.  First, it's short.  The last patch added new campaigns, but it can all be finished in about  10 hours.  There's not a lot of replay value.  Second, there's no level editor (at least not at the time of this review).  That would make a difference - the board game is all about creating new scenarios/campaigns to play with friends.  For twitch gamers, take note this is turned base.  There are persistent bugs, like the ability to undue a failed attack and try again, that still need to be patched.  And if you know the boardgame, well don't expect the same flexibility with the rules engine in the software.  Goals and actions are limited.  AI seems basic (hunt and seek) - even just the addition of AI flanking would have made for a more rewarding challenge.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I recommend this, at least when Steam does a price drop on it.   The sound is phenomenal, the bass is massive reverb (rapid firing a machine gun against a swarm of Genestealers will definitely move something on your desk),  the atmosphere is really well established.  It's just that it could have been so much more, and leave you wanting rather than satisfied.\n\n\nHowever, it is fairly true to the gameplay","December 1, 2013","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaigns are very atmospheric first time through.  Not much fun in repeat visits, once you've cracked a campaign theres not much satisfaction going back through it again.  Multiplayer is ok but each map seems to have a distinct advantage to one side or the other.  Its good not to have a timer for each turn so you can spend a bit of time typing banter into chat.   Theres no skill tree or advancement or even equipment choice for your marines, they come as they are.  But that makes for very balanced and challenging combat.  It can be frustrating when you know your doing all the right things but the dice just won't give you a break.  But you can't odds bad luck as the bookies say.

You get 2 campaigns for the asking price, and the rest of them are being sold in a micro-transaction store. 80% of the game available at release is being held back to gouge you.

But, not a great deal more either.\n\nI had a bunch of friends in High School who got really into W40K and so I bought a few models myself.  While I loved building my armies, I could never get into the game, It was far too complicated and time consuming. However, the tight claustrophobic, squad based battles of space hulk were loads of fun to me.\n\nIf you are looking for a game oozing with atmosphere, while being as simplistic and easy to understand, then this game is for you.\n\nIf you want pages of charts and stats, and a steep learning curve that take months or years to master then poke on over to something else.  While the game has many weapons and abilities to aid your strategies, it is still at it's heart a board game, meant to be easily understood, and enjoyed in quick bites.","July 4, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After finishing the Campaign im a little disappointed. It graps the the board game feeling but it had potenial for much more. So it is's only the basic box of Space Hulk.\n\nPositive:\n- The Game sticks to the board game rule (I belief Version 3 Rules)\n- The graphic and sound is ok\n\nNegative:\n- Compared with other Warhammer games the visuals are bad.\n- No Map editor ( Sorry but that should be a basic and important part of the game)\n- The basic game has only 12 mission plus 3 tutorial  (playtime 9-15 hour). For more maps you have to buy DLC's.\n- The control is sloppy and slow ( Even if you set the animation to "very fast" and switch off the action camera)\n- AI is not good and you can't set the difficult rate of the AI\n- Multiplayer looks unfinished\n- No play by mail option or Asynchronous Multiplayer\n- A league and player names world be nice\n- Many small bugs\n\nRecommendation:\nThis Game mostly for Space Hulk and Turn-Based Games fans. If you want to try it wait for 75% to 80% Steam Sale. I bought the game for 11 € with all DLC's this seems a fair price for this game. Normal Price for this game is overpriced.
