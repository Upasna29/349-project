I was skeptical at first reading about the whole "castles in the sky" theme, but after seeing the hand-drawn backgrounds and maps I was instantly transported to the Highlands. Pairing that with the superb background music made for a very good first impression.\n\nIn terms of game-play, let me split it into two parts:\n- pre-update 1.1\n-post-update 1.1\n\nIn pre-update 1.1, there were many instances where the combat felt slightly unrealistic. For example, a 22 HP character could be out-damaged by a 4 HP swarm bot (pretty much a low-level grunt). Combat itself lacked variety, as it was simply a game of numbers with a lot of luck involved. Think a D&D and Risk hybrid. There were a few areas that needed improvement in hindsight, but didn't affect the game TOO much. The storyline itself is your typical strategy game type of story; just enough to motivate you to complete a level, but not deep enough to be praised. Overall, it was a game that may have been ready to exit Early-Access, but definitely needed some more work.\n\nIn post-update 1.1, nearly all of the problems I mentioned above were addressed, with most of them fixed completely. Combat has been diversified, with smarter AI, combat abilities such as double strike, as well as strategic abilities outside of combat. The field kit is a nice addition, providing that extra health boost in tight situations. The narrower damage range means that the minimum damage output of all units is more reliable, and more realistic. What may have been slightly too ridiculous (like the swarm bot mentioned above; D&D + Risk) is now a fun twist on the classic territory strategy game. With added tooltips, something that I didn't necessarily feel was lacking, the game has moved to a point where I personally feel is definitely ready for all strategy-loving Steam users to enjoy.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to note that Burrito Studios added another update on June 10th, with even more bug fixes and tooltips. This kind of dedication speaks to the work ethic of not only the studio but the developers as well.\n\n","June 14, 2015","true","7.5"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","46","48","0","2"

It's a good game but feels unfair (And thus frustrating) due to the heavy influence of luck. If the balancing issues are tended to it will make it better.\n\nVerdict - 6.8/10 - GoodStory - 7/10 - Good\nCombat - 6/10 - Decent\nGraphics - 8/10 - Great\nMusic - 6/10 - Decent\nSound - 6/10 - Decent\nLevel Design - 8/10 - Great\n\n\n\nPros:+ Great Graphics (Crisp Disney style)\n+ Good Storyline (And some good characters too)\n+ Good Level Design (The levels are fun to play through but the sheer artificial difficulty really spoils it...)\n+ Good Progression\n+ A few Good Mechanics\n+ Decent Music (Ambience style but nothing special)\n+ Decent Sound\n+ Runs on any machine (And probably any phone/tablet... See below)\n+ Has potential but needs balancing\n\n\nCons:- Simple combat (Limits the players options and any room for tactics)\n- No voice acting (Normally I wouldn't care but due to focus on story I feel this point has worth)\n- Way too luck based to consider any involvement of 'skill'\n\n\n\nAdditional Information:\nIt's unfortunate really, I'd love to play on if the game would let me but, it doesn't...  I can't get past the 3rd level in the Easiest difficulty (which is Normal - you have a choice between Normal and Hard). The game itself is fun but, the severe balance issues this game has pretty much makes it unplayable...\n\nIt's clear that the developers have really taken their time with this game though and it's obvious that something happened during the play-testing and none of the balance issues were either reported or fixed. Now you're probably sitting there thinking "Well it's just that your bad, the game has fine balance", when it comes to games that have such a heavy focus on Luck, you can't use that excuse. The only way to get through this game is to use the Auto-save feature and only proceed after you have achieved the best possible outcome from every fight... That's just a plain grind.\n\nI'll talk about the good things it does though, the graphics are - like I said -  a crisp Disney style, quite unique and clearly one of the main points that the developers focused on. The progression and levelling system is simple but functions like you think it would and it carries a few good mechanics in terms of resource management which are clearly Civilisation (And similar games) inspired. The storyline is good, nothing really much to say about it but it is clearly another point the developers focused a lot on. The music and sound are... Well... 'Decent'... They go with the setting but they are nothing special or amazing... They just work.\n\nNow on to my final point, this game... Feels like a Mobile game. The large obnoxious buttons... Really makes it feel like a game either ported from Mobile or intended to be played on Mobile. Now this isn't typically a bad thing, many good games are on both PC and Mobile/Tablet (Hearthstone and Plants vs Zombies for example) but I do feel that it needs to be mentioned as this is a review at the end of the day.\n\nThis game was funded on Kickstarter.\n\nOverall, if the balance issues are fixed then this game will be majorly improved (And especially good for a Mobile Game) - I really hope, for the developers sake that they do this... Or at least include an Easy difficulty... Just something at least!\n\n\n\nSuggestions for the Developers - spend a little more time on play-testing next time and only release for Mobile after the issues I have mentioned are fixed (As I assume that is what you are planning to do).\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","April 21, 2015","true","4.6"," 97 of 135 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","97","135","6","13"

While the pics provided up there might make you think it's very simple, there's a lot more depth than I thought there would be.\n\nGameplay: You have armies that you shift around different areas, and the entirety of your army are heroes. There are four classes: combatants, leaders, academics and mechanics. Combatants' sole purpose is to fight, to add greater numbers to your army. Leaders develop the lands they're on, allowing those lands to generate resources for you. Academics heal your people, simply put. Mechanics fortify areas and also craft items that can be equipped by your heroes. As they level up, they get stronger, acquire different skills and increase in health. You can carry a few minor heroes over with you between games, usually the best leveled ones.\n\nFor those who've played Risk, the battling is very much like that. Force on force. Now, you need to get used to two things: you're going to lose heroes, and you're going to lose land. I've seen a couple reviews mention this game is hard, and while it is, it becomes easier once you realize both lands and minor heroes are disposable. Heroes become disposable (the non-important ones, anyways), so you usually shift the brunt of damage to them, while trying to win a battle of attrition and keep your strongest units and critical units intact. In fact, the entirety of this game is a battle of attrition. You fortify some places that serve as choke points, while leaving other lands open so you can lure armies in away from the big armies sitting next to them.\n\nSounds easy so far, right? Well, not so fast. Every...I think it's 9 turns, enemies populate every land the enemy owns on the map. Never enough to truly be of concern, but enough to reinforce the big armies and keep you on your toes with the smaller lands so that you don't lose something you didn't mean to lose. There are also warlords, who are generated every once in a while and move through the map just like you are. It keeps the pace up and ensures that unless you're sitting at the end of the map, you're gonna have to keep moving and keep attacking.\n\nAll in all, it turns into a much more complex strategy game than I was expecting, though I still think a little more flexibility needs to be in the actual combat itself.\n\nAesthetic: As you probably suspect, the aesthetic is very well done. While the music isn't quite Supergiant-esque, it's still adds a pleasant ambience to help keep you frothing at the mouth in frustration. The cartoonish graphics are great, even in the more grim moments I've seen across the game. There's really nothing to nitpick at here, though I do wish there more character designs for each class. I know that there are dozens of designs across the classes, but considering how many heroes you just throw away, I think there needs to be more variety. Especially in combatant.\n\nStory: The story is quite simple, but enjoyable nonetheless. The characters aren't completely one dimensional, but aren't exactly complex either, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The game has its little random events here and there, and there are little scenes at the end of each map that are well written enough. I will say that I have spotted some errors here and there within the script. Nothing laughable, but another look-over by an editor wouldn't have hurt. In case you're curious, there's no voice acting that I've seen so far, outside of the opening.\n\nAll in all, I'd say this is a good game if you're looking for something not too complex, but challenging. If you're looking for something very in depth, you might want to watch some LPs to decide if this will be enough to scratch that itch.","April 22, 2015","true","2.9"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","29","32","2","0"

Let me see if I can explain why.\n\nWhat I Like:\n1) Game imagery and setting seems really cool.\n2) Game mechanics are fairly straight forward.\n3) Game reminds me a lot of The Banner Saga (search on steam if you haven't heard of).\n4) Game is tactical and requires strategic placement of units, use of limited resources, and distribution of items.\n\nWhat I dont like:\n1) Difficulty - The game has two modes, hard and normal. I am playing the game on normal and finding that the mechanics are not very well balanced for a fun game. I am only on the second mission, but I am finding myself getting overwhelmingly "zerged" by the AI.\n2) AI Mechanics - goes hand in had with my first point. AI continuously spawns new units every X amount of turns, cause them to snowball into ridiculously impossible opponents. You on the other hand have to wait for resources to generate at a set rate by capturing nodes. You can heal your army with food, which seems to be a scarce resource.\n3) Crashing - I spent an hour or so on the second mission. After what felt like an hour long grind fest of fighting enemy after enemy, trying to advance on the map, the game simply crashed. I am reluctant to continue playing the game because I am worried about future crashing and aggrevation.","April 25, 2015","false","6.5"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","35","43","0","0"

Maps widen, scenarios become tougher, more possibilities/choices to be made. Proper use of game mechanics to: push/pull, control zones, manage ressources, while constantly being on the clock from constant reinforcements... becomes a must. Knowing when to attack, when to withdraw, moving units/crafted items around to be more efficient, which ressources to focus on and what to use them for... as well as purposely sacrificing units when need be, adds to its complexity. PS: When a unit dies, it never comes back.\n\nNegative points: It lacks replayability, which shouldn't come as a surprise, since it is a single player game.\nIt also could have used a few 'Quality of life' features: discarding crafted items, filters, having more game menu/graphical options, etc... nothing too serious.\n\nOverall, It's a great game, well worth its 15$ price tag.\n\nPS: If you're experienced in these type of games, I would advise playing it on hard difficulty right off the bat, as I found it be well balanced.","April 21, 2015","true","29.2"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

I'll return to this view if what I see later changes my opinion.\n\nAs of this review, I've only completed the first few levels, and played only 3-4 hours. I'm posting this as a brief list of criticisms. But first, the good:\n\nIt's got a pleasant aesthetic, and information is generally clear and easy to parse. The basic mechanics of the game are simple, yet hint at a greater depth, and the random nature of the combat does help, even if it makes some choices become\nchoices between playing safe and slower, or slightly faster and possibly suicidal. I also absolutely love how snappy and quick the main menu is.\n\nNow for the bad.\nThe inventory UI is terribly clunky. It shouldn't take a dozen clicks just to take items from two characters, and switch them around.\nThere are no hotkeys for the few menus the game has.\nThe fights seem to be exercises of patience, rather than tactics. With how the early levels are set up, it's not a challenge to win, just really time consuming.\nI'm more than 3 hours in, and it's like the game doesn't know how to throw a good curveball. I've seen 3 different enemy "types", but each is just a bigger number with a new icon.\nSelecting character icons on the map is clunky at best. I get that they want a more compact look, but it just makes selecting them more difficult than it needs to be because you need to first hover over the bar of icons, watch it expand, then trace the cursor along the bar to the character you actually want to select. Maybe space them apart a bit more and have them stack vertically as well.\nThe writing's mostly just a bunch of exposition dump. None of the characters show much personality through their dialogue beyond the bare minimum. It's got some nice moments, but not enough to make me look forward to reading it.\nThe 'quit' button is very delayed, taking several seconds to finally close the game while leaving the rest of it completely interactable while it's closing, even letting you resume playing the game before being cut off by the window closing.\n*edit*\nAfter playing through most of another level which lasted roughly ~2 hours according to Steam, I don't see any point in continuing. The bit above where I called the fights an exercise in patience could not be more true by this point. Unless there's a major update that overhauls enemy behavior and level design, I don't think I'll be returning to this game for a long while.\n\nFor those curious and don't mind minor gameplay spoilers, this is the scenario that made me quit: http://puu.sh/i3qC9/64bcdcdd47.png .","May 10, 2015","false","7.8"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","29","36","0","4"

But just as importantly the devs at Burrito Studio are VERY responsive to community input. Steam achievements are already in and a new "casual" difficulty is being added (within the next day or so) mainly due to the fact that Highlands' gameplay is so different to what we are used to that extra climatisation may well be needed for the average player despite already having a well made integrated tutorial. There is little doubt that this is a challenge that none should take lightly. In addittion, the guys have added some nice extra features including extra craftable consumables, extra character abilities, and extra enemy abilities. All in all, the 1.1 build will radically alter an already good game for the better making Highlands very close to being a must-buy for anyone interested in a fresh look at the tactical turn based with RPG elements genre. Overall an extremely professional piece of work destined, at the very least, to become a cult classic.\n\n*edit* Don't underestimate that word "unique" up there - everyone claims it but few actually achieve it.","June 3, 2015","true","15.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Its unique style really draws you into the gameworld and its story of warfare among floating islands in the sky.\n\nThe game's basic mechanics involve a game of territorial control, where you freely assign various characters from your army among different 'sectors' on the map to capture them from enemies, defend your own territory, or use abilities. Capturing new sectors generally opens you up to further attacks, forcing the player to balance between expansion and defense. The RPG side of the game presents you with a number of different character types who each have different abilities: pure combat strength, healing, fortification, and leaders who convert sectors for you. I only wish the actual combat between armies was a bit more involved; it basically comes down to who has the most/biggest guys and a few dice rolls without much in the way of tactical choice.\n\nThis is definitely a game worth playing for RPG or strategy enthusiasts, and my biggest regret is that it isn't longer.\n\nYou can also check out a longer review at the DecryptedGaming blog here[decryptedgaming.com].","April 24, 2015","true","8.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

This is a turn-based strategy game that owes more to abstract wargames than it does to the likes of Final Fantasy Tactics or King's Bounty, complete with somewhat esoteric game mechanics, abstraction of combat, and emphasis on supply lines and areas of control. But where I usually find the gameplay of grand war games to be inaccessible at best, Highlands' mechanics are clean and simple to understand, and within a couple of chapters I found myself adroitly maneuvering my units toward victory.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe art is gorgeous, hand-drawn cel-style, and while the character portraits and chapter interstitials aren't animated, they don't really need to be: the art stands well enough on its own.\n\nThe game mechanics are unique, but not obtuse. I found them easy to understand and manipulate, and I really enjoyed the feeling of mastering a new and unfamiliar system by the end of the game. If you enjoy learning systems, this will scratch that itch.\n\nOn the Challenging difficulty (second-hardest out of four), the game is--apropriately enough--challenging, but not frustrating. I rarely felt like I was being handed a victory, and the objectives and parameters of each of the game's seven chapters mix it up enough that I kept having to devise new strategies.\n\nThe game moves at a very fast clip. The only downtime you'll ever really experience is when you're contemplating your next turn. Menus are smooth and fast, though I did find that the item/equip menu was a little clunky. Animations are fast, clean, and descriptive, and the game tells you everything you need to know and doesn't dilly-dally about it.\n\nThe meh:\n\nThe music is okay, but nothing exceptional. It's mostly inoffensive, light, airy background music. It fit the theme and accompanied the game well, but I don't think I'll be humming it months from now.\n\nThere is a fair amount of RNG in this game, as the outcome of combat is determined by a dice roll modified by the combatants' relative combat strength. The game's tutorial does a good job of instructing you on how to gain the edge in combat, but you may well run into situations where you have to rely on an against-the-odds roll in your favor to proceed. The game is generous with autosaves, but you may end up save-scumming a few battles if you're particularly unlucky.\n\nThe writing is servicable at best. It gets the job done, but it's mostly exposition dumps and the characters never develop much personality. The copy editing is rather poor, too; time and again I saw missing punctuation and bad sentence structure. The developers would have been wise to hire a line editor to mark up their script beforehand. The pacing is also awkward. In short, don't play the game for its writing or story.\n\nConclusion:\n\nDespite its flaws, I really enjoyed the time I spent with the game. I thought it was just the right length, it provided just the right challenge, and was engrossing enough that the hours flew by while I was playing. I would recommend this game to anyone with an eye for strategy games, especially anyone who is interested in learning new systems.","June 10, 2015","true","12.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The mechanics are simple, with more powerful skills and items showing up deeper into this story driven Turn Based Strategy game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24E1NhZ79aI\n\nThe premise of the game is you lead a family of nobles, who rule a land high in the clouds called the Highlands, in a tale of loss and spider robots. Yeah, that's right, spider robots, that will overwhelm you should you allow them to respawn too quickly. The game is simple, everyone has a combat value that increases through skills and experience that gives you a higher chance surviving encounters. You allocate resources by improving sectors you captured from combat which can be used to heal your troops and to recruit more troops. Again, the game is simple... yet one false move can lead to you having to restart level, after level should you take too long to complete a chapter. However, the challenge is not a bad thing.\nI'm also not embarrassed to say that I got my butt kicked by the Swarmbots on the second level. Definitely recommended.","May 19, 2015","true","1.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","13","16","6","0"

If i hadn't intended to write a review i'd dropped it after first 10 minutes. Opening level is just a linear path with obnoxious app-store-level forced tutorials, restricting almost any interactions and freedom and without any gameplay. But on the second level it becomes clear that this game is in fact a simple risk-like wargame, where individual battles and\or control over them don't matter as much as overall strategy. When i realized that, game turned out to be rather enjoyable.\n\nOverall story and it's delivery are utilitarian and without any major flaws. There are random encounters with flavour text and classic static cut-outs dialogues. But lack of any barks or at least old-school beeps on new lines of dialogue makes an uncanny impression of complete silence, despite the sound of background music.\n\nSome animations, like mills and clouds, are amazing. But everything else is just standard wargame static images. Style of drawings reminds of recent banner saga and some people think that the land is similar to bastion. But of course tight budget is quite obvious. Overall graphics are pleasant and tidy and serve their function.\n\nThere are several uncanny or uncomfortable things with interface, like kerning of the letters or not very informative and redundant tabs with unpredictable behaviour. Conflicting narrative of the items stats and some other places are inconvenient too. But it is still tolerable once you get used to it.\n\nGame runs well on nvidia surround and i didn't saw any technical issues.\n\nOverall it's pleasant and simple risk descendant with uncommon visual elements of flying ships, flying islands and clockpunk-syle robots. You just need to force yourself through the tutorial.","June 19, 2015","true","15.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Highlands does a fantastic job of delivering a story with minimal design/graphics. The gameplay itself is a cross blend of strategy and RPG elements. Tactically commanding your troops across large levels all the while leveling, gaining/crafting new items, and recruiting new allies to your cause.\nThe combat and difficulty is a hit and miss situation. While the RNG does make strategy and battle unpredictable. The A.I. itself is rather easy to manipulate and predict. The tactical placement of fortifications and capturing of resources is pivotal. Death of an ally can lead quickly to a game over or loss of a officer with much time invested. However all of this becomes moot with the in game save system. No decision really carries much weight with the ability to just instantly reload, and make another move. With no multiplayer, iron man mode. Highlands falls on the easy side of strategy games. Despite this, it's still a wonderfully done game and plays fantastically.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/DT_VU7eWodc\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","April 21, 2015","true","4.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

In Risk, and Civilization, once you gain the upper hand the game is as good as won, and it's an unmotivated steamrolling of whatever's left in the game, which can really drag on.  In Highlands, taking a slower paced strategy can actually work against you, as every few turns there are respawns that get higher over time.  The third chapter in particular I had to restart because I wasn't aggressive enough at the beginning, and got boxed in and overwhelmed.  The resource management is pretty basic, but works well and plays a vital role to your success.  I felt like some abilities were slightly overpowered, but then on the last stage I realize it would have been impossible without them.  I think great attention was given to the overall balance of the game.\n\nIt falls a bit short on the story, and overall length.  It's about 15 hours total.  It lacks any kind of customization beyond a limited set of equipable items, which even on the weapon side is a one size fits all selection.  Level ups are important, but  adding a character attribute to advance each level would have added a ton of replayability to the game.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for a quick, easy to learn, addictive turn based strategy game, this is an easy choice.  It has that Civilization feel of "one more turn" and the difficulty scales really well as you advance in the game.  I personally recommend doing the "Challenging" difficulty level if you are big into strategy games, which is the level I selected,","September 12, 2015","true","19.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Highlands is a turn-based strategy game with very simple mechanics wrapped in a pretty package. It would be easy to play in 15 minute chunks, slowly chipping away at the campaign.

The random events (which are just a bit of text and a resource/item drop) can describe something quite awful. Writing sometimes sounds like something out of a straight-to-video kids movie, and at other times sounds quite respectable.\nHighlands simplicity means it is very accessible.

The royal family in this world apparently have quite a set of cojones, as they are on the front lines with their troops the entire time. You can recruit new fodder in taverns littered around the map. There are a multitude of classes available, leaders capture resource points, engineers/mechanics can craft weapons and armor as well as fortifying your points on the map. Combatants are the meatshields, and academics are used to keep the meat on their feet.\n\nEnemy robots and warlords will consistently advance on your position. Luckily your enemies can only move through your areas one at a time, but they do spawn friends after a set amount of turns (depending on the difficulty) which helps to keep the pressure on. There have been multiple situations where I screwed around for far too long capturing points only to be forced into combat with an almost insurmountable force at the end of the map. How did I overcome? Molotovs. Lots and lots of molotovs.\n\nTrying to keep a decent pace while not missing out on crucial resources is indeed a delicate dance, and as with most dances, I fail pretty miserably. Leadership is a resource used to recruit new troops, food is used as upkeep for your troops as well as keeping your characters healed, finally scrap is used in every sort of crafting imaginable. Gearing up your troops with weapons and armor increases their fighting ability, but all the skill in the world won’t save your characters from the ever-looming threat of permadeath.\n\nRandom events ensure no game plays out the same, but the story will remain the same. While the events are cool, this along with some flowery writing and amazing visuals don’t really motivate me to give the game a second playthrough. I’m supremely glad I got to experience it, and won’t hesitate to call it another kickstarter success story, but I don’t think I’ll be sitting down to trek through it again, at least for a little while. Fantastic first game by Burrito Studio, we at IGB can’t wait to see what is next.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 6/10\nFun Factor- 7/10\nDifficulty- 10/10\nReplayability- 3/10\nInnovation- 7/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 8/10\nMusic- 9/10\nSound FX- 7/10\nStory/Lore- 9/10\nLevel Design- 6/10\n\nFinal Score: 72/100 for innovation, graphics, and lore.\n\nSummary: Wonderfully unique Fire-Emblem-esque strategy game.

I was drawn in by the gorgeous hand drawn art and the promise of a turn based strategy game with some rpg elements and I have not been disappointed.\n\nThe game puts you in charge of the Arislaan  family in a fight to reclaim their kingdom in the sky.  The clouds act as a fog of war and as you fight your way across the regions you gotta look out for both enemies and valuable resources that the regions have to offer.\n\nYou have four classes of characters; the combatant is a straight up fighter, the mechanics can build the very important fortifications, the leaders are needed to gain control of areas and finally the academic function as healers. There is a number of special skills that widen the scope of that, but those are the basic functions of the classes.\n\nThere are three basic resources; food  that is essential for survival and healing, leadership that allows you to purchase new heroes and finally scraps that you can use to craft items as well as other special stuff.\n\nThese simple mechanics make for some tough choices on the battlefield. When to advance. What regions to focus on and to get essential resources or  buildings (taverns to recruit new heroes or workshops to craft items) and so on. On top of that, death is permanent! So if  you loose any of the main characters they are really gone. So be careful.\n\nControls are simple and work well. The artwork is gorgeous like I said and the music also adds to the mood. So if you like stuff like the old Heroes of Might and Magic or Battle  Isles? Or maybe you enjoy some of the Japanese tactics games? Then this is for you! The combat system may seem simple, but don't be fooled, there is plenty of strategy to sink your teeth into here.\n\nIn conclusion, Highlands gives us some much needed turn based goodness.

The music is pleasant to listen to and the artwork is quite nice as well, so a great addition to an already great game.

Artistically speaking I enjoyed the attention to smaller details such as full movement to the in-game trees and the whole game art theme struck me as a mix of Bastion with Disney-like elements. Mechanically it played similarly to popular tabletop games such as Risk or Smallworld. The unit movement and seperation of forces is simple at first but upon reaching mission 2 it escelated quite heavily in difficulty approaching the second bridge-weight mechanizm. As well I don't know if too many people will be fond of the whole luck-based system for damage dealing but I think it added a fun element of chance and don't mind the feature. Lastly the story was a little cut and dry, at first I was honestly confused whether the queen and youngest brother were fighting off the droids or militia men following them were so maybe the addition of a few NPC character faces could recifty that? Couldn't hurt considering how lovely the art is!\n\nFinal tally: 7.5/10  Need some buffing of kinks but shows a very promissing run.","May 8, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I believe the big difference is the storyline and linear progression, not to say you play in a stright line but more like you're following a path. It adds another element to the game that other stright forward stratigy games lack. The RPG feel of the game also complements the deeper complexities of character abilities which adds another layer to the strategy involved. This game is also turn oriented and not restricted to a time limit, more like a game of chess.

If you enjoy strategy games then consider letting your eyes linger a while longer.\n\nWhat I liked\n\nMechanics: Highlands is a very elegant, very sharp game. At its core is a very simple system of board control and area denial. To gain and hold territory you have four types of units:\n\nFighters: everyone has a combat value, but fighters have the highest. Enemies will never engage a stack bigger than itself, allowing you to body block territory.\nBuilders: Fortifies territory, creating a shield the enemy has to eat away at before moving forward.\nLeaders: Mobilizes territory under your control, allowing resource production.\nHealers: Using limited resources (food), patches up your wounded combatants.\nBy the end of the first map you've pretty much figured it all out, at which point your characters start gaining new abilities as they level up (crafting, ranged zone control, etc.) and you rush to figure out how to best employ them, because...\n\nMap Design: They've done a great job with campaign progression. As you progress the maps become progressively more challenging as more elements and twists on gameplay are thrown in your path, forcing you to discard old strategies and incorporate those shiny new abilities that seemed excessive only one map ago. A less innovative game would have reused the same basic layout time and time again, and the mechanics would have suffered from it.\n\nArt/Layout Design: The art is gorgeous, and more importantly it meshes very well with the visual information the game needs to present. There is never any excess data in your field of vision, you know everything you need to without cluttering up the screen with too many inputs. Concision is a virtue even in game design!\n\nWhat I Didn't Like\n\nThe Writing: There's no way around it. As addictive as the gameplay is and as beautiful the world they've created is, they really dropped the ball here. Every word out of any character's mouth is the most banal, generic action/fantasy trope they could get their hands on. Maybe you don't care about storytelling, in which case move on, but as some who reads every codex entry I can find in games I was quickly fast-forwarding through any cutscene because my stomach couldn't handle it. It isn't even properly proofread, as characters will overtly contradict earlier events.\n\nAnd it's a shame. Bad storytelling isn't news, and I usually just ignore it. It's a shame because the world they created isn't just beautiful because of the artwork: the mechanics themselves tell a tale far grander than the writing ever aspires to. You're introduced to the royal family: the daughter of the duke, a burgeoning warrior who wants to be just like her dad. The duke arrives and is this towering figure, with a combat value so much higher that you can't help but believe him to be that archetype of the invincible father present in almost every child's mind. And yet... by the end of the game, the daughter has surpassed him, reached heights even he could not. That is a beautiful story, and not a single word is devoted to it. A tale told entire in numbers.\n\nThere are many moments like that in the game, and if they're intentional then I tip my hat to their creators. But given the state of the actual plot, I'm not holding my breath.\n\nRandomness of Combat: Combat is essentially determined by stack size. The bigger your total combat value, the harder your troops hit the other guy's troops, and vice versa. Except that all of this is determined by a ridiculously bounded dice roll. It's not unusual to see a possible roll of 1-120, where anything above 60 will one-shot a Fighter. And since power is adjusted as the battle goes on, the first dice roll is infinitely more critical than any other.\n\nOh and if any of your main characters die at any time, it's game over. Reloading is never painful, it just brings you back right before the battle, but the whole thing just incentivizes you to reroll until the result is what you need it to be. Later in maps you have the resources to just buy enough disposable characters to eat those first few blows, but it isn't good design.\n\nLuckily the emphasis of the game is in the board mechanics and not the combat, so this isn't a huge issue. But it is one you will notice.\n\nTLDR (Conclusion for the regular folk)\n\nHighlands has a few flaws (story, combat) but when talking about an indie game it's far more important to talk about niche: what does this game do well, and why will I enjoy playing it?\n\nThe strategy component of this game, the board control gameplay, is an incredible amount of fun. The mechanics fit seamlessly into one another and have obviously received a lot of care. If that's a game type you enjoy, then you will definitely want to play Highlands.\n\nNote: If you have any experience with this type of game, I recommend playing on Hard. While that may have been what created the excessively random combat rolls (I did not play on normal difficulty so perhaps they are balanced around it), the scarcity of resources and relative strength of the enemy was perfect. Overcoming the challenges presented is the most satisfying part of this game, and you'd be doing yourself a disfavour if you made it easier.","May 20, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Making sure that no more than 1 or 2 frontlines is ever active, if there is a possibility of 3-way fight, i would prepare characters to bombard and suppress entire army, or i could decide to use fortification to delay incoming army until my main is ready.\n\nThis pretty much resembles a functioning military system in active combat. Protection of supply sector, making sure your men are not cut off from your sector, baiting smaller or larger enemy into the sector that u want, area denial using bombardment or fortification, sacrificing leadership points or even multiple sectors to gain the objective or even losing half of your armies to reduce the strength of opposing force, constant access to medical units, these are the skills u need. If you know how to manipulate sectors, accept large number of casualty, understand the skills; conditions; objectives; troop movement then you will do brilliant in this game.\n\n10/10.","December 15, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

The setting and characters were good, and the story (though mostly told in prose between chapters) was decent. I especially liked the character designs. The gameplay was interesting to start with but got tedious by the end of the game.\n\nPrimarily this is a game about map control and gathering resources, rather than direct combat. This leads to a fast-paced start as you try to defend against enemies on multiple fronts while improving your income. Once you've stabilised though, it's a slow mindless grind through large groups of enemies that have no real chance of breaking through your lines. To make matters worse, the combat consists of random dice rolls with a huge variance. You can see damage ranges of 1-90 odd, which means the enemy could do nothing or one-shot your character. You can mitigate this with character ablities, but they cost resources which means that grinding out the last areas of the enemy is a repetitive cycle. Namely: hit end turn to gather resources, activate skills to capture a location, drop back to heal and gather resources, repeat. Higher difficulties make the early game more frantic, but don't help with this gameplay cycle.\n\nThe game is fun enough to last most of its short length, though I recommend avoiding the higher difficulties because the fun of putting out fires at the start of levels is quickly extinguished by how tedious it is to finish off a level.","December 26, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Beautiful art style, good story, relaxing music. The mechanics ae simple, the stats are clear and don't require an advanced algebra degree to understand. The combat is diced-based with permadeath, and while it  can feel a little repetitive sometimes, it has moments of intensity that keep it from being to dull. If you main characters die in battle, it's game over, so you're often forced to sacrifice of your other units in order to save the main ones, which is difficult because they are usually just as, or more, powerful as/than your main charcters.\n\nThe map is beautifully drawn, but there isn't a huge variety of tiles, so every map kind of looks the same. Each tile can be fortified by your units, and some come with resources that you need to hire units, build armor and weapons, or heal, so you have to take into account risk/reward when choosing which tiles to conquer. Also some menus can't be closed by "esc", you actually have to hit the button for that menu again to close it.\n\nThere's a decent variety of missions, though they all essentially boil down to "get from point a-to-b", it's what's in between that changes, some missions have you fighting on two fronts, some missions have you fighting without access to any reources (which forces you to get though the mission before you run out of food for healing), Luckily, any weapons or armor you made in previous missions carry over, so at the very least you won't be forced to fight with your barehands after a few missions). You also get to keep all the surviving units you've recruited, though there is a limit on how many you can start each mission with.\n\nThe biggest drawback I think is that the game feels like a mobile port (it's not, to my knowledge) but the UI feels like it was designed for a touch screen, which makes moving around with a mouse a bit cumbersome since you have to drag and drop your units to get around the maps, and you can't reallly zoom out that far to make it a bit easier.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun, little game. Not too difficult to learn, but definitely not easy to beat (though there is a casual mode). And I'd say it's definitely worth the full asking price. Even though I got it on sale.","December 9, 2015","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Make no mistake about, the art style is very attractive, and the setting was one of the reasons I ended up getting the title. So, how does the game function overall?\n\nDifficulty\nFirst, allow me to say that I ultimately enjoyed playing Highlands. The gameplay mechanics work, and function without too much issue. I will say that if you've experienced playing strategy games beforehand, the game will be noticeably easier as you might recognize the patterns/quirks of the gameplay. I should mention that earlier on, the game was apparently MUCH more difficult, as what is now the Challenging difficulty used to be the Normal mode. After finishing the game once and now starting over, I can say without hesitation that you will see a difference in how much you struggle--I finished normal mode without losing any units or resetting, but now I've lost at least 2-3 people in Chapter 2 alone.\n\nSo ultimately, Highlands has good versatility in its challenge (pending one's ability with strategy games), and for those that really want to test themselves, the harder modes will certainly grant that request.\n\nGameplay\n\nHighlands functions very simplisticly--like Risk, you control regions of terrain on the map and send units to attack adjacent regions. Having a higher total number equals higher potential attack and a greater advantage against the enemy. When attacking, you choose a unit to block the incoming strike from the enemy. If the strength of the attack depletes their Combat points (which functions both as health and attack power), that unit dies.\n\nHighlands strictly functions as a campaign of several maps, so the goal will usually be either clear the map of foes or reach/capture certain destinations. You are given a variety of "hero" characters, but you can also create generic units of your own from Taverns. There are four classes available: Combatant (soldier), Mechanic (defense-builder/crafter), Leader (region capturer), and Academic (medic).\n\nI felt this system was effective and straightforward, but lacking in versatility. There's no real limitation on equipment for the different classes, so I found myself equipping shotguns and two-handed swords to my Academics in an effort to boost their "health", which seemed...strange. I feel having more items to craft and limiting them to certain classes would diversify the gameworld more. Otherwise, crafting devolves to "make the most powerful weapon for every single character, regardless of stats or class".\n\nSimilarly, I wouldn't have minded more situations to deal with in combat. You'll quickly become familiar with most of the enemy "types" there are, and apart from some additionally being "blockers" or "medics", fighting is mostly the same pattern. If the system was to be revisited/expanded on, perhaps units that did damage to more than one of your units (such as a flamethrower-type weapon) would open more options for combat, troop organization, etc.\n\nOf the classes, I enjoyed the Mechanic the most. They serve a multitude of purposes, from item crafting to  bombarding enemy forces , and were quite fun to get around the map.\n\nArtwork\n\nHighlands is very beautiful--what could have been a much more generic combat "map" looks more vibrant and alive, with billowing clouds and moving flags and sails. Personally, I would have liked more character artwork, as the pallet of potential units seemed to get exhausted pretty quickly. Some classes clearly had more emphasis--like the Combatant--while others such as the Leader only had a handful of designs.\n\nThere's also some issue with reading text in certain aspect ratios. Granted, this happened mostly with unit names in the combat screen, so this was usually not too critical an issue. In large battles, however, the Combat points of the units come become distorted, which could be dangerous if you chose a lower-level soldier as your defender by mistake.\n\nI'd also occasionally see vertical tears between certain tiles of terrain on the map or points icon, but these were minor issues. The rest of the world looks great--I give it a pass.\n\nmusic/sound\n\nBeing a musician myself, I always love a decent soundtrack in a game. Simon Tardif has given us a great, albeit limited, soundtrack to the world of Arislaan. The music gives an excellent, floating ambience that fits quite well with the design of the Highlands. My only complaint again is the quantity--all maps use the same tracks, and given they all take a while to complete, you can expect to hear all of them a few times each chapter. They blend very nicely, though, so unless you're consciously paying attention to the soundtrack all the time, this isn't too repetitive or intrusive. For what was available for the team, Tardif's music works well.\n\nLore and Story\n\nThis is by far the biggest love/hate relationship of mine for Highlands. The world is beautiful. There's plenty of characters. Yet despite all of this, I struggled to really get into the story of the game. The story is relatively familiar, especially if you've played games from the Fire Emblem series: A peaceful, proud country (Arislaan) suddenly finds itself under attack by invading forces, threatening the royal family. Despite this downfall, they rally their people and fight to reclaim their country from the antagonizing force. It's a standard plot, but it has been shown to work well in numerous games, movies, and books.\n\nThe problem is that, even with all of the characters--Cecaelia, Leoric, Micah, Eldrich, and so on--I never felt a really strong emotional or personal connection to their struggles and achievements. It suffers a similar issue as Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon. Once introduced to a character, very little in terms of personality follows; it's just another (more powerful) unit. I really want to know more about Arislaan-- Who are these people? What are their likes and dislikes? How did they begin their service to the Duke, or what was their life like before coming? And where will they go or what will they do after the invasion is over?\n\nFinal Verdict\nAs I said, I enjoyed playing Highlands--don't get distracted by my gripes. While its gameplay is simplistic, it was quite easy for me to get into. And allow me to say to Burrito Studio: I would certainly be interested in seeing another game to continue or expand this world. For those that aren't aware, Highlands was a Kickstarter game. Simply making the game was no doubt a challenge for them (they had just over $23,000 to work with, which quickly disappears in game development costs). Some of the limitations can be attributed to this, as a much larger budget would have given more room for expanding game mechanics and aesthetics. Hopefully, with Highlands' release, we might see more works from them in the future.\n\n$15.00 might be a little steep for the amount of gameplay given (I completed the game in about 12 hours, with only a few achievements left), but for those that enjoy strategy games (especially Risk) with a mild steampunk-ish design, I'd say take a look at the very least. Finding the game for half price was more than satisfactory for me.","October 14, 2015","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In most levels when you reach the point where there's only one enemy left, you can abuse the system pretty hard and craft equipment for your whole team. That made the game too easy.\nI'd say it's worth the 10€ for some nice hours of playing through once. I tried to replay, but didn't actually play through it again.","April 24","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found 'casual' too much of a walkover, and 'challenging' can turn into a bit of a grind at times.\n\nA couple of minor niggles in the interface, but nothing serious. Solid as a rock; I found no bugs.\n\nMany hours of intriguing gameplay still lie ahead of me -- I haven't finished the game once yet!","May 1","true","82.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is not bad, but nothing special. The mechanics is all right, but shallow - there’s not much to explore in terms of developing your characters or your districts. It’s not a bad game, but it has little new to offer and it gets repeptitive too quickly.\n\nIt reminds me of Rebuild: Gangs of Deadsville, with somewhat more stylish graphics and story.","June 4","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe I will switch it to negative on a later occasion. It get's only a mediocre rating because of little and unnecessary but greatly annoying flaws in the controls.\n\nIf a developer reads this, I would be happy to see the following things fixed:\n-The first thing I noticed within 30 seconds in the game is that I am not able to read the experince value in the left bottom corner properly on a resolution of 1920x1080. The font is simply too smal.\n-Swapping equipment is too complicated, just make a screen with more than one character to exchange the equipment.\n-At the end of a level in order to take equipment with you it must already be equipped to the charakter, which you take also with you... why? I just finished the second level 5 minutes ago, found out about this, quit, felt the urge to channel my frustration into this review. Next time I start the game I will load the latest savegame of the level I just beat and equip the right stuff.\nDidn't you do any testing?? The game is good, but such little and silly inconveniences can spoil a good game, because it makes me work more than I want to just make the right inputs.","June 6","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
