Bonney","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198090381103/","182 products in account","Well, I have learned another lesson about buying games on the first day of release....Don't do it. This game is broken and crashes without making it to the main menu.\n\nEdit: Due to negative comments, I must add that I am not the bad guy here. This game was NOT in early access. But I expected some flaws, as these simulator games are hit or miss on the quality. I purchased a finished game, I can't wait until its finished so I can write a proper review of my gameplay experience.\n\nUnfotunately for now, I cannot recommed anyone purchase this because I am not the only one having problems with the game crashing. When it is patched so I can play a few hours, I will edit my review.\n\nEdit 9/12/2014 The patch came out 8 days after release so here is my review- It's about what I expected when I purchased this title. Good graphics, probably the best feature of the game. There still are some bugs that need to be worked out. I am satisfied with the game for the price but you have to like simulator games. I am not changing the thumbs down because, at the time I purchased, there were no reviews. I posted this review because I use the review system to help me decide if I should purchase the game, and for all the other gamers that do the same, I was providing valuable information to help them as they have helped me.\n\nEdit 9/12/2014\nThe patch was out yesterday and now the game will play. However, there are still game-breaking bugs and crashes.About 10 hours in, and this will be the 3rd time I have had to restart because of crashing during loading a saved game or a bug with the truck being empty but when I try to dump a container in it, it says the truck is full.\n\nBuy at your own risk.","September 3, 2014","false","30.1"," 336 of 412 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","336","412","2","17"

I purchased this title on its release day on Steam, and boy was I disappointed.  As a QA analyst by profession I was truly disturbed by how unfinished this game truly was at release.  Mercifully I was not beset by the crashes many of the other users have been afflicted by, but the game itself was clearly rushed through QA if it was even tested at all.\n\nAI trucks not having cockpits, immediate resolution of AI routes, incorrect amounts fo profit returned from AI routes.. The list goes on and on.  I truly, personally gave up after attempting to dump in the landfill with the trash going under my truck preventing me from ever moving again.

I love Simulations, was tenative on getting it until a patch was released, proves they care. So I bought it once the patch was released. Game play is unique, guess it would be for a game about garbage and recycling, little repeatative but most simulators are. Graphics are suprisingly good and the game play is fun if you like simulations. No complaints, I hope they add more maps not that I have finished the original but variety would be awesome. More trucks etc too but game plays smoooth, is rather fun to play, suprisingly addictive. :)\n\nRandom events would also add a coolness factor to the game too, something to break up of the normal trash activities.","September 17, 2014","true","35.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

It doesn't win any awards in the physics department (you bounce off objects, drive through people, etc.), but it is fairly good at being a garbage sim.  You're forced to be in control of a vehicle but can set the others on autopilot should you have more than one.  If you're not in the mood to drive at all, you can assign your other trucks to their usual routes and when they return, send them right back out again to the ones you'd normally do (Your day ends at 4 PM, so try to make sure you have enough trucks to handle the extra loads).  You gain XP and money either way you do it, so you can sit back and manage or take the reigns yourself...though I have to admit the AI is MUCH faster at doing the job.  Vehicles and other features unlock as you play, though you don't actually create routes...you purchase pre-planned ones and send your trucks out accordingly.  You CAN however assign the days the routes get services.\n\nVerdict: I myself wouldn't pay $24.99 for this game, though I WOULD grab it during a sale.\n\nFixing the crash on startup error can be done as follows:\n\n1) Open your Steam/Steam Apps/Common/RECYCLE/System folder and COPY the 7 ICOM files to...\n\n2) Open your C Drive/Users/Your Name/Documents/My Games/ Recycle/System.  Simply overwrite the 3 existing ICOM files.\n\n---\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2bOiJB74tE","September 5, 2014","true","15.0"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

I got it for 15% off, first of all, so that was cool. Above all else, this is geared as a business simulation, even if you don't get any inference of that from the video. Yes, the graphics are not up to par with PS3 or 4. The movements of the trashmen are somewhat slow, but not horribly so. I have had 3 crashes in about 17 hours of play - twice for the same thing (accidentally grabbing the wrong container type on route setup and instead of just letting it go, I tried to drag it back to it's original spot), and once it said my trash guy was blocked by an obstacle and to move to the open road so he could grab a container. I was in the road at the time. I never went off the road. Aside from that, the game has been uneventful, in respect to glitches/crashes. And yeah, there's only 1 useful camera angle I've found (although I haven't checked them all out, and only checked out 2 views{change views in the options menu}), but so what. It's not like you are playing against other people trying to collect the same trash or shooting at people, lol. Deal with it. Maybe they'll release a patch or two and things will be better. It's a decent enough game. But then again, what the hell do I know? Watch the video and decide for yourself. It's your cash  :)\n\nYou start off with some cash, a parking lot, and that's it. Buy a truck, buy some route licenses so you can collect the trash, take a short loan to float you buying your own dump, or just dump for free at the municipal dump. Difference is, you get paid to dump it at your own dump. The object is to make money.","September 9, 2014","true","34.7"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

However....\n\nThere is no way the developer has tested the game play on 50 PCs as they claim. I think they have simply installed on 50 PCs and checked the start up screen loads.\n\nThis game is not finished. Far from it.\n\nEverybody who has bought the game is being used as beta testers. The game sort of works but has too many erros too often.\n\nEverybody has reported that the crane truck crashes the game when being unloaded - this is something you would expect to have been picked up in testing. They claim a ptach is on the way and they seem to have had no problem replcating the crash so It really would have been picked up in a even poorly done test phase.\n\nMy trucks on auto now randomly claim the wrong garbage is being dumped at the wrong place when its not. General waste to the landfills is correct and has been for the last 5 in game days. Now every other dump is wrong apprently.\n\nDriving the organic truck and no matter where I park the guy on the back can not get off the truck due to a none existant obstruction.\n\nTake the dumper to the incinerator and try to switch back to the crane without driving back to the landfill. Game hangs then crashes.\n\nThe phyiscs system is ♥♥♥♥. Cars have infinate mass as do street signs. My truck must weigh 15 tons and I have 10 tons or garbage in the back. Why do I bounce off of street signs!!! Yes I am not supposed to be driving it like GTA but a street sign should not stop my truck.\n\nEverything is far to happy to ragdoll for the slightest reason. I can make my bulldozer bounce 10 feet high over the landfill. If you stick the handbrake on while unloading a truck at the dump you fire off like a rocket towards the perimeter fance ragdolling along the way.\n\nGraphics are extremely poorly optimsed. I have a PC well beyond the recommended specs but get frequent half second freezes and when using the crane to the load the dump truck the FPS drop to about 10 when the claw is full of garbage.\n\nThe only thing the devs have done well is the trailer video. It makes the game look far better and more interesting then it is. False representation in the extreme.\n\nThis game needs at least another 12 months of coding just to be playable and maybe even enjoyable.\n","September 6, 2014","false","7.0"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","12","23","2","0"

The variety of vehicles and things to do makes the game enjoyable for quite a while. If you ever get bored you can always go on a rampage and crash into everything. The devs will soon fix the crashes and the bugs and add more updates so it will only get better from this point on.

Yes you will be collecting garbage over and over but everyone out there that is saying the camera views don't work and it crashes on startup, if you go to the community hub and look at the posts by the developers you will see that they tell you how to fix it.
