"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rainer_s/recommended/331210/","rainer_s","Rainer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rainer_s/","644 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNote: Copy provided by the developer\n\nBolt Riley (Episode 1) is a very short point and click adventure in early access, telling a funny quirky story. The tutorial is implemented in the intro sequence, introducing the way on how to play. It has full voice acting (narrator and dialogues) enabled. Dialogues can be skipped at any time. There is an interesting feature available, called "inspiration", don’t want to talk about it in detail, just mention it. ;-)\n\nThe puzzles are almost logical and very funny. You can save your progress all the time. The control interface (item interaction/handling) needs some adjustment. The graphics is really simple and functional, it is a bit rough around the edges and there is room for improvement. So let’s see how it turns out in the end. But please don’t get me wrong, I did enjoy playing it!","April 25","true","1.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/331210/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYo so what’s up Rasta’s this here be Steamified featuring a game for all yo reggae needs with Adventure Mob and Corbomite Games’s Bolt Riley: A Reggae Adventure. It’s a real pleasure son. I find it a little bit on the funny side man that an Israeli company is the one to create an adventure reggae anthem. This is just the first chapter of what is expected to be a two part game. I wish it were a little longer if the other chapter is as short in game play as what this one is because I quite enjoyed this chapter until it came to an abrupt end.\n\nI actually thought that they held to the true side of reggae. It’s definitely an interesting concept for the game and it suckered me in more quickly than what most point and click adventure games have done lately. As a fan of reggae and the West Indies cricket team the subject matter was very enjoyable. The first chapter tells the story of Bolt Riley, the lead character in the game and the one that the player controls, and how he ascended to become a reggae superstar. It’s a cute charming story.\n\nI liked that you could save your progress at any time. However, given that the gameplay can be finished in a little over an hour it makes for a perfectly fine one sitting game. The puzzles are for the most part logical and straight forward enough so one shouldn’t keep you guessing for too long. The music was quite nice. The graphics while simple suited the game very well.\n\nUnfortunately, there were quite a few bugs in the game. Two of my bugbears involve the voice acting. The first is the fact that there was never any intention at mirroring the lip syncing of the characters to the voice acting. The second is if you ever wanted to skip some dialogue, which you can by pressing on the mouse you’ll still get the entire animation – without voice – until the animation is finished. That was more than a little irritating.\n\nGiven how short it is I would advise that it’s not quite worth the standard $9.99 asking price unless you’re a big fan of reggae and point and click adventures. However, it is one to watch for when it goes on a decent sale.","May 2","true","1.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I do realise this game is considered Early Access and I know the budget for this game is pretty small, and you should keep that in mind too (if you end up reading the in-depth review linked below), but ultimately, is it something I would recommend to my friends or the gaming public in its current state? Considering the artwork still needs some touching up, bugs were encountered way too frequently, the UI needs fixing and the first chapter is way too short, probably not. I'm hoping that Adventure Mob will eventually prove me wrong though, as I really want this game to succeed.\n\nhttp://www.choicestgames.com/2016/04/bolt-riley-reggae-adventure-chapter-1.html","April 24","false","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
