Although there are quite a few bugs that will hopefully be fixed/improved on in the full version.\n\n-You can't reach the guy in the blue cap due to the bench and rocks blocking the way, so you can't recruit him.\n-You're more than likely to accidentally travel screens due to the border not being visible.\n-There's certain spots when travelling screens, where you would get stuck on an object upon changing screens.\n-Loot and survivors aren't randomised, they'll always be found in the same spot.\n-No options, needed to lower the volume and couldn't. Button mapping would be great as well.\n-The only warning you get for your hunger is the hunger bar, I had forgotten about it at one point and my character exclaimed "I'm so hungry", then proceeded to die instantly.

It could have been released as a free demo, because in it's current state, it's not something that should be commercial.\n\nLet's start from the very beginning\nAt the start of the game, you are thrown straight into the game where you name your character. No title screen, no splash screen. Nothing. You just straight up get thrown in, however, after saving there IS a title screen.\nOne problem I had is, except when I did it the first time, I get thrown into a map where I am stuck on a bunch of barrels and can't move everytime I start a new game. Holding shift also skips text which I appreciate but also don't. It's really annoying trying to read a tutorial but then accidentally pressing shift and skipping it all. Also the food you get never runs out. If you get hungry you can just go to your menu and keep choosing the tin of beans, it will not disappear at all.\n\nI'm outside!\n\nOne problem I really had with the exteriors is it's so hard to tell where you are going. You can't tell where the borders are and you just get teleported to a new area out of nowhere. About gathering party members, I didn't like this system much either. They are just randomly lying around and they join you immediately if you just tell them to. I hope that in the final version maybe they will not be in areas filled with zombies(who stands around in the middle of all those zombies?)and maybe you will need to gain their trust first, by doing something like a sidequest. Also there are no loots around at all. I feel like more loots and some more weapons could be added. I like the idea of getting attacked by large hordes of zombies. They are easy to escape at times, however one thing that's really bothering me is how easy they are to kill. All you have to do is keep smashing space-bar, they are no challenge at all. The only way they can kill you is if you are alone. With party members you are like indestructible. Maps are ok, they are not bad but they are a little too much stacked together. Your battle system also gets buggy when you get more than 4 party members. I can see that the developer wanted to make it so that if one person dies the other will fight instead, but the enemies are so easy to defeat, so something like that won't be happening anytime soon.\n\nI feel that this game has a lot of potential but it needs polishing. I am sure the final version will be better, but the early access version just isn't worth buying. It's nothing that stands out too much. It won't keep you thrilled, it isn't full of fun, but it has potential. Just, wait for it to get some updates first.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvqD3XbQIVg","December 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","1"

And while the concept may have it's potential, this game certainly has none. With the current gameplay, all it basically does is mixing the screens randomly, hoping for something good to magically happen in the process (spoiler alert: it doesn't).\n\nThe battle system is dull and boring -- if you've ever played a JRPG, you know how it works. The battles are turn-based, turns are determined by ATB gauge. You can perform one action per turn: attack, defend, use an item, use a technique (aka "special" attack), which consumses your "mana" (at the moment, I couldn't find a way to replenish it, by the way).\n\nThe storyline is entirely missing. You have your 10-seconds tutorial, telling you that you're immune to... a pathogen? Well, there's that. And this is all you need to know, evidently.\n\nAlso, the game is *really* buggy -- enemies are glitching (the "werecar" monster is just terrible at passing stuff), decorations are glitching, your character is glitching and sometimes stucking irreversibly in obstacles... I mean, sure, this is an Early Access product, but come on, can you do *some* beta-testing before releasing the game?\n\nAll in all, this is a very, very wonky game with foggy outlook. I'd rate it 3.5 out of 10.0, and I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it, as of now.\n\n(If the game develops any further, I might change this review later on)\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\nYup, RPG Maker confirmed: game uses "Horror City" DLC for RPG Maker VX, so no original art is coming your way here either. I'm changing my rating from 3.5 to 1.0 out of 10.0.","January 3","false","3.4"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","3"

F5/F6 toggling & restarted until I got the full screen working properly.  I used an xbox360 controller, which worked fine (buttons X to select, B to backout).  Make sure you find and equip yourself with a weapon quickly.  There isn't a lot of text, so it didn't strain my eyes.  It was fun, I died and restarted a few times, and I got the hang of it.  But that's when the fun halted.  I'm not sure I understand what I am supposed to be doing in this game.  I avoid zombies, fight a few, find a rare healthkit or weapon or two, run out of medkits and die.  There doesn't seem to be anywhere really to go or do beyond repeat this avoid, fight-a-few, and eventually die.  I got 30 minutes of fun, then confused.\n\nThis is early access.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/recommended/423710/","Chernobog3","Chernobog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/","94 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCurrently, the game is very rough. It's extremely simple to get wiped out early on if you get a bad string of luck where you can't find any companions. You can, however, have a full group of six running around. You'll need them to tackle the heavy amount of wandering hordes hunting you down (to say nothing of a 'were-car'). On your own, your life expectancy might be a few minutes at best. Characters are individually quite weak- you must search the city to find people and perhaps a little equipment, although the game is very thin on the latter right now.\n\nThere's no goal at this time, other than just to survive as long as you can. If you can manage long enough, you can reroll the maps to a new area with your levels and companions. Additionally, the zombies also level (and rather quickly, too).\n\nAgain, this might not sound like much, but there's an interesting idea and an experience here. I want to see Invasion turn into more of an in depth zombie survival rpg experience, with a goal and nuances. Maybe that won't happen. I suppose we'll see. So you might want to hold off until there's more of a game under the hood, but with the extremely low price, you probably won't be hurting just to try for the challenge and experience of the concept.\n\nAt this time, the game is rather buggy and crude. There seems to be a little too much emphasis on references and quips, which didn't really work for me, as well. Characters could stand to have more abilities and personality. And to really flesh out the zombie survival experience, the game needs far more equipment.\n\nThis used to be a Recommended review, as I cited there was potential here. But the developer doesn't seem to be doing much of anything with this title. As of this writing, he hasn't updated any meaningful content and the developer has gone silent on the forums. By itself, the game is overly limited even for an Early Access. Not sure why the title is seemingly being ignored into a state of barely functioning limbo, but I can't in good conscience recommend it, even for a dollar's value. It's one of those greenlit titles that has a kernal of a good idea in it, but it apparently isn't being helmed by anyone willing to make it work.","February 11","false","3.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm now sharing these notes with you to help you patch up and see how a new player experiences your game. Spoilers may be present for those thinking about getting this game, but in this stage I don't think spoilers are possible, nevertheless this is mostly for the developer. Warning: this will be lengthy, but hopefully helpful.\n\nGameplay NotesCombat gets dull, ZZ, wait a sec, ZZ, wait a sec, etc. (but then again it's early-game)\nWhen do I get techniques? Why don't I start with a simple one?? Even the zombies get "Endure6" or whatever it says (what does that say? and what does it do? I'm very curious)\nReal-time should stop when you're trying to read or just picked something up: I picked up a health pack and then got attacked by a swarm because I couldn't grab and run\nKilled a huge swarm in front of a store because I figured I could go into it, but it's not even interactive\nTook me about 30 minutes total of aimlessly wondering and fighting to find first survivor\nWhy doesn't food for hunger also replenish health? It's food...\nFirst survivor I find is at least 4x stronger than me, not a problem just strange\nActually really cool that you can die and then just continue as a survivor\nGets hard too fast, only seen one survivor, no store no other NPCs, nothing, and it's already like my last stand\nMovement's too slow and stiff for a real-time game where you have to avoid zombies\nImpassable objects hidden behind buildings\nNo way to tell which survivor is attacking, or if there is it's super subtle\nToo many zombies right off the bat, the game needs a difficulty progression, and it starts with getting swarmed by 20 zombies a screen, it's just too much\nStraight up don't understand the hunger bar, does it get smaller the hungrier I am? If so, how do I know just HOW small it is compared to how big it could be?\nThe only part that feels like an actual game is the very beginning, with the dialogue, secret health pack, and scripted zombie attack. Once I leave the building I feel like I'm stuck in limbo between what I just did and the next story point/NPC/etc., only problem is the next action never comes. I found a newspaper that talked about the emergence of the zombies, which was neat, but only unique discovery I've found thus far aside from the survivors\nIs the Tiger Defence Academy bit designed purposefully so I get attacked while reading it??\nSurvivor's just have like a one-liner, then start following you around. Why not some back-and-forths or something?\nI would've said the Shotgun's technique that shoots every enemy is OP considering it has barely any damage reduction as opposed to just shooting one enemy, but then again the swarm one shot me anyway because each zombie hit's around 100, there were at least 10 of them, and I had 500 health max, but like 250 at the time\nIn the entire time I've played this I've only found one other building to go into\nAesthetic NotesNicely decorated but for gameplay's sake perhaps too decorated? Or be able to pass through more things\nTakes a second to distinguish character from zombies, and in a game where screen is changing alot and it spawns you not always right on the edge of the new screen, I can loose the character briefly which is not good in a zombie game\nThere's a zombie type that looks almost exactly like the survivor Peach but with her arms out: it's confusing\nNeedless to say that stock effects/graphics/sounds were used, which is very unappealing in the long-run: there's SO many RPGmaker games out there today, it's clear that the ones that are fully customized and no longer look or sound like RPGmaker are the ones that are successful\nTechnical NotesCan't minimize game without it breaking\nStarting the game flashes the screen fullscreen back to windowed repeatedly for a minute\nMy hunger went down even though we couldn't open the Tin 'O Beans (but then jumped way back up a minute later??)\nEnemies respawn way too quickly, I leave screen and come back and they're back, what if I left screen on accident? There goes all my progress\nNear the park there's some car that seems like it's franticly trying to run me over but can never succeed even if it's directly on top of me; it follows me to neighboring screens\nApparently if you hit Z you can fight this (zombie?) car. It looks super glitchy and this is probably a bug what I'm seeing; I targeted it and I shot the pond behind it, and it's name was all messed up but I can't check what it was since it one-shot me (like I said, difficulty is insane for this early in a game)\nWhy can't you walk over bushes?\nDO NOT HIT F12 ANYONE. For some reason it immediately quits without saving...\nThe combat system is strange, I like it because it's different but much more thought should be put into it to balance it out and make it a bit more concrete, I'm mostly talking about the fact that you don't necessarily take turns, but you just wait for your ATB to fill up, then you make an action\nIt was still raining inside a building\nWhenever I try to "Shutdown" the game from the menu, the correct way, it goes unresponsive, a window comes up saying so and I have to tell it to give up trying to recover...\nOverall, I like this game, it has tons of flaws and I found a bunch of tiny knit-picky problems with it but that's what Early Access is for. I hope to see this game improve consistently and look forward to the official release! Hope I helped, have a great day.","December 30, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

But now that the developer has spent time updating the game (and I would really enjoy it if development continued), I actually like the game because of many reason (my opinions). I am huge in to zombie games such as CS:NZ, L4D2, Zombie Panic Source!, etc. and when I played this game I found that it promots cooperation. The key feature in a fun zombie game is when you have fun playing it, this game currently does not have a lot of places to go but I believe in time Invasion: Brain Craving will be a really awesome game. Another reason it is good is that it is balenced in gameplay, the zombies are not to easy and not to hard and there is the right amount of zombies in each area. Now let me point out a few things that I do not like then go over them at the end :) First: Only two enterable buildings (only one has loot). Two: Not really any items added in besides cans of beans and health packs. Three: Can not see zombies when moving behind buildings. Four: Not a lot of areas to go to and there not progressive in difficulty (besides the area with the werecar). And Fifth: I really would like to see if the developer does want to continue updating this game, if so I will play the game a whole lot and tell my friends about.

At the moment, it's mostly walking around killing zombies in an old school rpg kind of way, while exploring a random city. You of course get xp for kills but also "scrap" which you can't use for the moment, there's no real goal either. But when they fix that, this can be something really special. If you are looking for a game, don't buy this yet, wait until it's done. If you like what you see about the game, buy it now to support the developers to finish this, we all want to see the end product!","March 3","true","4.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I mean we aren't talkin Episode 7 levels of good here were talking a good mix of elements with decent rpg combat. Where it fall short is in its buggyness and lack of patches or really a community following. I don't know what the dev does, or how he does it but the game feels hard but at the point where the player is getting frustrated at every turn around the never ending streets of this game.\n\n-You can get stuck in objects that make no sense being stuck behind (Small Plants or Bushes)\n\n-You start off entirely useless, like we're talking red shirt levels of useless. I havent survived to get past level 2 yet.\n\n-Other Companions start off higher level then you, which causes enemies to scale.\n\n-No way to escape battles you accidentally encounter (If I have 50 hp, there is no way I'm surviving an encounter even with a level one zombie, it ain't happening)\n\nNow while these are a few negatives, the game is fun and a challenge but its almost too challenging. The fact that all my gear comes from zombie drops or garbage cans is kinda silly, theres not even a merchant that I have found that will sell me food. Kind of farfetched of an idea for a merchant, but you can easily ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that into a game and have at least one safe area for your players to rearm, re-equip, and re-supply. There is also a lack of a way to fully heal your character outside of medkits which is a design flaw in my opinion.\n\nIf the game was ment to be sometimes frustratingly hard, or even just challenging, I think it needs a few.. stepping stones, for players to hop onto inbetween fighting numerous undead that will forever lumber their way towards the nearest sack of flesh.","January 2","true","1.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The overall gameplay is fun.

You can save anytime. You level up like an old fashioned RPG. Battle like an old RPG. But it's not as long. You play to find all the survivor characters. I like the concept. It's still in early access and I'm waiting on the dev to fix the werecar battle.\n\nIn it's current state, after the last update: 8/10\n\nCheck out our gameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knKiKCKcwCg","March 17","true","2.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"
