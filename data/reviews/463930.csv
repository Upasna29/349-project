WIlhelm scream included ;)\nIts possible people might have issues with it going fullscreen with a relatively small (and unchangable) resolution but it worked fine for me.","May 19","true","0.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","2"

And that just make it even more interesting.\n\nIt's actually a very interesting and refreshingly unique puzzle game, where you pick a section of rock to spawn into, and are then stuck in that section of rock.  You can possess boulders and move around to get to other sectiosn of rock.\n\n\n\nPros:\n+ Unusual and refreshing game mechanics.\n+ Simplistic game mechanics that can still require in some serious thinking to finish a level.\n+ While graphics are simplistic, they are still distinct and attractive.\n+ Sound effects and music is very nice.\n+ Interesting stoiry that's unlocked as you progress by reading the journal notes.\n+ Many, many levels.\n+ Full-screen mode doesn't mess with your monitor's resolution, runs at native resolution.\n\nCons:\n- Music does get a little repetitive.\n- Some levels are fiendishly difficult. (Although there is a level skip function.)\n- Very little customization options.\n- Colour pallete used is rather plain and repetitive.\n\n\nConclusions:\nVery good for a first-game dev, well done.\n\nMost of the cons that I have about this game are really just nitpicking, with one elephant in the room:  The total lack of customization options.\n\nNot being able to adjust sound volume is pretty much a required feature for most games, and only being able to turn sound and/or music on or off is not enough.\n\nKudos to full-screen mode not messing up the monitor's resoluion (something that even AAA game devs can't seem to get straight.)  But not being able to adjust the size of windowed mode makes playing it windowed at higher resolutions a real pain.\n\nOver all, would reccomend.\nI'd rate it on the Indie scale as 4/5.  Not as good as FTL or Risk Of Rain, but certainly in the same class as Submerged.","May 22","true","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The pacing of intriguing puzzle gameplay is punctuated with snippets of progressing storyline in just the right way. It has a little bit of the feel of Eternal Darkness. You are introduced to newer puzzle pieces and new abilities later in the game, and you are able to intuitively pick it up instantly with no explanation, keeping you in the game.","May 21","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Now, imagine he's incompetent and you're the boulder.  This game in a nutshell.  A few of the puzzles really made me think for a while.  Some of them were easy, others required a few tries.   Overall, pretty well balanced.  There are a number of little things that change up the game as it progresses.  Mechanics are added periodically to spice it up and keep you from getting bored. Also, gotta love the little bits of Lovecraftian inspiration thrown in.  I'd say it's worth your five bucks (or, well, a little less as it is on sale at the moment).\nEdit: Just a warning though, it is on the short side if you catch on quickly.  Some people might take longer than myself, and others might breeze through it even faster.  I thought I should throw that in there.\n\nTo the developer:\nFirst game, was it?  I think I remember seeing that.  If so, well done.  It was entertaining.  The ending could've been a little more complex, but I won't elaborate to avoid spoilers.  Also, if you do future endeavors such as this one I'd suggest ramping up the difficulty considerably toward the end.  Almost felt like the hardest part was around the half-way to three-quarter mark.  Perhaps it was the final change, or evolution if you want to call it that.  It kind of felt like the last added mechanic was highly overpowered, but it was satisfying in its own right so I personally forgive it.","May 22","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I gave a look and told myself "Well, that game looks fine, let's try it!".\nThen I discovered a good little game into the one you act as a creepy creature stalking and killing from the shadows, using your mind to wipe out the intruders, with difficulty and new usable elements getting crescendo as you keep advancing.\nIf the background music sticks with the atmosphere of the scenario, it is the only thing that didn't pleased me, as it is way too monotonous to me.\nWith 59 levels to beat and around 30 story-telling documents to unlock, a great replayability as numerous can be beaten several ways, good old-school graphics and a competitive price (and it must be specified that this is the first game of its creator, villainousgames), The Dweller is definitely worth buying.","June 5","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
