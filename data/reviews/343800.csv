"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bbblitz/recommended/343800/","bbblitz","Big Bang Blitz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bbblitz/","391 products in account","I jumped into this without knowing anything about it. Yeah I played the Mac games on an emulator and have seen them here and there and finished some on Nintendo, i'm kind of familiar with the games, I was just expecting this Steam release to be a handful of roms and some kind of emulator.\n\nSurprisingly it isn't though.. it's a set of games built from the ground up to resemble the old versions, and it does a remarkable job at it. You've got the old Mac note windows (albeit with new fonts) and all the methods of interaction are the same, including the item management where you can just lose stuff if you don't organize it well. That's refreshing. Everything works the way you'd expect it to and it even comes with a mono and color version for picky types.\n\nThat's all great engine wise. Gamewise - you might want to consider that part. First point: these games don't care AT ALL if you ever finish them. You will die in the first room, you often won't know from what or why, and you usually will not get hints on anything. They are all completely unfair by modern standards and you can often make them entirely unwinnable no matter how often you save. Do you like challenge? Are you psychic? You may enjoy these games more than other people. If you don't care so much about that and want to ♥♥♥♥ around in glorious retro adventures for cheap this stuff will do it for you. If you owned these on a Mac way back.. well you probably already bought this i'm guessing.\n\nBottom line - surprisingly good port of classic adventure games with massive problems that just aren't for everybody, but at this price you can afford to take a peek.","January 26, 2015","true","26.2"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","40","43","0","1"

It was like a time machine, it took me back to 1994, when I was playing it on the Apple Classic of my sister. It was impossible then, and it is impossible now. The adventure is unforgivable and unforgiving. It doesn't help you in any way. You may burn something which is crucial to proceed later on, you may not pick up a crucial object... the game does nothing to help you. And it's as vintage as you can get. Simply great. I recommend it 100%.\n\nBy the way, I still haven't beaten the game!!! :--)","September 6, 2015","true","3.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

This game is timeless, still every bit as fun and frustrating as it always was! Really fun to go back and play this again after enjoying the 2014 version. If you are a modern gamer who expects fancy things like music, be warned. There are only sound effects. So please don't trash a great old game for no reason. I would recommend buying the package with all the Macventure games if you want some great retro point and clicks.","March 29, 2015","true","0.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theeveningghost/recommended/343800/","theeveningghost","eveningghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theeveningghost/","225 products in account","Excellent port of the original Mac version Shadowgate. Outside of the game, which remains as fun and challanging as it was when I played it 20 years ago, I was particularly entertained by the emulated operating system for which Shadowgate functions. Not only does the console bring back memories of the past through comparable menu imagery, but the functionality of the console through resizable windows makes the game remarkably easier and more fun to play than on the stamp-sized screen of the old Apple II. While I do hope that the developers acquire the appropriate licensing to place the NES music into the game as a option, it has not detracted from my overall experience as the game function and sense of adventure have remained intact.","February 4, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The original is lacking the NES version's awesome soundtrack.\n\n2. The original's controls are a bit clunky at best. Although by today's standards the NES version's controls would be considered clunky as well.. but it is a form of clunkiness I am very familiar with.\n\nNevertheless THIS IS A CLASSIC that everyone who enjoys point and click adventures SHOULD DEFINITELY add to their libraries :D","January 31, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I remember spending hours playing and replaying this game, trying to find better and more efficient ways of beating the game. Playing the MacVenture series version of Shadowgate is different from the NES version, though the content seems to be the same. The controls, however are not. Not trying to knock it, it's still a good game, just takes a little getting used to the controls for those of us who grew up playing this on the NES or Gameboy Color. If you enjoy an old school RPG, pick this game up. Of course there is a rebooted version, with more modern graphics; However, I have a soft spot for the original.","December 13, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Having the original, and the new updated version, makes me appreciate the distance that PC games have traveled in the last 30 years. Shadowgate, while often being a frustrating 'use this object here', 'try this object there' style of game, it's one of the cornerstones of the point and click genre. I don't so much enjoy this exhaustive approach to point and click games, I prefer a more legitimate puzzle quality to them now, I sure spent plenty of time walking the dank and cobwebbed halls of Shadowgate when I was young, and due to this game being available with the update, can return on occasion.\n\nAn enjoyable game for those who have Shadowgate nostalgia, and for those interested in experiencing a classis.","March 25","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

With torch in hand I bravely waltzed into the castle, I was greeted by a pair of evil floating eyes and a maniacle cackle. The sinister eyes faded away soon after I gallantly walked into the entrance hallway. There were two doors I could see that would allow me to progress further, I daringly attempted to open both of them, I boldy tugged again, and again, and again, but it was pointless, for the doors were composed of pure corrupt communism. Using my superior capitalist reasoning, I decided it would be a dashing idea to simply try to punch the doors down! After many grand punches the doors would still not budge... Communist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... I went back to the center of the hallway, defeated... I had already been in the castle for about 10 minutes... I feared starvation would kick in soon... I looked down at my arm, and the grim truth kicked in... if I was going to last in this castle, I would have to resort to self cannibalism. I attempted to eat my arm, but just as my teeth sank in, my torch died. I stumbled around in the dark, terrified, I tripped on something, probably the rug, but thats the last thing I remembered, I hit my head on the ground and broke my neck.   10/10  -Like skyrim with self cannibalism -IGN","January 26, 2015","true","0.5"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","43","10","23","12","0"
