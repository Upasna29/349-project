If you're into games like the Sims and Game Dev Tycoon then you'll like this. You are a youtuber and it is your goal to be the #1 youtuber. You'll move up through the ranks, move into bigger and bigger houses, hire collaborators to boost your subscriber base. In making videos, you click on types of cards and edit them in as puzzle pieces to make a video.\nNow what about the Sims part? Well, it's somewhat simplistic, but there are ranks to relationships, normal, acquaintance, friend, dating, relationship, engaged, married. To increase relationship, you basically just chat on your computer. you can hire friends as collaborators, and getting married is really just an achievement.\nThere is also a level system, a variety of clothing choices, and you can also upgrade your computers until they are the best of the best.\n\nThis game is in Early Access and has some bugs that ♥♥♥♥ you. For example, a bug prevented me from getting married in the game, what a ♥♥♥♥ blocker. There also isn't really 15 hours of gameplay to match the price. I've played the game for 10 hours and honestly there really isn't anything else to do except get married, which I can't do.\nHowever, this  is a fun game, and I still recommend it.","May 19","true","10.4"," 447 of 564 people (79%) found this review helpful 449 people found this review funny","79","447","564","449","13"

Most of the issues are actually related to vague and seemingly arbitrary logic on the part of the game's developers and I hope some of this gets corrected. If people ask I'll consider trimming this down to make a guide for anyone that wants the specifics. This review is current as of the 0.7.6 build.\n\nPros:\n+The game has an interesting premise and let's us take a somewhat minimalistic look at what Youtubers put into making their videos.\n+Each of the six different personality types have different benefits and tasks. Geniuses are good at studying and taking courses, and one of their tasks lets them gain a large amount of experience for every so many videos they make. On the other side, Socializers are better at making friends and their tasks center around this, making it easier for them to find collaborators for the third apartment onwards.\n+The game has a feel to it that's very much like Sims, so it would be interesting to see if more complex sequels that allow us to do more things show up in the future.\n+Eventually there will be five different types of channels you could make videos for, allowing the game to appeal to people who don't want to be a Let's Player or other type of gamer.\n+The different reaction cards used to make clips in a video are divided into categories in a rather humorous way so the emotions behind them don't have an impact on the category they're in, which can lead to some amusing prompt/response combinations.\n+The fact that the game is in Early Access alone makes it hilarious when you look at how Vlogs are. When you record a Vlog, it treats it like recording a game, but with pictures of people that'd presumably be around you at the time and game-related prompts underneath them. This can lead to clips with..... Interesting implications.\n+The devs have added a copyright marker to any clip that was made using a copyright card, making it easier to avoid using them in a video if you don't want to.\n\nCons:\n-It's quite possible to find an interface bug where starting a course can result it being impossible to see what progress is being made.\n-The game has a rather lengthy tutorial that extends at least to the third or fourth apartment or residence. It seems the game now skips most tutorial sections that you've already played since the update unless I'm experiencing a bug on my side.\n-There seems to be a bug with the gaming events/conventions where they stop loading at 81%, making it impossible to go to them.\n-Increasing your level seems to increase the rendering points used by the camera. This is never mentioned in the game and you might not notice if you aren't paying careful attention or looking for where 2-3 rendering points vanished to.\n-There isn't an option to turn off or just not use some components even though looking at the components in the shop show there's an "off" option.\n-The requirements to trigger some events that unlock certain parts of the game require a bit of idling and being less efficient with your time. Spend all your time while waiting for a video to upload working, eating, and sleeping? Good luck getting invited to a party or the movies.\n-You need to have at least a certain relationship level with someone to invite them to an event. This makes sense. What doesn't make sense is that the developers arbitrarily decided that you can only ask people with the relationship level of "friend" to become a collaborator. If you're playing as a Romantic and have been doing the personality-related tasks, you might find yourself with nobody who's capable of collaborating with you simply because the game developers decided to make "collaborators" a relation instead of a status or something similar and locked several relation levels out of that path.\n-You don't have the option to prevent the copyright cards from coming up, making it entirely possible the game will force you to use at least one at some point in a video.\n\nIn short, this has the potential to be a good game, but a mix of Early Access wierdness, a somewhat clunky and prolonged tutorial that doesn't tie itself together all that well, and bizzarre developers' logic resulting in the implimentation of core features that contradict each other (parties/movies invite requirements being a minimum relationship level against a hard relationship requirement for hiring collaborators) and even crippling one of the six personality types (Romantic against the collaborator issue) make it difficult for me to reccommend the game in its current state.","May 22","false","30.9"," 260 of 365 people (71%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","71","260","365","18","15"

However it gets boring incredibly fast and the rewards get stale.\nSome issues:\n\n1. I hired my first collaborator (~700$ / month). Got him to make one video and after that I wasn\'t able to get him working. Made him learn a short 1-day course - he got stuck for ~2 weeks reading the book. Couldn\'t cancel it. Still had to pay his salary. Had to fire him = he got really mad.\n\n2. Time ticks very quickly. At first this is not a problem.\nAt later stages into the game, when each video has 8+ events, it can take almost a full day just to pick the proper cards, then half a day for edit and upload.\n\n3. The more you progress, the more difficult it is to use the UI. The map is larger, you can\'t easily switch from level 1 to level 2 of the apartment, lots and lots of wasted time.\n\nOverall I\'m OK with the game and what it does, it is just not for me.\nI don\'t see any replay value in it at all.\n\nCannot recommend it.","June 1","false","6.0"," 159 of 216 people (74%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","74","159","216","34","7"

Yet of course the game is still being refined, and I still seem to find myself playing this game. I think what I like about this game is that it reminds me alot about the Sims in a way. You take care of your little person, and you get the person friends / enemies / lovers.\nOne thing that can be problematic is the time goes by way too quick! And the damn subscribers are too needy, if I don't have atleast one or two videos up per day they start unsubscribing in MASSES! Yet to even that out per video you will also bring in MASSES of subscribers too. I also find the more I make videos and level the more cards / light bulbs / slides-per-video I get, which can start being troubling considering I can't edit for the life of me and I can rarely ever get to the end of recording a video without running out of light bulbs.\nI do find this game having a ton of potential, and am super excited to see the other options of channels once they come out! I think the idea of this is really interesting too, as Youtube is a rather big thing now and this is appealing to alot of people who might find themselves watching Youtube after long days of works, when favourite channels update, or even for help on things. I think this idea could be played out better though, like giving us more flexibility in cards to use in videos and making everything not so time consuming. I would love to see the time slowed down or even us be able to control the speed of the game (a pause button would be lovely).\nI'm not sure I can say I fully recommend this game yet, although I do play it I can start to feel it becoming rather repetitive and the time thing is really getting to me. I feel like I eat, sleep, make videos, and go to events without having much time to do other stuff like go to the parties and movies with my friends.  Personally I don't mind repetitive things, they make me feel very orderly, but if I can't go have a variety in a game atleast once in awhile then it starts to feel like I'm just grinding the game and not get a new and exciting experience everytime.","June 3","false","11.1"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","46","58","2","0"

(LIke amazon, xbox, ps4, ect) lol\n\nI eat and drink stuff and party all the time but I never have to use the bathroom?\nI also can't cook any food so everything is cold and either sandwiches style of food.\n\n\nAt this current state of game play its worth the 15 dollars and maybe once the full game is released/finished it might be a $30.00 game.

For me at the moment, these problems currently outweigh the pros. Let me expand a little on this (I do intend to keep it brief).\n\nThe game itself feels like a very stripped down version of The Sims. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it is a comparison that will no doubt be made often. There's at least more to do than simply making YouTube videos, such as dating, upgrading your equipment and your accommodation but don't expect much more than this. While there is some things to do while "editing" the videos, the options feel very limited. It often feels more like pure chance on whether you're going to get the right card for the scene, or even if you do get the right card, is it going to get you into trouble (copyright stuff, it's funny once). This actually becomes a HUGE frustration throughout.\n\nAnother big frustration is that while editing things can just continue to happen and stop the process. Someone may decide to just walk into your room and ask you something, so you quit the editing process. Normally in frustration I just clicked whatever button made them go away quickest, which usually resulted in a lowering my friendship with them.\n\nThere are also the occasional bug, which is to be forgiven in an early access game.

The game feels like a youtube simulator + sims, which works out pretty well. It also makes you wish youtube was this easy.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simple and easy to understand, but it doesn't mean it's stupid easy (at least not to the point where I am at). At this point you can only be a gaming channel, so you get a game, record you playing, edit, and wait for it. Just like real life for making youtube videos. Then you still have real life duties, at first you have school and need to earn money by working cuz your channel does pay enough. Then you move out and got rent and have to buy more stuff to stay relevant on youtube. So you have to be able to manage your time in game to be as efficient as possible to make sure you have constant uploads (or else you lose subs), have enough money (dunno what happens if you don't for rent, but I guess it would be gg), and still have a social life.\n\nSince it's early access I ran into several annoying bugs, but thankfully the devs took care of most of them, still some issues that annoy me, but I'm patient enough.\n\nOne issue that does stand out thought is that time in game goes by too fast. Like stupid fast. I understand recording and editing make take a few to several hours (I know I do them) but if you think too long about your decisions in game, a day can past by and making miss deadlines or just overall mess with your organizations. Hopefully in the near future this can get  tweaked a bit for an overall better experience.\n","May 26","true","15.8"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","29","37","3","0"

To go into more detail:\n\n- I was forced to start a new game twice within a couple of hours due to gamebreaking bugs which prevented me from starting new  videos.\n\n- The game world hours progress extremely quickly and are very hard to keep notice of.  It will seem like an evening has passed, but actually a week has.  In this week you have likely eaten once, not slept, played 1.5 games, studied once... you get the idea.\n\n- Those hours progress at that speed *no matter what*.  Even when you're in menus deciding on things, or choosing clothes to wear to an event, time is rapidly trickling away.  This creates an almost tangible blanket of stress that covers the whole game.  At all times you feel rushed and unable to sit back and think about your next move.  It feels contrary to what a laid-back simulation ought to be about.  A sims-style game speed setting (1x speed, 3x speed, 10x speed etc) with vastly reduced base rate of time advancement would go a long way to solving this, as would time pausing in most decision-making menus.\n\n- As a particularly frustrating example of the above: sometimes you are given tasks to do by friends, which generally are expected to be completed within a week.  Due to the above time issues, you could go to an evening event, get home, record the video and have the task expire before it finishes uploading because most of a week passed during that evening's (short) event.\n\n- There are a lot of bugs.  Courses just seem straight-up broken; most of the time I resumed a course, my character would be putting time down against nothing.  The tutorial system often breaks and leaves the game in a broken state.  Sometimes after starting a game, you get interrupted and can't resume or create new games.\n\n- The tutorial flows feel tacked-on.  For instance, it shows a tutorial bubble while you create your first video.  It describes what the screen does and how you select reaction cards for your video.  But the cards are not well explained, matching the cards up with symbols is not explained, power you spend on reactions is not explained, and worst of all while you're reading the text, a countdown timer appears to force you to make a decision.\n\nThese are easy enough to fix in time and I look forward to updating my review with a positive recommendation.\n\nIf you're particularly adventurous, feel free to give it a buy; it's not the worst game out there even in its current state.","June 4","false","3.3"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","2"

Well, looks like Steam reviews have burned me once again, because this game has a long way to go before escaping the "early access garbage tier".\n\nPROS\n- Combining a life simulator and a tycoon game was an interesting idea\n- The mechanics for recording videos and editing them are pretty fun/solid overall\n\nCONS\n- Lackluster character customization\n- Everyone looks like an ugly mii/xbox avatar\n- Sound assets suck\n- Unskippable tutorial that forces you to waste time doing things\n- Time passes by way too quickly, cannot be controlled, and can only be paused by opening certain menus.  It takes you 4+ hours to order a game on amazon.\n- You aren't rewarded that much for creating great videos.  You can slide by easily making lousy ones as long as the game is popular.\n- The UI is truly awful.  For example, when a task is completed you have to remember to go to the tasks window and click the little icon in order to get your xp reward and reset the task.\n- It takes forever (even by Youtube standards) to render and upload a video.  You cannot use your computer for anything during this time, not even shopping.\n- Leveling up relationships sucks and mostly consists of pressing "talk" a million times while listening to maybe 5 seconds of awful voiceclips in a fake language on a loop.\n- You start losing subs if you don't upload for a day or two.\n- Queuing up tasks is virtually pointless.  If I click the door to study, then to work/eat/study again, my character will come back from studying, walk to a specific point in the center of his room, then turn around and go back out.\n- Crashes often, poorly optimized, and one update dropped my fps to 15 (has been fixed).  There is no reason this game should run this poorly on my machine.\n- Skill tree is pretty meh.\n\nIt's simply not a good game.  You don't have many decisions to make and are pretty much forced into the same loop: make a video, study, eat, sleep.  It completely fails as a life simulator, and is merely a mediocre tycoon game.  The UI and performance issues only make this bad game worse.\n\nMaybe it will be an okay game someday, but stay the hell away for the time being.","June 5","false","2.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","8","8","3","0"

The cards I got for my videos are either Copyright infringement things or only high numbered (or both) so that I would either have to pay to get the video out, or would be unable to really finish the video.\nFor example: I got a request on the 28th of May to do a Walkthrough for a video until June 5th. You have to play the game a little before you can do a walkthrough. I had to redo the normal Gameplay video so many times, that I was unable to fullfill this request. I was unable to publish more than one video in this timeframe.\n\nI was also trying to safe up for a computer, since you can only buy things through your computer, it really sucks when it constantly breaks.

The game seems to have a lot of potential. Below I list quite a lot of cons, but it's only to let the developers know what (in my opinion) could use some improvement. The game is really fun to play, and given that it's early access, I hope the developers will keep on improving it.\n\nPRO's\n- great art style\n- good idea\n- fun gameplay (see some fun-limiting cons listed below)\n- some realism, which is nice (having to study when living with your parents, having to buy your food when living on your own, etc).\n\nCON's\n\n- Buggy. As others have stated, some ordered items never get delivered. It's especially frustrating when you accept a paid review mission and have a tight deadline to make a video and the game doesn't arrive. Then you get the message from a frustrating publisher: "you were supposed to deliver it and you did nothing!" - well, of course I did nothing, because I didn't have the freaking game! :-|\n- Editing part of the game is a fun concept, but it also gets frustrating later in the game when it gets noticeably unfavorable for the player (getting more and more cards with copyrighted content that forces the player to pay the fine or cards that don't fit a given scene). I wish editing was based on actual skill, not complete randomness (the cards you get to choose from are chosen randomly, but become more and more punishing as the game progresses).\n- The social aspect of the game (meeting people, partying, etc.) is not interesting enough. Every party event is exactly the same: clicking "talk" button and staring at the screen for 5 minutes. Highly repetitive music makes this experience quite annoying.\n- After about 3-4 hours of play I ran out of things to buy / improve. The game quickly turned into watching my money and subscribers grow with nothing else to do (except attending parties and getting a girlfriend, which, as stated before, quickly starts feeling repetitive). Randomly generated titles of new releases and their repeating covers make further gameplay not exciting enough. Feels like the game needs more content to live up to its full potential.\n- Taking a course seems like a cool idea, but later you realize it does exactly the same thing as making a video. Taking an advanced course takes so much time that you start loosing subscribers. I didn't see a reason to ever take a course - making another video always seemed like a better idea\n- It was frustrating that the game doesn't pause when you get a pop-up message or enter any statistic window of any sort. I wish the game didn't punish the player (losing time = losing subscribers) for trying to read all the information that needs to be read. Also, the lack of ability to speed up time while taking a course or talking to somebody at a party made those activities uninteresting. It's because of that I decided not to attend any events and not to take any courses.\n\nIf those issues are fixed (especially bugs), this could be a very good game!","May 23","true","6.2"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

I'll list a few of the problems I have with the release at this time:\n\n>The interface is incredibly clunky and needlessly complicated.\n>Interactions around the apartment are a pain due to the horrible controls\n>Escape doesn't X out of popped up windows\n>The tutorials are strangely-paced out and withhold critical information.\n>Subscribers demand a new video very often, leaving little time for interactions with friends (surely this is meant to be a "realistic" feature, but it's pretty obnoxious)\n>Interactions outside the home are incredibly shallow. I thought my game stalled during a "movie" scene.\n>Editing software is frustrating until updated. Seems almost random in nature. This especially is where the tutorial falls flat.\n\nHopefully further refinement through the early access platform will put an end to some of these worries. Right now the game is not what I'd consider much fun due to the frustrating elements listed above.

I know it's early access so lots of its downsides are most certainly caused by that. The game is working well, it's not laggy and it's completly playable, so that's cool. It's a little bit buggy but you know...early access. I find the game really fun and addictive even though i can feel it can easily become repetitive, but that's like most of management/strategy/simulation games, and i assume that when the other kind of video making will be available, it'll add a lot of replayability. (For now, only 'gaming' is inplanted in the game)\n\nSome problems i encountered :\n- The menu of games you own became to load slowly when you own a lot of games, selling them has to be done one by one and the menu closes everytime you sell one :(\n- You can't sort the games to buy by date, nor price, etc.\n- You can't sort your friend list (by friendship would be nice) and i don't think you can remove people from you friend list, so if you talk to everybody like i did, your friend list is horribly long.\n- I did not really feel the days, i mean, you can see the date, but you don't feel like you've work an entire day, plus day and night don't really matter.\n- I had a few bugs with the collaborators that won't work and i had to fire them, and they become haters :( Also, isn't that a bit harsh of them to become haters just because i fire them ? (it bugged 2 times, then it has been working perfectly)\n- WHERE IS THE FRIDGE D: ok i found it but why is that fridge next to the bed and the kitchen on the other floor with no fridge ? (house with 3 computers)\n- There is no way to pause the game if you are editing or filming. Also i personnally would enjoy to be able to browse while shopping etc., but the game is running :( You have to shop quickly !\n- There is no explaination that the networks are not available BEFORE a certain point of the game. I also assume 'Tag videos' are not available immediatly after you get the "mission" to do one (that, or i totally did not found how to do them).\n- What's the meaning of the yellow cards while recording ?\n- Maybe the goals to achieve each month while in a Network should be clearerly explain ?\n- I don't find the NPC's reactions really clear, are they happy or not ? Mhh i don't know :(\n- If i'm not mistaken, you can't sell your old computer parts, nor reuse them for another computer.\n- You can't fast forward time like when you're watching a movie or when you attend game presentations.\n- The sound of dialogues is missing (?) and the talking while game presentations is quite funny but i'm not sure if that's positive. The music can become repetitive very fast.\n- At the moment i feel like there is not enough personalization of NPC's (My 2 collaborators have the same face and haircut as my character, and the 2 are wearing the same clothes :D) You can't personalize your collaborators.","May 24","true","16.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

More so than quite a few early access games that I've bought. The game suffers from a few semi-gamebreaking glitches as a result of this. The most annoying one by far is a glitch that causes items that you buy to not appear at your house. This glitch is simply fixed by quitting your game and then re-loading again, but sometimes if you've ordered multiple items you have to quit and reload for each of them.\n\nSecondly, the grammar is atrocious. I do understand a non-English development team is working on this game, but regardless of that fact this game is just painful to play. Google Translate could do a better job in some cases.\n\nThese may seem like small gripes, but for a game that currently is being sold at over $15, they make the game not worth its current cost. Wait for this game to either be on sale, or far more developed before you drop money on it.","May 23","false","7.4"," 42 of 78 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","42","78","4","4"

If you wait till the game is fully realeased, it will be more expensive. $15 may seem like alot to some people, but really compared to other sim games it is a bargin *Cough* Sims 4 *cough*. Yes, there are bugs, but nothing that a restart can't fix. Bugs are to be expected, no game is bug free, ever. This game is in Early Access meaning that it is not a complete game.

Well, there are certain elements of those games in there, because basically, in this game, you create gaming videos instead of games. And another parallel - this game, to me, is just as addictive as some of those game tycoon games, maybe even more so.\n\nHere is the deal:\n- You are a game-vlogger, and your job is creating gameplay videos. You can eventually make reviews, walkthroughs etc.\n- You can upgrade your skills (acting, video editing etc.) to make better videos, and you can upgrade your PC, or get other systems, like consoles.\n- Your goal is income through youtube clicks and likes, and you do get positive and negative comments\n- You also wanna make friends and KEEP them... these people will ask you to make videos for them, which gives you XP and money.\n- You can go to parties, game presentations, the movies, and communicate with people there.\n\nAll this is just scratching the surface... you wanna skill up, do courses to get better at making videos, get new outfits in order to wear the right outfit at each event, you have to make sure you eat and sleep enough, or your videos won't be as good (is there a lesson in here?)\nSo there is quite some depth in this game, much more so than in some of the other games I hinted at, and I like that. Sometimes, it feels as if you have to juggle TOO many things, but eventually, you will learn what to focus on. There is a bit of a tutorial, and some hints at what to do.\n\nFor an Early Access-game this one is VERY well done already, with many features. I didn't experience the bugs other have reported (like deliveries not coming in), but there are some flaws, no doubt due to the game still being in development:\n\n- Some buttons and menus still aren't translated all the way, so the localization needs to be finished.\n- For some reason, right now, I am stuck in my progress. I am in the second building (living with a friend), am married, and have completed all steps of the current "quest" (upload 2 vids, study courses and one other thing)... all those are greenlit, so it should complete, but it doesnt.\nI don't know whether this is a bug. Also, I know I should move to a bigger building, yet I don't know what I have to do to get there, and there are no hints telling me... do I need a certain amount of money, need to do something else?\n- Some menus still need new text. For example, when you do interviews, you get the text you get when you make game-videos, which doesn't make sense.\n- With the youtube comments... I had my WIFE post a comment posting "I don't know who this is but his videos suck". So maybe the relationships need to be takern into consideration, like your spouse actually knowing you, or friends cutting you some slack?\n- For everything that happens in a game, you have to react a certain way. TO do so, you get three choices, and the more you progress, the more variety there is, as in kinds of choices. But it's always three. And sometimes, none of them FIT. Like "You beat a challenging level. How do you react? Angry comment, angry yell, technical commentary". None of these fit. Dont know whether this is really on purpose\n\nPlease remember, the game is in EA, so the (small) complaints above are for the devs as well.\n\nStill... this, to me, is REALLY impressive for an EA game! The graphics are quite cute, and there is a ton of depth to it. I love how shopping online, the recording of gaming vid (you watch yourself gaming through the webcam), etc... all that is really nicely done.\n\nSo... lots of depth here, it's already very addictive, and there is a lot of stuff to do, with more to come (hinted at in the game). So far, this title looks REALLY good, I really enjoy it. If they can iron out the bugs and add a bit more depth, this will definitely be a great value at 15 bucks once it's released.\n\nDEVS: Please don't mess this up! You have something really cool here, so please don't ruin it!!\n\nNo rating as it's EA, but this gets a strong recommendation! If you don't wanna deal with an EA-game, wait until release, but if you don't mind trying EA, give this a try if you're into games like the game dev tycoon ones! Really really good already!","May 23","true","6.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

IT's limited to 4 tasks at a time, but doing more than one or two tasks seems to cause the game to lag.\nExample - I made my character study, and queued up eating and then sleep. The mum came in and yelled at me, then I went to eat, then slept, then I made another video. I got a message from a friend. Only then did the little message from mum pop up, telling me to study more or I would be grounded.\nIt's very minor, but distracting. That's the only real problem I have with the game for now.\nI'm sure the other types of YouTube "jobs" (Other than Gamers) will come soon enough. Though there is very limited "Life Goals" to choose from, it is just there to give you slightly altered tasks and goals to complete. The gameplay itself is good, if a little slow paced. But much like real life YouTube, it's not going to kick off overnight. You can't expect it to.\nLike I said, the game is very much in Early Access, and it's pretty much what you expect, and while it's a little buggy and slow, I do really enjoy the game, I highly reccomend people give it a try. Personally, I can't wait to see what the updates bring.","May 25","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/danieltimothy/recommended/428690/","danieltimothy","Danamite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/danieltimothy/","","Early Access Review\n\nI am having issues with the games graphics, after a few minutes of a session the walls, characters and other in game items will become transparent making the game hard to play and taking away from the visual experience. The game play itself is quite slow and crashes after around 7 minutes of continual play. This takes away from the games value and makes it increasingly difficult to enjoy. Until these issues and bugs are addressed I cannot unfortunately recommend anyone purchase this game as I do not feel you will achieve what you hope for when in game.\n\nSecond Edit\n\nFurthermore, upon attempting to play this game again I found that the online shopping feature had the same graphic for all items making it hard to tell what was being purchased.\n\nThird Edit\n\nIn attending the Gaming Convention I was set the task of playing arcade games in an attempt to win a gaming console. My attempts to play these games were hindered by slow graphics which made it impossible to achieve the goal set.\n\nFourth Edit\n\nAfter selecting the option to move into my own apartment, the game totally froze on the loading screen. Not even reaching the 1% mark. Lagging game play and slow speeds like this have been a common theme throughout the game and thus far have made the playing experience a woeful one.\n\nFifth Edit\n\nAfter experiencing the loading issues when moving house, I restarted my PC and opened up the game once again. To my displeasure the finds to move apartment had been taken, however, I was not able to stay in the new apartment until I paid once again. I highly recommend that you wait until these bugs along are addressed and fixed before purchasing this game, I will update my review as bug fixes and new versions are released.\n\nSixth Edit\n\nFollowing the release of update 0.7.5 I have noticed the game play moving fat more smoothly with less crashes. However, the major flaw of which I first experienced - the transparent walls and characters is still present making the game hard to play. The game also appears to be crashing every time any shopping is attempted, making progression incredibly difficult. At this moment in time I cannot recommend that you purchase YouTubers Life.\n\nSeventh Edit\n\nFollowing this post, I will proceed to request a refund. The game had become unplayable, I will restart the complete story only to be faced with continual cragses whenever a new action is attempted, graphic failires resulting in confusing and frankly sore to look at game play. Please, save your money and neglect from purchasing this game.","May 24","false","1.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","0"

You cannot get more than one for a given  console.\n\nI'm afraid this game will not reach its potential anytime soon, let alone features that could make the game better.","May 22","false","12.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

If you like Tycoon games like me I would highly suggest you purchase this game and support the developers in creating updates, as this game shows great potential.\nI have some pros and cons to go with this review.\n\nPros:\n+Very addicting to play if you are in to Tycoon games\n+It is very similar to Sims. The only difference is that this game represents a person who has a YouTube channel\n+You can go to the cinema and parties just like a normal person\n+You can go to conventions for YouTubers or game releases\n+Pleasing graphics\n\nCons:\n-It can get repetitive after a couple of hours playing\n-There are some bugs that can sometimes will need you to start over again (Bug where you buy something, it arrives at your doorstep but it quickly dissapears and you can't buy anything else)\n-It is difficult to start up\n\nOverall, I would most likely recommend this to anyone who enjoys Tyccon games or any game where you maintain a business. If I was to give it a rating out of 10; I would give it a 8.5/10. I would've given it higher if not for the game breaking bug, however it is an early access game and so the game still has time to improve.","May 22","true","7.3"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","12","24","4","0"

If we do not take into account few optimization problems and typical bugs from this kind of games, this game looks interesting and quite well done even being in early access. The story-flashback mode that the game uses to give us certain objectives and tasks to increase our number of subscribers getting more popularity makes more interesting the game mechanics. The fact that we can unlock new flats and new items such as furnitures for our room or new components for our (master race) PC makes the game customization bigger. However do not expect an easy game: it is not easy to gain money and it will be difficult to progress quickly.\n\nAs long as updates from the devs are coming regularly (weekly or, at least, monthly) and new content is given, we can find so enjoyable and original game. I would recommend to buy it, relation price-quality is not bad and the game can be really addictive.","May 18","true","7.1"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","1"

It's fun to play and easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. I'd love to see more character customization options, as far as hair style/color goes. I've encountered some bugs, but nothing game-breaking or immersion-breaking. I will say that time seems to flow too quickly in the game and doesn't have much meaning-- your character will sleep for three or four hours a day and spend three hours crossing the apartment. It also started to feel quite repetitive after a while. I still recommend it because these issues are easily fixed and the game is in early access.","May 26","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

And it did. The patch fixed most things I was angry with, which was incorrect English translations and repetive gameplay. The game has you, a youtuber, telling your life story of how you became famous. Although not every thing is implemented  yet (like, where the heck do I buy the new phone in it) I enjoy this game. Gameplay can get a little repetive but it has it's pros. I'm sure the game will improve, and although this seems to only touch base with what it could become, it seems like the games going down a good path.

If you like Tycoon games like me I would highly suggest you purchase this game and support the developers in creating updates, as this game shows great potential.\nI have some pros and cons to go with this review.\n\nPros:\n+Very addicting to play if you are in to Tycoon games\n+It is very similar to Sims. The only difference is that this game represents a person who has a YouTube channel\n+You can go to the cinema and parties just like a normal person\n+You can go to conventions for YouTubers or game releases\n+Pleasing graphics\n\nCons:\n-It can get repetitive after a couple of hours playing\n-There are some bugs that can sometimes will need you to start over again (Bug where you buy something, it arrives at your doorstep but it quickly dissapears and you can't buy anything else)\n-It is difficult to start up\n\nOverall, I would most likely recommend this to anyone who enjoys Tyccon games or any game where you maintain a business. If I was to give it a rating out of 10; I would give it a 8.5/10. I would've given it higher if not for the game breaking bug, however it is an early access game and so the game still has time to improve.","May 22","true","7.3"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","12","24","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azeriel/recommended/428690/","Azeriel","Azeriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azeriel/","194 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt has potentials, but there are a lot that still needs to be fixed and QOL improvements before release. Would I recommend it once they're fixed? absolutely. Right now, not so much.\n\nFirst of all let me just say that they might have the next big indie title here. It's not often a tycoon management game tries to tackle to the social aspect as well, and if it's done correctly, it would be a great attempt at a stale genre.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my suggestions based on my time spent on the early access of the game:\n\n- Camera movements are my biggest gripe right now. I don't know why the camera sometimes moves like it's on acid in which even a slightest move request would swing the camera to the extreme. Additionally, there's no proper angle once you move to your second apartment to get a good look at everything.\n\n- Speaking of camera and movement, there should be a way for me to look at the second floor without having my character use the stairs. Please see how The Sims handle multiple floors buildings.\n\n- Proper time formatting please. I hope this is just an Early Access thing, but going to school to "study" at 2H (which I assumed 2AM) made absolutely no sense.\n\n- There should be an option to alter the speed of time (x0.5, x1, x2, x3). More often than not I felt rushed in the game to get the next video out and when I was wasting time doing social events, I just sat there without any option to make the time move faster.\n\n- Accidentally cancelling the video editing sequence for whatever reason should allow you to get back to it. Either by a proper UI function, or clicking the computer again.\n\n- The computer breaks too fast. And hopefully there's a system where you just eventually able to fix your own computer like in real life.\n\n- If my collaborator is in the middle of creating a video, he or she should not randomly stopped just because I went to a social event. This happens multiple times that I had to request the video creation again.\n\n- I should be able to ask my collaborator to stop reading a course book and continue later if we need a new video STAT.\n\n- Allow us to chat with our contacts even when the video is rendering or updating.\n\n- We can't shop with our smartphone?\n\n- Accidentally missing an event for whatever reason should allow you to get back to it if the event is not going yet. I accidentally closed the "automatic event pop-up" to go to a game presentation and my character just won't go anymore. That is silly especially since I'm not even late to the presentation whatsoever.\n\n- Need more keybindings and quick menu.\n\nThat will be all for now. I love these kind of games and I'm looking forward for the full release, if these issues are addressed.","May 29","false","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crypticcat/recommended/428690/","crypticcat","Merdakah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crypticcat/","212 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCurrent negative recommendation is purely based on the state of the game being not finished and dire need of development in key-areas, which detract from the game being an enjoyable experience.\n\nYT-L is a fun game. Time-management, keeping up appearances, social engineering, a puzzle-minigame in the form of video-editing and empire-building. The game is really good in appearing to be casual, but it is actually reasonably hard to master.\n\nMoreover, the game gets awesome-points from me for avoiding to include RL-youtubers, so there's no Pew-die-pie in there. Even more awesome-points for the game because it avoids namedropping meme-games, minecraft or FNaF. It makes the game, apart from the title, a timeless management game that explores a new industry.\n\nBut there are some major bug-bears. A PC-setup that's nothing but top of the line components shouldn't break every five minutes of real gameplay time. It's annoying and it actually broke my current playthrough of the campaign as my sci-fi PC got stuck in a perpetual loop of breaking, getting repaired and then breaking before I could do anything with it afterwards. The frequency in which the PC breaks is unrealistic, irritating, annoying and as far as I'm concerned a FU from the developer to their player-base.\n\nThe player should not be the only one keeping up friendships. A cell-phone is not a one-way only gadget. Also, why can't I order stuff through the cell-phone? My youtuber had the best cellphone money could buy, a cellphone that obviously had Internet, because it could access the 'Wall' (their version of Facebook, I guess). Yet, when my PC is broken again or it is rendering a video, my cellphone is totally useless to order stuff online, to chat with my friends or do other things that RL-cellphones can do.\nI have the feeling that this is a contrivance to make the game 'harder'. It's just extremely irritating that only through the PC the internet can be used, even to stock up the fridge.\n\nThe game has many things right. There are many options to costumize your youtuber's looks and appearance and the style of clothes they wear are important for events and gatherings. You can also buy many items for your house, though you have no control over where things that you buy go. I have also not found any indication that buying stuff for the house makes your youtuber's life better or easier. It's merely a money-sink.\n\nEditing videos is minigame that's a rudimentary deckbuilder; you enhance video-clips with post-production cards that you earn for different things that your youtuber does. There's depth there as the cards have different strengths and can be positive or negative. It's up to the player to guess the right card for a given video-clip.\nAfter selecting the 'powers' for all the clips, the player must puzzle the clips together in the best possible way. The more clips that have the right powers, the easier that will be.\nHowever, there were many instances where I canned a video because the choices I had were mostly negative including being forced to select powers that would result in copyright infringement. The fines on those prohibit uploading the video. While probably realistic, it's wasted time and I believe that a game should always respect the player's time.\n\nAt this time YT-L is allright, being held back by instances of being caught in a unescapable fail-loop that basically ends your run, a one-way friendship system and a mini-game that can screw you over through no fault of your own. It gets compounded by nagging NPCs that only seem to be there to be annoying.\nBut there's also a lot of good things going on that I enjoy and I look forward to see how the game grows over the coming months towards 1.0.\nAt this moment, this game isn't worth a positive recommendation, as the awesome-points I give it are being undone by the game's insistance of being an annoying piece of crap. I hope that the developer adjusts those instances in the future to make YT-L a truly fun and enjoyable product!","May 25","false","21.5"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","8","16","3","0"

It would be nice if it did.\nSometimes, when you have two events going on, you know how it slides from the left under the current event?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azeriel/recommended/428690/","Azeriel","Azeriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azeriel/","194 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt has potentials, but there are a lot that still needs to be fixed and QOL improvements before release. Would I recommend it once they're fixed? absolutely. Right now, not so much.\n\nFirst of all let me just say that they might have the next big indie title here. It's not often a tycoon management game tries to tackle to the social aspect as well, and if it's done correctly, it would be a great attempt at a stale genre.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my suggestions based on my time spent on the early access of the game:\n\n- Camera movements are my biggest gripe right now. I don't know why the camera sometimes moves like it's on acid in which even a slightest move request would swing the camera to the extreme. Additionally, there's no proper angle once you move to your second apartment to get a good look at everything.\n\n- Speaking of camera and movement, there should be a way for me to look at the second floor without having my character use the stairs. Please see how The Sims handle multiple floors buildings.\n\n- Proper time formatting please. I hope this is just an Early Access thing, but going to school to "study" at 2H (which I assumed 2AM) made absolutely no sense.\n\n- There should be an option to alter the speed of time (x0.5, x1, x2, x3). More often than not I felt rushed in the game to get the next video out and when I was wasting time doing social events, I just sat there without any option to make the time move faster.\n\n- Accidentally cancelling the video editing sequence for whatever reason should allow you to get back to it. Either by a proper UI function, or clicking the computer again.\n\n- The computer breaks too fast. And hopefully there's a system where you just eventually able to fix your own computer like in real life.\n\n- If my collaborator is in the middle of creating a video, he or she should not randomly stopped just because I went to a social event. This happens multiple times that I had to request the video creation again.\n\n- I should be able to ask my collaborator to stop reading a course book and continue later if we need a new video STAT.\n\n- Allow us to chat with our contacts even when the video is rendering or updating.\n\n- We can't shop with our smartphone?\n\n- Accidentally missing an event for whatever reason should allow you to get back to it if the event is not going yet. I accidentally closed the "automatic event pop-up" to go to a game presentation and my character just won't go anymore. That is silly especially since I'm not even late to the presentation whatsoever.\n\n- Need more keybindings and quick menu.\n\nThat will be all for now. I love these kind of games and I'm looking forward for the full release, if these issues are addressed.","May 29","false","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Hopefully more coming for that\n- Can lose some videos/etc. Maybe bug, but I blame the UI as well. If you goto an event and do an interview and also do a selfie/video blog you lose your interview or vlog. So even though you create 2 things, one just disappears\n- Very light tutorial/explanation. Still trying to understand exactly how to edit the videos, if it matters to line up all the tabs or not. Or even how sometimes it seems impossible as you don't have enough 'lightbulbs' to reach the end so your video doesn't cose properly. (For those that don't own it, you get up to about 12 different segments of video to edit, sometimes you run out of 'stamina' and can't properly end the video. So you post it unfinished, people seem to still enjoy it all the same though)\n- Audio is slightly poor, terrible talking audio and the background music is only like 20 seconds long and just repeats forever. Hoping more to come since it's just early access.\n\nIt's absolutely worth the price though.

Go to the movies and events with friends to boost up your friendships and network yourself to other youtubers.\n\nEventually you move to a new place, which allows you to upload videos quicker, and more opportunities open up for you with level ups like allocating points to bump up the subscribers, or open up new types of videos you can make like unboxings, first to play, and more.\n\nCollaborate with friends and roommates to make a multiplayer video,  steal shots from other peoples videos or use copywrite music to make yours stand out more (but watch out for the fines!)\n\nIt's Early Access still, so there are bugs that need to be worked out still and the game is still growing quite a bit, but the Dev's seem pretty on the ball with it, and that's awesome.\nDefinitely worth the purchase.

They're set to go home when they're tired, but if they're studying, they will become static and neither learn their skill or go home to rest\n- relationships are confusing. i never knew how to romanticize someone (though i never spent more than 10 minutes at a time trying) and friendships decay unexpectedly fast\n- glitches in progression. i only had 1 employee thorugh the majority of the game and cleared most of it in 5 hours. Needs to be rebalenced because once i got a second guy, money was coming in wayyy to easily\n- simple glitches like my mom coming in my room and telling me i need to study more even though i just came back from studying and window x's exiting entire menus so i have to reopen and redo all my configs again\n- tutorial is lacking depth. it teaches you the very basics but the more complex stuff is left to be discovered. Ex: i didnt learn until 3-4 hours in how editing card compatiability worked. I just noticed the cards were the same but it never hinted at that and i was always distraced by what the cards read.\n\nOverall, great game. The fukk version should be a 9.5/10 but as it stands, i give it a 7.5/10, the cause being the balance and glitches in progression.","May 30","true","11.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It took my sim 3 hours to go to the kitchen and eat something before he managed to come back. This game can be pretty rough on you if you try and level up too fast.\nHOWEVER, despite saying that, I can easily say this is one of the best games I've played in awhile. I need to study, I need to eat, I need to sleep and yet I was able to play this game for a very long time without stopping or ever wanting to stop.\n\nThe realistic contrast of juggling Youtube life and a social life makes for very interesting game play. Filled with lots of people wanting to get in touch with you, people asking for help with their games on top of you making your own games or collaborating with others. Then there's money to worry about, food, copyright issues (lol)\n\nI highly recommend it, regardless of whether you have a life or not, this is one game that should definitely not slip between the cracks. I'll be very interested in how they make an already addictive game like this even better.","May 31","true","13.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I mean there is some glitches that just make me reset the game which is ridiculous.\nSome glitches are\n\n-If you assign your workers a video before you go to a party; when you comeback your command totally reset and your workers are just wondering\n-I have the mansion and I need to upload a lot of videos. My only problem is that the mansion appears to have more then 1 tv but everyone has to use the same TV which wastes my time only putting up 1 video at a time.\n-When I press "see course" on my worker, my screen freezes and I have to reset my game.\n-My player has no logic when choosing a computer, they should add a feature where the player should just use the computer nearest because I often scramble around the house when the computer was right next to me.\n-The game gets really slow over 1 mil subscribers especially in the mansion.\n-I get kicked from my network everytime for no reason, I go to the events and upload but the network continues to kick me.\n-Later in the game I never have enough points to complete editing a video, I run out which makes me stop the video in the middle.\n-You should be able to change your characters physical features whenever you want.\n-When the vendors at partys and events give you a task for a free item, you still end up paying.\n-Whats the point of the upstairs of the mansion when have the rooms are empty.\n-I buy a lot of PC equpment in the game, when you have more then 1 computer in the house, you should be able to passdown computers because whenever I upgrade, the enitial one just gets discarded, i'd like if I could move it to a diffrent station because thats how I lose money.\n-Going to events are pointless because you lose nothing and can just chat with friends online.\n-I don't like how I have to waste my time assigning my workers things to make videos on, in real life they do what they want, just let them make a video and I get to approve of it, I don't need to assign them.\n\nThis game is alright, I mean it's obviously new, however I paid for it.

You start off at your mom's house still going to school. You start off taking tests, but with some money you'll purchase new games and recording equipment. You put that back into your videos, and you rinse and repeat. That builds into new places to stay, and with enough persistence, you'll have your own YouTube team!\n\nIn my opinion it's a very fun game, but just be aware this is an Early Access game still. There are some balancing issues once you get into the Luxury stage and Network modes. For some people you'll probably find the game too repetitive in its current state. The "Sim" aspect isn't fully hashed out quite yet.\n\n\nHowever I'm quite excited to see where this game goes. It seems the game will allow different types of YouTube channels in the future (currently you can only do a gaming channel). The developers seem to have clear direction on where this game is going as well, as opposed to other Early Access games.","June 1","true","13.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's hard to make enough money to pay your bills. There is no pause during anything you do. It can take 3 hours just to get some food to eat. By time the game gets to your place and you unbox it ect.

Would reccomend this game if you are open to bugs and other issues. Currently, I've faced unstable situations and weird bugs throughout, however I'm still having a decent experience. When the game is out of Early Access, I think it will be a must buy title.

When the ingame-clock progresses when you're in menus, changing clothes or creating videos, this makes you feel like you have to be on your toes every split-second. Before you know it, an in-game week has passed and you were nowhere near able to complete the tasks you were given, seeing as you in that time also need to sleep, eat, work and study.\n\nIt gets a little better once you can afford hiring collaborators to make videos for you, but when you yourself decide to chip in (afterall, you are the big cahuna), it feels like the in-game clock discourages you to do so. Because while you are editing, picking clips to use and putting them together, time still runs and you cannot upload your collabs videos until you're done yourself.\n\nThis game still has a ways to go to iron out some minor flaws, but it's definately worth checking out. If the above seems discouraging, try once the game has been released.","June 4","true","20.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Add a feature where we can sell our old computer items or we could use them to upgrade the collabrators Computer, It just seems like a waste of money purchasing upgrades for the second station when you have already purchased these upgrades. (ect: I now use a 5 star mouse but before that I had a 3 star mouse, maybe Instead of repurchasing the 3 star mouse for the second station there could be an option to use my old equipment)\n\n2. If a friend is playing Youtubers life then maybe there character could be an option for a roomate or an option to make then a collab person working for you.\n\n3. Why does it cost so much to get a good collaborator? If we upgrade skills for a Level 1 character they become more expensive, maybe this goes back to the whole friend thing making so they still have the good skills but you pay 50% less then you would with a good NPC Collaborator.\n\n4. More game events? Technically there are several game events a year IRL so maybe have a few more in the game?\n\n5. Why does someone have to come to my house to play a game with me? Cant we just play oline with each other?\n\n6. Making the video became real difficult real quick, I dont have enought lightbulbs to make a good video anymore, maybe make it so we can multi select which film things we want to pop up.","June 4","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE!" as you watched the videos and left a downvote (because you're bitter). Inspired by the claim this is like The Sims series, I decided to take a look.\n\nIt's certainly worthy of the claim. Not only is it like The Sims with balancing relations and a job (being a famous youtube personality), the mouse controls are similar to The Sims as well. If you're transitioning over, fear not. Easily done. The graphics are a bit cartoony which is charming in a way. You're walking around as your own customized character and they have an awfully large head, a terrible hairstyle, and they're hoping you're going to guide their way to a successful life.\n\nIt's a very nice start for Early Access. This is what I want to see for Early Access. Good job, devs. Keep up the good work. I'll keep playing.\n\nI can understand if you're a little leery after seeing the hype and reading these reviews. Yes, the game has some bugs. I haven't encountered anything life ending right now other than some friends not recognizing that yes, I put up their videos in time. This seemed to stop once I moved to an apartment with a roommate. Now I'm rolling in cash.\n\nThe game isn't too hard to learn. There's some minor instructions and they don't hold your hand like you're a toddler. I found out most things on my own. What I would love to see in the future is a better explanation to the video editting. I'm still unsure how to do this. I caught on later that you can get higher scores with better arrangements, but this should probably be explained in gigantic letters for people who rush through.\n\nSomething that made me a little bit peeved (but otherwise still willing to play) were the ugly hairstyles. All of the women look like their hair has been cut by an angry lawnmower. That's probably an exaggeration, but this game is currently victim to "girls have long hair, pulled back hair, or fros". There's probably going to be more variety as time goes on, but as of right now, don't expect any ladies you create to look "pretty/to your liking/in your image/etc". A second thing is when you go to film vlogs, the text is as if you're filming a game video. Whoops. We're not gaming now. We're at a press release/party/con/movie!\n\nDating is a mysterious process in this game. My roommate seems to has the hots for me. That's great but like... She scares me. She comes on super strong and in real life, people who do that frighten me so I want to hide under those Space Invaders sheets and NEVER COME OUT. I haven't figured out how to flirt with other people. I do that and they stare at me, cringe, and just want me to go away. This is me in real life because I stare at romance then walk over to the macaroni art table, sit down, and start creating unicorns while talking about cartoons. Accurate. It's been about five different men and I haven't gone on a single date, but my roommate keeps trying to make awkward advances!\n\nI'm not a fan of the meter that tells you went to leave an event. I feel like your needs for food/drink and sleep would be better indicators of that. I feel like those would probably drain faster being outside. Still, you do need something that says "hey, we need to leave and get back to work to make money off of youtube!" So this makes sense as something being there. It just doesn't seem realistic as a sims-style game to me. Usually your needs would tell you when it's time to go. Or maybe even the person you showed up with would tell you when they're leaving so it's leave now or have no ride back! We're splitting hairs here. Take this or leave this, it's just an incredibly stupid opinion!\n\nOtherwise, there's not much else to say. It's a sim based on becoming youtube famous. It's still adding things (I can't wait to see cooking and fashion added because those are two other things I follow IRL) so keep looking.\n\nIt's up to you to get it now. The perks of doing early access means it's cheap. This game has the potential to become fairly big and whatever you saw your favorite youtube personality play? That's been fixed since you saw it. I\'m seeing fixes and additions since I was convinced to pick it up myself. You can also keep waiting.\n\nIf sim-style games are your niche in the gaming world, this is something to consider. Forget the whole "youtube personality" aspect of the game. It's a pretty nice sim alone. Adding the youtube concept makes it light hearted and gives it more fun. It's lovely.\n\nAs always, health warnings. The disco parties? I want to hurl. The lighting is offensive on the eyes and if you get migraines, you'll want to be away from those as far as possible. Oddly enough the Space Invaders-esque backgrounds at the release events you get invited to? Not as bad. Just beware the discos. They are very bad for your brain.\n\ntl;dr, A very strong start. Keep it going. Keep revising.

Most of the simulator games are really simple made, but this one has gone over the line! They implemented party's, weddings, houses, the actual editting part. And a lot more.\n\nEarly AccesThis game is still in early access, I was actually impressed that this game was in early access because in my opinion it has everything that's needed for a simulator game. Oh and one thing where I am really fan of is that your guys are later on adding more possibility's to start your channel like: Cooking, Gaming, Beauty and more! I can't wait to see what to expect.\n\nThe RatingIn my opinion this game has everything thats needed so here's my rating:\n\n4.5/5 - Gameplay\n5/5 - Graphics\n4.6/5 - Options (There should be an option to disable Tutorials.)\n\n\n","May 22","true","13.2"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","11","23","3","0"

The "Pikachu" hat for instance can lead down some dark holes considering how trigger happy Nintendo can be.\n\nMessage over.\n\n\nYouTube has created an opportunity for normal people to become famous with the simple creation of visual media. Let's Plays to politics, culinary excellence to downright stupidity, a video has been enough to make a person immortal in this day and age. That fame is not always easily won and it can take years of slow, painful dedication before getting the right boost needed to start raking in the subscribers. From the bedroom of your mother's home to a luxurious house, Youtuber Life descends into the story of the worlds greatest Youtuber's rise to glory. Is this rarely used premise the cornerstone of a enriching new life simulator or just another poorly edited idea with poor views?\n\nThe visual approach to this game looks similar to a crossbreed of the Sims and the Miis used for the Wii. Furniture, environments, people and items all have this cel-shaded look with very refined structure detail. Lighting effects are well implemented to display the passage of time and while the facial animations feel stiff, movement is agile with little input delay. Animations from talking, laughing, playing and even eating are just as natural. The music, on the other hand, is very limited with one track used for each scenario. This is not as big an issue with say, parties or the movies, but when you have the same background music looping for a long period of time in your bedroom, it can get extremely monotonous and downright annoying. Sound effects are not as bad, but there are some choices used that can be very grating such as the speaking voice used for speakers at reveals. It has a great visual appeal, but hopefully they will tune the audio some more in the future.\n\nSimilar to the Sims, you will be controlling the many everyday activities of your character as they play games for content, eat and sleep, shop for new computer parts, socialize at parties and take courses to improve their skills. Everything starts out rather slow as you strive to make a name for yourself, but as you gain more followers and better income, you can move into bigger apartments, romance friends, hire constituents and attend game shows. All of this builds up experience that in turn levels up your character with every odd level providing a task point. You can uses these points to unlock new game coverage methods (reviews, speed runs) or getting discounts on games. You can also work part time jobs and accept requests from people to help get more money. The only downside to all of this is how grindy it starts to feel and the possible boredom from it. There is a lot to keep track of in such short amount of time that things can get chaotic if not managed properly, but that is part of the fun as well.\n\nThe lifeline to your channel is with your computer and every component needs to be upgraded. The better your equipment, the more stats are placed into your video and the better the final product. When a video is recording, a small puzzle game starts that involves matching cards to their respective scenes in order to produce a better flowing video. The cards feel extremely random, which can be a problem when you are dealt three copyright infringements that will force you to pay a increasingly expensive fine. It would be nice if you could build decks with the cards instead or add a symbol to a scene with a copyright in it so you can avoid adding it into a video. Vlogs of your other Youtubers can also be made and uploaded, which has a similar issue.\n\nThis is an early access product, so that means there are indeed some issues that need to be nicked. Crashes (even with the new update) occur frequently and mostly at start-up. The game has a nasty habit of slowing down to a crawl when selecting games for reviews, accessing the computer to shop and when going to select something to eat. I had a few cases of the game just stopping all together during loading screens between parties and the movies. Text and update windows are also a gigantic annoyance with them popping up to cover selection options for current tasks and requiring to restart the whole task due to them not disappearing.\n\nThere are minor issues with items not being added to the collection, friends stuck on chat while you are shopping or editing a video (a useful bug), and collaborators not finishing products. One giant bug I noticed when I played through I for the second time was a issue where my character would not receive the option to progress in the story (no objectives being produced). I continued to play for about an hour before giving up, knowing in my first play through the option was provided on cue with completion of the prior objective.\n\nIt is great to see some different ideas being tossed around when the game market is so over saturated with first person shooters, survival sims and MOBAs. The daily grind of video making and maintaining friendships is quite a challenge when you have rent and other expenses to worry about. Problems are still very visible including the frequent crashes, slow downs and annoying text bugs. There is quite a bit to do with several other lifestyles planned for release, but at the moment I still cannot recommend this game. The really annoying issues just make this a poor purchase in its' current state, but I will be checking up on it to see if these problems manage to get ironed out.\n\nPros\n\n- Character models, environments are appealing\n- Challenging life management\n- Tutorial is rather helpful\n\n\nCons\n\n- Crashes, slowdowns and bugs!","May 20","false","8.4"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","10","21","3","0"

First of all, it's not worth its £10.99 price tag. If I chose a price, I'd say about £2. Secondly, it's just not a good game. It kind of went for "The Sims" style gameplay, with choosing a personality, and clicking somewhere to go there. But this kind of game is better without making friends, and that kind of stuff. It feels really cheap, as if they put no effort into it. Thirdly, I have a semi-good laptop that can run Skyrim and CS:GO at about 35 FPS. But Youtubers Life (emphasis on the lack of apostraphy) decides that 10 FPS is fine and playable, when really, it feels like someone with a terminal illness is describing how to get to Platform 9 and 3/4.

It really seems like the English version was just never run through QA?\nGame gets tedious at points, in ways that are not fun, because of the exact how with progression.\nSome things in the game are obviously possible but purposely witheld from the player without and obvious reason or goal, and then granted to the player once this invisible goal is reached. (Level caps at certain houses, your second computer, etc.)\nBecause the game is basically ENTIRELY a time-management game, the content feels unappetizing in places, such as trying to balance social life and professional life.\nSummary:\n\nThat last con is really the most difficult to deal with, because it makes all the other cons worse, but it also adds a level of realism because the pressure/difficulty of managing your life is something that challenges most people. The game is very charming, and especially in the early game is extremely fun for fans of simulation games or time-management games.\n\nBut this is not "YouTube Star Tycoon", this is "YouTube Star Diner Dash". If you go into this game expecting to be doing any non-time-management challenges, or strategy, or so on, you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nI think that the game is probably slightly overpriced, and this is why: I feel like a stripped down version with worse graphics on the phone would play JUST as well.\n\nBut there is quite a lot of attention to detail in this game, such as the "recording view" showing the ACTUAL scene you're filming in, including NPCs that might be behind you or with you.\n\nOverall, I'm quite conflicted. This is a good game, but I'm not certain that it's worth $15.\n\nThe fact that the game presents about SIX game modes, and only one is released right now in Early Access is somewhat concerning, because each of those other game modes should require quite a bit of unique content to them. But being that it's an Early Access game, I'd give this a recommendation.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential to it, and I think that it will be very fun to many people even as it is.","May 23","true","5.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattTheInsane/recommended/428690/","MattTheInsane","MattTheInsane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattTheInsane/","100 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDoes this game accuratlly depict youtubers? Not really. I cant say for myself but the hole premise of literally whoring out for money and views does feel abit crude, since not everyone does it as a job, and the fact that the story *pushes* you to get to be "the best" just doesnt feel very free and open to do as you please.\n\nWith that being said the game is very enjoyable and fun. It has cartoony characters which, in this situation of trying to be "the biggest and best youtuber" fits quite well. Its also just addictive to play if you like buisness tycoonesque games.\n\nSo why am I not recommending this game? As of now the game is littered with bugs, I dont mean small, once and awhile glitches, I mean full blown gamebreaking bugs. So far as of now Ive had my computer Blue Screen on me due to trying to study multiple times and my computer just went *blargh*. However, the more common bugs (atleast common with my games) is that often the game just blanks out. For instance, Ive had multiple recurring problems when it comes to training your collaborators and even working with them. What I often find is that during training the progress bar empties and the training excersise simply blanks, this causes the collaborator to be in an never-ending loop trying to complete training while the ball stays at 0%, rendering the collaborator useless.\n\nAnother problem comes simply in trying to interact with them, sometimes almost randomlly the game will simply show no dialogue options when you click on your collaborators. Usually when you click on them you can manage what they do such as releasing a video or training, firing and so on and so forth, this simply does not come up.\n\nFinally, again almost randomlly with collaborations, once a video is created it will either never continue to post production and thus my two youtubers are stuck playing games until the end of time. Simillarlly sometimes the video will get through post production, but will never start its processing and uploading phase.\n\nI should mention that these three problems I face can be fixed by simply exiting to main menu and reloading your save. The game autosaves very often, the only crux that makes the save and reload option futile is that everything currentlly being worked on gets scrapped, I cant tell you how infuritating it was seeing my perfect youtube video get trashed, having to reload the game, and in replacement making a piece of ♥♥♥♥ that isnt worth the bandwidth it costs to keep the internet going to upload it.\n\nFINAL NOTE: With this all being said the game *IS* good, but until all the bugs are fixxed I would be very astute in buying this game.\n\n","May 27","false","4.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","3","7","3","0"

It should be one hour after 6 sec and it would be a little bit better, it think it skips after every 4 secs.

Also there is a bug that happens in the collaborators, when they are studying a course the thing becomes blank and the name of what he is studying disappear, it happens when the collaborator is wanting to sleep and we have to talk or do whatsoever with him then he stops and go to it's house then comes back to complete the course, and also is very annoying that we have to see how became the video or the course to have the thing done, like: we have to see how the video became at him to he post it and the course the same to he win the stats, also the hours skip to fast! It should be one hour after 6 sec and it would be a little bit better, it think it skips after every 4 secs. It is not very good to buy it in the early access, just play who wanna give feedback or report bugs, but probably when the games get out of early access it will be the most AMAAAAAAZING game in steam.","May 28","false","26.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

This made sure I didn't lose 2 hours of progress.\n\nNegatives about the game:\n- No interaction with the viewer-base\n- Currently you are unable to leave the 3rd appartment\n- Whilst making a video you've got the option to choose content with a possible copyright infringement. These pop-up, and you sometimes have no way around them.\n- Content, I've played for about 5 hours and the game does not have more to offer in this version.\n- Most of the hardware is rated in tiers. When you have bought a 3rd tier item and you then buy a 2nd tier item. The 3rd tier item will disappear, the player is currently unable to rebuy the highest tier considering this one has already been bought.\n\n- There is no option for a 2nd workspace in an appartment where a 2nd workspace was supposed to be an option.\n- Computers break down very often.\n\nTL;DR for the devs\nMake the 2nd workspace work.\nReduce the amount of time between computer breakdowns.\nWhen we buy 3rd tier items, remove lower tier items from the store.\nAdd more content\n\nOverall I have to say that the game has a promising future with devs that seem to care about the game. I can't wait to see future patches of the game.","May 30","false","10.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

She is a huge fan of Youtube and aspires to one day be an established Youtuber herself.   In addition she is a big fan of The Sims and tycoon type simulators.  A win/win for her.\n\nShe played the game for a few hours and I could tell she was indeed in love with the game.  Usually when my daughter gets on the gaming PC it is to play GTA or Tomb Raider but I can already tell that she is going to pump dozens of hours into her new favorite game, Youtubers Life.\n\nLast night I watched her play for a while and got the hang of it and created another character for myself and I saw the appeal.  She got mad because I was hogging the game. ;)    All in all the game feels pretty polished for an Early Access game.  I didn't see any major flaws during my playtime, nor has my daughter mentioned any.\n\nWe both look forward to seeing the game progress.  Can't wait to see Achivements get into the game.   As for my daughter she already is starting to see that being a Youtuber may be a lot more work than she had any idea it would be.  It is funny to see this game be a life lesson for her in addition to being entertaining.","June 4","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I really did. It's like a mix of The Sims and Tube Tycoon. But after awhile, it just gets to the point where you're just doing the same thing over and over again. It's a fun game if you only want to play for a few hours, but getting to the point where you have the most subs on youtube will take too much of your time, and it's too repetitive. You make video after video, and if you're not at top health (slept already, ate food) then you won't be able to make a good video. There are some bugs, too. Sometimes your roommate comes in, says he will play on your computer, but you're making a video on it, so he leaves, but then he appeared in the chair as soon as the video uploaded. It's too buggy and there's not much to do in my opinion yet. Save your money. If you want a game like this that's worth your while, buy The Sims on a game keys site for cheaper.","May 30","false","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is pretty fun, but I thought the other reviews were very misleading. It isn't 10/10 yet, and there is just not enough content to play it for a week straight.\n\nThere are some noticeable problems right off the bat that will hopefully be fixed before it's fully released. My game froze several times when I tried to load into parties/conventions. This might be a personal problem, but the loading screens take FOREVER and the time skipping between voice bubbles (especially during those presentations) also takes forever. The voice packs are limited, leading to repetitive phrases when speaking to other characters, it is so annoying I turned the sound off all together. Clothes/hair is limited, I noticed more so for female characters which irked me as I wanted there to be more than two feminine shirts, not really that big of a deal just a picky personal preference. Also, (for now, I know there will be more later) the type of Youtuber "style" is limited to just the gaming category.\n\nIt is a fun and clever concept, but there are a few executional errors that I can't wait to see fixed so this game can reach full potential! :)","May 28","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Networking is a huge part of becoming successful on YouTube so I feel it needs to be more heavily forced onto you throughout.\n\n-Friends requirements to progress, similar to carrers in the sims.\n\n-Studying needs better rewards, again, something I skipped all the way to the top and never really gave it a second thought. Again this needs to be something that's forced to allow you to progress so you don't skip over it, but I'm not entirely sure what you gain from the courses as such, other than a few levels, which you get easily from making videos?\n\nAnyway great game so far overall and I look forward to the future to see what's in stock for us!","May 28","true","24.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Enough for this time 1 hour and I can say that I liked the game . The game has cons and perhaps I'll start with them :1)Graphics (-1 point); 2) the Translation (-1 point) . However at the moment the game more minuses has not found . Especially at the moment the game is in beta. Well , let's start with the pros: 1)a Mixture of Game Dev Tycoon and Sims(2 points) ; Optimization (1 point) ; 3) the Game is like and for male and for female sex (1 point) ; 4) A realistic (2 points). Especially the game suggest to fans of Game Dev Tycoon and Sims. Put the game a 7.7 out of 10 . If you like games like FPS or TPS shooters and the rest of the game is not for you , but I like many different genres.\n[РУССКИЙ]\nДостаточно хорошая игра . Наиграл на данное время 1 час и могу сказать что игра мне понравилась . У игры есть минусы и пожалуй начну с них :1)Графика (-1 балл); 2) Перевод (-1 балл) . Впрочем на данный момент игры минусов больше не нашел . Тем более на данный момент игра в бете. Что ж , начнем с плюсов: 1)Смесь Game Dev Tycoon и Sims(2 балла) ; Оптимизация (1 балл) ; 3) Игра как и для мужского пола так и для женского пола (1 балл) ; 4) Есть реалистичность (2 балла). Особенно игру советую любителям Game Dev Tycoon и Sims. Ставлю игре 7,7 из 10 . Если вам нравится игры типа FPS или TPS и остальные шутеры то игра не для вас , но а я люблю разные жанры.","May 19","true","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not sure if anyone else has, or if it's just one that's popped up for me, but if I have 3 games on my shelf, I no long am able to get new games, be they bought by myself or given to me by friends or fans. I get the alert saying they'll send the game, or that it'll arrive in X amount of hours, but it never does. I'm not sure if I messed up by leaving before it arrived or something, but it needs to be fixed, as it's kind of a game breaking thing. You can only go so far on 3 games.

But there is the kernel of something interesting here.\n\nAnyone familiar with Game Dev Tycoon is aware of this kind of game, but there's more control while also more randomized elements in the making of each product.  You have to produce videos with varying sorts of clips in them, such as an intro, a transition, a comment, and a close.  It isn't always the same.  You get new cards by ranking up.  Each time you are deal three cards and must use one to satisfy the need of the video at a particular time.  Sometimes you have perfect cards dealt to you to make a great video and other times you don't get more than one or two to align.\n\nI like this system because it makes it so there is some randomization to the success and failure while still leaving the ultimate quality up to the player.  In addition to this, there's a lot of Sims type stuff in the game and I think these are my least favorite parts of the game.\n\nOverall it's an interesting game that needs a lot of work but can be pretty good eventually.  I'd pick it up now if you like this style of game, like I do.","May 20","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Allot better for me than being an actual YouTuber though I have a few concerns and advice/ ideas\n\nThe game edges me to hire collaborators, move and buy expensive equipment.\nAt the moment I've just hit over $2k. I'd love to hire a collaborator if their salary wasn't so expensive. $700+ and $320 for rent? That's seriously gonna put me in financial trouble.\nI reccomend you make the salary much less expensive, or at least notify me when I've made at least $5k or more.\nI also want to note that whenever you make a vlog, the dialogue displays itself like I'm gaming.\nEx: "You just unlocked an achievement." Not at a movie theatre lol, so I'd change that.\n\nIdeas:\nSomewhere along the line you should add pets! Then there could be an option to vlog at home so you can show off your pets. Either a cat or dog lol. And you should get rid of the option to vlog at a movie theatre and replace it with parties or outdoor events.:)\n\nAnother idea is that you can be able discard any of the cards you don't wish to used, especially the copyright cards and cards that use up too many light bulbs. Since using up all the bulbs mean I can't do an outro, so it gets pretty annoying.","May 22","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game plays a lot like The Sims except with fewer needs. You create your character and choose their Youtuber career path, while most are under development right now you still get to play through one path. After the creation process you start the game by creating videos, working side jobs, eating sleeping, interacting with other people, going to events, and upgrading your room/wardrobe/equipment. While it is in the early development stage, I feel like the game has loads of potential if the developers maintain constant updates.","May 18","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But there is the kernel of something interesting here.\n\nAnyone familiar with Game Dev Tycoon is aware of this kind of game, but there's more control while also more randomized elements in the making of each product.  You have to produce videos with varying sorts of clips in them, such as an intro, a transition, a comment, and a close.  It isn't always the same.  You get new cards by ranking up.  Each time you are deal three cards and must use one to satisfy the need of the video at a particular time.  Sometimes you have perfect cards dealt to you to make a great video and other times you don't get more than one or two to align.\n\nI like this system because it makes it so there is some randomization to the success and failure while still leaving the ultimate quality up to the player.  In addition to this, there's a lot of Sims type stuff in the game and I think these are my least favorite parts of the game.\n\nOverall it's an interesting game that needs a lot of work but can be pretty good eventually.  I'd pick it up now if you like this style of game, like I do.","May 20","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Since it is an ealy access game i went in knowing it was going to have bugs but i was extremely suprised. The devs created a great game that simply anyone could find themselves spending countless hours enjoying the experiance. If you love sims, tycoon, and youtube, then this is perfect for you. So just in case your a little unsure if you want to buy this game here are some Pros and Cons.\n\nCons: This game is early access so gamebreaking glitches may occur, and sometimes dev's love to just abandon the game. Their is a glitch in which you will order new games or equipment but it just does not come in the mail. Now that for example will ruin the game if the Devs decide to abandon the game and forget about the customers. Besides that you have the normal frame rate drops and lag spikes etc, simply because it is in early access.\n\nPros: This game is fantastic. It's a simple tycoon with a great popular topic, Youtube. If you want to live out your Youtube fantisy this is perfect. If your a fan of tycoon this is perfect. If you like sims this is perfect. It has a nice little story to it too.\n\nSuggestions: I hope the devs make the world more interactive like sims. Right now all you have to worry about is food and sleep, it would be more fun if your character had other needs as well. I wish the other youtuber's in the game weren't random generated names but knockoffs of youtuber's in real life like FooDiePie, Darkiplier, MackHecticEye etc. I wish that there was more character custimization as well. Lastly i hope in the near future that if you become popular enough movie companies and TV companies would want you to star or guest star on their program. Lastly i want there to be a why you can "Hype" your videos up before you upload them, or for videos to go viral.\n\nConclusion: I say don't buy the game now until further updates, if the dev's continue to fix and patch the game up and create new content I don't see why people shouldn't buy this game. It is a great combination of game categories and its just overall fun to play 7/10 so far but if bugs get fixed 10/10","May 21","true","12.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think it's fun, great concept, and (if everything works correctly) the mechanics are fun.\n\nHowever, I think the idea that the game will be ready in 6 months is at best, optimistic, and at worst, straight up negligent. This game needs a lot of work if they are also intending to add additional content on top of what is already implemented. Clearer tutorials that don't actively bug gameplay, ways to open things that don't require insane repition, same for selling old games, easier navigation of the bigger homes, bug fixes out the wazoo, better explanations for EVERYTHING (what are you suppose to do at movies/presentations/parties? what do the networks actually want? what happens when I get low on money and can't do anything?), and on and on and on.\n\nDespite the previous paragraph, I actually would suggest playing this game. Perhaps not now, maybe a few motnhs down the line or when it's released, but it's a good game, at its core. However, the devs have a lot of work ahead of them.\n\nI'd rather they take the time needed and simply push out the Early Access time to a year.

I'm one of those "Youtuber" people who records and uploads (crappy) videos and TubeTycoon has made an appearance on my channel. I've recorded but never uploaded Game Dev and from the pictures this game looked fun. I immediately purchased it and began recording.. Oh, my.. Lord. As an Early Access Game I did not expect much, just a quick in and then I'm done..  I've since recorded three episodes back to back and made a different "Avatar" for my own personal playing.. 10 hours later, I finally went to bed.\n\nThough, there have been bugs like the events stop working and the computer's "hang" when you try to upgrade your second/third computer sometimes.. but those are fixed with a simple reboot. This game has so much potential, hopefully they continue with this momentum.\n\nI love how the game is structured, I have yet to actually test to see how long you can stay in a certain place, how ever, I stayed in the second "home" until I had about 900,000 subscribers. I feel like there needs to be a more rewarding system in place, as I had no idea I was right below 1,000,000. One good thing about this game, even though I have gotten so far in my second "Avatar", I'm still excited to get back into my other one and record more episodes. I'm playing these Avatar's so differently, which is shocking that you can...\n\nFor early gameplay, check it out.. Keep in mind and I didn't realize it until editing this video.. My editing style is apparently as ADD as I am.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ywi2ld_bU8o","May 25","true","14.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(if they did what sims do). i dunno, make it feel youre place in designing youre apartment than just geting everything set up for you.\n","May 25","true","11.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It took me just over 25 hours to get to end game and then you are left with not much left to do but make more money and slave away at making videos. If there was any criticism it would be that it needs alot more to keep the player intrested at the end as without the objectives it seems pointless to carry on. I think the game might have more hours to put in to it once more paths like cooking come in to the game but i think puzzles or challenges need to be implemented in later stages to give the game some more depth and to make it more of a game rather than a simulator. All this being said i have enjoyed the time iv put in to it, i only hope that it excells in making it a more rounded experience.","May 27","true","26.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I would also want to say that the people who made this game are great. They always listen to their fans or at least actual Youtubers who are playing this game to fix the game and make it better.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. When we are in the store, could you please make the time stop? It gets really annoying when I go shopping to get new games (if there are any) or just get food/ new equipment only to realize I've been shopping for a lot of hours in-game time. A lot of wasted time there. I would also say you should also do this for editing then I realized that it is actually realistic to make time keep going when we edit because it really does take a long time to edit.\n\n2. When playing games, the options where you get to choose action cards or whatever it's called is always high when we progress far into the game so we don't get to always finish the video. Even if I choose the lowest card everytime, even if it's not the right one, I never get to finish the video. Would you allow us to pick the cards we want to use every video? Or at least make it possible to actually give the video an ending.\n\n3. Allow us to skip tutorials.\n\nI would put new recommendations and mention glitches next time. These were the only things I could think of on the top of my head (I haven't played for 2 days because I've been busy).","May 26","true","40.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only downside at this point in time is that you're stuck with being a "gaming channel"  and the other options such as cooking or being lifestyle vlogger for example is not yet available.\n\nSo keep that in mind if you choose to purchase this game now, your stuck with only one option of what kind of channel you can run.\n\nBesides that the game is pretty fun if your into a casual management sim. I do think that the developers should consider maybe adding more types of youtube channel options down the road then the ones they will put in later. Maybe a skit-comedy channel as an option prehaps.\n\nI will say out of the Early Access games I've played this one from the start feels almost complete and has a lot of potential.\n\nStill go into this knowing that all the features are not there yet and you can only play as a gaming channel youtuber at the moment.","May 30","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I would also want to say that the people who made this game are great. They always listen to their fans or at least actual Youtubers who are playing this game to fix the game and make it better.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. When we are in the store, could you please make the time stop? It gets really annoying when I go shopping to get new games (if there are any) or just get food/ new equipment only to realize I've been shopping for a lot of hours in-game time. A lot of wasted time there. I would also say you should also do this for editing then I realized that it is actually realistic to make time keep going when we edit because it really does take a long time to edit.\n\n2. When playing games, the options where you get to choose action cards or whatever it's called is always high when we progress far into the game so we don't get to always finish the video. Even if I choose the lowest card everytime, even if it's not the right one, I never get to finish the video. Would you allow us to pick the cards we want to use every video? Or at least make it possible to actually give the video an ending.\n\n3. Allow us to skip tutorials.\n\nI would put new recommendations and mention glitches next time. These were the only things I could think of on the top of my head (I haven't played for 2 days because I've been busy).","May 26","true","40.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is pretty fun, but I thought the other reviews were very misleading. It isn't 10/10 yet, and there is just not enough content to play it for a week straight.\n\nThere are some noticeable problems right off the bat that will hopefully be fixed before it's fully released. My game froze several times when I tried to load into parties/conventions. This might be a personal problem, but the loading screens take FOREVER and the time skipping between voice bubbles (especially during those presentations) also takes forever. The voice packs are limited, leading to repetitive phrases when speaking to other characters, it is so annoying I turned the sound off all together. Clothes/hair is limited, I noticed more so for female characters which irked me as I wanted there to be more than two feminine shirts, not really that big of a deal just a picky personal preference. Also, (for now, I know there will be more later) the type of Youtuber "style" is limited to just the gaming category.\n\nIt is a fun and clever concept, but there are a few executional errors that I can't wait to see fixed so this game can reach full potential! :)","May 28","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Networking is a huge part of becoming successful on YouTube so I feel it needs to be more heavily forced onto you throughout.\n\n-Friends requirements to progress, similar to carrers in the sims.\n\n-Studying needs better rewards, again, something I skipped all the way to the top and never really gave it a second thought. Again this needs to be something that's forced to allow you to progress so you don't skip over it, but I'm not entirely sure what you gain from the courses as such, other than a few levels, which you get easily from making videos?\n\nAnyway great game so far overall and I look forward to the future to see what's in stock for us!","May 28","true","24.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Another thing is that you can click stuff faster than some of the tutorial thingies pop up so you finished the task already but can only get rid of the tutorial thing by leaving the game. In general the tutorial is really nerve wrecking i mean it explains stuff but requests you to do them instantly which can ruin other processes... - we are living in 2016 guys!\n\nBUT besides these obvious weaknesses it shows big potential to becoma a really neat game.\n","May 29","true","21.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Such a great game! Seriously looking forward to seeing where the development is headed; there is mega potential here! I got 2 characters to level 10 within about a day. It gets significantly harder to progress around level 10 from what I can tell so far. Super fun to try though!\n\nFavorite stuff: Selecting reaction cards while recording videos, applying/lining up effects while editing, seeing results and xp levels go up accordingly, studying courses (after moving out of Mom's house), temp jobs, getting paid to make videos for friends, watching all the comments and analytics, social media/upgraded cell phone, "pose for photo" outside movie/presentation hall, and the talent point system. Having to sleep, eat, study, work, etc... all that makes it feel as addicting as Sims and that's amazing! I love the general design and feel of the game too, it's just great!\n\nFeedback and details for things that (as of 6/1/2016 when writing this) need improvement: Vlogging; need the option to do it more often, and need recording cues that aren't gaming related. MOM; she scolded me constantly even though I studied a lot, and she glitched stuck in my room a couple of times - awkward. Friends; friendships are difficult to maintain, they always ask to Chat right after a video starts rendering/uploading and the pc isn't available, they want to interact too much! Social Interactions/Events; It would be fine for friends and people to want to get together more often, if the venues and activities functioned a bit better. I find it a bit tedious/slow to sit through presentations and movies or chat up a bunch of people at parties and events. Also, the special tasks to do for rewards, there isn't time to do it usually or you still have to pay for the reward which is honestly annoying.\n\nThat might look like a lot of need for improvement, but please be assured that Youtubers Life has quickly become my favorite game of 2016 and I wouldn't take the time to note/notice these things if I didn't truly sincerely care about this games development! I Love It So Much!!! :D\n\nThat's all my feedback so far!

Then it starts you in your room, this is actually a good setting since most YouTubers start with living with their parents. Then you make the videos and start to get subscribers and views for your channel. Then the game will start to have you move up in housing, so that way you don't have to study in the other houses. As progressing you will make more money than ever before.\n\nTHINGS TO WORK ON:\n\nHere is a few suggestions for the future to help improve in the future.\n1. Instead of only having a Sound menu when going into the menu screen, add more menus to the menu.\n2. I feel that you should keep videos up, so that they can still be viewed, rather than assume nobody wants to see them anymore.\n3. Have a total at the end of the month, subtract the money from how long you stayed in a place from the total, and the amount for an intern.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nOverall, I feel that this game has alot of potential to it, but there is a few things that can be worked on in order to make this a great game. 8/10","May 31","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It took me just over 25 hours to get to end game and then you are left with not much left to do but make more money and slave away at making videos. If there was any criticism it would be that it needs alot more to keep the player intrested at the end as without the objectives it seems pointless to carry on. I think the game might have more hours to put in to it once more paths like cooking come in to the game but i think puzzles or challenges need to be implemented in later stages to give the game some more depth and to make it more of a game rather than a simulator. All this being said i have enjoyed the time iv put in to it, i only hope that it excells in making it a more rounded experience.","May 27","true","26.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is one of the best and worst purchases of my life. I've wanted to be a Youtuber ever since I saw "SkyDoesMinecraft" when I was five years old. I just never had the guts to show my face or voice on the internet. So I bought this game thinking it would be like an actual Youtube career, but easier, becuase You gain hundreds of subs, no matter what you post. Also, at the moment, You are only able to do Gaming channels. I imagine, possibly, that you have to earn other types of channels later on in the game, or they aren't even added to the game yet, as it is Early Access. So I started my "Not-Real-Youtube" Career. You start in your mother's house. Not the basement, which I am sad about. You say, "hey, les make som vidja gaem vids." So you start with the only game on your shelf. You gradually gain money, study, do jobs to earn money, and decorate your room in this phase of the game. Pretty fun, right? This is everything I thought Youtube would be like ever since I was a kid. Eventually, one of your friends invites you to stay in a bigger apartment, which allows you to gain more levels, however, you need $160 on the spot and from there on, $80 dollars a month. I bought the upgrade, and as soon as you move in, you no longer have unlimited food, you can go in debt easily with the $80 a month, because as soon as you have atleast $160, the game prompts you into buying, and you can't really progress unless you buy the apartment. So, you unlock The Grocery Website, and The Clothing Website, which lets you buy food and clothes respectively. After this, the game shifts into MADNESS. You constantly have to buy new gaming platforms, even though nowadays, PC game dominates Youtube, buying games for those platforms, and managing your food. I was always trying to manage my channel, but I would run out of money from buying games, upgrading my PC to edit my videos, and keeping up with the $80 rent. I tried mainly focusing on my channel, because thats whats this game is about! I was always accepting offers to play games and upload them to my channel, because I was constantly out of money, also, once you move into your apartment, you can recieve offers for games, you don't have consoles for. So if you want the money that you need very much, you can't get it unless you earn about 200-375 dollars. So this is where my story kicks back in. I was invited to go to the movies with my friend, as you can go to parties and gaming cons, which I think is really cool, and I accepted, because I thought I had time to earn my rent, as it was the day before the end of the month. I went to the movies and tried to socialize with everyone, thinking my channel would grow from that when I got back to my room. I walk into the movie hall to watch the movie. GAME OVER. START OVER FROM THE BEGINNING OF YOUR APARTMENT! "Oh no! It seems you've missed rent twice. Screw you." Oh yeah, I missed rent once because of all the games I had, were outdated, so I wouldn't earn any money from them. Why does the game advance in Game Time instead of Real Time when at events. That is so stupid. I was furious. I have no words. Literally, I can't think of anything else to say about that. I'm writing this review 3 hours later, and I'm still ♥♥♥♥♥♥. WHY. Ok, enough about that, time for things this game needs to fix/add/remove. Add all types of channels from the start. Did NerdyNummies start out as a gaming channel? Probably, but I really don't care about that channel, so I'm going to assume she didn't. Add Flash Games! The first thing you see when you open your game, is a guy that looks pretty much like PewDiePie! One of his most popular game series is "Happy Wheels" and look where that got him! 20mil+ subs! When at events, make them run in real time. If it runs in real time at parties, why doesn't it run in real time in other events? Fix the computers in this game. Remember how I said I was constantly doing jobs instead of making videos? Well, I did that for about... 4 in-game days, didn't touch the PC once, because I was loaded with the only affordable food, Sandwiches. The PC broke! So that costed me $20 to repair. Money is crucial in this game. I understand thats what happens in real life. Youtubers need the money once they go independant, and if they fail, there's not much to climb back up on. However, that's no excuse to make this game about only making money. The Youtubers I see, are, most of the time, having fun with their friends when they make videos. This game, is being the Youtuber only doing it for money. Thats just not fun to me. Unless Online Multiplayer is added, where everyone has their individual lives, but everyone can interact with each other, I just don't see this game being that fun. This game is just MySims, but restricted to one room. In my opinion, that really is as boring and lonely as it can get. Also, I have to mention this, the games you buy in this game, have silly and goofy names, yet the merchanise you can buy on the in-game website for your room, is literally called "Mario Shelf" and I saw a Pikachu hat that looked exactly like the one I have so, I don't get why they tried to avoid copyright, but they put copyrighted material in the game.

I would focus a ton of work around the core of the game making sure its not breaking before you continue to add more stuff. the more you add while the current version is broken the harder it will be to fix later.\nthanks for making such a good early access game !","June 3","true","16.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can see how it could possibly become addicting but the days go by way too fast. After about two hours it got very drawn out and boring for me. I would recommend you give it a try if you're really into simulations and being the best youtuber. It feels like a sims game but just with different design styles. For the right person this would be an amazing game. I think it just needs to be fixed and more content needs to be added. But, all said I would give this a 6/10.

I'm pretty sure the majority of people who like this game are children fantasizing to become the next Pewdiepie or AVGN. What next, are we going to get a DeviantArt simulator, so we can milk off of the success of Leonardo Da Vinci or Edgar Allen Poe? SO original!\n\n- Bugs. Are. EVERYWHERE. Before I bought the game, I heard it crashed every time; when the game starts up, when you upload a video, when you save, when you LOAD. I've only played the game for what, 30 minutes?, and I've already experienced a plethera of graphical glitches, CTDs, etc.!\n\n- Speaking of saving, they can't even get autosaves right. Every time you load an autosave, the game would either crash or mess up the save and receive undesirable results. Even Sonic '06 knew how to autosave, and if any game can't get that right, you know you ♥♥♥♥ed it up.\n\n- Have I ever mentioned that this is literally a clone of My Sims? It's obvious!\n\n- The saddest thing is, I can't even refund it; because I bought the game with two other games in one transaction, and I don't want to refund the other games that I haven't even installed yet!\n\nPROS-----\n\n- The fact that I got this game for a discount.","May 22","false","0.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","6","14","3","0"

The game is totally worth trying, but perhaps later in the year when the devs have tended to more bugs and created a more stable game.\n\nPerformance is a concern right now but the devs seem active enough that I've convinced myself not to consider it a major negative *for now*. At the moment I've got a 980Ti that runs in the late 70s-celsius to keep this game at a stable 60FPS on 1440p. Happily delves into the early 80s and becomes rather loud at 4K. Basically this game currently consumes about the same horsepower as Witcher 3 with everything set to High.\n\nIf you enjoyed the atmosphere of The Sims Bustin' Out though, this is the game for you.","May 21","true","11.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It brings me back to my childhood, when I used to really enjoy playing tycoon games, even if I didn't really understand them. I see a lot of that in YouTubers Life, mixed with a dash of a casualized Sims game.\n\nYouTubers Life is a game where you play as an up-and-coming YouTuber as you try to become the next PewDiePie. Right now, only gaming channels are playable in the game, with options for several later. You start off small, making pennies on every video you release, but you grow rather rapidly. Living in your mom's house, you get free meals, all you have to do is go to school and pass monthly tests. It seems rather too willing to let you learn the ropes here, however, because it threw me into the second location rather early on.\n\nPart of the game features socialization with other YouTubers. You can chat with, befriend, or even date fictional YouTubers in order to grow your circle and possibly collab with them. I haven't explored this too far, but it seems a little...forced. It says at any time you can do the different events (i.e., a trip to the movies) but it doesn't tell you how.\n\nThe game seems to have a few localization issues. I believe the game was originally created in either Spanish or Portugese, and not all of the text has been converted over to English. Seeing as this is early access, and the fact that the few localization errors don't pose a big problem in gameplay (they just look out of place) it's something that I can live with.\n\nAnother problem is the crashes. It seems rather stable, but it can be prone to crashes, especially in the 'talent tree' where you spend talent points to upgrade your YouTuber. I hope they fix that soon.\n\nAll in all, YouTubers life has the potential to be something great. At the moment, its a game that I've lost a few hours in and will probably lose a few more. It seems to have roots in Game Dev Tycoon by Greenlight Games and, if so, it doesn't shame its inspirations.","May 19","true","10.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

There's still some problems but that's what you get from it just being released.\nIf it weren't for their good save system, I probably would have already rage-quitted due to crashing. This game is a mixture between game dev tycoon and the sims if you needed a point of reference.\n\nDespite these problems, this is has been a fantastic game so far and I can't wait till they come out with new genres. This game is only going to get better over time so get it while it's cheap. A new genre I hope that will be released for this game is a comedy type. Some youtubers haven't become popular from games, music, fashion, cooking, or even fitness(?). They've become popular just from being a hilarious individual, but I digress. If you're a fan of game dev tycoon, you're going to enjoy this game.\n\n","May 20","true","10.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's a game where you start as a succesful Youtuber, and explain how you got there. You start off as an aspiring youtuber, and slowly progress your way through levels, granting further ways to produce higher quality videos.\n\nThe idea of the game is interesting , and one you can easily spend time playing; however I felt after a couple of hours that the game play had become repetative and stale. I found myself repeating the same things every day: Sleep, eat and create a video. At the start of the game you do also have to juggle studying as well, though your mother never seems happy when you study.\n\nThe game does offer things to do outside of your room; however I found little use to these, other than meeting new people, and even that didn't seem to make much difference to my day to day life.\n\nIf you are a fan of other sims, where you slowly become a better gamer, games creator etc, then you will surely find this game fun. However I was personally hoping for a bit more.","May 21","true","1.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It is fun up until late game then the crashes start. The game only takes you about 8 hours to become number one with a spouse or atleast that is how long it took me. It feels like a fusion of sims and a tycoon game. My game only crashed about 3 times thought the time I played it. So that is not too bad for a early access game. Overall the game is quite fun and I hope to see more content put in it for the future. But the game as it is now is playable but lacks in some areas.  There are a lot of recurring events which kinda hurt the experience but still a fun game. If you like the sims or tycoon games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SymbioteGames/recommended/428690/","SymbioteGames","Symbiote","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SymbioteGames/","163 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nINTRODUCTION:\n\nYouTubers Life is an interesting game, in the sense that I've always wanted this kind of game to exist, but I never knew how someone was going to make it. YouTubers Life is a mix of similar games such as The Sims and many Tycoon-style games. You're given a character creator, you make your YouTuber, and you're set out to complete various actions and goals to build your channel, network, friendships, and more, while also taking care of your YouTuber's basic necessities (hunger, sleep, etc.) While this game is a lot of fun, quite addicting, and has a lot of -promise-, this game isn't perfect. Early Access is a tag slapped onto the front page of this game, and that makes us wonder, will the developer(s) run with our money or follow through with their promises? We can only hope it's the latter.\n\nPROS:\n- Despite being Early Access, YouTubers Life has more content than the current price tag. ($1 = 1 Hour of Gameplay)\n- Graphic style is silly, yet I believe that adds to the game's colorful personality.\n- Character customization is fairly good for being Early Access, in physical appearance and clothing options.\n- There are many things to collect in the game. House items, computer upgrades, personal clothing, and more.\n- Always saving (however, this could be a -con- as well.)\n- Tugs at your strings to think strategically, as producing and editing your video requires some patience and proper placement of cards, clips and effects for the best possible video.\n- Provides a good sense of character development. You'll begin in your mother's house, eventually move out into an apartment with a friend, and more. You will always be upgrading something in this game, from your computer to your personal life.\n- Good tutorial. If there's something new put into the game, you can guarantee the game is going to tell you all about it. You're often forced to go along with the tutorial as well. However, I found that I could get ahead of the tutorial sometimes and I'd get explanation about things I already knew.\n- Ripping off company, video game, and brand names was quite funny to me. You could argue that this doesn't push creativity, but I think it adds to the game's personality.\n\n\nCONS:\n- Music is severely lacking. As far as I could tell, only one single song repeatedly loops while you're at home. You're given a single song based off of your area. There needs to be more variety.\n- Sound effects could be improved on. The developer(s) have a good idea of what they're going for with voices, it's very -Sims- like, in the sense that there's a mix of words you can't understand while they speak. Voice actors and sounds could have a better overall quality.\n- There are some translation errors that still exist in the game, as well as grammar mistakes that make certain dialogue weird to read. I believe the developer(s) should hire a translator ASAP, this task shouldn't be very hard.\n- No option to "speed up" the gameplay for specific things. Features such as your character studying to learn certain skills, this takes a long time and it's quite boring to watch them stare at a book for so long. When waiting on a video, you could sleep or do something else. With studying? That isn't an option.\n- RNG cards can be fairly annoying while producing a video. Sometimes you're forced to use copyrighted material in a video, or you don't get a matching card, which ruins the production and can stab you in the back. I enjoy that there's a struggle, but sometimes it's too harsh.\n- There should be several saves that you can make, instead of being locked to a constant auto-saving feature. I've read that if you don't pay your rent, the game will end on you. I've never had this issue, but that just sounds terrible.\n- Receiving items you've purchased can be repetitive. Each individual item will appear in a box next to your door that you have to click on. Imagine waiting on each item if you buy many things at once. I'm not easily annoyed by this, but I can see how others would complain about it.\n- Repetition in dialogue, video game covers, YouTube video comments, everything. There needs to be a larger variety with everything to make the experience feel unique.\n- Channel subscribers, views and ratings seem a little unrealistic to me. I think that you should start off A LOT smaller after your first few videos. Success is not found that easily.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe YouTubers Life developer(s) seem to have recognized the popularity that has been brought to their game, and hopefully that is enough motivation for them to finish their game and listen to their community. In it's current state, if you enjoy this genre of game, I'd recommend buying it and supporting the developer(s) for creating what they have so far. I'd like to note that this game won't appeal to everyone, so I'd recommend doing your research beforehand. Also, the golden rule of $1 = 1 Hour of Entertainment looks like it'll be met, so I'm very happy about that.\n\nRATING:\n\nYouTubers Life receives a 9/10 for me, and I can see this game being a 10/10 for if the developer(s) follow through with their promises, finish the game, and add/fix the content that people are talking about.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- I've read about people crashing while playing this game, but I haven't once ever experienced that before.","May 30","true","7.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

(I've seen some actual youtubers play it worse :P)\nFor example, a youtuber couldn't go to the ingame convention, which I through smart play could attend and still have money left.\nAs I am typing this I still have 99 bucks in the green.\n\nSigning off,\n\nKaghy","June 5","true","9.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Obviously has some bugs ,but for 15$ it's worth every dollar. I saw some YouTube videos and it looked like a quick play, but I'm now getting obsessed with this game. As an early access game fixes are still needed but, it feels like more of beta game than other games on the market which are far early in development.

As far as game mechanics go there are obviously going to be bugs, but those will hopefully be fixed soon.  The customisability of the characters is quite good too, even with the limited amount we have right now, can't wait to get that pikachu hat when it comes out!  The concept of the game is straight forward, make vidoes, get subscribers and be the number one youtuber, but the game is so much more than that.  at the start you have to balance youtube work, school, sleeping, eating, and socializing.  As the game progresses you have other things you need to consider throughout the game and it's definitely harder than it seems.  As of now i would definitely recommend this game.  I'd give it a solid 8/10 right now, but if they keep coming with the updates like they have been, i could see this game being a hit.","May 22","true","27.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game is fun though while it wasn't finished. I know this is an early access game which is why im writting this so people who want to buy early access know wats in the game n dont feel a bit cheated after they finish the game quickly, but hopefully when the game is finished it will be amazing.\nThank you","May 30","true","6.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

But still addictive. Maybe wait till next updade before buying though.","May 29","true","12.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"
