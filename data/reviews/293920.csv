You have the option to choose random dice to add up to a number without going over OR Auto Job, which just gives you a random outcome. Honestly, you'll just want to pick Auto Job everytime as it'll give you more favorable results.\n\nSpeaking of! Of you do poor you get nothing, if you do average you get half and if you do Good you get the amount you are supposed to. Perfect I think nets you 1/3 more or something. Considering how bad the dice fail is, Average should net you the full amount with Poor netting you half as you'll be seeing POOR more often than not.\n\nSTATS! It seems stats go up randomly if you get Average-Perfect and even then it seems that the stat gains are random as well, I've gotten perfects and have had 0 stat gain.\n\nALSO BTW! You can have multiple events that steal your money, lower your health AND lower your stats. Stats you worked hard to raise through the crappy dice system or the meager wages you scraped up. So I'd often find myself taking 6 weeks or more just to recover from everything to Work/Train again.\n\nROMANCE! SO the romance is based on random chance. As other's have said, you'll randomly encounter your love and then have to pick the right choice to make the meter go up. Fail to do so and you didn't pick the right choice.. I hope you can get that character to show up again. So really you'll be switching off the boys and girls in the options to incrase your chance of an encounter, or at least eliminate choices you don't want to appear.\n\nIn the end, the game where everything is made up and points don't matter. No really the points just seem to be there to get you a second tier job and I don't think there is a third tier despite the graphics looking as if there are more tiers.\n\nComparing this to Princess Maker 2 and Prince Maker Braveness (MSN2), it fails to do stat sim and romance decently.\nUsing PM2 as an example, the marriage options were strewn throughout the game and the points were more or less used to get them. Want to marry the prince, talk to him every January and raise the Decorum, Social and such stats. Want to marry a dragon? Become a warrior and go on an adventure in the dragon ruins, thus all the combat stats go up. The prince is in the no time advancement Social menu, the dragon is on an adventure and there is yet even MORE people you can meet. There were things like talking to the character, going to town, talking to the palace people. Stuff that gave you a goal to focus on.\nSpirited Heart? There is no point to the stats. At least in Long Live the Queen the stats were useful to try and maybe stay alive (though that game has issues). You could try and focus on combat to war your way through the game or dancing and such to try and swocialite your way through the game. Magical Diary? Mandatory to get through the game (Even though a lot of spells were useless). The three character stats affected if you were going to romance anyone.\n\nThere seems to be a sequel in the make, hopefully it will be better than this and actually try and emulate the games it seeks to copy from. It just seems here the person didn't 'get' what was fun about those games and thought kludging stats + romances without meshign them with a story in some way was going to work.","November 4, 2014","false","1.5"," 143 of 160 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","143","160","3","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jessfest/recommended/293920/","jessfest","utopianmachine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jessfest/","792 products in account","Spirited Heart is a difficult game to recommend. Fans of dating and life management sims will no doubt be quickly immersed, but for everyone else, I doubt the game will maintain their interest.\n\nAlthough your character will always be female, you are allowed to choose three different races to choose from: human, elf, and demon. Each race has particular, inherent stats, and through the life choices you navigate, those stats are adjusted to create a custom character. I played through the game once with each race, and while I ended up with a demure elf and human, my demon was delightfully spunky. There is a full roster of individuals your character can date, including male and female options. The potential lovers are fantastically varied and interesting, but sometimes winning the affections of a particular person takes a little trial and error.\n\nYou start the game as a adult who has just moved into her first apartment, and the game will end when one of a variety of endings is reached. The experience will either end when you reach the age of 30, when you get married, or when you fulfill the goal set by the goddess of your race. At a certain point in your life, the goddess will appear with a specific job goal for you, and if you meet it before the age of 30, she will grant you a wish, and this will trigger the end of the game.\n\nMuch of the game comes down to spamming jobs. Jobs are completed by random dice rolls, and you must balance your character's work life with an appropriate amount of rest. Jobs earn you money which allow you to train skills, visit exotic locals which also increase skills, and pay taxes. The game indicates that if you have no money when it is time to pay taxes, you go to jail. Sometimes, random events such as bandit attacks will dramatically decrease your available currency, and at other times, you'll have the option to be charitable to a customer at a loss of money but with a reward of stat increases. While many of the stat increases feel arbitrary, they are actually beneficial -- depending on your career goal. If your career goal is outside of one of the stat categories, it is a good idea to ignore those options which pump unnessessary stats and focus on reaching your goal. If you are interested in a potential spouse centralized to one career path, then you will also be spamming that career to win their heart. Once your love interest confesses their attraction to you and you move in with them, you can navigate the game in such a way that you no longer have to visit that career option but still end up marrying them.\n\nAfter the first playthrough or two, you'll have the hang of the game. It is a delightful experience initially, but the fun wears down with necessary stat-pumping and job-spamming. I found myself clicking through all options as quickly as possible to get to the next random encounter, where I would hopefully progress the relationship I had been fostering. There's a lot of charm and terrific artwork to Spirited Heart, but the $20 price point feels unfair. This is a $5 experience and no more, so if you are interested in the romantic notions of a charming young girl, you will be well-advised to wait for a bundle or sale.","June 7, 2014","true","5.5"," 98 of 112 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","98","112","0","0"

Your relationship advances through a series of random events with the characters in question and you can go whole playthroughs without ever getting a random event with the lover you want to pursue. And then the romance system is basically bunk anyway. Your relationship is a gauge consisting of five hearts and the better your relationship the more hearts are filled... in theory. I had my romantic "interest" proposing to me at two hearts, and the only reason he was even my romantic interest is because he just happened to show up more often than the guy I actually wanted to pursue; and thus our relationship progressed farther... and I got sick of not getting any sort of events with the one I wanted.\n\nAs I said; the game really isn't all that fulfilling, it's systems are pretty pointless and the only reason to gain stats is to get a better job... and the only reason to get a better job is to make money, and the only reason to make money is because the king takes a percentage of it every three months... and if you can't pay his tax you lose the game...\n\nThe story does a poor job of driving along the stat grinding (which is fairly random whether your stats will even increase or not); and ultimately the game feels hollow and pointless.\n\nSadly; I cannot recommend this game.","June 30, 2014","false","2.6"," 75 of 87 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","75","87","0","3"

And what an awful world these Spirited Hearts inhabit!\n\nYou spend most of the time directing which job your Spirited Heart will take each week. Poor work performance means you won't get paid - and work performance is determined by randomly choosing dice. A perfect opportunity for skill-based minigames is squandered. Even adequate performance results in half pay! Furthermore, work makes the Hearts physically ill, so much so that they must take a week's vacation every three weeks. Want to save for a nice vacation? Don't bother. Every quarter of the year, the government takes about 40% of their *savings* not *income*, so there is no incentive to accumulate money. Want to buy some special, magical items for your Spirited Heart to make the work grind less tedious? There are no items to acquire.\n\nBut what about your race-specific special mission your goddess wants you to perform? Surely that must be amazing! Well, as a human wizard who had maxed out her magic skill, my goddess wanted to me to ... become a gardener. Let the adventure begin! Had I been given the option I would have selected "Laugh in her face and tell her to buzz off."\n\nPerhaps people who like this type of game will overlook its many, many flaws - everyone else should steer clear.

I loved the idea of choosing a character based on different stats and I have no problem with a stat raising VN. My issue with this game is the character interactions. One of the goals in this game is to find a potential romance. There are a lot of different characters to choose from, male and female, all of which have distinct personalties and spend their time in different areas. You raise your stats and interact with them to gain their affection, eventually leading to engagement and marriage. All of that sounds good, in theory, but the dialogue between the romancable characters is incredibly boring. A VN is just that, a novel. There should be a good amount of character building and interactions that make you feel something for the characters. There was none of that in this game. You barely speak to these characters, therefore making it nearly impossible to care about them at all. Once you're engaged, you speak to them even less (basically not at all). And, once you're married, the game ends. That's it.\n\nThis game is a pretty bad example of visual novels and I'd highly recommend not wasting your money on it. It's possibly worth it, if it were on sale, but it would have to be a really big sale. All in all, don't waste your money or time. There are a lot of better VN's you can play for that price or even cheaper.","June 25, 2015","false","2.6"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

It makes the $20-$16 price tag a lot more understandable. Though it's always buyer's choice if they want to accept the explanation.\n\nNot worth this much money, I'd agree with scarletemerald and say that $5 is a better price for this. So there have been a few issues with text overlapping, and I feel like a system of scheduling a week's worth of activities at a time may have made it flow a little better (such as, choose Sun. and Sat. to rest, and put different jobs in for Monday-Friday). One of the biggest things is that you apparently can not act like a decent person as a demon. There is no warning that you have to sit here and either yell at a girl for getting scared by a bee or criticize (which ends up being yelling) her for getting scared by a bee. I would have really liked at least a warning, you noted demons are usually discriminated against but an addition there that they are usually mean would have cleared it up.\n\nAdditionally the description for the work minigame was a bit confusing, the way it was written indicated that the totalled number was the number you were trying to match and did not mention the top number.\n\nAnd my last note, you've got token minority going on pretty hard here. It's great to see a game with straight and lesbian options but there's one nonwhite character out of 12. I don't expect a perfect split but it really would have given it a deeper level of diversity if there were maybe a few more.\n\nGotta say though the design for the demon girl is cute as hell.\n\nAddition: I just got the Ria, Thofte, and Janimee collectable card things and I have not met these characters.

Simply visiting that location and meeting them by chance will cause cheesy romantic music to start playing, give you two conversational choices to pick, likely improve your relationship score with them, and if you're lucky it might even increase a stat by a few points (of which you need a huge amount for it to even do anything).\n\nEvery few days you will tell your character to take time for herself, to restore her health and emotional state, so she can continue to work. The money from your work is then used to pay for your time off or lessons which may or may not increase your stats a little faster than working, any you don't spend is removed due to monthly taxes. You will continue to unavoidably be forced into romancing whichever NPC happens to be in the location you need for stat increases. Sometimes these romantic encounters are things such as saying hello to a stranger, or being yelled at by your boss. Yes, the stranger and the boss in these circumstances are the 'romances'.\n\nThe entire game is a grind like this, and if you wanted to pick a specific romantic partner, you better hope and pray that you knew what stats you had to train beforehand, otherwise you'll have extra hours of grinding just to start on their paths. While you can disable same-sex or opposite-sex romances to taste, this isn't an option given to you unless you go looking for it, and can be confusing when you find an abusive employer yelling at you to romantic music on your first few encounters.\n\nThis all might be forgiven if you're just thirsty for (presumably non-existent) trashy anime sex and got this game for a dollar, but currently this is selling for £15 at the time of this review. Even if there is a better game under the initial hours of grinding somewhere, that's still hours you're spending in utter boredom.\n\nThe only saving grace is the trading cards which you can use to regain some of your badly spent money.\nOnly reccommended if you like buyers remorse :P","April 20, 2015","false","3.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infinipede/recommended/293920/","infinipede","Carnelian Exile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infinipede/","37 products in account","tl;dr Underdeveloped characters, annoying lack of foresight with dialogue options, shallow gameplay when compared to other current and older life sims, Not worth $20 even for diehard fans of the genre.\n\nSpirited Heart is basically a Princess Maker type sim game with some benefits over the de-facto version (PM2), but those benefits don't make up for the things it's lacking.\n\nThere's a lot less variety, which is honestly sort of surprising considering the amount of jobs and the three species you can play as. Jobs seem to lead only into getting skill points used for the goddess quests or to meet and marry characters you're interested in. There are only a handful of random events I've seen playing through the game 3 times and most of them are negative, which isn't bad on its own, but seeing them repeat over and over is frustrating.\n\nThe romance aspect of the game was part of the appeal for me when I went to buy this, but, well, it's very shallow. A lot of lovers? Awesome. Same sex lovers, and just as many as the guys? Even better. Sadly, the characterization of the npcs you can pursue is... just not there. It's the equivalent of making a character out of cardboard, then taking the cardboard away so all there is is invisible tape. What I saw of the romance options strayed from the typical cliches, which was nice! But you just don't get to spend enough time with them to really get to know them beyond some superficial personality traits. The most connected I got to a character was the elf mage guy, and (spoilers i guess) he goes off and cheats on you in the epilogue. And, well, he was kind of a flirtatious guy, but that wasn't his entire personality and there was absolutely zero interactions with him with other characters that would have tipped me off. I felt like the game was somehow  punishing me for its lazy writing.\n\nSpeaking of that, some of the dialogue options do the opposite of what you think they'd do. i know this is par for the course with a lot of VN and sim games, just sayin', I never felt like making one totally not my fault at all ♥♥♥♥up in Katawa Shoujo or Hatoful Boyfriend or Magical Diary or anything screwed my chances at a character. I say something that seems like the better option, my character says something else on accident and I have the route locked off to me forever. Lovely. Thankfully I could save anytime, but this kind of one strike and you're out gameplay decisionmaking is ridiculous and has no reason to exist aside from, ahem, laziness.\n\nThe UI wasn't difficult to use most of the time, but it was unattractive, your mileage may vary.\n\nI'd say the best things about Spirited Heart would have to be the same-sex romance and amount of romanceable characters, and the character creation options, and sadly not much else. I had high hopes for this game, as I often hear Winter Wolves tossed around with names such as Hanako Games, Otome-X and sakevisual, whose work I've loved (and iirc Otome-X was part of WW for a while) I'm a life sim, nut, and the kind of person who spends an entire day on Long Live the Queen without realizing it, but sadly, me and Spirited Heart just weren't meant to be. A waste of $20, IMO.\n\nVerdict:\nI'd recommend even the most die-hard of stat raising sim and f/f romance fans stay away from this one unless it goes on sale. It's really not worth the money. I probably won't come back to it unless I'm really at a loss for stuff to play.\n\nHighest price I'd buy it for: $5.\n\nTry Instead:\nLong Live the Queen (The Dark Souls of life sims)\nPrincess Maker 2 (The game this is based on, you can get the DOS version online for free)\nRE:Alistair++ (Free stat raising dating sim with a female protag.

It's not worth playing even if you pick it up in a bundle like I did. It's definitely not worth the $20 price point. The randomness of the jobs system (roll some die and see how you did!) is frustrating not only because it's so random, but because if you do poorly at a job you don't get paid at all, and if you do an average job you only get half pay. In what universe do people get paid like this? This system would be OK if it was at least embedded in a complex, satisfying story, but none of the romance storylines is well-written or interesting, and the endings aren't particularly satisfying. You'll just be grinding away to get a particular ending, and then be disappointed when it comes.\n\nThis game is a waste of your time. If you're looking for a Princess Maker 2-style game, I'd suggest picking up Hanako's Cute Knight or Cute Knight Kingdoms.","February 14, 2015","false","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it has the common elements of random encounters as you go through your day, the skill building is heavily reliant on chance by having you pick dice at the end of each week (round) which determines exactly how well your week went.\n\nThere are basically two tier of jobs in this game, and the second tier requires a lot of grinding to unlock. This could result in monotonous gameplay, but the random dice roll and random encounters present in Spirited Heart really break this up. Unlike some other stat heavy games, like Long Live the Queen, it is also very clear in what is needed on any occasion so you never feel cheated when you "fail".\n\nThese gameplay elements aside, it is and remains a visual novel so if that's not your thing, Spirited Heart won't convince you to like the genre. But if you do like these kinds of games, it is definitely worth a try even if only to see a rather new take on the genre.","August 24, 2014","true","5.1"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised to find that, though not without several problems, it's not nearly that bad. While not the best raising sim I've ever played, it's certainly not the worst, and it even does some interesting things with the format. I'd say its biggest flaw is that it's very old, and thus, obviously the work of a young developer. It lacks polish, but it's got some heart.\n\nTHE GOOD\nI played through a few of the romance paths and for the most part they were really quite sweet, if a little rushed toward the end\nEach player character has her own personality that alters the available dialogue options and reactions of NPCs; the human is sort of the girl next door, the elf is kind and sensitive, the demoness is snarky and kind of mean. It's a pretty nifty feature, even if the characterizations aren't super original.\nIn a similar vein, you can select your character's background and shape her skills through a short set of questions (think like Fallout: New Vegas' ink blot tests and vigor tester.)\nYour character's goals are randomized every time you play, which means you get a new experience with every game.\nYou have the option to toggle love interests on or off by gender, so if you want to play your character as a particular sexual orientation, you can\nWith several marriage and career endings to attain, it's got quite a bit of replayability\nTHE MEDIOCRE\nThe art style is all over the place. Some of it is pretty good, some of it is...not, and the differences are quite jarring. An update to make things more consistent would be lovely.\nStats are raised using a mini-game that's basically Black Jack but with dice instead of cards, and a randomized goal number rather than 21. If you're good at balancing odds in your head, this isn't a problem; if you're not, it's going to get old fast. There's an exploit, though, that allows you to fix each poor result: scrolling back with your mouse wheel reverses time in-game, so if you're dedicated, you can get a perfect score each time.\nRandomized events that are unavoidable can sometimes occur, draining some of your hard earned stat points. Some have dialogue options that may allow for a good result, but many don't and this can be frustrating.\nThe writing isn't fantastic, but it's mostly pretty inoffensive and serves its purpose. The game would definitely benefit from a rewrite to make some of the dialogue feel more natural/less stilted.\nTHE BAD:\nA couple of the relationships available have unhealthy undertones that bother me a bit. Your character can get slapped around by one of the potential love interests when she's upset with you, and that...does not make me want to romance her, to be quite honest. Another love interest may sexually harass you, depending on your dialogue choices, and still another may threaten your life and hold you at knife point, which is also annoying.\nThere are two difficulty modes, normal and easy, but these labels are not accurate. Easy is fairly challenging, normal is extremely difficult.\nStat points that you earn through jobs or classes are determined randomly. You may get +3, +1, +5 or +0, depending on your luck. The same is true of your character's salary, though that depends on how your dice mini-game goes.\nThe price is too high. $19.99 for Spirited Heart, as-is, is far too steep. HOWEVER, if it got a rewrite and better art, I'd say that was fair.\nAll that said: I grabbed this game on sale for half price, and I don't regret that, though I can see why somebody else might feel differently. If you're unsure, there's a demo floating around, so give that a look before buying it. It's an okay game, with good bones, that just doesn't quite live up to its potential. I look forward to seeing how its sequel will improve on the less-than-stellar bits.\n\n7/10","June 26, 2015","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This not only helps you keep track of which ones you've done, but also encourages you to do them all. However, it only has achievements for the three goddess endings. This was a real let down, for me anyway.\n\nAnd because there are so few achievements, and a lot of it is kind of repetitive, I didn't really have any incentive to go back to it after that last goddess ending.\n\nThis game was a bit of a disappointment.
