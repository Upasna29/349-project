"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnmyster/recommended/207710/","johnmyster","johnmyster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnmyster/","277 products in account","None of the other reviews for this game seemed very descriptive so I have decided to review it. I'm not sure what I was expecting from this game, but I didn't get it. I completed all of the levels (except for the few bonus ones that I didn't unlock through normal gameplay) in an hour. Sadly, I was just glad that it was over. The graphics are great, but the gameplay is very simple. It plays extremely similar to many iPhone apps. There's some nicely created single-frame cutscenes at the beginning to warm the player up to the game's universe.\n\nYou progress through a series of levels, in three different worlds (with a fourth promised soon), and can get up to three honeycombs as a ranking -- this game's version of the three stars used in many similar games. You defend against enemy bugs using about five different spells, with each level allowing usually one or two specific spells. Spells are cast using a mouse movement, such as a downward stroke from the clouds for lightning or a rightward stroke from around your character for fire or ice. Some enemies explode, or release icicles, allowing for combos which are needed for high scores and to conserve your limited spell reserves.\n\nInitially, the enemies simply serve as target practice to launch your spells and get a feel for the game, but as you progress through the levels, they start moving towards your base in larger numbers. If one enemy gets past, or you run out of spells before all enemies are defeated, you lose. Most levels I was able to clear in one try, with a few taking multiple tries. If you wanted to shoot for perfect rankings, though, the game would be a challenge.\n\n...and that's about it. To me, this game was hardly worth my time playing, let alone shelling out $5 for. Fortunately, I believe I purchased the game on sale for something like $1.25 or $2.50. Bumbledore is not necessarily a bad game, and you might even enjoy the game for a short time, but I cannot personally recommend it for purchase or play.\n\nBest regards,\n\n- johnmyster","January 19, 2014","false","1.0"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","42","49","0","0"

The port is pretty bad, even if it's completely functional. The graphics are blurry, and the gameplay shallow, even for a tower defense title. I've seen tons of other games that do a better job, and are more enjoyable as well. This should've been named Bumblebore.\n\n[Rating: 61/100]","February 27, 2014","false","0.3"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","1"

The storyline is intense and it has a perfect balance of romance, action, and comedy! I'd give this game a 10/10 because of the great graphics and the one-of-a-kind characters! With our main hero bumbledore you can expect a great time. The way this game plays so smoothly can make a grown man cry. To conclude, I give bumbledore a 10/10 and I'd say that even though CoD took it's ideas it's still WAY better...","June 25, 2014","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on. Some chips seem to have minimal flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most. Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes. I wish that these chips had more than just a "hint" of lime.","January 20, 2014","true","5.7"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","0"

This is somewhat like that, but with spells and enemies. You have a certain number/type of spells each level, and you have to use these to defeat as many enemies at once as you can to rack up combos. If you're looking for a game that is particularly deep, long, or spits out easy Steam achievements, this isn't it. I'm already on the third and last set of levels, and I've put only 35 minutes into the game. However, it's an enjoyable enough experience that I'll go back and try to get a better ranking on the levels. Mowing through enemies in the most efficient way possible is pretty fun.\n\nOne thing that strikes me as a bit odd is that there are a lot more achievements in the game than there are on Steam. Steam only seems to have retained the hardest achievements. As I said, this is only an issue if you want to do some easy achievement hunting. In the end, this is a good, simple, and even unique experience. It is too short-lived to be worth even five dollars, unfortunately. Recommended with reservations.

Ah yes, Bumbledore. A fresh new spin on the classic tower defence games. If you've ever seen the movie "A Bug's Life", then you will be right at home with Bumbledore. There are Bugs and they are fighting! Wooooo! Who will win in the Kone Kingdom??? The forces of Bee, or Evil?? Anyways the game is pure, unadulterated bee ♥♥♥♥. Also you ever try honey? Good right? That's bee ♥♥♥♥. Think about that the next time you drink your tea! Some bee milked himself to make that! ♥♥♥♥in' gross! Anyways back to Bumbledore. It's a great action platformer with a lot to offer. Something tells me the company that made this brought their "A Game", and it really shows. I'm in suspense thinking about how they could possibly improve on this great formula. I think we can all agree that when Bumbledore 2 comes out, its shockwaves will be felt worlds over.","November 27, 2013","true","0.2"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

I have a son who i figured might possibly enjoy it due to the cartoony graphics and what SEEMED to be a Plants vs. Zombies style of gameplay. But i was wrong, It is nothing like plants vs. Zombies.\nThis game is basically an Angry Birds clone where instead of flinging yourself at your enemies, you have magical attacks. It's a pretty straightforward fame in that aspect. While i haven't spent enough time wiht the game to give it a full review and give my whole opinion on the game, I have spent enough time to give my first impressions of it, and that impression is that it is a great game. Not bad at all.\nIf i were to rate it from 1-10 right at this moment, i would definitely give it a 7.5-8. In th genre this game belongs to, Bumbledore is definitely a leader of the pack.","May 9, 2014","true","0.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
