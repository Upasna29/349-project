Played it for 45 minutes and didn't even achieve Day 1?  So kept playing, then it suddenly ended, with no clues as to what I did to end it.  It's all guesswork, and I must have guessed wrong...a lot.  It's super cheap, but that doesn't make it worth it.  Unless you're extremely intuitive, I suggest you pass on this one.","September 30, 2015","false","0.9"," 52 of 85 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","52","85","6","7"

(The end credits thank a team member for the English translation, refer to an email address that players can contact if they find any grammatical/spelling errors and then end with a "thanks for playing our game" message, which is all fine and dandy, except that "playing" is spelled as "plaing".\n\nThe "game" itself consists of a sort of weird Groundhog Day set-up where the main character lives through the same day over and over. I guess it's a sort of parabolic story about the monotony of working soul-crushing jobs and following your dreams, but it's done in such an awkward manner that it becomes mildly Kaufka-esque in the sense that you feel as though you're slowly experiencing life through the eyes of a sociopath/someone suffering from narcissistic personality disorder. He keeps viewing himself as this great person who's meant to "write a book", but is constantly held down by responsibility to his co-workers, his friends, boss, etc.\n\nSpoiler: When he can't get what he wants he moves on to the next thing and constantly complains about helping people.\n\nI can't recommend this in general, I'd like to offer it some complimentary commentary, and in some ways it's deserving of it. The art style, albeit incredibly strange and slightly awkward to look at/experience is pretty unique and I could see it being of use in a game that's meant to make the audience feel slightly uncomfortable (say a physcological thriller RPG or something.). The needs system works well, and is sufficient, but highly unneeded in a game this short.\n\nI feel like if the devs expanded on this concept and perhaps explored the narratives that are found in simillar games (Like Always Sometimes Monsters, To the Moon, Papers, Please) they might hit on something more tangible. I really felt like I could see their concept coming through the cracks of the game, which is promising. As an aspiring game developer myself, it sucks to have to have to write a negative review of a game that people worked hard on and was something they believed in. It's always discouraging to read negative reviews.\n\nAs it stands now, this game is a mess. I hope the devs can make something in the future that is more evocative of the ideas that they tried to manifest in this game.","January 9","false","0.3"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","1"

The graphics are strange, and the gameplay is repetitive and boring. Not even worth the $1.69 I paid for it.","October 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","13","27","2","1"
