It was extremely expensive to make at the time, and a lot of effort was made to make it as historically authentic and convincing as possible. They even found an old abandoned Orient Express stowed away for 50+ years on a rail yard somewhere in Athens giving them first hand sources to make the legendary train come to life.\n\nThe game itself in a nutshell is a murder mystery. You have received a telegram from your friend Tyler Whitney to meet him on the train to take a journey from Paris to Jerusalem, as he has found something that might interest him there. Unfortunately the protagonist misses the train thanks to unforeseen circumstances with the law, and the only thing Tyler is greeted with is patrolling police on the lookout. Still that doesn’t stop the protagonist from boarding the train thanks to a friend and her motorcycle. On board you are free to explore the train, but your first task is to reunite with your friend whom should be waiting in his compartment. As you open the door you are met his mutilated and clawed up body. Determined to find out what happened you hide his body, take his identity ready to seek out and find the killer of your friend.\n\nWhat makes this game so unique and not like anything you have ever previously played is how the whole game is played in real time. The clock is always ticking on the Orient Express and you have both passengers and crew going about their own things no matter if you’re there to catch them in the act or not. By making it this way you never feel like the game is tailor made for you. Just sitting in the smoking car eavesdropping as the passengers babble on might give you important information or clues to your case or impertinent discussions about anything 1914 related topics or just ordinary daily life stuff - which is still very interesting mind you thanks to some of the most realistic and deepest characters I’ve ever seen in a video game.  Never have I played a game with this level of historical authenticity, you are immediately immersed in this game and convinced that you are a passenger on the Orient Express on the eve of World War 1.\n\nBeing in real time you will obviously miss tons clues, discussions, dialogue and events the first times playing it. Every time I come back to this game I always find new and undiscovered information. You are of course still able to rewind or fast forward the game at your leisure if you feel like experimenting with different routes. The game features a bunch of endings and only the most determined will make it all the way to Constantinople and find out the truth about the fate of his friend.\n\nI highly recommend this game for any fans of point-and-click adventures who wants to try something different. It contains a compelling story, excellent characters and great voice acting who all speaks in their natural language; may it be Russian, English, German, Serbian, Arabian or French. The graphics are cartoony, but very stylish – I think it fits great for this game. All the characters are based off real actors who were mo-capped into the game so it still contains a very realistic look despite having cartoony colours.","June 25, 2014","true","4.7"," 105 of 111 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","105","111","0","1"

Not at all.\nThere is no option to turn off achievement or character bio/unlock popups, and they linger on-screen for up to 10 seconds.\n\nThe inclusion of (but to merit the ability to disable) tutorials is an insult to this game. Sorry you had to take the time to write them into the game, sadly they don't scream "GOLD EDITION" when the original title was a test of wits and observation skills, rather than telling you that the person you needed to talk to was currently having breakfast and you should annoy them.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this VERSION of The Last Express solely that there are better, unadulterated versions available from other distributors, and simply put the term GOLD EDITION only exists because of a unlockables screen, which ultimately ruins the experience.\n\nIf the above could be toggled on/off or even removed, or even a purist setting, which disables on-screen prompts and hints, I would instantly regard this as the best version of the game available.\n","July 17, 2014","false","5.1"," 102 of 117 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","102","117","0","3"

However, its extreme nonlinearity, the inclusion of violent scenes, and a sense of being what is in reality a completely timed game set it apart from standard pure adventure fare. Quite frankly, I haven't clenched my teeth this hard since 1994 when I was in labor with Mini Minnie! I also have not played one computer game for this many hours in a row in years. By the end of my train journey, poor Mini was penciling up signs for what she wanted and waving them beside my computer desk!\n\nWill the Orient Express make it to its final destination in Constantinople?

I got this thinking it would be the same and I was sorely mistaken.\n\nCompare starting a new game in this to starting a new game in the original. Within 10sec of you getting in control you'll see how horrible this version is. Just find and play the original. There are no improvements to be had here and this version is a dog's breakfast of Facebook generation pop-up trash. This is one of my favourite games of all time. The -original- is a masterpiece and I -would- recommend everyone play that instead of this weaksauce, tooltip-filled ambiance-murdering piece of garbage.\n\nThe original game had one of the simplest, most intuitive interfaces imaginable and it went hand it hand with a deeply immersive atmosphere and memorable story. How does the "Gold Edition" improve on this? Apparently by filling all four corners of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ screen with bs tooltips, unwanted hints, permanent options/toggle buttons etc etc to the point that they may as well throw an ad banner on there. Then there's the constant bloody pop-ups and the stupid chapter intros. They've completely ruined the game. If you've played the original, this version is not playable.\n\nAs far as the "improved visuals" go, there are none to be had. Seems they've just taken the original work and stretched it. Framerate is noticeably lower than the original during FMVs. They've cut out sections of the FMVs as well for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason whatsoever.\n\nJust please, for the love of god, don't financially support this sort of dumbed-down ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of gameplay.

This version is unfortunately broken.   Issues I've noticed in the first hour of playing are:  Missing sound effects and sounds that sound worse than the original somehow (open a window on a moving train and theres suddenly silence, all ambiet noise gone.  close the window and hear the train again) , Buggy cursor that wont change context (always stuck on left arrow or turn around for example), and also there are some strange resolution issues.\n\nNow even if all that were fixed I can't honestly say that the "improvements" add that much to the game.  It's pretty much the same game as before but with more (annoying) popups and hints.\n\nIf you're looking to revisit this game or just now discovering it, know that this version is a mess and that 2 years after its release it still has a seriously amatuerish and  hacked together feel.

You are Robert Cath, a doctor-turned fugitive about to meet his old friend Tyler Whitney onboard the Orient Express. Upon opening your shared compartment, however, you find your friend has been murdered in a rather bloody fashion. To continue on the story of the game would spoil its magic. The Last Express features intuitive gameplay that is composed of mostly walking around the train, piecing together the lives of the people living on it. Your choices heavily impact the game, which is something that many games even today lack. You meet a prince, a Russian revolutionary, a German who appears to know you, and more witty and well written characters.

It also has plenty of endings.\n\nThe only downside is that sometimes, you'll be running against two clocks, or not quite sure how do go about doing something.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/integraldude/recommended/252710/","integraldude","Integral dude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/integraldude/","171 products in account","Ah the last express! A masterpiece when it came out, hundred years ago... But it kind of still is a masterpiece, and now it looks like a real peace of antique art. It does have something great to offer though, if you can see past the technical aspects.\n\nYou are on the last voyage of the famous train the oriental express, just before the first world war breaks out. You arrive on the train just after the departure, finding out your friend has been murdered. Slowly you learn about the passengers and their complex stories and motivations, who all seem to intertwined. You really feel the tension of the situation and the looming war. It is a great murder mystery that you would snuggle up with in your sofa, but this time, you are really there, seeing and experience the train as the main hero.\n\nWell, sort of. Due to restrictions of computers back then, scenes are more like gifs with few colors. I think the whole game was filmed, and then more than half of the frames had to be taken out in order to run well and save space.\n\nBut the style, and especially the colors work in favor of the game. It reminds of how commercial posters were designed at the time. The characters and writing is well done. It is particularly refreshing that people speak their languages, instead of everything being in English. Your character knows a few languages, and in those cases, subtitles are provided.\n\nThis is one of those games that made me interested in gaming: a chance to participate in a movie, an event that you have dreamed to be a part of. The whole idea of not just watching a murder mystery happening on this beautiful train, but to actually be the hero was what really drew me in.\n\nWhat really makes this title even more special is that all passengers have a deeper story that happens with or without you. Instead of just running down a corridor, while a normal game would feed you events in specific order, in this game you can explore the train at your own leisure. You listen to people in order to understand their motivations and backgrounds. All the passengers have their own agenda and the game feels alive. Great AI considering when this game was developed (1997).  You have to behave, think and act like you were really on the train. You have to think: "What would they do now? Where are they now? How can I get to them?  What are the consequences?"  It is not about just finding objects and pulling levels. Also, you could argue there are multiple endings. In my mind there is only one good ending, but then you can end the game in other ways as well.\nThe game has a nice chapter system, and instead of saving, the story has "time". You can rewind the clock if you mess up.\n\nThe game is also not trying too hard to entertain you constantly with music and fantastic events. You are on a train, that behaves like a train. People behave like passengers from the time. But it is not boring at all, there is a real mystery going on of course. I for example love it how you can choose to interact with your romance interest. What would you do in real life?\n\nSo what is not so good about the game?\nWell, the game is a sort of a port, because the original would not work on today's PCs. It is quite buggy. It crashed a few times, and the language files don't work as I write this. No matter what you select in the menus, the game will set the language to whatever your OS language is. There is a hint system included, which is both good and bad. It is good because the game does not behave like a normal game, and there is no hand holding, which can be confusing. Some help might be welcome. It is bad because you can just look at all the hints and the game offers no challenge what so ever. I recommend you don't use the hints, and just rewind the time if you mess up, it makes you interact more with the game like you are there. There are some quick time events. Not too many thank God, but they are not forgiving and some of them you end up doing 20 times before you win.\nAnd, this title is not for everybody. This is a great old piece of art which really focuses on atmosphere, immersion and story. It is not a "gamey" game which feeds you constantly in fear of you being bored. You have to assume what to do yourself. It is more of an interactive story, and I think younger players are not going to dig it very much. It has nothing of what newer games provide (of course).\n\nI'm not pushing the "older games were better" cliché, because it isn't true. But I miss these kinds of elements this game offer  in newer games. I would love it if someone did a reboot on this one, with today's technology. Or if there were more games like this where you are in a specific situation with developed NPCs, where the game assume you are not a complete idiot.\n\nRecommended.","June 23, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I owned this game first on GOG and have beaten it already...OK read on!\nWhat a game....where to begin? In my opinion, this is one of the definitive classic point and click adventure titles. Put it above LucasArts (I love Monkey Island too), this game has it all. Mystery, danger, romance, and intrigue. Some may be put off by the screen resolution, but that just adds to the reality of the game. You are on a train, so don't expect to play this fullscreen or widescreen mode. It will feel like being on a train. The graphics are definitely dated, but they go with the style of the game. It adds to the charm. I don't want to spoil the plot but it is definitely a cross between Agatha Christie and Alfred Hitchcock. The characters are all memorable, and the voice acting is never cheesy. It may interest you to know that for a lot of the shots, the actually filmed live actors doing the movie scenes and then computerized them to add the reality of the characters...I thought that was neat at least. The music is also a big character, great soundtrack. The moments in which you have to fight can be a bit awkward but luckily if you mess up, you can start right before the confrontation.  The pacing may be slow for some,  but it only starts slow so it get more exciting and complicated as the game goes along. There are multiple ways to achieve goals (not common in point and click) and there are multiple endings. Also, there are 100 ways to die in the game. Have fun achievement seekers! Overall, a great classic game that you will not want to stop playing until you reach the end.

It was made in 1997, but as i was playing I found I didn't notice that fact as much as I thought I would. I think it's the combination of the unique art style and the solid voice acting that drew me into the story and distracted from any graphical shortcomings. The gameplay stands up on its own as well, and though the clicking system can be a bit clunky at times, overall it's a fine interface once you get used to it.\n\nAnother strong point of this game is the cast of characters. Over the course of the journey, you come to know each of your fellow travellers and have to piece together the mystery that, as you proceed, you realize everyone else has a hand in as well. Despite the fact that the characters all come from different backgrounds, for the most part the tired stereotypes are avoided inasmuch as they can be in this style of noir investigation. If the game doesn't create all new archetypes, then it fulfills the existing ones very well.\n\nOverall I'd say this is worth the asking price, as it will probably occupy a good 3-4 nights of gameplay for the casual gamer, all while offering a new perspective and a rather unique gameplay experience, the likes of which are rarely seen in titles today.","August 18, 2014","true","11.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

While it is an adventure in its own right, it combines genres such as murder mystery, suspense, romance and an Indiana Jones and Sherlock Holmes like adventure all together in one solid package.\n\nThe story starts off with Robert Cath, a young multilingual American doctor, getting a telegram from an old friend, Tyler Whitney, about a recent discovery he made while Cath was retreated in Paris after a firefight involving Irish nationalist and British policemen. The proposition is to meet on board of the Orient Express going to Jerusalem, but just when Cath manages to get on board illegally (since he was followed by policemen), he soon discovers his friend was murdered in his own comportment. From this point on, the game begins as a simple murder mystery case, but the plot thickens as the story progresses. With Tyler gone, Cath takes Tyler’s identity throughout the journey as means of disguising himself, making his task of finding the murderer a lot easier and safer without anyone else knowing he actually died. This is where the game shines because it always provides something fresh and keeps the player invested in the plot. There is always an unexpected twist just around the corner, and you will eventually discover that everyone on board is not who they seem to be at first glance; a solid inceptive to find out what is actually going on. In fact, almost all characters are related to the main plot to an extent, like a big masquerade. Ultimately, from start to finish, this is one heck of a journey. Something big and eloborate is behind the plot and Tyler's death is only the catalyst. A memorable adventure throughout the 10-hour plot, at a normal pace.\n\nWhat is unique about The Last Express is the real-time simulation mechanism. Nearly all the events happen in real-time, giving the player a certain amount of time to complete tasks non-linearly on board of the train. These can range from talking to characters, eavesdropping conversations (which can provide invaluable information on characters’ backstories) and searching compartments for clues. Time does indeed pass in the Orient Express, with every single clock tick. Moreover, all the NPCs are excellently programmed as well, since they go about their own things in real-time, so there is always the possibility of missing out on their acts in any playthrough.\n\nIt is correct to say that everything can be approached non-linearly within a time gap in the game. However, there is at least a certain point in the game which may require the player to do the specific tasks in an exact order since otherwise you end up to a dead-end due to a bug, I believe. In my case, avoiding any spoilers, I was supposed to put a certain briefcase (what is in the briefcase is for you to find out) which I retrieved in my own comportment but due to the chronological order I approached things, the briefcase would always disappear from my inventory when I was entering the comportment. Nonetheless, the simulation is nothing I have ever seen in an adventure game before and it is entirely functional and, yes, revolutionaly.\n\nAnd this leads to another interesting thing which is the number of possible “deaths” the game can offer. Since tasks are meant to be done in a certain time gap, failing to accomplish them can result in different outcomes ranging from simply being killed to getting arrested (in different circumstances). Most of these trigger when you are too late since time never stops. For instance, at the start of the game, you have to find Tyler before anyone else on the train, otherwise they will find the corpse and stop the train to check every passenger on board, ultimately discovering that you do not have a ticket, leading to your actual identity. Thus, in a way, it is rather interesting to see the different ways you can “die” and increases the tension without actually being a frustrating experience. There is almost never that feeling that you are running out of time, forcing you to rush. How come?\n\nWell, even if you die or made a mistake, The Last Express features a functional and unique Rewind button which always you to go back to whatever point in time you want. This way, you can approach things differently without getting the game-over screen. It works like a save file, albeit much more immersive. In reality, it works like in Prince of Persian (2003), but instead of seconds it can range from minutes to hours. And this is not a surprise since the same person who designed Prince of Persia also designed The Last Express, so the similarities can be spotted in this rewind feature.\n\nThe bottom line is that the player can take different paths in the game, leading to different final endings. Thus, chances are no two people will play the same game, increasing the replay value. For example, without any major spoilers again, there is a point in the game where you can either run away with the briefcase or hand it back.\n\nThe puzzles are definitely not hard to solve and the hint system in the Gold Edition is useful if the player ever gets stuck. In general, the puzzles are adequate but hardly a strong point of the game. Not because there are poorly implemented or illogical, but because they are less memorable. Actually, there are not that many puzzles in the game in the traditional sense of combining inventory items and placing them on things to see what happens. If applicable, the puzzles are mostly of “be there, at the right time” for the event to trigger.\n\nWhile The Last Express shines brightly as an adventure game with a great plot and believable characters, it is visually outdated by today’s standards and did not age well. While the character drawings are acceptable, it might put off a number of people used to more realistic 3D graphics by how pixelated they look. Since the game back then (in 1997) used up 3-CDs, it can be clearly noticed that the developers had to compromise in the animation department to save up space. For example, travelling in the game is more or less static, along with the cutscenes. But bearing in mind the circumstances, being a 17-old game at the time of writing this, I strongly believe it does not break the overall immersion and spark if you accept the fact that the game is old. In fact, it might have been a great looking game back in 1997 on the 640x480 resolution monitors given that the developers tried creating characters which look more human than some cartoony sprites like in other old P&C adventure games. I respect that. Also, there are some fighting scenes with required QTEs which can be frustrating at times though. Lastly, one last grip might be the advertised length of the game. On Steam, it says the plot lasts more than 20-hours, however myself and other people completed it around 10-hours. While it is still a relatively lengthy game, especially for when it was originally released, I personally felt a bit disappointed by that because I always had the impression that there would be more stories to tell by the time you arrive in Constantinople.\n\nConclusively, as an adventure game, despite being visually outdated due to its old technology, The Last Express is an amazing game and a true masterpiece. It has everything: a great branched plot with many twists, well-written and voiced cast of characters, realistic circumstances with a choice-and-consequence mentality, and most importantly a unique and revolutionary real-time simulation mechanism to advance the plot. Easily one of the best adventure games ever made. If only the visuals were to be remastered accordingly, I would easily see this game wiping the floor with most other similar games out there, new or old. And to hear that the game flopped commercially at launch, it breaks my heart!","September 9, 2014","true","8.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","4"

The setting is brilliantly detailed and Cath's misadventures are interesting enough to follow even if you (like me) won't care much for the erratic love story or will have troubles accepting a pretty absurd conclusion to the main murder mystery. Everything is more about that stunning atmosphere than an actual story. I'd like to specifically point out an amazing work with the voice acting, when despite a game's crazy language diversity, every actor is a native speaker. It adds a lot to the overall experience.\n\nWith the release of this "Gold Edition" and its hint system The Last Express can now actually be enjoyed even by those who are not prone to hours of aimless wondering. TLE is closer to the modern walk-and-talk approach and doesn't feature any obscure puzzles, but the problem is that an original game gave you little to no direction, betting almost everything on the timely and lucky eavesdropping. So you may just walk in circles for a while, not realising that you've missed a key event and need to rewind the time. Some may argue that it was a part of the special charm and added to the immersion, but it clearly averted quite a few less hardcore lurkers from the experience. Still while I wholly support the inclusion of the hint system itself, in the reality it has been added in a rather... ugly way, seriously damaging game's aesthetics. Sometimes it almost feels like you are playing some sketchy shareware hidden object game.\n\nThe Last Express deserves to be played even if only as an example of probably the most ambitious adventure game of the late 90-s. Especially since now it's a lot more accessible to the not so dedicated gamers. Just live through the tasteless design decisions that followed.\n\n3.5/5\n\nPS: I really wonder what would happen in the end if I didn't find that random beetle.

The game largely plays out in real time, and your character can't be everywhere at once. Luckily, you're given the ability to rewind time to try to explore other parts of the train during times where you were otherwise occupied.\n\nThe new features in the Gold edition are a welcome addition, though some veterans may take issue with the hints and more easily accessed inventory. Personally, I found the original game to be a bit too difficult to fully complete without a walkthrough at points (since it can largely be trial and error figuring out which events happen at what time).\n\nThe only thing I really take issue is the system requirements. The game was originally released in 1997 and required 66 MHz CPU, 8 MB RAM, and 35 MB of hard drive space. This release has seemingly insane requirements for such an old game, and I was disappointed to find I couldn't run it on my laptop (which sports only a 1.6 GHz CPU - low for 'gaming', but should be adequate to run a game from 1997!).","December 2, 2013","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In "The Last Express" you play a man who answers the call after recieving a telegram from a friend who is bound for Istanbul on the famed Orient Express train. That's as far as I'm going plotwise because it would be doing a disservice to future players because it's one of the best things about this game. It's like a historical spy adventure murder mystery with some romance thrown in. The story, voice acting and music are all top notch. The graphics are "rotoscoped" and are early examples of all that sensor wearing/green screen technology so common in movie making today and they work very well. Another thing of note is that the game runs (mostly) in real time. The passengers will go about their business so if you miss something, you'll really miss it. However you do get a lifeline with a "rewind time" mechanic which allows you to run back the clock. It's pretty helpful when you make a bad decision. Unfortunately you will do quite a bit of wandering waiting for the next action to occur and the train isn't terribly big but you will know the layout very well by the end.  Some of the QTEs are somewhat wonky but you get used to them fairly quickly.  If you're an ADD type player looking for quick satisfaction, then you may want to look elsewhere. But if you savor slow burn, plot driven games where you take your time then this is for you.  The story gets a 10/10 from me.

Yes. Yes, it absolutely did. Buy this game. NOW.\n\nWeirdly enough, I almost stopped playing this game after the initial five minutes. My one  caveat to anyone playing this game is to expect a very narrow game screen. After playing (and being spoiled by) modern games that fill up my entire computer screen, I was surprised and temporarily frustrated by narrow gaming window (can't remember the name for it, but basically black bars on either side of the screeen with the game "window" in the middle). While this screen does open up for cutscenes and certain areas, if you give the format a chance, you'll be used to it in no time. After about 15-20min, I got my bearings and roughly knew the layout of the train, as well as important functions like looking around.\n\nUnlike the vast majority of games out there, The Last Express is in real time, so conversations don't wait, people move around, and important events may unfold regardless of your presence, which often lead to a very abrupt end. Not to worry though; the game has a handy "Rewind" button which allows you to go back before your mistake, so the ends aren't that problematic and occasionaly are even funny. As such, you are immersed into a living, breathing world set just before World War I, where every moment contains actions and dialogue that can be caught or missed. If you turned left during one playthrough, turn right during the next, and so on; you never know what you will find or overhear! As far replay-value goes, The Last Express is a gem: the script for the game was apparently over 800 pages long.\n\nYou play fugitive Robert Cath who has managed to get on to the Orient Express at the behest of his friend Tyler Whitney. On board, you go find to find Whitney, and are quickly swept up into an engrossing tangle of murder, political intrigue, covert operations, and even a bit of romance. I'll be honest, I didn't expect to become so invested in the story, and there's no two ways about it, chances are you will (unneccesarily) rush through your first run because of the inital pressure of real time (turns out, you can actually do and explore a lot more than you think), but by the end, you will be right there with the characters as plots intertwine, secrets are revealed, and the world stands on the brink of World War I. By the time the credits roll, you'll want to start it all over again.\n\n","July 19, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is by far one of the best point and click games money can buy, despite the aged graphics and animations. If you are a lover of adventure games, this is a must own title from one of videogames legandary  creators.

The voice acting really does shine and has to be the best part about the game. It is as if you are watching a film sometimes and every now and the game just looks amazing for when it was made. The world around you functions without you having to set all the events into motion. The way things play out is very entertaining and you are rewarded for searching the entire train.\n\nThere are a few bugs here and there for windows that you might notice. These are not at all gamebreakers, just a bit annoying. Your character from time to time will get stuck in an action, for example you might move too many paces ahead of yourself and have to turn around. Also, the icons to move and interact with things get mixed up from time to time. These bugs can be fixed with a quick reload and don't happen often enough to destroy the fun.\n\nIf you are a lover of the classics and have some money to throw at this gem, then do just that. It won't let you down unless you allow the age of the animation and graphics bother you the entire time. Everything you need to get invested into a story is right here.

Part of the story is somewhat compelling, part of it scattered and too all over the place.  But even worse is the nature of the gameplay.  It's less a point-and-click and more in the vein of the old Dragon's Lair video games, which means you're walking around and clicking on things somewhat arbitrarily until you learn to perform actions in a certain order.  Often you're spending a lot of time waiting for time to move forward, unless you follow the in-game hint system to learn exactly what you need to do next, which isn't always intuitive.  On top of all that, the older graphics and navigational system are pretty clunky; if the game was rebuilt on a new engine, that problem could be solved, but there's probably not enough compelling gameplay to merit that kind of update. 5/10","June 1, 2015","false","10.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is supposed to be a point and click adventure game where you are tasked to solve a mystery, but what I found while playing it was that you wandered around trying to find things to click on while hoping that said things didn’t suddenly and inexplicably end the game for you. This happens a lot. “Oh, that’s the E-break to stop the train? Guess I should have left that alone, but it was so shiny and clickable!”\nThe animation style is unique and it might appeal to some people. It looks old-fashioned, and since the game is set on the Orient Express, that’s probably on purpose. The gameplay consists of wandering around the same five or six locations while trying to “catch” people in conversation to further the plot, or sometimes people simply show up and talk to you. Often times I felt like I performed an action and had no idea why until the game explained it to me. For example, very early on in the game you come across a dead body. You have no idea who it is but the only thing you seem to be able to do with it is throw it out the window. If you do nothing, the game ends on your failure to act so I threw the body out the window and wondered what the heck was going on. Later on, the game finally told me who that was and why I threw him.  I don’t feel like I’m actively solving a mystery when the game has to explain to me why and what I did after I already did it.\nAs I said, some people might enjoy this game. It’s a bit of a curiosity and it’s not a bad game per-say, but I could not enjoy it because I didn’t feel like I was solving a murder mystery (especially when I threw the body out the window).\n","August 16, 2014","false","2.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I've also been told of the time and effort went into the filming of the reference work for the art in the game, there's much to be said of the character's emotions and personality because of this. Lastly, I'd like to express my feelings for the burning turd productions which created the game. If Jordan Mechner receives even more royalty because of games like this, is it no different than the movie, television, fashion, and music creators who feed capitalism without obvious benefit to society? Is there any meaning to producing media for the contentment of people if there's still needs to be met on the lawns of the other side? Regardless, adventure allows many to divulge into greater aspects of life, teaching themselves to appreciate so much more by the end.

The plot is a mix between an Agatha Christie novel and a film-noir. You have a strange murder on a train, and a Matlese Falcon (that is neither Maltese nor a falcon).\nTwo things separate TLE from other games in the genre - first, its effort at achieving a level of non-linearity, and second, its intellectual and artistic pretensions. TLE fails on the first count - it's really a linear game at its core - but succeeds on the second. The passengers of the last express speak naturally and in their own tongues; have believable if somewhat stylized and exaggerated motivations, and have coherent and distinct personalities. They are both interesting and memorable.\nFrom a technical perspective, TLE has decent graphics that still hold up, and excellent sound complete with great dialogue and enjoyable music. Certainly it was a game ahead of its time.\n\nSummary:\n+ Unique\n+ Decent graphics and great sound\n+ Interesting characters and an absorbing plot\n+ Great tablet game, touch controls feel natural\n- The real-time gimmick masks heavy linearity; straightforward puzzles; feels like a (non-interactive) movie at times\n- Some nasty bugs that can force the player to replay segments of the game\n- The graphics feel rather dated on occasions\n- The fight scenes are more annoying than fun\n\nRecommended, 8/10 - genre classic.","January 16, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Created by Jordan Mechner, of Prince of Persia and Karateka fame, The Last Express is set in 1914, during the final journey of the cross-continental Orient Express. The player is Robert Cath, an American doctor and occultist, who hitches an incognito ride in the Express alongside his friend Tyler Whitney. However, when you find friend murdered, you impersonate him try to survive the journey while playing all ends towards the middle to solve the mystery.\n\nThe game is reminiscent in its mechanics to Myst, in the sense that the player moves around scene-by-scene, navigating via mouse-over arrows. However, one hallmark of the Last Express is that it  is  real-time. The time actually passes in the game whether you act or not. Therefore, if there's something you're suppose to do but don't, you'll see the consequences. This feature keeps the player constantly on her/his toes, prompting you to explore, eavesdrop, examine.\n\nGraphics consist of real-life photography, rotoscoped in the style of Art Nouveau. Aside from a few occasions of fluid action, the game plays at visible framerate. The surroundings are from an actual Orient Express train car as well, lending an air of authenticity.\n\nVoice-acting and music score is quite astounding. Having played the game when it was first lauched in 1997, I've noticed in a recent playthrough how much I could still remember from the dialogues after more than 15 years.\n\nThe plot of the game, in my opinion, still remains one of the best even when compared with the storytelling benchmark set by developers like Telltale. The year is 1914 and the entire Europe is an armed camp waiting for spark. The train is full of the European high society of the time, which were after all whom the Orient Express caters to. Russian aristocrats, French socialites, a German businessman, an Austrian artist, as well as Serbian soldiers present a microcosm of the European society across various nations and classes therein. The player should tread between all these potentially dangerous people to reach Constantinople as well as to uncover the murderer of his friend. Dialogues are well-written, plot is well-developed and well-acted. Despite the multitude of characters from many countries of the period, the game doesn't resort to clichés in their representation and portrays them in fleshed-out, developed fashion.\n\nThe game gives you copious amount spare time between mandatory actions (or evasions) so you may employ these moments to explore the train through subtle means of breaking and entering, which allows you to see the sheer amount of detail invested in even the peripheral characters. Each compartment is filled with items pertaining to its occupants' private and/or public life, whether love letters or indicators of their intents. Even a chance passing past a compartment may turn up a chit-chat amongst the passengers.\n\nThe Last Express, despite 18 years past its making, is still one of the best adventure games ever made, combining fantastic writing with staggeringly beautiful art direction and sound.\n","November 11, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Along your way you will uncover the mystery surrounding a mysterious telegram from an old friend in need of your help.\n\nGameplay of TLE resembles that of older graphical ZORK games in that you are almost entirely in a first person perspective as you move about the train and interact with its various people and compartments. An interesting point of note is that the entire game runs in real time, meaning that if you take too long exploring a certain segment or interacting with a particular person, you could miss an important event or possibly even die. Regarding that, there are A LOT of ways to “end” this game (die) depending on the choices you make as you go along. Thankfully the game also allows you to “rewind” to a previous scene or train stop so that you can make the necessary corrections in order to continue\n\nAs far as this “remake” of TLE goes, I feel like they could have expanded on the character animations a bit. A lot of the story scenes play out like old films with 3/4ths of the frames cut out, with exception to the action scenes where you have to click precisely during slightly smoother animation. The navigation shortcuts of double-clicking were entirely unnecessary and only added the timing-related headaches in the game. I also felt a bit claustrophobic in certain parts of the train as the navigation is not very clear and objects that you think you would be able to look at, or get closer to, cannot always be reached.\n\nOne thing I really liked about The Last express was all the little historical details sprinkled about in newspaper articles and conversations. The voice acting was also very good and hearing people conversing in various languages added a nice bit of realism (as opposed to just giving everyone goofy accents in English).

But if you miss anything or do something in the wrong order, it's hard to catch up and/or progress effectively through the story.\nGood for people with a high attention to detail and who can figure out what path to take in a short period of time, just not for me personally.\nIf I hear the conductor tell me I'm at the wrong room again I might cry.\n","June 1, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/252710/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","The Last Express is an adventurous take on the adventure game genre that stars an American doctor caught in a web of intrigue woven by the passengers on a train from Paris to Constantinople (Istanbul). Along your way you will uncover the mystery surrounding a mysterious telegram from an old friend in need of your help.\n\nGameplay of TLE resembles that of older graphical ZORK games in that you are almost entirely in a first person perspective as you move about the train and interact with its various people and compartments. An interesting point of note is that the entire game runs in real time, meaning that if you take too long exploring a certain segment or interacting with a particular person, you could miss an important event or possibly even die. Regarding that, there are A LOT of ways to “end” this game (die) depending on the choices you make as you go along. Thankfully the game also allows you to “rewind” to a previous scene or train stop so that you can make the necessary corrections in order to continue\n\nAs far as this “remake” of TLE goes, I feel like they could have expanded on the character animations a bit. A lot of the story scenes play out like old films with 3/4ths of the frames cut out, with exception to the action scenes where you have to click precisely during slightly smoother animation. The navigation shortcuts of double-clicking were entirely unnecessary and only added the timing-related headaches in the game. I also felt a bit claustrophobic in certain parts of the train as the navigation is not very clear and objects that you think you would be able to look at, or get closer to, cannot always be reached.\n\nOne thing I really liked about The Last express was all the little historical details sprinkled about in newspaper articles and conversations. The voice acting was also very good and hearing people conversing in various languages added a nice bit of realism (as opposed to just giving everyone goofy accents in English). Although the playtime is not particularly long (I spent about 8 hours) this game typically goes on sale for around $3 making it a great addition to any adventure gamer’s library.\n","November 21, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have always enjoyed playing detctive/mystery games and this is the perfect example of that. Also because the people are actually real and are just edited/drawn to be more 'game like' if that makes sense at all; it makes them come to life in a way that is quite intriguing, their facial expressions and especially when they are walking down a corridor are when you can see this most.\n\nI would recommend this game to anybody who loves this genre or who is wanting to try it out it's amazing; and I promise you, you will get quite emersed in this game sometimes beyond what you ever thought possible.\n\nHappy playing! :)","May 25","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
