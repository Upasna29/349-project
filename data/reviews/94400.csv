It gives you this giddy feeling, those 5 seconds of a showdown, staring down your opponent, waiting to see who's going to make the first move. The adrenaline starts pumping after you charge in for the first swing and your opponent counters and knocks your sword out of your hand. You're swordless. You close your eyes and take a deep breath as your opponent charges at you with his sword. Seconds before impact you leap and flip over his head, grab your sword, turn around and throw it right through his head. As he falls to the ground you spit on his body and sprint through the gate to the cheering of thousands of spectators.\n\nThen a giant worm eats you. Victory.\n\nThis game rocks. I'll start off with that. You got these tiny little guys with swords fencing for their lives back and forth as the bodies pile up. This is the kind of game that you can actually be skillful at, by watching the o0ther person's sword you can try to figure out how to counter what he's doing.\n\nIt has a mortal combat type ladder single player where you play through a bunch of levels against harder and harder characters and I've managed to get about halway up. Not sure if there are lives but if you lose you continue from the same character you don't have to start over.\n\nI'm most excited for the multiplayer though, I can't wait to invite some friends over to play this because this is one of those games which will cause a lot of screaming and yelling. I just played a random person through the matchmaking a bunch of times and it worked flawlessly, I'm excited to play more.\n\nAlso in the multiplayer section where there's offline and other options for multiplayer there are a whole sleuth of "variants": Slow mo, Fast mo, boomerang swords, divekicks, throwing and other stuff.\n\nReally not a bad learning curve. Yeah, the first couple of rounds you can't figure out what the hell is going on, but after 15 minutes of trial and error I was leaping, stabbing, and doing a lot of other weird ♥♥♥♥.\n\nMusic's not shabby, you got the shwing shwing of the swords in there so I'm happy.\n\nThe game makes you feel like that guy from Princess Bride with those wiggly swords.\n\nThe bad: No windowed mode, and the how to play menu is broken to all hell. Just check the controls and go with it.\n\n\nIt's just a fun game, it's got a lot of replay value and it would always be cool to see more levels or maybe... hats?","January 13, 2014","true","9.2"," 878 of 1,107 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","878","1","0","10"

At first glance it's a simple 2D fighting with 8-bit graphics. But is it really?\n\nI CHALLENGE YOU TO A PIXEL DUEL\n\nThere is no plot in Nidhogg. Instead, only fights with a computer opponent or with other people in online. The meaning of each battle is not killing the enemy, but in achieving the opposite end of the map. Four keys for movement, one key for punch and one key for jump. Sounds easier than it actually is. In fact, fightings are very funny and full of madness, but not without subtleties of the combat system. I advise you to play only in the company of friends. Singleplayer and online battles with strangers doesn't bring much fun.\n\nNOT ENOUGH PIXELS\n\nNidhogg has enough of advantages to buy it. But there are some unpleasant drawbacks. Too few maps, quickly bored gameplay, inconvenient system for playing online with friends (A friend is not always able to connect to your game). These shortcomings, in fact, are not much spoiling the gaming experience. If it were not for one thing. Too high price. Seriously. It should cost twice less, judging on how many content in it.\n\nMultiplayer:\nOnline: ☺☺☺☺☺OOOOO\nCo-op: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ\nStoryline: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ\nGraphics: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OOO\nGameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OO\n\nComplexity of the achievements: Some achievements will make you play this game for a long time.

Otherwise, you probably shouldn't get it.\n\nThe game plays like an elaborate dance; two players fighting for the honour of being consumed by the titular serpent- the Nidhogg. The controls are simple: one button jabs your sword, one button makes you jump. The real beauty is how the mechanics blend together. Swords can be moved up and down to reach a jumping or ducking enemy. Swords at the same height will clash, and can block the opposing player's attacks. Swords can also be knocked out of a players hand by some particularly crafty swordplay. Jousting with your sword fully raised throws your sword through the air, which is hard to dodge, but leaves you without your best weapon. Thrusting in midair results in a divekick, a techniquie used to relieve the enemy of their weapon (that is, if you don't impale yourself on their weapon first).\nThe result is an EXTREMELY intense sword battle. Matches can last for seconds, others can last for half of an hour or more. The ducking and dodging and jumping and running blends brilliantly with the game's glitch-art style and kickass music. You can play this before the start of a lecture. You can play this at a party, with a tournament of eight players. You can use it as a substitute for rock-paper-scissors in decision-making situations. It's become one of my go-to games when friends are over (see also: touhou 9).\n\nHowever, this only applies if you have real-life friends. Sure, the game has online play, but it's horribly laggy and bugged, with no sign of a fix. The lag ruins the crucial fast-paced action of the game and usually results in the host player winning. Because of this, you'll be very lucky to actually find anyone through the matchmaking service. The single-player mode is basically multiplayer but against a series of bots, which each have distinct playstyles and weaknesses. It's very much like playing against real players, but nowhere near as fun as having friends to play with in the same room. Additionally, the price is VERY steep for what the contents of the game are: only four (admittedly BEAUTIFUL) levels.\n\nOverall: One of the best local multiplayer games that exist. If you have real friends that can come over and play: get this game ...but get it during a sale. If you have no friends: sorry, this game isn't for you. Go out and make some friends instead!","October 15, 2014","true","21.8"," 86 of 100 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","86","100","9","1"

The biggest problem with this is the multiplayer system only works when it wants to so you can't even play online with your buddies unless the "Server" is feeling okay. When the server is working which is probably isn't right now, you are unable to customize the online multiplayer match which is a huge part of the multiplayer experience in nidhogg.\n\nIn conclusion this is not a $15 game. I am glad I bought it for $3 and it is worth that when it is working. Offline mode locally I am sure is the only use for this game.

Playing with a friend could grant you countless hours of fun. The graphics are beautiful. If this was a freeware game it would be great, if it was $2 it would be great, however it is priced at 15$ which is too much to pay for the amount of content (which is 4 arenas and a tacked on single player mode)\n\nNow the bad things are, as some people have mentioned; The ONLINE multilayer is currently  unplayable, a big bummer for me. Another really big bummer is that in fact, it does NOT have "full" controller support; It does support fancy Xbox controllers, but it would not recognize my lovely SNES style USB controllers which other games recognize just fine. So ya, this coupled with a 15$ price tag and lack of content leads me to a thumb down :( sorry.\n\nOnce again it IS a great 2 player offline game, and I will be playing it a lot when I have friends over, but its not worth 15$. Wait till this game is cheaper and patched for proper controller support and online play, then it will be worth it.\n\nEDIT: GOOD: I have had a few good online games with minimal lag, but it is rare with random matches.

If you engage in this frequently, get it. I only have occasional local multiplayer games and this is why it was a bad purchase for me and might be for you.\n\nThere hasn't been one update since this game's release. The guy ignored EVERY support request and then had the cheek to release it on the PS4. Why is this a problem? The netcode is HORRIBLE, and latency is the most important factor with a game where reaction time can be very important. If you play online and enjoy it consistently, get back to me, because that would be the first I've heard about it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/travistyoj/recommended/94400/","travistyoj","TravistyOJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/travistyoj/","337 products in account","Nidhogg provides some of the fastest and most enjoyable monochromatic bloodletting one could hope to experience.   The premise is simple.  You are a pixelated swordsman in a territorial conflict with your opponent, most often your best friend sitting right beside you.  Each standoff is lightning fast, and invariably ends in a gratuitous splattering of blood.   Kill your opponent with a well-timed and well-placed lunge, hurl your épée at his head, or just knock him down and rip his heart out.  Savagery is encouraged, and provides a hilarious counterpoint to the civilized image of fencing.  Once you have managed to kill your opponent, you can progress to your goal until just seconds later, he respawns and you must again defeat him to progress. Lose, and he gains ground on you. This ebb and flow continues until one of you reaches the final screen where the winner is given a true hero’s sendup: He is eaten by a flying worm.\n\nNidhogg is not just a circus of inanity and violence, but is some of the best fun you can have with your friends.  Controls are responsive, animations are fast and smooth, and landing consecutive killing blows provides a jolt of dopamine that keeps you coming back for more.  There are multiple arenas to choose from, each one visually unique and designed to make you rethink your strategy.  Some corridors are too tight for jumping or sword throwing, so both your opponent and the landscape will make you think on your toes.\n\nVisually, Nidhogg exhibits a unique combination of minimalism through pixilation and solid colors.  It highlights the expression of characters through animation rather than textures.  It is aesthetically arresting and securely has its own style.  These visuals are elevated even further when coupled with an exceptional soundtrack by Daedelus.\n\nNidhogg could have provided only the core one-on-one experience, but if you look deeper there are a lot of extras.  There is a tournament mode supporting up to 8 players. There is a multitude of variants in gameplay to explore. There is a single player experience pitting you against an increasingly difficult array of AI personalities.  Additionally, there is an online multiplayer component, but at the time of this review, I experienced some unfortunate glitches.  In several matches I experienced moments where I killed my opponent, but immediately the game changed states, and my character unexplainably died.  It wasn’t often, but it was often enough to sour the experience.  I’m told that the online component is still a work in progress, so if you don’t have a friend handy to play local multiplayer check the forums for progress.\n\nNidhogg was first shown in 2010, and since then Messhoff, comprised of Mark Essen and Kristy Norindr, have worked to shine the core game into a full-fledged release.  Nidhogg is available today on Steam for $11.99, and if you have friends, it is well worth your dollars.","January 13, 2014","true","14.0"," 226 of 335 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","226","335","0","0"

I won’t go into much detail because the trailers and such pretty much show what it's about, but its damn fun to play. The combat has a lot of options and things going for it and nicely juggles both complexity and ease of learning. The music and visuals match and mesh with the feel of the combat excellently. I can easily see how co-op can be a blast with friends, or the tourney potential.\n\nSo why is this not recommended? Because the devs cared more about the game’s style, raw gameplay, and media hype then its long-term substance or support. You’re playing this game and having a lot of fun, and then before you even hit the one hour mark you find yourself thinking “that’s it?” and then it’s all downhill from there. Singleplayer consists of you fighting a dozen or two progressively harder AI opponents, however the stages start looping after opponent four. Yep, only four stages. There’s no story to speak of or even an attempt at one, and once you’re done with it you’re left with nearly nothing else to do with the game. Multiplayer is dead, D-E-A-D. Its features are minimal and in terms of functionality the MP barely worked when the game came out, and then because they never fixed it people gave up on it entirely so there’s no one playing.\n\nThis game deserved more support and more features and updates from a solid company. But because it didn’t get that and most likely won’t ever, I am sorry to say that charging $15 for this is broad daylight robbery and I cannot recommend it. Only buy this if it’s on sale, and with the understanding that outside of being a weekend distraction or occasional hour of fun with a friend this game has no value.","January 25, 2015","false","2.1"," 114 of 164 people (70%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","70","114","164","10","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/94400/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Nidhogg embodies the aggressive, intoxicating thrill of competition. Through hazily defined personas and their ethereal exacting movements, a simple duel is transformed into a bustling frenzy of close saves, impossible luck, and overlapping cries of victory and defeat. It only took one match for me to fall in love with Nidhogg – to be hooked by the overwhelming energy that erupts both inside and outside the game – and hours later each round continues to bring with it that same feeling that I’m discovering something incredible for the first time and desperately need someone to share it with.\n\nIn the most concise and direct of terms, Nidhogg is a two-player fencing game which calls back to the simpler times of 80’s arcade classics like Joust and Pong, but bridges the generational gap with a precision and adrenaline that would have melted the insides of the quarter devouring machines which have grown extinct over the last 30 years. Nidhogg’s indirect heritage doesn’t define it so much as provides a sense of place for Nidhogg where so many other games are quickly lost and forgotten. Already it feels like a classic I’ve loved for years and a staple game that is kept installed eternally as part of an evergreen collection of multiplayer games.\n\nNidhogg works so immensely well because it’s the sort of game you stop thinking about almost immediately. Controlling your swordsman in Nidhogg is impeccably intuitive as they move and react contextually and clearly, causing you to forget about how your controlling them as you focus all your attention on what you’re actually doing. Nidhogg feels much like a spontaneous dance between two people attempting to kill each other. It’s not about executing a particular move or performing a perfect counter block, but allowing yourself to be taken by the moment as you and your opponent flow together in a blur of kicks and stabs as you fight against each other in a deadly tug of war.\n\nThe organic interplay which develops over the course of a match helps keep Nidhogg from ever feeling one-sided the way many multiplayer games do. Everything which takes place during a match is the dual result of two players colliding and reacting with one another, which forms a dynamic that feels cordial and joyful. Even during my worst matches I often found myself erupting in laugher over my own mistakes and haphazard attempts to regain ground, because even when I’m losing Nidhogg’s ridiculous pace and explosions of pixels are still ludicrously fun to be a part of.\n\nTo me the lifespan of a multiplayer game is almost entirely based on whether or not it’s enjoyable to the person losing, and I’ve never played a competitive game where me and my supposed competitor have fallen into such fits of laughter precisely because we’re losing. Nidhogg is a brilliantly tactical and engaging beast of a fighting game, but that it can also allow for a much friendlier mood and feel satisfying even when you’re outmatched is a remarkable achievement very few other games can boast.\n\nI suppose it has to be mentioned though that there is one rather enormous qualifier to recommending Nidhogg, that being the requirement of another local player. Though there is a single player mode it feels like a lifeless shell of its multiplayer counterpart, only potentially worth venturing into as a means of practicing advanced strategies against increasingly tough AI opponents. The online mode as well, despite being fairly functional, can’t compete with the feeling of having another person in the room with you (even more so if you are playing against random players). It will suffice if you have absolutely no other options, but I found myself growing tired of it fairly quickly and wishing the person I was playing with was sitting next to me instead of on the other end of the internet.\n\nI desperately hope that whoever is reading this won’t be hamstrung by a lack of local competition though, as with another person in the room Nidhogg is a phenomenal experience that takes only moments to sell itself but has had me repeatedly stuck in place for hours at a time, always shocked when I finally look at the clock and realize how long we’ve been playing. It’s a finely tuned machine you won’t notice and a catalyst for the delightful multiplayer mayhem that few other games have come anywhere close to matching for me.\n\nDeveloper Messhof understands that multiplayer means more than putting two players on the screen; that making sure multiple people are having fun isn’t as simple as letting them play together, and that creating a friendly competition in a space where there can be only one winner is perhaps the easiest thing to screw up and the most imperative to get right. Nidhogg doesn’t assume what it’s doing is easy the way a lot of similar games seem to, but knows if it can get it right that the end result is an atmosphere and enthusiasm that can’t be matched. Wow, did they ever follow through on that one.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","July 28, 2015","true","5.2"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","30","33","3","0"

Gameplay is what makes a game tick.\nAnd gameplay is where Nidhogg shines.\n\nIt's tense tactical game where your skills as a player matter as much as your ability to lure and trick your opponent.\n\nIt's a subtle give and take, of establishing patterns only to break them, of intimate moments of stillness and caution as the two of you step back and forth anticipating the first strike.\n\nIt's a game where all are equally matched, where true skill decides the victor rather than the perks, upgrades, boosters of so many other games\n\nThe simplicity of the controls hide a surprisingly tense and strategic game. One hit kills and there's a wide range of moves and maneuvers at your disposal. While I love Samurai Gunn's lightning fast speed and more varied maps, Nidhogg's slower paced, more cerebral challenge is absolutely addicting. And while you may be able to leap through the air with ease in Samurai Gunn, your moveset is far more versatile in Nidhogg. The smooth animations give each fight a fluid dynamic feel.\n\nNot that the visuals are bad either. The surreal graphics and chunky pixels give the game a style all its own. And while the number of maps may seem small, it's definitely a case of quality over quanity. Each map is unique, with its own eccentricities to be mastered from the concealing high grass of the Wilds to the collapsing bridges in Clouds. Not only that, each map consists of several areas as you and your opponent push back and forth to victory. Epic 20 minute duels are not uncommon\n\nI rarely play online games, but Nidhogg has me hooked.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/94400/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Nidhogg is a side scrolling fighting game which was released in early 2014. You duel against another sword wielding foe.  You have to get to the other side of the map before your opponent. In order to do so, you must run, jump, throw your sword and slide past the other enemies.\n\nThe actual gameplay is very simple, just kill the other guy really. This can be done in a number of ways, the most common is just to kill the enemy in a sparing match. You can also disarm your opponent by knocking their weapon out of their hands leaving them very vulnerable with just their fists to fight back with. You can get quite technical if you want though, by wall jumping, dive kicks and knocking down enemies by sliding their feet out.\n\nNidhogg has a single player mode, which is quite enjoyable, but can be completed in about two hours if you have any sort of skill at the game. The single player is essentially the four different levels repeated over and over increasing in difficulty. While I did have fun playing this mode, the real fun from Nidhogg comes out of the local multiplayer mode. This will pit you against your friends in a duel with the same mechanics as previously mentioned, things get competitive very fast, so watch out!  We also have an online multiplayer options available, however there were no players online every time I checked so I would class this as a no go zone.\n\nThe graphics are a very simplistic style, which actually have a nice look to them; this is the type of game that doesn't need fancy textures and shadows to make it more appealing, as you hardly pay any attention to the graphics due to how fast paced the gameplay is.\n\nThe single player mode of Nidhogg is about two hours long, so if you are purely looking for a single player experience, this may not be for you since there is not much replay-ability for single player. If you have friends who you can hook up a second controller with, Nidhogg really shines there. The majority of my time on Nidhogg was spent in a local multiplayer mode and it's an absolute blast.\n\nWhilst I think the price of £10,99 is quite steep for this game given the lack of single player and online multiplayer content available, the amount of fun you can have in local multiplayer redeems it slightly. So I am going to recommend Nidhogg, but only when it is on sale for anything under £5.  This is certainly a game I will be keeping installed for when friends come round.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldO6G9X6c7Y\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Honestly, the game doesn't give that much content, there are only 4 levels in the game, which is understandable, since the actual level design is marvelous, but for most people who play fighting game, they want levels where you can perform combos and such; where in Nidhogg; it's not about combos, but about speed; so really, this game ISN'T under most fighting game genres. To put it short; it's just generally not a fighting game; it's just a game of tag, with swords.\n\n2. The price; even if you are into this game, and the game alone, honestly, for 15 bucks, I could buy the binding of isaac for 5 dollars, and get about 10 times the amount of content in this, I'm not even kidding. Isaac aside; there isn't much play value if you don't have a controller (Sure, you can play without the controller, but it's extremly awkward using the keyboard at once when you are in a really tense situation); and even if you do, you'd probably get about 15 hours worth, before you and your friend gets bored entirely. While the game is VERY well made with excellent work, I'd only get this game during a sale; to me, the game is worth about 6 dollars at the most.\n\nOne thing I would like to note that, this is simply my opinion, because alot of people in the review section have good points about the game, if possible, give this game a go, it didn't satify my tastes, but it certinly did for alot of other people. So who knows, maybe you'll be that badass ninja guy who can throw his sword like a boomerang, and kill 2 guys in a single swing.

Among these titles is Nidhogg from developer Messhof. At first glance the portrait displayed isn't anything that would take a spot in a respectable museum but take another look and the fine details may surprise you. Nidhogg's image may not be of this generation or the last few for that matter but for all it's simplicity does its transcend to the height of AAA titles?\n\nFocused on it's combat Nidhogg offers very little in content, the single player consists of dueling several enemies within the four available stages in side-scrolling fashion. The goal is the same throughout, make it across to the opposite end whist in numerous duels of death. The respawns are unlimited but once either makes it across 3 screens the game is over and the victor is eaten by the Nidhogg, the world tree chomping worm of Norse mythology.\n\nIf there is anything that Nidhogg does extremely well is its combat, the intricate system requires quick reflexes, perfect timing and finesse. Considering the simple premise, the multitude of stances and moves offer up a good amount of depth.  Duels expanding across the pixilated canvas aren't uncommon and it's a testament to how deep the combat is. Stage hazards do play their role but in the end the better fighter will come out on top. It's any easy game to get into and one that offers up some intense moments with duels reaching ridiculous heights.\n\nWithout a doubt the visuals of Nidhogg are not the main attraction, it's sprite based aesthetics do enough to portray the environments and figures throughout the world. Though limited the end result gives Nidhogg some visual charm and identity. Seeing the floor and walls painted with the players matter is chuckle worthy and a nice touch displaying the chaos among adversaries.\n\nHowever, the small amount of stages leaves much to desire, considering how simple the levels are it's hard to imagine why any DLC has not been introduced. Stages present little in the imagination department with minimal inspiration. In light of how much was presented in the combat one would imagine a larger emphasis in the level design to promote replayability.\n\nNidhogg's multiplayer is crippled by the absence of any online lobby system that could in fact strengthen the competitive mode drastically. The limited online mutliplayer consist of single encounters unless played locally via the bracket based tournament mode. The idea behind the mode is brilliant but why it isn't available online is a major misstep in the design.\n\nNidhogg is a charming experience that could of been greater if not for it's lack in content and multiplayer options. The simple to execute yet deep combat system is offset by many other flaws in design. Nidhoggs first attempt has the most important aspect of any game of this style right, it may be completely lacking in narrative but definitely a game made for competitive multiplayer. Playing with some buds is fun and Nidhogg does a great job with contact kills allowing you to embellish every neck break or impalement of a friend.  It's simple, stupid, and addicting fun.  Pick it up on a sale, the asking price might be a bit steep for the short but humorous experience.\n\n+Great Combat\n+Unique Identity\n+The Nidhogg has no Mercy\n\n-Lack of online options and lobbies\n-Cloud stage is weak\n-Lag can be an issue\n-Flat soundtrack\n\n6.9\n","July 3, 2014","true","4.5"," 31 of 50 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","31","50","0","0"

Ahem:\n\n•	WINNER: Indiecade Game Design, 2013\n•	WINNER: IGF | GDC Nuovo Award, 2011\n•	WINNER: Eurogamer Expo, RPS Indie Game of the Show, 2010\n•	WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Excellence in Design, 2010\n•	WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Bloodsport of the Year: 2010\n•	FINALIST: IGF | GDG Excellence in Design, 2011\n•	FINALIST: IGF | GDC Grand Prize, 2011\n\nThose are the nominations and awards the newly released indie fighter, Nidhogg has listed on their home page. It was enough to make me pick it up without hesitation.\n\nI don't often define the quality of a video game by how many awards it's won, but when I start losing the ability to count them on my hands, apparently I do. A good thing, too. Nidhogg is all kinds of awesome.\n\nA DUEL TO THE DEATH\nThe concept is remarkably simple: 2 players go head-to-head in a half duel/half race to the death, both equipped with fencing swords and capable of more than a few tricks to give an edge in battle.\n\nYou begin facing your opponent in the 'middle' of a map, with an opening battle. Battles are fast and furious beyond imagining, often ending within a few seconds, which ties into the gameplay mechanic wonderfully: upon killing your opponent they'll need to wait a moment to respawn, allowing you to press forward toward your 'goal'.\n\nWin a battle and you're given the 'goal light' allowing you to move forward further; lose, and your opponent gains it instead. So long as you maintain the previous kill you can pass-by your opponent without engaging and edge closer to your goal - should they fail to stop your approach.\n\nThis 'tug-o-war' mechanic is the single most endearing indie game element I've felt in a while. It's relentless, and the feeling of achievement after finally managing to push an opponent back to the end, before summarily being eaten by Nidhogg, is one of much glory and admiration. Simple, sure. But so very, very rewarding. Easy to learn, too, and likely near-impossible to master.\n\nMATCH MADE IN HELL\nSingle-Player Mode consists of fighting steadily more challenging opponents, one after another, on one of 4 maps. So, naturally, if you want to be playing Nidhogg for more than a few hours, you're going to need to go multiplayer.\n\nSadly, the online matchmaking within Steam isn't great. Assuming you can actually find a game, there's a good chance one of you will be lagging horribly — and when you're playing the type of game that you can't play with even the slightest amount of lag, matches can often lead to aggravating experiences.\n\nAssuming you have a few friends playing, and you're all within the same global region, this won't be a huge problem. And if you're lucky enough to have more than a few friends playing, then Tournament Mode will likely give you the greatest experience of all. I know, personally, playing live on Twitch, that this feature will make for 99% of all my time playing.\n\nWORTH A BUY?\nAt $15~ I can only recommend a purchase here for players with friends planning to play with them - for now, at least. Which is largely a shame, as the gameplay offered in Nidhogg is truly exceptional.\n\nPossible improvements include visual upgrades to characters to simulate some form of character progression; as it stands, every game is the same and with 4 maps there's limited variety. You'll be relying on your opponents to entertain you; if they do, you're going to love Nidhogg, if not, you're likely going to get very bored, very quick.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nCody Hargreaves, better known as  Excessive Profanity[twitch.tv], has been writing reviews and articles in the gaming industry for 7 years, across various websites and publications.

I say this because it requires skill to play, is fast-paced, has wonderful backgrounds, and simply has an interesting and fun concept behind it. It's also very satisfying to fake out your opponent with a tricky sword maneuver and jam a rapier through his head. Additionally, the soundtrack is phenomenal!\n\nHowever, the replayability of the game is limited, as there are only four maps and the online multiplayer is a bit rough around the edges (it's much better and more responsive while playing local multiplayer or singleplayer), and once you beat the singleplayer campaign you need friends who enjoy playing it as much as you do.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game, as it is entertaining, satisfying, and while it is easy to learn, it is difficult to master (but very rewarding when you get it down pat). I actually have more hours on record than Steam reports I do, because I've played it on a different computer and the transfer of playtime between computers was not very good; I have about 10 hours more than the amount shown above invested in this game, and I still play it and recommend it heartily.

You hold your rapier in three positions, low, mid, and high. You can strike from any of these positions, and if you hit your opponent who is at the same guard as your attack, it'll be parried. Moving your blade up/down onto your opponent's guard will also disarm them. You can throw your rapier, do a jump-kick, and do a sweep while crouched. You can also roll on the ground, which has the implication of rolling under a high-guard and getting behind your opponent. Overall, the combat is good. Also, each unique stage has special areas and can be used to your advantage. Such as the cloud level where you can fall down if you don't move.\n\nGRAPHICS: The graphics, although "pixellated", are aesthetically pleasing. However this is where the game starts to fall. The second "cloud" level, is very, very bright and flashes very fast. I'm not epileptic, but I was straining to see in this level and I have no idea how an epileptic would deal with it. But otherwise they're good.\n\nCOMMUNITY: Now here's where the game falls apart further. It has a good, active community. However this is useless as the netcode for the game literally doesn't work. There is no online play, so you can only play locally/LAN. A game that'd otherwise have a very long life is made a gimmick because of this. There are no multiplayer tournaments, matches with friends, or community events. In this sense, the game's simplicity kills itself as it doesn't last when playing alone.\n\nThe game is good, but I can't recommend it. Due to the non-existant support post-launch, the broken netcode, and lack of news about the game gives it a bleak future.\n\n5/10, good game but it's average.","January 17, 2015","false","1.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

I'd heard such great things about it, and it seemed like it should be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it was just let down.\n\nFirst, the gameplay. Nidhogg has simple but slightly awkward controls that certainly can be mastered but aren't particularly fluid on their own. If you're expecting fighting-game style precision, you're going to be disappointed. Once you get past the tutorial, the movement options feel fuzzy and unreliable. The basic combat is... okay. Most actions happen so quickly that it's humanly impossible to react to them, so it's mostly about anticipation and taking risks, and be prepared for a number of frustrating deaths where it doesn't even look like you were touched by the opponent's sword.\n\nI realize that everything I just wrote is directly contrary to what most other critics are saying about the game, but I can only call it like I see it. I've played plenty of other games in this niche, and they all felt better than Nidhogg.\n\nThe one place where the game is fun is local co-op, which is the entire point of the game I suppose, but it's fun for the "wrong" reasons. Playing with a group of friends makes all of the "screw you, that was stupid" moments fun, because you  all get to taunt each other the whole time. So basically, the game is fun with friends precisely *because* of the stupid and lopsided moments that in any other situation would just be frustrating.\n\nClaims that the game's graphics are "beautiful" are overstated. There are one or two impressive setpieces that will probably catch your eye, but the game as a whole isn't particularly nice-looking. The style is unique and expressive, but it's not objectively pleasing by any measure. Also, the game really needs a colorblind setting, because my character is practically invisible to me against the backdrop of the second stage.\n\nMy final complaint, which others have echoed, is that there's not nearly enough content to justify the $15 price tag. I normally don't mind paying a little extra for a good game, but this is definitely more of a $5 title. If it's on sale for that much and you're looking for a new game to play at parties, maybe this is for you, but otherwise you're not missing much by passing it up.","September 25, 2014","false","1.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Think Smash Bros, Towerfall, Samurai Gunn, etc. Don´t fret though because the game does have online multiplayer.\n\nThe simple goal of Nidhogg is to get into the endzone, that´s it. Too bad your opponent has the exact same goal.\nWhat ensues is a glorious tug of war, because who ever got the last kill is the only one who can proceed. And killing there will be lots of, because besides being a race for the goal, Nidhogg also excells at being a Prince of Persia-style fencing game. Although appearing rather simple, the fighting system is pretty deep and complex with parries, blocks, feints, jumps, rolls, wallmoves, different attack stances, you can even throw your blade at your opponent.\n\nAll of this lightning-fast action is presented in a very stylized fashion, reminescent of the good old days of the Commodore 64 and it fits the game perfectly. Animations are fluent (and very gory in a cartoony way), backgrounds are very retro and sometimes deliberately convoluted or hard to see your character in.\nThough featuring only 4 Stages on the date of this review, it´s more than enough to get going and further deepens the Retro-Arcady-Feel of this game (yes, leaving things out can actually give a product more character rather than taking it away)\n\nSound and music are nothing to write home about but they get the job done with little screams and clangs here and there.\n\n\nNidhogg is a game it would definetely reccomend if you grew up with titles like Barbarian, International Karate (Karateka) or even the wonderful Moonstone (which NEEDS a remake). It´s fast, deep, satisfying, a definite skill- AND mindgame when it comes to the fencing. People looking for a lot of content and fancy graphics will surely be turned off by this game but tournament-fighters and retro-fans should try it.\n\n\nOne final word about the pricing, I can understand that 11 bucks (or how much that may be in $) is a steep price but devs gotta live too and I´m sure it will be in a sale sooner or later. So consider helping the guys (the guy?) from Messhoff out by getting it right now!","January 14, 2014","true","3.6"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

The game isn't even true 16x9 widescreen, game has unexplainable lagspikes on my brand new 700 series GPU Gaming Laptop.  And the combat itself feels more frantic and "beat to the punch" based than actual super fast paced methodical skill-based combat.  Has good ideas, and my opinions can change on the complexity and eventual mastery, but right now it's just "feels" too frenetic to be any real skill-based 3rd Strike (if you will) type gameplay.  So it's a good pick up and play game.\n\nSoundtrack wise, it leaves a lot to be desired.  nothing really to say there, nothing is really good at all...\n\nVisually, it's a minimalist type paintery style, sort of, but I don't particularly think it excentuates the raw gameplay as much as another artstyle could.  But heh, it's unique, and it looks alright.\n\nMultiplayer should be fun at least.\n\nAnyway, just my first impressions.  But definitely not worth a $15 pricetag imo, much better games at cheaper or exactly that price.  And Volgarr The Viking remains the undisputed king of recent Indie games recently with Race The Sun at #2 imo.\n\nSo anyway, yeah, 7/10 if you want a score.","January 15, 2014","true","5.1"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","3"

It can be ♥♥♥♥in’ INTENSE.  You can die and respawn as many times as you like.  The goal is to get to the end of the level in whatever direction you have to go, right for me, left for him.  Stab, jump, kick, punch your way through him.  Even if the game ends up with him almost winning, you can push your way back to your end of the level just because it becomes so nerve racking for the other person that a chance for you to push back opens up and you make a mad dash for the right side of the screen.  The battle wages on room through room, back and forth.  Orange and Yellow blood bathes the floor while sword upon sword exchange hands as they are thrown through the air.  A lucky stab in the face brings your opponent’s hands to your sword as you stand still for but a moment, the character grasping at the sword.  You thrust forward and the color orange floods the floor below.  You run forward.  He spawns in the doorway ahead of you.  You can’t throw your sword.  You have to charge him.  You see that he has put his sword just too high.  You charge.  You duck and roll all the way through the doorway and stand and stab him in the back.  You keep running.  He spawns again, this time getting a lucky sword throw to your face.  Lives are traded.  you finally make it to the next room.  You are beating him.  This is your territory.  The ground is clean of blood and swords.  you charge.  he spawns just before a pit and makes a nervous jump, falling to his doom.  You laugh!  You wait for him to respawn as he recollects himself.  You both realize that that pitfall was a mistake.  An honorable man lets your opponent have a fair fight.   You beat him.  As he dissolves in to orange goo behind you, you run for the final screen.  You make it.\n\nThe screen flares up in brilliant red as the sky catches fire.  The music picks up.  Everything is waiting for you to make the first move.  You charge.  he spawns.  He knows you could win if you get past him.  You make a jump.  You dive kick in to him.  His sword goes left, his body crumples.  You charge to the right.  he runs to the left, hoping to respawn before you can make it across to the end of the map.  He respawns.\n\nHe knows your tricks.  he knows you will jump above him as he spawns, sending your foot in to his face.  He is ready.  You know he knows your plans.  You prepare for the inevitable.  There is no time to change plans.  You must act.  You jump.\n\nHe jumps.\n\nOne of you will press the kick button at the right time.  If you press it at the wrong time, he will kick you to the ground and rip your proud head off your yellow neck.  You kick.  Your feet meet his feet.  He falls.  You charge.\n\nThe croud is doing the wave in your favor.  You have done it.  You bow to your opponent.  Your hands are sweating.  You crawl to the finish line, barely able to stand.\n\nA giant worm flies towards you.  You are eaten whole.\n\nWINNER.","January 15, 2014","true","14.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The combat is surprisingly deep and even after a few days I still find it really fun to play in a local setting. Spectating people chanting and cheering when someone is disarmed and slain is one of the things that just can't be coded in to the game. Eight player tournaments are also spectacular, but this is an even less likely scenario for most prospective buyers. There is a single player game that is adequate for times where you'd like to play but have no one to play with for the moment, but this mode is not nearly as interesting as battling with other humans.\n\nYes, there is an option to play online. However, online multiplayer still has a lot of issues that seem to vary between being "fine" and "massive desync; abort everything". It's a shame, but I can't recommend this game that doesn't treat this game as a local multiplayer game the time being. There may be a day where that's untrue, maybe even soon, where it'll be absolutely fine online. Until then, consider this game only if you have at least one other person to play with. If you are willing to slog through some horrible connection problems with some people, there may be some fun matches to have, but the cost-benefit of that could potentially be very low.\n\nIn short: great game for local multiplayer. Very interesting and fun mechanics.

Online multiplayer is incredibly laggy, there is no option for local lan play which I see as a huge omission, there is no way of directly choosing to play with a friend so you can't arrange to play people, and the menus need better mouse support or a different UI entirely.\n\nBut, the gameplay is there, and that's the biggest hurdle.  The aesthetic is solid, the gamemodes are varied and interesting, it's got most of what it needs to be a good multiplayer game between friends.  It could be lots of fun, if they could make it so you could actually play with those friends without dealing with 20 rounds of matchmaking roulette to get paired and a ruberbanding stuttery mess when you finally play.  It's just pretty hard to actually enjoy the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibernetik/recommended/94400/","kibernetik","Eddard Stark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibernetik/","542 products in account","Let's start this review slightly differently. This is an amazing game and you should be ashamed you're not playing it right now.\nI think many of you will agree that there are very few genres that can compete with fighting games when it comes to a local multiplayer experience. While RPGs, FPSs and RTSs are usually played alone with headphones on, it's the fighting games that not brings the whole circle of friends together. And the neighbours as well, since they're jarateed off that you are still shouting for several hours straight. Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Skullgirls - these games are the first ones that come to mind whenever you think about playing together on the same couch with your buddies. Hell, even on the Wii, that's notorious for being the best console to play with your buddies in the same room, the best selling game that's not Sports or Mario is... Super Smash Bros. Brawl. A fighting game. The sheer competitiveness of fighting one-to-one or two versus two is already thrilling and excitement-filling, but the possible moves, combinations and strategies can leave an incredible impression to anyone.\nAnd Nidhogg, well, is a fighting game. Kind of.\nTruth to be told, it's a fighting game in the purest form. No different characters. No varied movesets. Perfect. Symmetry.\nBoth players get to play as a diffent-colored fighter. Part stickman, part pixel-man(?), he wields a sword of sorts. It's probably a rapier. I mean, you stab the other part stickman, part pixel-man with it. The stages are perfectly symmetrical as well, meaning that the only advantage you can get is the one you build yourself.\nThe gameplay isn't traditional in fighting game sense: two players try to stab/divekick/rip-spine-off one another. Such actions result in an instant-kill. Although this is not quite near the Divekick level, where one touch means someone is dead already, the fights rarely last more than a few seconds. Once the morbid deed has been done and your opponent is bleeding all over the place, a huge GO! arrow appears in the direction where your opponent should be. If he was alive, that is. You run towards the arrow, the screen moves slightly and now your opponent has respawned, standing a few meters away from you, weapon ready. Kill him, see the arrow, run towards the arrow, move screen even more. In a way, this might remind you of those classic beat-'em-ups, where you have to punch down all the guys in the screen, see the GO! arrow appear and then move the screen slightly, getting yourself an inch closer to victory. The process in Nidhogg is pretty similar, except that in the way of killing>running towards arrow>killing, you will most likely be pierced like a kebab and left pouring blood all over the carpet.\nIf such an accident happens, and it will, a GO! arrow will still appear. This time, for your opponent. If you fail enough times and get killed more, the screen will move to the final stage. Dying here will usually mean that your opponent wins. As he runs towards victory, you block his initial lunge, jump to the air and land on his head. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ manages to roll back and pick up his rapier. However, this time, he is on the defensive, while you are free to run towards him, roll just under his blade and swipe his feet, knocking your foe down. It all culminates with a glorified spine-rip, with extra crunchy sound effects as a bonus. You run towards the arrow, the screen moves and you feel a little bit more relieved, knowing that you managed to push away your fate slightly farther away.\nSuch is the beatiful fencing of Nidhogg, where you use the responsive and fluid control to out-skill and out-wit your opponent. Fights last mere seconds, but they are just as exciting as a whole round of Street Fighter. You'll never feel cheated if you die, since you were not out-gunned. I mean, who the hell picks Chun Li while playing with your friends, anyway!? Erm, sorry. The whole game can be controlled by 6 buttons - 4 for movement and 2 for attacking. It's incredibly simple and easy to pick up, but just like the aforementioned Divekick, this game is immensely complex. With a few button combinations, you can jump, divekick, roll, cartwheel (!), taunt, throw you goshdarned rapier into the unsuspecting victim's face and more.\nNot only the fencing is beautiful, however. The arenas you fight in are as well. There is some variety and creativity here and there, but not too much to distract you from the true goal. To appeal to the mighty Nidhogg. Oh, forgot to mention him! Reader, meet Nidhogg, the giant pink nordic dragon-snake-thingy that eats you once you win.\nAll jokes aside, this game is filled with incredible design decisions, even if some of them are accidental. Even the mere fact that the whole point of the game is to get EATEN with a loud *CRUNCH* sound following makes this game perfect for parties. Sure, your opponent won after that hard match and he might have been using his cheap running technique, but he got eaten. The silly Nidhogg's eyes are enough to soften up even the sorest losers. And the awesome design doesn't stop there.\nThe sound effects are great to cheer people up as well. Alongside the general rapier sounds, you also get a whole bunch of *slash*, *slush* and *GWEAAAARRRRGHHHhhhh...* as well. After your opponent misjudges his distance and divekicks right in front of your rapier, impaling himself, it's hard for both to contain laughter after the poor sod releases a complimentary *Erghhwgghhht...*\nThis game also has flaws, as hard it might be to confess. Single-player is pretty much a glorified training mode (aren't most fighting games like that?) with an easily exploitable AI and online-multiplayers suffers from latency issues. However, playing anything but local multiplayer on this game is just a crime against it. Still, the number of stages is underwhelming and Steam Workshop support could help it. Another minor complaint would be that you can't pick your own color during offline multiplayer, only tournament mode.\nNidhogg can create new friendships. Nidhogg can strenghthen existing ones. And most likely Nidhogg will. Dueling with a buddy, be it you two are playing for the first time or this is your fifth hundredth match, is just simply a blast, filled with laughter, joy, shouts and pixelated blood. But it's even more fun to play with even more friends. Up to 8 player tournament mode is incredible (and the winner gets something more awesome than being eaten by a worm) and while two are locked in an intense duel, the others can shoutcast, cheer or pick favorites. It's an incredible party game. Tim is strategic, trying to roll under your feet and disarm you. Mike is wrong in the head and he thinks that throwing your only weapon in vain hopes to kill is the best way to win. He's probably right. Johnny? He's an ♥♥♥♥, trying to run around the opposition, instead of fighting head-on. Steve is good at dive-kicking. He'll dive-kick when he has the upper hand and when he doesn't. He'll dive-kick anytime. Oh, there's also me, the sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, who rolls around the floor using the same move he calls "Cartwheel assassin" trying to sneakily stab you once you're distracted.\nAll of these strategies work. All of them are viable. All of them can win games and they HAVE won games.\nThere are no tier-lists in Nidhogg. There are no combo sheets either. Just pure fun. If you, dear reader, think that this isn't a fighting game, you're probably right as well. But all I care is that Nidhogg is the best local multiplayer game you could ever play.","May 8, 2014","true","13.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

There aren't many people online (4 were matchmaking at the time) but I still found a match relativley quickly. The tutorial is broken at the momment, but just looking at the control configuration gives you an idea of things.\n\nThe game is pretty straight forward, you kill the enemy player and advanced towards your goal before they respawn infront of you. Once you get to the end you sacrafice yourself to a giant worm to entertain a crowd and win. It's a tug of war game with swords and it's rather fun doing crazy moves like disarming your opponents or kicking them off cliffs.\n\nI heard the multiplayer was really laggy for some people, but it seems playable if you're playing with somebody on the same continent. I expereinced a bit of delay in my moves but did alright against a random player.\n\nIf you're hurting for cash, I probably wouldn't recommend spending more than 10 dollars on this game unless you are planning on playing it with a friend, I'm assuming that's where most of the fun comes from.\n\nIf this game every goes for sale at a cheap price, I'd defintiley recommend it.

This game perfectly revives old arcade style fights with your friends. This game is one of the most intense you will play in a long time. Locally, this game is a wonder and something that everyone will have a blast with. The graphics are simplistic enough that they do not distract from the gameplay, which the game revolves around in the first place. The controls are quick and easy to hop into. Within the first five minutes of the game, you will learn every move the game has to offer, from divekicks to somersaults. The concept of Nidhogg sometimes makes it feel like a boardgame; having a strict set of rules and goals but hundreds of different ways to achieve them. Although the meat of the game purely revolves around playing with other people, the AI is actually very fun to play against in the singleplayer. Obviously, they goof sometimes, but they will often be fun to play with and be a slight challenge at least. This game is great with friends and even the matchmaking is pretty swell. What takes away from this game is purely how laggy the multiplayer can be in some cases. Few matchmaking games will be laggy, but private games that you are invited to can be atrocious. If you have the money, I highly recommend Nidhogg, especially if you have people to enjoy it with.","January 18, 2014","true","7.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The gameplay is innovative and complicated, but it basically goes to waste because of the glaring flaws in its mechanics. It is far too easy to simply run past your opponent and prevent them from attacking you. All you have to do is evade their attacks when the arrow is on you and you can skip right to the end. You can also cheap-shot them if their sword isn't in the right place, making it even harder for a defender to turn the tide. It's advertised as a fencing game but it's really about trolling. If you want to get good at this strategy and use it to ♥♥♥♥ off everyone you play against, absolutely, buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/94400/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Nidhogg is about competitive dueling. I first played EggNogg that was way more hilarious with the swords bouncing around, so I entered Nidhogg disappointed as it was more 'bland' and the different parts of each level are too short to allow longer play and more frequent comebacks. EggNogg had one single level with more variety inside, while Nidhogg has less variety inside a single level but more variety overall with the different levels and their unique twists (grass field to hide in the Wilds, narrow corridors and moving floor in the Mines, concealing clouds and bright colors in the Clouds, and a few pits plus a big central area in the Castle). I will give something important to Nidhogg over EggNogg though: the controls are more reactive and the game is more balanced. It feels good to play, and it leaves a lot of room for improving skill and reading the moves of the opponent. (Edit: However EggNogg+ now has reactive controls that even includes wall-jumps!)\n\nSo what else does Nidhogg have? AI players for a single player mode, these opponents are actually quite good and each AI seems to have its own way to fight and unpredictable movements. Good point here. There are nice local multiplayer additions such as an 8 player tournament mode, and the possibility to change the game rules for local 1 on 1.\n\nLast but not least, there is an online multiplayer mode. Having friends to play with seems like the only reasonable way, as the matchmaking is literally empty and on the rare occasions that there is someone else playing, expect painful lag as they are likely at the other side of the world.\n\nSo then, here comes the big question. Why am I not recommending this game? I enjoy playing it, I want it to have more success but.... It took so many years and does not seem polished enough. It is not possible to change the color of the players, my logitech controllers are not recognized by the game, the different areas in each level are too short to allow for more tense play (the central area in the castle is the best place for comebacks and tension building up), the online part of the game has the merit to exist but didn't get enough love, there are no arrows at the start of the game to show who is who, and, for all of that, I find that the game is too expensive for what it is. And apparently I'm not the only one thinking that way, seeing all the comments in the forum and the fact that the online multiplayer is quite empty.\n\nI can only recommend this game on sale or if you know you will often have friends over to enjoy the duels. I realize that I am too severe because I probably expected too much and the free game EggNogg biased my judgment a lot, but Nidhogg was around for a long time and the result still lacks polish. Although I guess that it is expensive to compensate for the small niche market. But a fundamental issue for me is the lack of players online, and the insane lag on the rare moments that a player is found (it can even happen often to see the same scene rewind with each time a different player dying, wtf?).","February 17, 2014","false","14.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Players are only equipped with a sword. However you may perform various moves, such as lunging, diving and rolling. The aim of the game is to run to your side of the map. However, you may only do so if your marker is active. You receive the marker when you slay your opponent. The player that wins gets to sacfrifice themselves to the Nidhogg!\n\nThe game offers excellent gameplay. Although there are only four maps, it is still quite addictive. Gather some friends, and enjoy every second of it... that is, if you have friends that are willing to play this. Otherwise, don't bother getting this game; the online matchmaking system does not work! Due to this, the $15 price tag is just not worth it. There is singleplayer, however it is only a race against bots, moving through each map sequencially with bots that increase in difficulty as you go along. The aim is to see how fast you can win against 16 bots. Hence, singleplayer is rather repetative and only good if you are new to the game.\n\nIn terms of game development techniques (i.e. graphics, media and physics), the developers have done a great job! Everything suits the theme of the game, the music is very motivating, and the graphics are substantial. The physics are also quite precise, with minimum glitches.\n\nOverall, a fine effort. It is a shame though, that the matchmaking system doesn't work. This game has so much potential, and could be made into something extraordinary! I would love to rate this higher, but the price tag and high amount of potential just brings it down. One thing is for sure though... this is certainly unforgettable. ~ Rating: 7.5/10","June 11, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What I failed to realize was how much fun it would be and how much I'd be laughing during our bouts. It's got that same quick gameplay and strategic timing of old school vs arcade games like Joust. The graphics even herald of the golden days of pixel based gaming. It is just you vs the computer or another player and you have to advance all the way to the enemies side of the battlefield across several screens. Your only weapon is a fencing foil that you can hold high, level or low and depending on the positioning you will have an advantage when swining at the enemy, a disadvantage, or a cancel/parry. Throw in a jump, a roll, a throw, and the ability to punch/kick when disarmed and you have a simple move set that is difficult to level against your enemy if they are every bit as conniving as you. It's a great game to play with friends, and though it doesn't have lasting appeal, it's always fun to throw in for a quick match as a palette cleanser betwee other multiplayer games. Pick it up on sale and you won't regret it.","November 15, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is sadly a one-trick pony and you'll feel the brand-new game buzz wear pretty damn thin much quicker than you'd like. If you look past the shear lack of longevity to this game, you can no doubt appreciate the nice visual take on a classic look and the quirky and fresh (in the modern gaming world anyway) style of gameplay. If you're looking for a fun indie game to play solo (for more than an hour or two at least), in my opinion, this isn't it.\n\n6/10\nPros/Cons\n\n+ Gameplay is fluent, intense and varied enough for a well balanced and fun showdown.\n+ Classical visuals matched with frantic visual effects and modern music make for an interesting mix.\n+ With friends this game creates rivalries and offers a few hours of fun gaming full of laughs.\n+ The crossover between Nordic mythology and fencing is so mis-matched it adds to the games charm.\n\n- Has to be one of the most repetitive games i've played with no variation in gameplay whatsoever.\n- There is such little content even for the select game types with only 4 environments available.\n- For the price of this game, you'd expect much more from it and not just a glamourised minigame.\n- The singleplayer mode is tiring to work through whilst multiplayer options are just as limiting due to content.","February 20, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So to actually achieve that "full controller support" just download a software like JoyToKey. Other than that, it's kinda repetitive contentwise, I haven't seen matches in online multiplayer, and if you play too much local multiplayer you're going to lose friends fast.

A fantastic party game to play with friends, both online and locally.\n\nIf you like 1 versus 1 gameplay, fencing, and fast-paced action, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are very simple, but still good - the blood leakage effect whenever someone dies can result in the battlefield being painted in a variety of colors. The music and sounds are decent, but I prefer to play my own to add to the intensity of the combat.\n\nControls are very simple, but mastering the combat system may take some practice. There is a quick tutorial that will help you learn everything you need to know. The learning curve is minimal - the most difficult thing being training yourself and your reflexes/reaction time. I've tried using both a controller and the keyboard, and either works perfectly - I personally prefer a controller.\n\nThe gameplay is fast and relentless - your goal is to reach the opposite end of the map, while also preventing your opponent from doing the same. There are a series of areas to pass (the map is mirrored) before the "final area," and if you pass this area you will continue on to the winners section. You can lunge with your sword or punch/divekick if you are unarmed. Throwing your sword is risky, but may be fruitful in the right situation. You can pick up any dropped sword, and an area may have plenty of swords (and blood) on the ground if you and your opponent are rapidly killing each other. You can do tricks like disarming your opponent by hovering up or down on their sword, and you can also sweep their legs to drop them to the ground. The "right of way" arrow shows who can continue down the map, and this is provided to whoever has achieved the latest kill. There are situations where both players can die - mostly falling to your death - and the right of way will be reset to no one.\n\nAn interesting concept - and advantage - of having the right of way is that you don't necessarily have to kill your opponent each time. Instead, you can also try to dodge them and just keep running down the map. To counter this, you need to run in the opposite direction in order to spawn in front of the person with the right of way.\n\nThere is a singleplayer mode that is fairly challenging, as well as a tournament mode (or just straight up versus, both online and local).\n\nOverall, the game is a fantastic party game that is very easy to learn and begin playing.\n\nDefinitely recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","January 18, 2015","true","3.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","10","18","3","0"

What that means is, you can only progress if you were the last one to net the kill, and the entire goal isn't to kill the foe after that- it's to sprint to your goal. So long as you have the "Go" arrow you can progress, otherwise your opponent can. The goal of the game is to protect yourself while you're progressing and to be as aggressive as possible when you're defending.\n\nThe game has very simple mechanics- Jump, lunge/throw, raise sword, lower sword, duck, roll, kick, flying kick, etc. What makes the game interesting is these simple mechanics blend so nicely... however it does lead to some intense frustration as you THINK you got the hit but your opponent was just ONE TINY MILLISECOND ahead of you and stabs you first.\n\nIt's definitally a fun game that you can pick up with  a friend, but extended play is nerve-wrecking and requires a great deal of patience.","September 26, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A great game with a retro arcade feel yet all the fluidity of modern controls. Fast-paced, addictive gameplay that's great to play with friends, especially in the Offline Versus mode (I'm pretty sure this is the preferred mode for most players).\n\nMy only gripe with this game is the cost. As great as this game is, it shouldn't be retailing for more than £5, considering the potential AAA titles you can pick up for the £12 price tag. It simply doesn't have the content depth to justify it. Also, if you're going to offer buy two copies and give one to a friend, it should at least be 50% off the second copy, not a £2 saving.\n\nMy advice: Chip in with some friends and buy this for some pick up and play tournament action.","January 28, 2014","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/partialbiscuit/recommended/94400/","partialbiscuit","marciN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/partialbiscuit/","981 products in account","Nidhogg is a small game developed by an indie developer Messhof. While the game isn’t the longest one I have ever played, it is definitely THE best local multiplayer game I have played in a long time. You can literally spend countless hours playing the local multiplayer against your friends.\n\nIn Nidhogg there is only one objective , kill your opponent by out-stabbing them by using only three sets of stances, high, middle and low. Maneuvers such as, rolling, dive-kicking, neck-snapping and sword-throwing are also at your disposal. While it may sound simple at first, the game is really hard to master, and sometimes it gets a little bit frustrating when you get stabbed couple times in a row.\n\nAfter you kill your enemy you have to run to the right in order to advance to next level, the enemy can do the same thing, if you get killed, he can run to the opposite direction, this will get you back to the previous screen, and this gets really annoying because sometimes the enemy instead of fighting you, will just run past you just to get you back to the previous screen. Each ‘level’ is divided into couple smaller ones. In single player, there is a total of 17 AI opponents, the first one being the easiest and the last one, the toughest(I don’t know if that’s true but when I’ve played it, the game got harder every time with each AI opponent). At the end of each level your character is eaten by a giant dragon-like creature, by the name of Nidhogg, you can’t avoid it though(trust me, I’ve tried), I don’t know what’s the point of that but It’s kind of hilarious and random.\n\nThe art style is what I love the most about this game, it has that surreal look to it, kind of like Hotline Miami. The player animations are also worth mentioning because of how smooth and realistic they are, and also it feels really satisfying when you stab someone.\n\nOn the other hand, the game also has some flaws, one of them is the online multiplayer, it is seriously lacking in features and is very unstable, I kept being disconnected from matches, and I have experienced serious lag during several online matches. You can’t even properly communicate with your opponent because the chat can’t handle longer messages.\n\nAs I have said before, the single-player consists of 17 AI opponents, which is great but the same can’t be said about the level variety, there is only 3 or 4 different levels which are re-used during the 17 battles in the single-player. I really wish that there was more variety in level design, maybe we’ll get them in later updates.\n\nNonetheless, If you enjoy playing games with your friends then this game is for you but If you don’t like the local multiplayer I would still recommend sure the game isn’t very long, but the multiplayer is still there, it might be a bit lackluster but who knows maybe the devs will add some new features to the online multiplayer.","March 9, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simple controls and gorgeous graphics combine with excellent music and sound design to present a simple, rewarding experience.

The next time you and a couple of friends are wondering how to kill the time, challenging them to a fencing match for the right to be devoured by a great beast is a fantastic way to do it.","March 10, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's complex and simple all at the same time.

After reaching the end of the level, you will defeat your opponent and move on to the next where you will fight a differently colored progressively more skilled opponent.

The controls and mechanics are simple enough for you to learn them quickly, but they also have enough depth for complex, skill-based play. At first, fighting doesn't appear complicated, but there is a lot going on. Positioning is crucial; standing above your opponent or blocking a doorway can make all the diffence. You also have a few different ways to approach fighting. Fencing is an option, but you could also try tossing your sword and rushing ahead for some melee attacks. One of my favorite tricks is "playing chicken"; I throw my sword and charge ahead, and right before my opponent attacks, I roll past them and just keep on going. Local versus is one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I've had in a long time. The visuals ooze retro style, and I absolutely adore the soundtrack.\n\nAs much as I love the gameplay, I can't necessarily recommend that you buy Nidhogg, at least for $15. You don't get a ton of content for your money. Apart from multiplayer, all you get is a single-player mode that is just a series of AI matches. The AI makes it clear that Nidhogg is a multiplayer game at heart, as it lacks the complexity of a human player. Playing with friends is great because of the atmosphere, the intensity, and the psychology. Messing with your opponent's head is just as important as the onscreen action, and when playing against the AI, you lose that crucial component.\n\nIf Nidhogg were around $7.50, I would have no reservations about recommending it. I'm still setting my review to "recommended" because the game itself is so fun, but you might want to wait for a sale.","February 12, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/partialbiscuit/recommended/94400/","partialbiscuit","marciN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/partialbiscuit/","981 products in account","Nidhogg is a small game developed by an indie developer Messhof. While the game isn’t the longest one I have ever played, it is definitely THE best local multiplayer game I have played in a long time. You can literally spend countless hours playing the local multiplayer against your friends.\n\nIn Nidhogg there is only one objective , kill your opponent by out-stabbing them by using only three sets of stances, high, middle and low. Maneuvers such as, rolling, dive-kicking, neck-snapping and sword-throwing are also at your disposal. While it may sound simple at first, the game is really hard to master, and sometimes it gets a little bit frustrating when you get stabbed couple times in a row.\n\nAfter you kill your enemy you have to run to the right in order to advance to next level, the enemy can do the same thing, if you get killed, he can run to the opposite direction, this will get you back to the previous screen, and this gets really annoying because sometimes the enemy instead of fighting you, will just run past you just to get you back to the previous screen. Each ‘level’ is divided into couple smaller ones. In single player, there is a total of 17 AI opponents, the first one being the easiest and the last one, the toughest(I don’t know if that’s true but when I’ve played it, the game got harder every time with each AI opponent). At the end of each level your character is eaten by a giant dragon-like creature, by the name of Nidhogg, you can’t avoid it though(trust me, I’ve tried), I don’t know what’s the point of that but It’s kind of hilarious and random.\n\nThe art style is what I love the most about this game, it has that surreal look to it, kind of like Hotline Miami. The player animations are also worth mentioning because of how smooth and realistic they are, and also it feels really satisfying when you stab someone.\n\nOn the other hand, the game also has some flaws, one of them is the online multiplayer, it is seriously lacking in features and is very unstable, I kept being disconnected from matches, and I have experienced serious lag during several online matches. You can’t even properly communicate with your opponent because the chat can’t handle longer messages.\n\nAs I have said before, the single-player consists of 17 AI opponents, which is great but the same can’t be said about the level variety, there is only 3 or 4 different levels which are re-used during the 17 battles in the single-player. I really wish that there was more variety in level design, maybe we’ll get them in later updates.\n\nNonetheless, If you enjoy playing games with your friends then this game is for you but If you don’t like the local multiplayer I would still recommend sure the game isn’t very long, but the multiplayer is still there, it might be a bit lackluster but who knows maybe the devs will add some new features to the online multiplayer.","March 9, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Be prepared to engage in very fast-paced swordplay, with friends of course.\n\nThe objective in Nidhogg is very simple: reach the end of the map on the enemy's side before he/she can reach your end of the map. Upon reaching the end of the map, you're promptly eaten by an Alaskan Bullworm. No idea why, but that signals your victory. However, a lone enemy stands in the way, ready to commence fencing at any given moment. This is where the real fun in the game lies, the fighting. Well, that's basically what the game is, so there's a plus.\n\nThere are three stances that one can take whilst wielding a sword in Nidhogg: Low, mid, and high. If your opponent attacks you low, and your stance is low, then you block their attack. This applies to the other two stances as well. There's also a stance that you can take if you just hold your sword up high. This stance is only used to prepare for throwing the sword, which, when thrown, can be deflected if your opponent has a mid or high stance active. Once you're without a sword, you must revert to your fists, which don't always help out much. However, you can pick up a fallen sword.\n\nThe game has a very minimalistic style to it. The characters are very low-res, solid-color sprites. This is an interesting style for such a game and it does add to the fun a bit on a certain stage, the Cloud stage. Because of the game's style, it is very difficult to see where each character is on this map, which is both a good and bad thing! All that said, the game does have one massive flaw. That flaw being the complete lack of content. For a game that has been in development for several years, I would at least expect more than four maps. Four years and only four maps? Very disappointing.\n\nNidhogg, overall, is just an excellent game. Highly recommended if you have a friend to play it with!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz-9jQTaBKI","January 23, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It then took nearly three years for the game to be released, and it kind of slipped off my radar. Upon launching on Steam for $15, I was immediately taken aback at what seemed a steep price for what I considered to be a very simple and one dimensional game.\nI'm glad to say that I was wrong. While over a friend's house, an impromtu Nidhogg tournament broke out and three hours and many laughs later, we all went home to buy the game for ourselves.\nThe game contains a dark sense of humor, simplistic but stylish retro visuals, and extraordinarily tight controls. It is compatible with three out of four of the controllers I have tested with it, and it's online is stable. I would reccomend playing against human opponents as much as possible (preferably in a hotseat fashion as the reactions of your live opponent is part of the attraction), but the AI is perfectly servicable for practicing your fighting strategy, if maybe just a little cheap every now and then.\nFor $15, if you play games with your friends often, this is a very reasonable and frankly excellent purchase, and I don't think you'll regret it!","February 25, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Trust me. Get a few friends, a small party. This game is at its best when you have a crew of folks with you playing tournaments.\n\nIt's a very simple game that's damn near impossible to master, and every single match with a human opponent can offer more range of emotion than your average title simply from your own progress -- or loss of.\n\nIf you're only interested in single player, this game will SEVERELY disappoint at just four maps and very few modes.

There's a limited amount of things you can do and it's kind of beautiful how there are counters and weaknesses to everything you do. You can only do 4 actions, really. Attack, roll, throw sword or divekick. The most advanced move is you can press up and down to change the level of your fencing sword. And if you change the level of your sword into the level of your opponent's fencing sword, it disarms them. Maybe being the buttonmasher is an advantage? I haven't quite figured it out, but this is a game to play against any friend.\n\nThis is a 1v1 combat game. If you kill your opponent, you are allowed to move forward to pan the screen in your direciton. You must run your designated direction for a few rooms to 'win the match' and choose another level. When you kill your opponent they'll repeatedly spawn in front of you. A stalward guardian of your path to your victory.

A SNACKRIFICE AWAITS.\nThe question is, will it be you, or the other guy?\nNidhogg is ostensibly a fencing game. But this appraisal is kind of misleading; it's definitely a game that features fencing, and the fencing is both simple and intense in the way many early-era 2 player games were (like Swashbuckler and Championship Karate). But there are a number of things going on here that you wouldn't see anybody getting away with in a proper fencing match, and that's where things start getting interesting. Throwing swords, sweeping the leg, and jump kicking the other dude in the chest are among the other tricks the Yellow Swoardsman and Orange Swordsman have at their disposal.\nBut wait; the match isn't won when your enemy's body is at your feet. Victory is only achieved by reaching the end of the level, far past your nemesis' starting position. And you'll find several more of him waiting where the first one came from.\nSo it's like fencing, even when it contains things other than fencing. Nidhogg is a must-play for anyone with a friend to play with, or hell, train your cat extremely well and play it with him.","December 12, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

Its mechanics are specific to the human element, and are best seen in player versus player combat.  This game is best played with a friend on local co-op, and should really only be bought for that purpose.  Online multiplayer is good, but does not contain the same enjoyment as facing down your oppenent eye-to-eye.  Online mode can lag as well, which can be frustrating in such a skill-based game.\n\nSingle player is nothing special, and should be seen as something to do when you don't have someone to play with.  It has a very arcadey feel and relatively challenging, but is not a time consumer, and furthermore, not is fun or rewarding when playing against another human.\n\nIf you have a friend that is willing to play with you, you have to buy this game.  It is one of the greatest player versus player experiences on the PC.  If you are looking for a single player experience, you might want to stay away, as that is not what this game is meant for.\n\nAlthough the base price of $15 ($12 now for sale) seems expensive for a low-budget indie game with only one game mode, it is suprisingly worth it.  You will have more fun playing this with a friend than in any other game I can think of.","January 15, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game can easy for two players to play on one computer (for instance one player using w,a,s,d and another up, down, left, right). You can set up tournaments where players can battle in a series of battles determining the best player. Nidhogg includes has a single-player mode. In singleplayer you fight different computers in hope of getting the fastest time. One great feature is variants where you can customize the gameplay for a new experience. Variants include time limit, low gravity, turbo mode, slow mode, boomerang swords, and more. I would highly recomend this game for any group of two or more people.","August 8, 2014","true","128.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Any game based off of something in real life with extra stuff (i.e ripping arms off) and cost less is great in my book.\n\nNote: Get the game when its on Discount, the price is insane but you have to give the devs credit, if I'm not mistaken, 1 person  made the WHOLE game, and released it faster than expected.

Because this game is FUN AS HELL. Not since the arcade days of Joust, have I had such a good time playing a 1 vs 1 game like this.\n\nThe BEST thing about this game is the accessibility of it. The controls are literally your W,A,S,D directionals, and two keys for jumping, then attacking. There's a tiny bit more technique to it as well, but I am able to fire this game up and play it with just about any family member in minutes. It's also neat because either two people can play on one keyboard, or if you smell bad and don't want to be that close to someone, they can use a 360 controller while you rock the keyboard.\n\nThis game evokes laughter, screams of defeat and terror. It's seriously THAT fun. Nidhogg is an excellent game with a price tag that is a bit too steep to buy it at full price.\n\nWhat's worse is the fact that it's online multiplayer is still broken. I have owned this game for quite some time now and to this day, cannot start an online match.\n\nBut that's really my only gripe with the game. So get it!

It's combat is suprisingly deep for what it is and plays out gracefully against friends or against AI. The stages are also well designed and beautiful without a hypnotic soundtrack. However, despite being a pixel art game, Nidhogg is about as demanding as full HD 2D games such as Battleblock Theater. This wouldn't really be that big of issue, except for the fact that the game's logic is written in reference to frames instead of milliseconds meaning that if the framerate goes below 60 then the game will actually slow down which can be quite jarring. On the whole though, Nidhogg is a simple fighting game great for playing multiplayer or single player and I would reccomend it to anyone as soon as it goes on sale.

There are four maps in this game and they are all excellent. The BGM in the cloud is awesome! But the color of the background in clouds always makes my eyes feel dizzy. Hope the producer will update more different scenes for the players to play. Unicorn worm is my favorite thing in this game, coz that means VICTORY.\n(Hit: It’s more fun with friends.

It also allows to modify gameplay options to make gameplay even more varied.\n\nIt's best enjoyed by playing two players in the same screen, I have still to check the online mode.\n\nPersonal Experience: I once played this with an entire group of actual fencers. Although it obviously lacks the depth of real fencing, we had a real good time and felt the combat was actually compelling and similar to fencing. Except the victory part, of course, they are still puzzled by it.","December 28, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And really, it breaks my heart to have to tell people, "No, you're better off not buying this game" because it has some great features.\n\nThe game follows the simplistic pixel-art that quite some indie games have. Nevertheless it works and makes everything easy to overlook. The mechanics are simple. Using up and down, jump, roll and attack you fight another person who is equipped similarly. The music is amazing and strangely befitting, too. So, what makes me not recommend this game?\n\nLimited content. There are only a few maps, and while that's not all that bad this is a game that ought to draw most of its entertainment from online play. Fighting friends and strangers worldwide in a dark cave or an overgrown meadow. But no. Several months after release the practically broken netplay has not been fixed, and the lack of the developer communicating shows us there will be no fix soon, if ever.\n\nIt truly is a shame to see such a great, simple, addictive game go to waste by lack of action to fix something so trivial...","June 24, 2014","false","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You will be disappointed.\n\nI love looking for new games to play with friends, and I was ecstatic to see this finally released. The gameplay is fantastically unique: You fight past your opponent to run to their 'endzone.' Killing them is not always necessary; you can just run past them, but it'll usually get you killed. After all, combat is what the game was made for.\n\nWhen fencing, there are three different stances you can take (low, mid, high), which can be used for parrying, or, if swift enough, disarming. But if you get disarmed, you can still roll under your opponent, kick them off their feet, snap their neck, and take their sword. But then they respawn at the other end again! So here's where you just chuck your sword into their head and pick it up again as you run past.\n\nThis is one of very few games where I have wanted to practice different techniques, guards, and attacks. The depth of gameplay is great (Even if there are only four stages), and the idea is unique. The one downside is the online play, which, more often than not, gives players too much lag to even be playable.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this if you don't have friends to play with locally, but if you do, enjoy!","January 29, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's simply a side-scrolling game of tug-of-war with old-school inspiration and it delivers.

Now I don't have many hours played on my account, but I've played this game plenty on a friend's, and it really is an excellent game.\n\nIt's definitely a game of skill. No outside forces are going to impact whether or not you come out the victor, it's simply you against your opponent, and occasionally taking advantage of your surroundings. The swordplay is easy to get used to but hard to master, and when you snap the neck of an enemy that's on the ground, it's amazingly satisfying. The visuals are a retro style done right, and the music and sound effects make the game come alive. One of the best local multiplayer experiences I've ever had.\n\nHowever, connections with online multiplayer seem to be giving other people problems. (I don't have experience with this myself, as I've only played it locally) so if this is a turn-off for you, keep that in mind.\n\nIf the local multiplayer experience is enough to warrant the $15 for you, go for it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellabrad/recommended/94400/","hellabrad",""Meany Louse" Montrose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellabrad/","446 products in account","It took me a while to understand this game. It seemed clunky, weird, too based on random chance and the luck of finding an opening as I charged blindly forward. I didn't get what I was doing wrong. Then, on my third run through the wilds level, my opponent and I both disarmed one another simultaneously. I didn't have a weapon, and neither did he. So I did what seemed sane: I tried to stab him anyways. And we started boxing. Then he punched me backwards into the crop fields, where I had seen my weapon land. Frantically, I searched the stalks of wheat, looking for the familiar silver glint of my weapon. Behind me, he leapt into the air, ready to land upon me where I lay and smash my face into the dirt that would be my unceremonius grave. And at the last possible moment, my hand met the cold steel of my blade, and I spun, holding my weapon high —\n\nHe landed squarely on the tip of sword, violently impaled by his own momentum. And in that moment, I understood. This game was exactly as frantic, exactly as crazy and snap-reflex-based as a real fencing match, between real swordsmen. The controls might not have the finesse of an actual human arm holding an epee, but the mechanics, the pacing; these are pitch-perfect, and evoke the same thrilling adrenaline rush that whipping an actual rapier around in a clumsy attempt at defense gave me in my teenage fencing lessons (my local community center offered some pretty rad summer programs). The key is to treat combat in Nidhogg with the same sort of gravity you would in real life. Take small, inching steps toward your enemy. Change stances freely, and attack opportunistically, when given a wide opening. And only throw your sword at the oppenent when it's the only move you've got left.\n\nIt's possible to beat Nidhogg without really knowing how to play it. The game is pretty forgiving, and you have an unlimited number of attempts for each stage, meaning you can essentially grind your way towards victory if you're really determined. But it's immensely satisfying to clear a level without losing a life by trouncing the bevy of foes that stand in your way one-by-one. So practice up, and prove you've got what it takes to be a winner.","January 15, 2014","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It seemed clunky, weird, too based on random chance and the luck of finding an opening as I charged blindly forward. I didn't get what I was doing wrong. Then, on my third run through the wilds level, my opponent and I both disarmed one another simultaneously. I didn't have a weapon, and neither did he. So I did what seemed sane: I tried to stab him anyways. And we started boxing. Then he punched me backwards into the crop fields, where I had seen my weapon land. Frantically, I searched the stalks of wheat, looking for the familiar silver glint of my weapon. Behind me, he leapt into the air, ready to land upon me where I lay and smash my face into the dirt that would be my unceremonius grave. And at the last possible moment, my hand met the cold steel of my blade, and I spun, holding my weapon high —\n\nHe landed squarely on the tip of sword, violently impaled by his own momentum. And in that moment, I understood. This game was exactly as frantic, exactly as crazy and snap-reflex-based as a real fencing match, between real swordsmen. The controls might not have the finesse of an actual human arm holding an epee, but the mechanics, the pacing; these are pitch-perfect, and evoke the same thrilling adrenaline rush that whipping an actual rapier around in a clumsy attempt at defense gave me in my teenage fencing lessons (my local community center offered some pretty rad summer programs). The key is to treat combat in Nidhogg with the same sort of gravity you would in real life. Take small, inching steps toward your enemy. Change stances freely, and attack opportunistically, when given a wide opening. And only throw your sword at the oppenent when it's the only move you've got left.\n\nIt's possible to beat Nidhogg without really knowing how to play it. The game is pretty forgiving, and you have an unlimited number of attempts for each stage, meaning you can essentially grind your way towards victory if you're really determined. But it's immensely satisfying to clear a level without losing a life by trouncing the bevy of foes that stand in your way one-by-one. So practice up, and prove you've got what it takes to be a winner.","January 15, 2014","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

You will be disappointed.\n\nI love looking for new games to play with friends, and I was ecstatic to see this finally released. The gameplay is fantastically unique: You fight past your opponent to run to their 'endzone.' Killing them is not always necessary; you can just run past them, but it'll usually get you killed. After all, combat is what the game was made for.\n\nWhen fencing, there are three different stances you can take (low, mid, high), which can be used for parrying, or, if swift enough, disarming. But if you get disarmed, you can still roll under your opponent, kick them off their feet, snap their neck, and take their sword. But then they respawn at the other end again! So here's where you just chuck your sword into their head and pick it up again as you run past.\n\nThis is one of very few games where I have wanted to practice different techniques, guards, and attacks. The depth of gameplay is great (Even if there are only four stages), and the idea is unique. The one downside is the online play, which, more often than not, gives players too much lag to even be playable.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this if you don't have friends to play with locally, but if you do, enjoy!","January 29, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now I don't have many hours played on my account, but I've played this game plenty on a friend's, and it really is an excellent game.\n\nIt's definitely a game of skill. No outside forces are going to impact whether or not you come out the victor, it's simply you against your opponent, and occasionally taking advantage of your surroundings. The swordplay is easy to get used to but hard to master, and when you snap the neck of an enemy that's on the ground, it's amazingly satisfying. The visuals are a retro style done right, and the music and sound effects make the game come alive. One of the best local multiplayer experiences I've ever had.\n\nHowever, connections with online multiplayer seem to be giving other people problems. (I don't have experience with this myself, as I've only played it locally) so if this is a turn-off for you, keep that in mind.\n\nIf the local multiplayer experience is enough to warrant the $15 for you, go for it.

The singleplayer is fine, but the meat and potatoes of this game is when you're facing a human opponent either online or locally.  The online can use a bit of work because some matches can be pretty laggy.  However, when you do get in to a match and everything works, it really works.  Still, the netcode needs improvement and I hope the fixes for that come sooner rather than later.\n\nThere's a lot of hidden depth to the gameplay as well.  You have to decide when it's right to let yourself die in order to respawn in front of your opponent before they make it to the next screen.  When is it the right time to make a break for it to get to the next screen?  When you decide to let yourself die in order to respawn as a barrier for your opponent, is there is even enough time for you to respawn in front of them?  Should I hold on to my sword, or should throw it and make a run for it hoping it distracts the opponent? These are some of the thoughts that will constantly be running through your head while playing this game and it's made all the more intense when facing off against a human opponent.\n\nI also really dig the old-school Atari 2600-esque look of the game.  The use of colours makes the levels look really nice and I just like the simplicity of it.  The super colourful neon blood is also prety great!\n\nThe soundtrack to the game is also fantastic!  Each of the 4 levels in the game has a unique song that plays in the background and it makes the one on one battle so much more enjoyable.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a lot of local and online (when it's properly working 100% of the time) MP fun!","January 14, 2014","true","9.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Every offense has its countering defensive stance, every defense has an offensive move to get around it, and none of them require any more or less effort than the other, making it a simple game of preparation, reflexes, and psychology; the true essence of a fighting game.\n\nThe graphics could be described as 'minimal', or it could be described as 'clear'. I choose to view it the latter way. All necessary information is communicated in an understandable fashion without sacrificing artistic integrity. Daedelus' soundtrack provides an excellent support to the atmosphere of the game and its individual levels, from the intense and aggressive Wilds, to the tense and deliberate Mines, and the quick and nimble Clouds.\n\nNidhogg's design is flawless in nearly every aspect, the only regrets being the lack of content. But why should you care about that, when you can throw a sword at someone to force them to block high, roll underneath them while grabbing a sword, then stab them in the back in a series of grand maneuvers that will make you feel like a god among men?","January 21, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Even with the people complaining about lag in the forums, I played it with my friend and had no problems at all. And being a huge fencing fan, I think this game is perfect in the format it was made. You really need to approach the fight strategically or you'll get your derrière sistematically handed to you. The game is one hit kill when armed with sword and when disarmed if your opponent strikes you on the ground he'll snap your neck and kill you, but this is just a mean to an end, since your main goal ain't to kill your opponent but to get to the last screen you need to push to be devoured by the mythical serpent Nidhogg, hence the name of the game, and to do that you need to kill you enemy and  move forward through each screen, being lead to a fence-fueled tug of war. And the graphics, soundtrack and sound effects match the game perfectly and until now I didn't experienced any major flaws on the gameplay of the game which is fluid and easy to get the hang. The single-player can be fun enough, but the game really shines in the multiplayer, the local versus can make for a really neat party game.

There's not much singleplayer content other than fighting a line of swordmen with the difficulty increase per time you defeat the next in the row. The multiplayer seems to have a bit delay for now, other than that it's great fun killing your enemy. Your goal is to get to the right of the level and enter the next screen, while your enemy have to get to the left side of the screen. You are only able to move to the next scene when  you have the GO sign in the opposite corner of yourself, It's a tough process and can take a good amount of time if you're playing against a mighty fencer.\n\nThere are various ways to kill and disarm your enemy or yourself :3\nYou have 5 different ways to hold your sword, with different range depending on you're trying to target the enemies feet or head. The higher you aim, the longer range. The lower you aim, the shorter range.\nWhen holding the sword in the upper position, you'll be able to throw it (also when jumping in midair), hopefully killing your enemy or die trying...\nWhen you jump, you're able to strike downward, this is a great ability if you've lost your sword and still want to go offensive on your enemy. You can also roll and kick when approaching the player if his sword is in a high position, else you'll just die horribly by getting stacked in the chest or face.\n\nThe sound effects makes it quite enjoyable to stick your sword through the chest of someone else and keeping it inside, making it "bleed"  more and enemy scream even longer is just very satisfying.\n\nThe different set of levels gives the player a good amount of space to use his different moves and feature lots of movement to make the scenes more alive, the game does have music but it's quite ambient and might not get noticed because of the  screams coming from either you or your enemy.\n\n.:CONCLUSION:.\nIt's really good fun and plays great, the price point might be a bit high but there's online multiplayer which makes the price acceptable in my opinion. There's not much content for the single-player type and the online multi-player can be slighty laggy at times but based on being very unique, play very smooth and the gameplay have great combat, I would very much recommend this game.","January 13, 2014","true","4.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It was an absolutely fantastic performance.\n\nOh, I absolutely love the funktionality in Nidhogg! The controls are hard at first but after a while they flow so easily. Sword fighting for me has never been this fun in any game I've ever played before. This is better than Minecraft PVP in my opinion. The background & asthetics flow right along with the duel perfectly! I absolutely love it. I fell kind of addicted now!\n\nI've never seen a fighting style game quite like tNidhogghis. It's a little bit like Capcom style but with more realistic machanics and more appealing. I didn't say realistic graphics though, it's really fun in an Atari kind of way while keeping all it's own style. There is a lot of background detail. I say detail even though it's pixel art. It's EXTREME pixel art. It's really well designed, for my tastes anyway.\n\nA couple cons are that there aren't that many maps, only four. Another one is that there are not as many offence forms as I think there could be while still keeping it simple. All in all, it's a great game.

It can't really be described, other than fast paced fencing-martial arts-divekicking-combat - oh yea, and you get eaten by a huge wyrm at the end of every level to top it all off.\n\nThe combat system is unique, in that there is surprising depth for such a seemly short (and by short, I mean a ton of deaths every level. This game isn't exactly easy) single player game. Developing your own style really feels like you own it, and every time you die, you don't feel cheated.\n\nMultiplayer is where this game really shines, and it's really meant to be played against a human opponent, whether someone online or someone sitting beside you. The CPU opponents put up a great fight though, and it's perfect for developing your own style of play before you face off with a friend.\n\nThe price is slightly high, for what this game is, but if you feel like it's something you might enjoy, I would say possibly wait for a sale if you are strapped for cash.\n\nThat being said, I do not regret my purchase.

The object of the game is to reach the other side of the map, to which there are seven sections; the only thing stopping you is your little set of legs and your adversary. There is a surprising amount of depth to this one on one side scroller, despite the only controls being jump, attack and the directions. You can hold your sword in three positions: high, medium, or low. Where you hold the sword dictates what attacks you will block.\n\nAll throughout you will have to make split-second decisions, and those decisions are what make the game so addicting. At times, you will be convinced that you have felled the enemy, only to be rolled into and killed. These are the defining moments of Nidhogg; while your jaw is on the floor from the surprise, your stinker of a roommate hoofs it to the goal.","August 24, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It might be stupidly simple, or elegantly uncomplex, depending on how you feel about the gameplay. It might be the greatest fighting game ever made, or an overpriced hipster art project, depending on if you like the damn thing or not. In development since 2011, this side-scrolling two-player fighting game where you duel with swords, kicks, runs, jumps and fistfights has been turning heads. Either towards it, attracted to the bright Atari-style low-fi graphics and immediately comprehensible combat, or away from it in disgust because… reasons.\n\nIt’s an incredible fast paced game when both players (or the player vs A.I.) are reckless. Pixel blood flows down the walls as each fighter tries to get past the other. If you make it, you move to the next screen and your opponent is placed in front of you once more. It’s a tug of war, in a sense. The victor not decided by who kills who the most, but by whichever side reaches their goal first: a giant flying worm on either end of the level. If you can get eaten by the Nidhogg, you have proven your prowess in combat.\n\nBut it can also be a slow, methodical and beautiful game of lethal Chess.","September 22, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I won it in a giveaway, and now here I am. The game fulfills a lot of promises, for me.

It's EXTREME pixel art. It's really well designed, for my tastes anyway.\n\nA couple cons are that there aren't that many maps, only four. Another one is that there are not as many offence forms as I think there could be while still keeping it simple. All in all, it's a great game. I rate it four & a half out of five stars.","December 18, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not much content, graphics simple yet fitting, laggy multiplayer, a seemingly boring soundtrack, and pretty decent combat. Fifteen dollars is not worth the lack of content this game provides, unless you have friends who live in your house, as tournaments are only local. The lack of maps is another downside to this game, but can be overlooked, as the maps included do have noticable differences. Swordplay is interesting, and takes some work to master. Matchmaking turns out to be horrendous unless you have friends to play with, as the matchmaking takes ten minutes to find a match, but when you do it is enjoyable. The gameplay provided is minimal, but what is provided is enjoyable. Overall, this title is not one for those who don't wish to put the work in to learn to master the excellent swordplay presented to them, but fifteen dollars is too much, this game is worth five or less.\n\nIf however you do decide to purchase this game, watch the first duel in this video, as it shows all the tricks needed to suceed in Nidhogg\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWMlU8eKOsg","April 26, 2015","true","7.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are a lot of options there to create a strategy. You can fight your opponent with rapier or goes unarmed, you can thrust, punch, parry, disarm opponent, throwing weapon, do a sweep attack, and even do a dive kick. Running away also a one good strategy here in Nidhogg for you to consider as the objective is to reach the goal not to defeat the opponent until he/she run out of life.\n\nNidhogg's concept is good and the video that show is even help make it look very interesting.\n\nAnyway, one big flaw of Nighogg is a lacks of contents, especially in a lacks of solid single player content. The only thing you will find in a single player mode is a series of 16 AI opponents that not really different in terms of difficulty, pretty much the same. There are only 4 stages in the game as you can see in the video. No unloackable contents pretty much make this game suffer a scarceness of solid contents and no replay value.\n\nIt is true that the core design of the game is quite interesting. I am able to enjoy a single player mode to some extent but that's that. Once I beat the single player mode I went to try multiplayer mode with someone, unfortunately online matchmaking show that no one playing Nidhogg online and none of my fried owned this game as well.\n\nI guess the game could deliver a better experience if you has a friend to play together offline or online but for a gamer who focus on single player experience I recommend you to avoid Nidhogg.

The multiplayer is consistently laggy and it always seems to take at least a few minutes to get into a match - if finding a game wasn't arduous enough, attempting to transfer your SP tactics to MP is nigh impossible since you'll find the controls simply aren't responsive enough. Nidhogg absolutely requires you to have quick reactions and MP makes this impossible.\n\nThe Tournament mode is useless without at least two other experienced players able to use your computer (since it's local MP) and if you were looking to practice against the AI then enjoy having to play through the entire game just to get to a point you feel is difficult enough because you can't skip levels.\n\nOh, and the super bright cloud level is absolutely horrible to look at, I personally can barely see anything. I wonder how exactly the development time on this game was spent when there are such obvious flaws (why would you choose a bright background when the player is bright yellow and the sword is white?)\n\nI do honestly like the gameplay but I can't in all good conscience recommend this game to anyone looking for a competitive multiplayer experience. Some cool stuff can happen but on average, Nidhogg will leave you simultaneously annoyed but wanting to play more since it could get better.","January 27, 2014","false","5.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

There are a lot of options there to create a strategy. You can fight your opponent with rapier or goes unarmed, you can thrust, punch, parry, disarm opponent, throwing weapon, do a sweep attack, and even do a dive kick. Running away also a one good strategy here in Nidhogg for you to consider as the objective is to reach the goal not to defeat the opponent until he/she run out of life.\n\nNidhogg's concept is good and the video that show is even help make it look very interesting.\n\nAnyway, one big flaw of Nighogg is a lacks of contents, especially in a lacks of solid single player content. The only thing you will find in a single player mode is a series of 16 AI opponents that not really different in terms of difficulty, pretty much the same. There are only 4 stages in the game as you can see in the video. No unloackable contents pretty much make this game suffer a scarceness of solid contents and no replay value.\n\nIt is true that the core design of the game is quite interesting. I am able to enjoy a single player mode to some extent but that's that. Once I beat the single player mode I went to try multiplayer mode with someone, unfortunately online matchmaking show that no one playing Nidhogg online and none of my fried owned this game as well.\n\nI guess the game could deliver a better experience if you has a friend to play together offline or online but for a gamer who focus on single player experience I recommend you to avoid Nidhogg. Even with a 66% discount for this game is seem a little pricy to me after I bought it.","June 24, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No, really. There's a single player mode, but it's not where the game shines. The AI is unpolished, as it occasionally goes dumb and lets you mow it down. Far better is beating a friend in person.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abiscuit/recommended/94400/","abiscuit","<TVB>abiscuit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abiscuit/","256 products in account","Nidhogg is absurdly fun.  The combat is similar to Divekick with its simple controls and surprising amount of depth in combat.  Once you kill your opponent you'll only have a few seconds to get as far as you can before you respawn.  Then you must decide if you're gonna take down your opponent again or try to run past him and go for the goal Randy Moss style.\n\nNidhogg is not without its issues though.  There's nothing for PC specific options aside from volume sliders and the online play has a few issues which could potentially be a dealbreaker.\n\nCreating a lobby at first was an exercise in frustration.  The invite friends list is not alphabatized which isn't a huge deal if you don't have many Steam friends, but I have 200+ and it added extra time to what should be a simple process.  Once you invite someone the other person doesn't get a Steam notification, they have to hit "Join Game" from Steam friends.  There's no indication that you have to do this either.  Once you have this all figured out it works, but come on.  These are basic menu functions in any online game.\n\nIn the games I played with my friend the host had a huge advantage because of latency, we had to swap hosting every few rounds to make it fair.  If you can play locally then you won't have to deal with this.  It's a perfect couch game if you are thinking of a Steambox solution.\n\nDespite my complaints about the game I've really enjoyed it so far, though with the issues I've mentioned above it's a little hard to recommend at full price.  Buy it on sale for sure.\n\nTL;DR version:  Buy if you have a friend to play with and can deal with a few online issues.\n\nEDIT\n\n1/14/2014 - The invite system works with Steam properly now, but the friends list in game is still not in alphabetical order.","January 13, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No, really. There's a single player mode, but it's not where the game shines. The AI is unpolished, as it occasionally goes dumb and lets you mow it down. Far better is beating a friend in person.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abiscuit/recommended/94400/","abiscuit","<TVB>abiscuit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abiscuit/","256 products in account","Nidhogg is absurdly fun.  The combat is similar to Divekick with its simple controls and surprising amount of depth in combat.  Once you kill your opponent you'll only have a few seconds to get as far as you can before you respawn.  Then you must decide if you're gonna take down your opponent again or try to run past him and go for the goal Randy Moss style.\n\nNidhogg is not without its issues though.  There's nothing for PC specific options aside from volume sliders and the online play has a few issues which could potentially be a dealbreaker.\n\nCreating a lobby at first was an exercise in frustration.  The invite friends list is not alphabatized which isn't a huge deal if you don't have many Steam friends, but I have 200+ and it added extra time to what should be a simple process.  Once you invite someone the other person doesn't get a Steam notification, they have to hit "Join Game" from Steam friends.  There's no indication that you have to do this either.  Once you have this all figured out it works, but come on.  These are basic menu functions in any online game.\n\nIn the games I played with my friend the host had a huge advantage because of latency, we had to swap hosting every few rounds to make it fair.  If you can play locally then you won't have to deal with this.  It's a perfect couch game if you are thinking of a Steambox solution.\n\nDespite my complaints about the game I've really enjoyed it so far, though with the issues I've mentioned above it's a little hard to recommend at full price.  Buy it on sale for sure.\n\nTL;DR version:  Buy if you have a friend to play with and can deal with a few online issues.\n\nEDIT\n\n1/14/2014 - The invite system works with Steam properly now, but the friends list in game is still not in alphabetical order.","January 13, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The worst part about that, is that it is quite a good game.\nThe game is funny to play with friend for a time, graphics and music are very well made.\n\nBut first, the game looks extremely aggressive, there is always a flickering element in any moment of the game and it flickers quite fast too, graphics are gory and depict many things not nice to watch.\nSecond thing, the content is very low, 4 maps, you can't change players colours.\nThird thing, the AI is very badly done, it is not funny at all to play single player.\nAnother thing I need to add, the game sometimes doesn't care if you modify your control setup and sometimes doesn't register some of your inputs, playing this game is kinda playing lotery: you know it can be nice but if you try too much it will most certainly brings more pain than pleasure.\nLast thing online mutiplayer is very crappy.\n\nTo conclude, this game is good so if you want to take it consider only for local battles with friends and only a few times.\n\nFor people who are willing to rate this review down, I am willing to hear why.","February 14","false","15.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/94400/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Nidhogg is a very simplistic representation of fencing where the goal is to reach the opponent's start point and get eaten by some giant creature presumably called the Nidhogg. The gameplay has a bit of a tug-of-war feel to it as dead players respawn a bit further back from where they were slain meaning you have to continuously battle all the way to the end without failing to win. Combat consists of moving your blade up/down, thrusting, rolling, throwing the blade, and jump kicks, combinations of which can be used to confuse and disable your opponent, setting them up for the kill. Once you kill an opponent, you gain the right of way and place him on the defensive, meaning that if you were to jump over him and continue towards his start, he would have to pursue you or allow himself to be scrolled off and respawn in front of you.\n\nDue to the overall simplicity of the game and small number of levels, it seems to suit itself more towards multiplayer than single player which is unfortunate because the multiplayer can get downright unplayable due to latency causing your inputs to get ignored or delayed. Additionally the controls can be awkward when shifting between stances not to mention you risk throwing your sword when shifting to stab high from a mid-stance. I originally had a bit more positive of a review for this game but after re-playing it I decided to drop my recommendation since the content is really lacking and not worth the base price (or really even the sale price).","July 28, 2015","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/revdb/recommended/94400/","revdb","Sean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/revdb/","175 products in account","This game is the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIt's a fast-paced two-player dueling game. You can fence madly, cartwheel away, throw your rapier, somersault through the air, snatch a rapier off the ground and skewer your opponent through the guts, you can rush unarmed at your opponent only to roll beneath his drawn rapier at the last moment, trip him with  a sweep of the leg, tear his heart out, grab his rapier and keep running. You can pull off all kinds of insane stunts, and I can't help but laugh every time. This gameplay is accompanied by an equally frenzied soundtrack and trippy neon graphics. The great art direction and style of this game is undeniable.\n\nMultiplayer is online and local, and there is also a singleplayer mode where you fight a computer opponent. It's not as fun as desperately outsmarting a human opponent. The online multiplayer introduces a ton of lag and causes many maneuvers to be impossible to pull off. That said, I've been mainly playing online opponents (haven't had the chance to play local yet), and it's been some of the most exhilarating multiplayer gameplay I've experienced, despite the lag.\n\nThere aren't many games where you can do a somersault, but this is one of them. It feels great.\n\nOn the downside, there are only 4 stages. What you'll get out of this game will depend on how much you put into it and on the people you play against. Best suited for playing with friends, two controllers and a tv.","January 19, 2014","true","23.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
