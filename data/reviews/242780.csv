When you click on something, a small radial menu shows up of things you can do with the object, and its context sensitive. You can look at it, use it or grab it, or use your currently equipped inventory item on it. The graphical inventory is on the right side of the screen, and you can not only equip an object, you can also look at it, use it, or combine several objects together.\n\nIt definitely has a very mature comic-book feel to it. The cutscenes are delivered in the standard "motion comic" style, with minimal animation - mostly to highlight the important aspects of the scene. The actual gameplay has full cel-shaded environments and characters, complete with mouth movements to accompany the voice acting. The music is also wonderfully done and definitely sets the mood for each scene. The best thing I can say about it is that it didn't get in the way, which is the point for a game like this. It highlights the atmosphere appropriately.\n\nCognition: An Erica Reed Thriller may have some clumsy animation, some robotic faces and the occasional instance where the tech and the art don’t quite gel, but it is a hugely competent adventure game in every other regard. One that provides stimulating puzzle mechanics that make perfect sense within its world, and a compelling story that quickly gains momentum and keeps it up until it culminates in a thrilling, memorable finale. That’s categorically what you want from the genre.","January 29, 2014","true","17.5"," 84 of 91 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","84","91","0","2"

Was not sure i was really going to enjoy it, but quickly found myself liking the game.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty good. I really liked the characters, especially the main one, which is pretty important in a game.The game is styled like a comic\n\nI found myself getting stumped A LOT. Almost felt like I had to actually be an FBI agent to crack the case. lol. The game does no hold your hand, and what you should do next is not always obvious. The game has a tip system, but it lets those who want to figure things out on their own, do so. The cases are pretty lengthy, more so if you get stuck a lot, like me. The story has small alternate paths. They don't change the story too much, but it's nice to have the small alternate choices\n\nSmall negative is that sometimes you have to travel back and forth to the same spots several times in a row, and it gets a bit annoying. Like in the first episode I recall having to go to the antique store, then back to the station, then back to the antique store, then back to the station again.\n\nThis game definitely might be flying under a lot of people's radar.

If the mastermind of Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers would make such an appraisal, why would you even care about reading my own opinion? Well, maybe you have never heard of Jane Jensen. You have never played Gabriel Knight. You may have never even played a Point-and-Click Adventure at all. Go ahead, read further.\n\nYou will find yourself taking the role of Erica Reed, a Boston FBI Special Agent, accompanied by her partner John McCoy. Right after the start they are rushing to a cemetery in order to rescue Erica’s brother Scott, who is being held captive by a psychopath called "The Cain Killer". He is known for gruesome murders involving siblings who get tortured with devices you would only expect to see in a Saw movie. Erica owns a special power, the cognition, that only she and her partner John know about. Explained simply: She sees what others did in the past, trying to use this to her own advantage. Right now you, the player, will make her use of it to get into the crypt where Scott is being held. If you read the Official Description carefully, you will already know how this is going to end..\n\n3 Years Later..\nErica spent the last 3 years trying to find the man who did this to her brother. Having not found him and losing control of her life she is forced to close the Cain Case and move on. But soon after she begins to investigate the next murder, she finds clues - left for her. Clues pointing out that whoever killed that person knew about Erica’s "special gift". Is it the Cain Killer again? A new serial killer? And why would he know about Erica’s Cognition Ability? With the help of Rose, the owner of an antique shop, medium and expert for psychic abilities, and her Partner John, Erica tries to solve this puzzle in the four acts of Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller.\n\nUse your mouse to click, Erica moves, doubleclick and she runs. Press Space to highlight Objects to interact with. Congratulations, you just learned the basic controls. Some objects can be used, others can even be combined in your inventory. This is the bread and butter of Adventure Games but learning to use this efficiently will save time, time you will need to solve some of the puzzles this game has to offer. I had a tough time with some of them but if you get stuck there is a really nice hint system. This games story is amazing and it knows how to keep you engaged if you get stuck. Ericas special power, the cognition, is key for nearly every problem you will get confronted with. It requires some trial and error but it adds possibilities other games simply can’t offer. Your power will evolve while progressing, forcing you to rethink situations, finding new ways to solve puzzles.\n\nThe overall setting is dark and stylish, combined with cutscenes that appear in nicely drawn comicstrips. I must admit that I encountered some bugs while playing like mouths that looked like broken boxes. This is nothing that breaks the game but tends to look a bit funny sometimes. What keeps you really entertained instead is the amazing soundtrack which all of you should give a listen even after finishing Cognition. Whether your heart needs pumping or your soul cries for relaxation, this games music makes sure that things start to get emotional. Believe me.\n\nBig Text, Quick Facts:\nPro:\nAn intriguing, dark and mature story with an exceptional plot.\nInteresting main protagonist..\n..and many antagonists\nDark graphics with comic looks\nVeterans AND Newbies will quickly get used to controls and mechanics\nFresh take on problem solving with Ericas Special Powers\nRewarding puzzles\nNice hint system\nAmazing soundtrackCon:\nComic Look (listed as pro but not everybody likes that kind of style)\nPuzzles might get tough sometimes, literally forcing you to use the hint system\nGraphical bugs\nAt some points I simply felt overwhelmed with where to go or start\nToo hard for kids eyes and ears\nSummary:\nIf you haven’t shut your mouth with shaking hands, asking how all of this could have happened, you haven’t played Cognition yet. Be prepared for a clever, dark and brutal thriller that plays with emotions - but brace yourself for some tough puzzles that might discourage you at first sight. Do not let this happen. Use your Hint System if it gets to hard and enjoy the plot.\n\nThere is something I have to add for those of you still hesitating. I haven`t played Gabriel Knight or any game connected with Jane Jensen before either, so my praising words should be an assurance for all of you.\n\n8,5 / 10\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews","June 4, 2015","true","19.2"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","34","38","2","7"

One of the best stories in a video game I've played. Intriguing yet disturbing, and full of tense moments. The closest analog I can think of are the Ace Attorney/Phoenix Wright games. Now imagine those games without the court cases. Now add in much deeper investigation scenes accompanied by extremely cool "cognition"  techniques, and you basically have Cognition.\n\nI can not emphasize enough how good the story is. Big budget $60 games struggle to achieve anything close to this. The characters have real emotions and real backstories, and the player will feel for them. Some characters make me want to punch them in the face, others make me tear up inside. Its these bonds that really make the player attached to Erica and her situation.\n\nThe story really takes off due to the tense moments. Although all games have tense moments, Cognition handles these so much better. The intensity never lets up. Just when the tense scene seems to be ending, something even crazier springs up. Best of all, Cognition is not afraid to have harmful consequences. In other games, I am relatively calm even in tense moments because I know everything will be fine once I complete the scene. Not so in this game. Even if everything is executed correctly, key characters will die, gruesome imagery will haunt the player and the sanity of the player will be repeatedly questioned. All in all, a must play and a must buy.\n\n+ Incredible story\n+ Engaging characters with personable backstories\n+ Mood appropriate music\n+ Innovative "cognition" mechanics\n+ Vivid imagery\n+ Intelligent puzzles that are never too vague\n\n- Minor graphical glitches","September 30, 2013","true","18.6"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","29","30","0","0"

It’s easy to sell this concept, harder to actually pull it off. Cognition luckily manages to do that, although not without problems.\n\nLong version:Psychic cops and serial killers are always a good mix in the hand of capable writers, and Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is a nice example of that. It follows the struggles of the titular FBI agent, who needs to tackle not one, but four different murderers preying on the streets of Boston.\nHer story is structured like a television miniseries with four self-contained episodes. Arguably, the first two ones are the best as they remain close to the concept of being about the investigations, while the third episode is just a huge plot dump constrained into a single location, and the fourth hastily ties everything together using a set of rather tired clichés (including the classic ‘you are suspended!’ one).\n\nStill, the plotting is spectacular; each episode has endings that would make you grip the edge of your chair if they wouldn’t also feature the best, most complex puzzles, with perfect music to boot. The developers really knew how to reward patience.\nAs for the rest of the game, Cognition is a fairly standard point ‘n’ click (with an uncomfortable interface) that adds cognitive powers on top of the usual item manipulation. The use of these powers is not really consistent; there’s one that you invoke maybe three times in the entire story, even though you spend half an hour acquiring it.\n\nGraphics aren’t too spectacular: the backgrounds look good, but the characters are weird and glitchy. The audio is a lot better with a memorable soundtrack, and all main actors do an astounding job playing their (fairly stereotypical) role. It really helps getting immersed in the game, which is always great for thrillers like this.","October 1, 2015","true","19.2"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","25","27","0","3"

Its strongest part would be the artwork cinematics, along with a quite interesting storytelling and a good soundtrack. The gameplay is fairly comfortable, the riddles mix well with the overall plot and the voice acting is generally ok, if not falling short in some parts. The game's low point would definitely be the graphics: the characters' skin has a weird shine on it, while movement is unnatural and glitchy. Overall, I hesitantly recommend it, if you don't think the glitchy graphics would ruin your experience. It is a shame however, that it was not built around its strongest point which is its art style.","November 26, 2013","true","17.0"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

Great work, cool plot twists. Characters are also well described, I loved Erica from the very beginning with all her flaws, fears, doubts. She's a very strong character, but at the same time someone you can relate with. Tridimensional. Puzzles are interesting, not very hard to crack but not super easy either, you'll probably get stuck a couple of times (at least it happened to me, and I loved it, getting stuck and having to think it's a big chunk of what an adventure game is about, for me).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/242780/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","Review of all 4 episodes\n\nI was ambivalent about recommending this game. It's in dire need of editing (both in the story and in the gaming elements) and full of technical problems. It's almost reaching the "so bad it's good" end of the spectrum. And yet it's also fun and beautiful and original. I'm giving it a yes because I'm a sucker for lovable trainwrecks, but only if you buy it heavily discounted. Because while I'm all for supporting devs that create a project of love (which this game clearly is), for that asking price I also want a polished experience (which this game CLEARLY isn't).\n\nHere's a rundown of what to expect:\n\n* A very convoluted story of the crime/supernatural B-movie variety, that tries its damnedest to twist whenever a twist is possible, and also when it's not. It often makes no narrative sense, yet it has moments when it's surprisingly gripping. I also appreciate the bleak and mature atmosphere it tries to convey. Treat it like a paperback novel, one that's not winning any awards, yet is fun if you don't take it too seriously.\n\n* Characters so weird that they're occasionally interesting, with inexplicable/over the top motivations, often completely unlikable (which makes them occasionally very likeable - which, again, is weird).\n\n* Puzzles covering the whole range from the very original, refreshing, interesting and satisfying to the "so obvious it's funny" and "so unnecessarily complicated and counterintuitive it's clear someone was trying too hard". Add to that some mind-numbingly boring fetch quests, a bunch of questionable QTEs of the "die 5 times in order to figure the puzzle out" variety and a later added "trust" system that completely undermines any meaningul storytelling coherence, and you can officially say this game has it all. Yes, that was sarcasm. Or not, your mileage may vary.\n\n* An honest if somehow flawed effort at gameplay progression and variety from episode to episode. Every chapter introduces new gameplay and puzzle elements, that for the most parts add to the game. Though again, when you try to do everything, chance are few you'll get anything right. Often you're just left baffled at why oh why no one told these devs that not EVERY idea they come up with needs to be implemented in one single game.\n\n* Gorgeous comic-book visuals, at least while nothing is moving. Once a character starts to walk though, we verge on "so bad it's good" territory.\n\n* Great soundtrack, good sound design overall, very hit and miss (mostly miss) voice acting.\n\n* Poor, though not horrible, UI.\n\n* A very mediocre hint system that tries not to ruin immersion yet often lets you down (especially when later on the story becomes so confusing you don't have a clue what you're doing next).\n\nMost importantly, you should be aware to expect:\n\n* Glitches. Oh the glitches. Hilarious dancing characters, persistent floating objects, clipping, dialog skips, dialog repetitions, and so on and so forth. Also: Occasional crashes. Overall: General technical incompetence. This is again one of the areas where you've got it all, from utter frustration to incredible "so bad it's epic" laughs. If it's any consolation, most of the glitches and bugs are not game breaking (though you may need to be prepared for the occasional restart from the latest save point).\n\nSo after all this, why did I click yes? Because this game has moments of sheer brilliance. Even if they are drowning in a sea of near misses, complete disasters and epic fails. It tries really really hard to include everything and your dog, and in the end it succeeds in very little. It's very often like watching a trainwreck. And yet those moments of brilliance in it are geniunely fun to play. Despite all the problems (and sometimes because of them), I had fun with this game.","July 10, 2014","true","14.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

The complexity of game's puzzle probably demanded that but developers should have tried and found out a better compromise.\n✘ Story and puzzles: The story is one of the strongest and weakest point of this game. Very, very deep, probably too deep. Aided by the fact that English isn't my primary language, it was very difficult to follow the story progress over each chapter.. it got each time more and more complicated and so did puzzles. Very often you are left without sufficient enough clues to solve them, that your only hope is trial and error. I got so frustrated playing the last chapter that I quit in the middle of it without completing the game.\n\nSo, it's basically what I said on top: this game has a lot of qualities and maybe you're going to fully enjoy it; however if you're not a "point and click" hard-core gamer but you still like this genre, I can't recommend to play "Cognition" - there are many more accessible and funner games than this one.","May 8","true","20.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/242780/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is a mature point-and-click (P&C) adventure game heavily focused on storytelling and puzzle-solving with high doses of drama, thrills and unexpected twists which grab your attention right from the start. Set as a gritty murder mystery theme with supernatural elements, you follow Erica Reed, a FBI agent in Boston, trying to unveil and take down the Cain Killer who murdered her brother. While the concept may sound a bit convoluted, it does its job surprisingly well, enough to express gratitude to its godfather, the Gabriel Knight series, for the inspiration and stand on for its own merits.\n\nThe strongest point of Cognition is perhaps in its story and narration. Firstly, Cognition is not for the faint hearted. Unlike most P&C adventure games which are traditionally light hearted and occasionally “cartoony” in tone, that is absolutely not the case here. Instead, it is a totally fresh approach -- albeit nothing new per se –- for adults looking for a genuine thriller. As stated earlier, Gabriel Knight is clearly a big inspiration, however Cognition pushes that envelope. What starts as a simple search for the Cain Killer, it eventually turns into a complex story where Erica finds out that there are more killers similar to him, each with their own creepy personalities and unique, yet gruesome, ways to kill their victims and how other characters turn out to be not what they might have seemed at first glance. Almost everyone is hiding dark secrets, and there are plenty of legitimate moments of unexpected twists which you would have never thought of. It can be argued that the game feels like a B-type movie, but if that were the case, it would be amongst the best. Cognition boasts many moments of shock horror, tension and emotional rollercoasters in its journey; sometimes to its own detriment, funnily enough. As much as the story is solid throughout the game, at times it does feel a bit forced with the whole mature content and the melodrama from some of its characters in certain situations, as if the developers tried really hard to make an emotional impact on the audience. So yes, it is forced at times, but nevertheless it is good to see that they are taking risks and throwing all they got into your face. So, on a personal note, it does have an impact. In the end, after the shocking revelations in Episode 3 and seeing the final conclusion, I felt for the characters. Although the story does stumble upon some pacing issues typically midway through an episode, they all start and end on high notes. Lastly, Erica Reed is an exceptionally well-written female protagonist. A bit cocky at times, but as her character development grows with each new episode you start to like her even more and sympathise for what she has to go through. Plus, the voice actor for her is amazing. There is rarely a moment where she cannot deliver a line appropriately.\n\nThe most unique game mechanic, even for a P&C adventure game, is Erica’s supernatural cognitive powers which allow her to see events from the past when touching objects. This makes puzzle-solving and the gameplay in general fresh and interesting, setting them aside from the traditional and mundane mechanics of clicking around to see what happens. Moreover, each episode introduces other new abilities and mechanics which allow her to perform various other tasks. In general, the cognitive mechanics are ingenious, functional and most importantly fun to use.\n\nThe hand drawn artwork and backgrounds capture that comic book vibe brilliantly and set the mood fittingly. Likewise, all the cutscenes never seize to be so captivating and tense. There is nothing not to love about them. On the other hand, there are possibly two grips with them: the character drawings move statically during the cutscenes and some of the hand drawn backgrounds can look a bit rushed and unpolished in some areas. But with a great soundtrack as well, Cognition’s setting and atmosphere are well established.\n\nThe puzzles here never feel hard throughout most of the game, but they can still be challenging (especially in the second last episode) and sometimes silly. Yes, there are a few puzzles which seem a bit out of place (ie. lockpicking the boss’s office in full view of everyone else) which can break some of the immersion, but in most parts Cognition provides interesting approaches to puzzles with its cognitive mechanics. The puzzles get even better with each new episode, except in the final episode which lacks as many puzzles as in previous episodes and instead focuses more on tying all the loose ends of the story.\n\nSurprisingly, through a first playthrough, the game can last as long as 20 hours, at least in my case. Thus it provides quite a lot content for its current price tag; substantially more than other adventure games out there, even compared to high budget ones. Even through a second playthrough, now knowing how to solve all the puzzles and where to go to look for clues, the game is perhaps around 15 hours long, which is still remarkable.\n\nAs much as Cognition seems to be like the best new P&C adventure game in years, it has some major flaws which can harm what it sets to achieve. Firstly, graphically it is not impressive at all and by that I mean the character models. Since it uses the Unity engine, the characters look like plasticine. Moreover, the animations are not impressive either. There will be moments which they can break immersion if you are a nitpicky person. If you are looking for something as fluent and polished up as The Book Of Unwritten Tales’ graphics for example, Cognition is not what you are looking for. And that is a big problem because it makes Cognition look unprofessional on the surface. While the artwork is great and praise-worthy, seeing average looking models with clunky animations on top of beautifully hand drawn backgrounds can be underwhelming. Luckily, if you own the Game of the Year Edition, most of the animations are much smoother and polished up, but nothing too drastic. The transition from the hand drawn characters in cutscenes to 3D does not work.\n\nSecondly, due to the scope of the game and the size of the team, there had to be some compromises on realism. For instance, buildings can be rather unpopulated. The FBI station’s main office is a long room with no more than around six people (not all interactive) including Erica inside. Surely the FBI has a lot more agents in a single room in real-life. It is understandable that being confined by a small budget and probably lack of manpower stopped the team from adding more realistic details. And on the topic of realism, in a way it fails to realistically capture how FBI agents actually behave and work due to some improbable dialogues and situations which you would not see in real-life. While the story is gripping and it is its stongest point, Cognition is not very realistic in some aspects.\n\nLastly, the support characters can be corny and cliché at times, but plausible if you can accept them as they are.\n\nConclusively, Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is a blasting experience from start to finish which will sure leave a good lasting impression after finishing its long gritty story in the style of Gabriel Knight and Jack The Ripper; even despite its flaws due to the lack of resources that well-established companies like Telltale Games have at their hands. It is good see such a young and talented developing team taking risks with their mature story and unique gameplay mechanics. It definitely rivals acclaimed games such as The Walking Dead and even Jane Jensen’s Gabriel Knight in the story department. So if that is enough incentive for you to give this game a chance and get past its undercooked graphics and animations, it will be the best $10 you will ever spend. And yes, I would proudly say this was the best point-and-click adventure game of 2013.

You play as FBI agent Erica Reed, trying to solve a series of serial killings with the help of a unique psychic ability. Each episode focuses on 1 serial killer, but there's an overarching story connecting all of them. I would like to say more, but I'm afraid of revealing too much.\n\nGameplay-wise, the best thing about the game is the hint-system. If you're ever stuck, you can message one of Erica's friends in-game with your phone. The hints are helpful most of the time, but they won't give you the answers outright, so you still keep a sense of accomplishment when making progress.\n\nAnother nice feature is that there's a button that reveals all hotspots, so you won't be pixel-hunting!\n\nThe graphics are decent enough although the character animations aren't the best. The music and voice acting are excellent though. Some of my favourite tracks are played when you're solving a puzzle or trying to escape a scary situation.\n\nComplaints:\n1) A few logic glitches allow you to do the same thing more than once, but the effect is the same. Luckily this doesn't actually hinder progress, but it may confuse the player a little.\n2) Dialogue is mostly skippable, but there are some you can't skip, and it gets annoying when it occurs in the middle of a puzzle.\n\nOverall verdict: 8.5/10\nOne of the best point-and-click adventure games ever.","February 22, 2015","true","17.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It is basically a point & click adventure with some innovative twists to it. I highly recommend reading the prequel-comics before playing, as it sets out the background very well.\n\nSince this game is so good, I'll get the bad out of the way first:\n\n- Most animations are unskippable, as are some dialogues. If you accidentally click on an object at the other side of the room, you are forced to wait until Erica walks all the way over there and interacts with it before you can continue playing\n- Unlike the classic take of point&click games where you could just pick up everything you might ever need, Erica often won't pick something up unless she knows she's gonna use it. This results in having to backtrack and having to go through places you've already searched just to get something you couldn't before.\n- It isn't always clear what to do. It feels at times like the game is forcing you to use the hint system.\n- Episode 4 drifts away from the standard point & click style and into choice-based dialogues where you die if you say the wrong thing. It isn't as fun as the previous chapters (gameplay wise).\n\n\nOk, now the good:\n- Great detective story with many twists and turns, interesting characters and a well designed investigation at its center\n- Erica's powers provide a very cool and unique take on the genre\n- The game remains refreshing, providing new powers and other gameplay mechanics in each chapter\n- Fun, challenging puzzles that will make you think outside the box\n- Comicbook like graphics that fit the game perfectly\n- Wonderful soundtrack that keeps you in the mood\n\nIf you're into the genre, this game is definitely worth your money.","August 29, 2015","true","13.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

The music was also good, it set the mood for a modern noir detective story and it helped with the immersion.\n\nJust to give you an idea of what the story is about, it's about an FBI agent named Erica Reed who uses her psychic powers to see the past which helps her piece together her murder investigations. It's something akin to Law & Order meets The Medium.\n\nI enjoyed Erica's refreshing personality and her interactions with her partner, John, and her on-again-off-again lover, Sully; she was sarcastic and witty and I related to her struggle for moral insight during investigations as well as making peace with the past and letting go. And, just the theme in general is interesting since Erica was able to interact with items and see visions from the past that added perspective and depth to the story.\n\nAnd the game also brings up the long debated argument and encourages players to question if crime is ever justified.\n\nI'm sure I could go on and on about the game but I don't want to spoil it nor turn this review into a novel.\n\nThe game has four episodes and it took me roughly seventeen hours to play through comfortably without rushing.\nI personally recommend that you find the time to sit down and play Cognition rather than play it in short bursts, otherwise you run the risk of forgetting small details about the story. In this game, every little bit matters and ties up at the end.\n\nBe forewarned, it has quite a few moments in which I personally got stuck on certain puzzles and needed to do certain things that I would never think of trying unless I had the guide handy. You can use the Gameboomers one without too much worry of seeing spoilers as you progress.\n\nUnlike some other episodic games, Cognition ends satisfyingly well and without a cliff-hanger that would beg for a sequel; it ends in a way that doesn't require a sequel but it certainly is open for one if the writers choose to continue. So, you probably won't need to worry about feeling that continuity itch.","July 23, 2014","true","17.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Cognition's first season is excellent, with more twist + turns in the story; really logical puzzles (for the most part); really good character development.\n\nWithout spoiling too much here - Erica Reed is a cop, her brother Scott gets taken, and she begins chasing after this serial killer. You play mostly as Erica, embarking on this journey of finding out more about this killer, the past of the killer, and who the killer plans to attack next. This is just the tip of the iceberg here, as there's a lot more than that that is going on in this game, story-wise, play-wise, and character-wise.\n\nA few of the puzzles are tough, but the Hint System can give you just enough to point you in the right direction to help you figure it out. At some point - Erica begins having visions, learning she has powers that can help her solve puzzles. Not only that, but there are puzzles based around her visions are extremely well integrated into the game. I don't want to spoil too much, but each episode seems to integrate a new type of puzzle that has to deal with her abilities.\n\nEven the final episode (Episode 4) introduces a new mechanic, which I'm sure is going to have some replaying the last episode, since it can even change some of the actual journey of the final chapter & the actual final outcome of the game.\n\nThere's very few flaws + problems w/ this season. The voice-acting quality is the biggest problem, as it's all over the place. Erica, Cordelia, and John are the best voice-acted characters; and then the quality for the rest of the characters are all over the place. The graphics do have the very interesting, stylish and comic-book type of look - ranging more on the artistic side, instead of having any sort of real technical quality.\n\nNone of those above-said flaws should stop you from playing this game, as those are very minor problems with this game. After 26 hours or so with this game, there was hardly any moments where I was not wanting to find out what's going to develop and happen next in the story + to these characters.

If you're a gamer and are into detective stories, do not miss this gem!\n\nThis is one of the very best point and click adventure/detective games I've played ever.  In most point and click adventure games, you just click some items on the screen in order to progress the story.  But in this game, you actually feel like you're a real detective, doing the gumshoe thing and piecing evidence together in order to track down the murderer.  You use your psionic abilities to see into the past, you pick up photographs and items and try to figure out what they are and their significance to the case.  I highly recommend that when playing the game, you have a real pen and little notebook with you so you can quickly jot down notes and be more immersed in the game.","November 29, 2013","true","6.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Cognition is trying to be a "hybrid" with the inclusion of action game situations - a formula that works for some, and may even bring some new fans to the genre, but adds essentially a feature that is nerve-wracking to those of us wanting a traditional adventure game.\n\nThere *are* timed sequences to the game, as well as situations where you have to think fast, or do things in an explicit order just the right way. This isn't a relaxing, exploratory adventure at all.  It's trying to go for intense and cinematic, like a low budget Fahrenheit Prophecy. However, at least those games rely on QTE's; mice, especially ones with twitchy drivers, just aren't good for precision timing when you're getting all sweaty and nervous trying to click on the right set of pixels.\n\nFurthermore, although I have a rather strong stomach for gore and horror... I still hate torture. And this seems the entire premise of the game, at least for chapter 1. If you're squeamish at all about torture scenes, I'd advise even staying clear of the comic. It's just something that squicks me out. I'd prefer seeing heads pop off in Wasteland 2 to slow, agonizing self-mutiliation scenes.\n\nI'm sure this is all just me whinging about personal gripes, and YMMV - most people really enjoy the game, and it's awesome that it's trying to be unique. It just wasn't my cup of tea.","March 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

It had a great story and mixture of puzzles. Loved the subject matter although may be gory for some (i.e. serial killers and graphically violent scences). Several parts of the story were a bit confusing and I felt had to jump to some of our own conclusions (or interpretations); but overall was compelling and had nice twists. Puzzles were of appropriate difficulty. I got stuck on a couple, but that was my fault for not paying attention to some detail. All the necessary info was provided at some point prior to a puzzle. A couple of times was not clear what needed to be done from a game function point of view (as opposed to a puzzle), but persistence in trying out of the box thinking will help. The psion game mechanics are compelling. I strongly recommend this game if you like detective adventure stories.","February 1","true","30.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You play Erica Reed, an FBI agent who carries the talent of physic abilities and pre-cognition regarding items she touches and people she encounters. It all comes together to force you to deal with some fantastic puzzles and situations.

The strongest point is definitely the story - it's interesting from beginning to end and certainly exciting and thrilling as well. I'd say the second episode is the standout and the third is the weakest but they're all pretty good. The second episode though might be one of the most engaging plots in a game that I've played... the last scenes especially are insanely tense. Gave me chills... really good stuff though, seriously.\nIn terms of gameplay. The puzzles never get too hard or moon-logic-y at all. Each chapter ends up having a new mechanic that the previous ones didn't and each mechanic gets used in future episodes as well so it's much less about pixel hunting and more about figuring out which cognition power is the best for the job. There's an in-game hint system as well if you ever get stuck, which I did on a few occasions but not excessively often, which is good.\nThe weak point has to be the animations. Because dear god are they terrible. It's... really clunky on this one element and basically nothing else, which iss a tad baffling to me really. The art style is generally good, the music is good, the voice acting is mostly good, but the animations are just not.

They more than make up for the somewhat over-tuned puzzles (instead of digging into ground that had been recently disturbed with your hands very early on in episode one you have to use a hammer to break a shovel that's been glued to a statue's hand) and the fairly predictable outcome of the murder mystery itself. I did, however, enjoy the way the psychic mechanics worked in the game for puzzle solving. The use of past/future to provide information and clues was neat and occasionally made the puzzles themselves more interesting (despite the sometimes ridiculous Rube Goldberg-ness of some of them). Even with the weak points of a fairly linear storyline and occasionally illogical/frustration puzzles, the deep story telling and characterization more than made the game worth it. I was especially pleased to see the care taken with the two protagonists, Erica and Cordelia, and how their stories mirrored and intertwined.

Even though I have not gotten half way through the content, Cognition:  An Erica Reed Thriller is definitely a game that I would recommend to someone.\n\nPros:\nCognition has an exciting storyline that is brimming with drama and touches of gore. This is all brought out vividly through comic-strip-like cut-scenes that are very well drawn and fun to watch. In addition to the cut-scenes, the makers really make an effort to provide voice acting (which is helpful for suckers like me who don’t want to read).\n\nIn addition to the great storyline, you’re invited to activate your thinking process throughout the game. Not only do you collect and search for clues, but you also solve a variety of puzzles which are linked to the cases. The amount of cerebration involved not only makes it great solo-play, but also team-play if you like working with others.\n\nCons:\nWhen playing this game, you’ll find out that there is a steep learning curve in the beginning. Finding out what the functions are on keys was what made it hard for me to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joezifer/recommended/242780/","joezifer","joezifer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joezifer/","125 products in account","Right now, this is a review about the first episode and ~10% of the second one.\n\nFirst of all, I really like the art style of this game. It has that comic book/cell shading aesthetic you may already know from Telltale games like "The Walking Dead" or "The Wolf Among Us" (or even -non TTG- XIII but that was quite a while ago). Most of the backgrounds are hand drawn though, which results in a very comic-escque blend. I prefer it over the "Telltale Style" which sometimes feels a bit too sterile for my taste.\n\nThe soundtrack as a whole is right around the upper threshold of "Okay", surpassing it with some haunting piano pieces, dipping way into "Meh" regions in the selection of the ambient theme of a store you visit quite regularly. Someone really dropped the ball there, light hearted, up-tempo Bossa (Elevator Music, basically) doesn't mix with moody antique stores/spiritual guidance etablissements that only open when the sun goes down.\n\nMost of the voice acting is great, bordering on sublime, especially in the cases of the two main investigators. Unfortunately there are some very weak performances as well, including the obligatory badly faked Louisiana accent.\n\nWith aesthetics out of the way, let's take a look at the controls:\n\nThey're awful.\n\nI'm not even kidding. Rarely has a game made me groan out in annoyance as often as Cognition did in the few hours I spent with it so far. Granted, for the most part it was a mix of sub-par puzzle design and awkward controls, but still.\n\nThe protagonist reacts rather lethargically to your mouse input. It kinda feels like you're trying to get an 18-wheeler to move instead of a rather athletic young Special Agent of ~60kg (~130lbs).\n\nThere are also some really unnecessary animations. In the office you can't move until the door of the elevator you just stepped out of closes. Sitting down by your desk, opening a door, it all just manages to overshoot the sweet spot (in terms of the length of the animation) ever so slightly. Lots of tiny things that really slow down the games pace and make you dread the idea of having to visit locations more often than necessary (which the game, being an adventure game after all, requires you to do pretty much all the time).\nSame for the "I can't use the dead squirrel with the cheese grater" monologue snippets the adventure game veteran loves to hate. All just that tiny bit too long. It helps turning off the tutorials in the menu, though.\n\nThen there's the controls on maps and elevator panels and such. Think you can just click the floor/location you want to get to? Guess again, it opens the context menu, which gives you the option to "Inspect" or "Use (go to)" said floor or location. Every. Damn. Time.\n\nThere's always a ~2 second loading time when switching screens, which also gets old very quickly. You'd think that a game with pre-rendered backgrounds, released in 2012, would handle that a bit more gracefully. Same for the transitions into and out of the "Intuition" mechanic.\n\nYou also get unexplainable interface lags. Entering a room or exiting an inspection (more on that later) sometimes causes the user interface to be unresponsive for up to 5 seconds. The game itself doesn't lag, animations, music, everything runs smoothly, you just can't click or do anything, sometimes the interface overlay doesn't even show up but sometimes it does. This was especially noticeable in the first "action scene" of the game.\n\nNow, what do I mean when I say inspection? Well, that's basically all screens that have the word "Exit" written on them in blue letters. It happens when you're sitting at a desk, when you're "zooming in" to inspect certain items closer, stuff like that. Now while you're inside an inspection-screen you won't be able to open certain other inspection-screens. This may sound a bit abstract but let me give you an example:\nOne puzzle requires you to sit at a desk (first inspection level), use a computer (next inspection level) and read a text file on that computer, which contains the code word to open something you have in your inventory. You won't be able to inspect (in this case: zoom in to be able to interact with) said inventory item to enter the code until you logged out of the computer and stood up from the desk.\n\nAlso, if you're using two monitors you gotta be careful not to click outside the game window. Even in fullscreen mode the game doesn't capture the cursor.\n\nOne quirk I noticed: When you leave a location to the map screen and you click that location again, the sound of the car's motor still plays, although you never actually travelled anywhere.\n\nBut wait, there's more:\n\nIn certain cases, the game gives you the option to make a decision. Take this or that agent to the interrogation, accept or decline the lunch invitation of your FWB-slash-colleague (it's complicated), force or persuade a witness to make a statement.\nIn other cases it forces you to steal a flower from someones grave because you forgot to bring your own for the anniversary of your brother's death. Now I get that you're trying to do some exposition here, but man. Really?\n\n\nAlso, plot holes.\n\nExample:\n\nYou get taken off a case because it's too personal. It was your case, the whole first episode revolved around it. In the end you realize that the next victim is going to be your boss. You hurry to the scene, guns blazing, but it's already too late and the murderer gets away. During your debrief with the new boss you start to feel a little dizzy and stumble to the bathroom. On your way there, before falling unconscious, you see a woman dragging your FWB-slash-colleague ("Sully") out of the door, cutting his ear off with a scalpel. What you didn't know is that you and Sully were drugged by your impostor office assistant while waiting outside the bosses office for your debriefs. Right after you wake up the boss assigns you to the case. Literally 20 minutes (that's ingame time, about 30 seconds real time) after taking you off of a case that's too personal because your boss died in it he assigns you to a case in which both you and your love interest are the victims. He doesn't even give you the time to get up.\n\nThen there's the usual minor deus-ex-machina, logical error and/or techno-babble you always quietly hope they manage to avoid but they always fail to (minor spoilers):\n\n- police officer needs your phone's PIN number to send you a GPS-location\n\n- magical gadget from techno geek/forensics expert/trapped in friendzone-limbo "pal" (more on him later) only needs the manufacturer's color code from a spray paint can to make text that was sprayed over in said color appear. It also tricks finger print readers by projecting an image of the finger print onto the detector\n\n- FBI outpost records interrogations on tape but doesn't have any gear to listen to the recordings\n\n- grumpy old coroner won't give you her tape recorder to listen to potentionally critical recordings\n\n- the office assistant's computer shows a (presumably...hopefully) confidential case file opened on her screen\n\n- the lead investigators monitor also always shows that case file, even after logging out and leaving the desk\n\n- so do several other computers in that office\n\n- office full of people doesn't give a rat's a** that you're picking the door to your bosses office\n\nAnd then, finally, there's the cast. Pretty compelling for the most part, like already mentioned with the odd outlier but there's also "pal". Evidently the two of you took some undergrad courses together and evidently he's been sleeping on a pillow with your face printed on it and sobbing into his TV dinners ever since. He actually pretty much looks like the "2/10, would not bang"-guy from that old image macro.\n\nUnfortunately I'm running out of characters but their interactions are really something. I just hope it's done on purpose.","February 8, 2015","false","15.6"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","20","36","0","0"

Cognition was by no means a flawless creation, but it impressed me with how different it was from other point and click adventure games I have played.\n\nIt was basically a horror game that made you think.  Not to many of those lying around.\n\nNow I know it hints at what to expect in the title. The game is technically a thriller, yes, but it is so full of gore, twisted psychology, mind games, deathtraps and people dying in horrible ways that the only thing that seems to  keep the game from plunging into the full fledged horror-only end of the spectrum is the fact that the main character, Erica Reed, is an FBI agent with some psychic abilities.\n\nStill, the writing is so dark an twisted that even being a psychic investigator in the FBI doesn’t really help Erica Reed much and she often comes out as more of a victim trying to survive than anybody who is successfully solving anything. It’s not even to hard to guess who the evil sick killers are as soon as they are introduced, but the puzzles, sick mind games, and music are so disturbing that most players will find it hard to stop playing.\n\nDespite it's ability to grip an audience, the over all presentation of the game still does flip flop a bit in quality. Sure there is the great draw of that dark atmosphere and the developers do a ton of things right as far as creepy tension goes, but there are a couple of moments where the presentation trips over itself.  Voice acting was hit or miss. The 3D animations would occasionally go from wildly over the top movement to actually breaking the character model, causing the character to glitch out and crash. It can be a bit distracting, listening to what sounds like a bipolar Erica Reed doing an anime style fist pump and then spontaneously having her head spin 360 degrees kind of takes a person out of the seriously tense moments. Luckily these bizarre issues were few enough to not really bother players with a forgiving sense of humor.\n\nThe over arching storyline is divided into five parts. Each of the five episodes seemed to have their own strong moments, paired together with little flaws in detail. There were plenty of moments when, if anyone stopped to really think about it, it would seem that the characters did things that would make no sense just to further the plot. In fact, there were many ways for the killers to have been caught in each episode, but FBI protocol and any logic associated with that setting is conveniently thrown aside in favor of a over dramatic scene or additional puzzle.\n\nFor instance, there is one laughable moment were Erica Reed thinks she has to figure out how to steal an old tape recorder and tape from a grumpy colleague then goes about breaking a couple of laws in the process, but the whole time I can’t help but wonder why she can’t just go to her boss, use her smart phone to record things or, heck, hop in her car and go to a local electronics store to buy her own hand held cassette recorder for around $20 or so.\n\nDoes Erica Reed's actions make any sense in the above situation? No, but it's not distracting enough to ruin the game for anyone who has tried other games in the point&click genre. Sure the dips in logic are noticable but not crippling to the bigger scheme of things and most casual players will probably shrug them off.\n\nIn the end, what really won me over was how the game made you thinks when it came to puzzles. If it’s a very mature game with mature content, you expect some very difficult and mature logic solving puzzles right? Well the player actually can get that here! It actually makes the player think and a player can solve most of them without using the hint system if one puts one’s mind to it.  I really enjoyed the complexity of the puzzles and I ended up using the hint system more to navigate through nonsensical parts of the story to find them than to do any actual puzzle or logic solving because of the long awaited challenge they represented.\n\nIn conclusion, I give Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller a thumbs up, although it's a twitchy thumb with warts just around the thumbnail. Honestly, I’m not sure if this game is for most audiences, since the game seems to have been made for people so desensitized that they no longer have a gag reflex combined with the tendency to have the patience level of a saint. I'm not even sure making any more "Erica Reed" thrillers (if that's the intent behind the needlessly lengthy title) would be a good idea considering how random the plot was, but was this game was different enough to stand out in a crowd and entertaining in it’s own right. I say give it a shot, just be aware that you might have to talk to a therapist when you are done playing.","August 14, 2014","true","19.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And WOW! It was great. One of the best...nah I would say THE best adventure I have ever played. I have never played a serious adventure which was that good.\n\nThe Story is the strongest part. The Killers are really creative and the atmosphere is perfect. One of the best tellings I have ever seen with perfect logic. Also the puzzles. Great and not to far away from the game. I hate puzzles which are there only for beeing puzzles without a real meaning for the game. I always remember Silent Hill with useless puzzles like the piano one which have nothing to do with the Story or the actuall game.\n\nThe artdesign of a comic is fantastic and fits perfectly.\n\nHow do we say in germany? Where you find light you also find shadows. The gameplay is far too slow, Erica moves  slow like granny and you have some issues where she don't react after clicks. I also did not like that she commented every small thing. Problem is that you can't skip her talk and always need to wait even if she already commented the situation. I'm far to impatient for this.\n\nStill there are some techincal issues. I had some crashes and in the Cordellia Sequenzes she just don't react after a command, standing still and I needed to restart the game.\n\nBut these are just minor issues for a great game, even though not every episode is as great as another.

Actually I like this kind of point and click adventure games.\n\nSadly to say, but this game is a little "bug"-ridden. It crashes quite regulary, safe-games can't be loaded too (at least not at episode 1) and sometimes the graphics become glitchy when Terence is talking for example.\n\nI will recomend this game nonetheless, since they still seem to work on the game. It is a game full of riddles and clues to find. Erica Reeds talents evolve during the game - the characters are quite good developed.  It offers hours and hours of suspense, thrill and sometimes frustration if you had the wrong ideas about the true importance of some objects.\n\nThe game is a great addition to any collection and a greater gift to people who like point and click adventures, the price is four all four episodes of season one and thus it is a great value, since you won't run through the adventures but stand, look and ponder about some of the darkest, yet very detailed sceneries - you might even wish to return once in a while to relive some of the more beautiful and surprisingly satisfying moments of the game.\n\nOh, and don't mind the sometime rough and tumble language, I have read and heard worse in some so called "Bestseller" books, especially in northern german crime and suspense stories it seems to be a thing of vogue to have the inspector talk like some brainless, drunk and lewd sailor... *sigh*\n\nAddendum 20.06.2015\nSadly after playing the first episode through and just starting the second one I also have to say that the game stays a bit behind in expectations. Sure it still is a good game, as an adventure it offers a lot - but some lapses in the game regarding save game issues and some very illogical puzzles (you'll have to see for yourself, becaus an explanation can't give you a hint)\n\nConditional Recomendation: For fans of the Point and Click Adventure Genre, the game still needs some finetuning.","March 20, 2015","true","23.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This meant that I jumped into the story mid way and to be honest the "what happened so far" catch up thing did nothing but utterly confuse me. Nevertheless the story came together quite well once I started playing. The voice acting is reasonable, the protagonist is decently compelling and storyline is quite fun if you like serial killers. I wasn't a fan of some of the mechanics in chapter 4 that would happily lead you to an untimely death (although it didn't make you back up far if you did) - it's worth saving after each very linear chunk of that chapter if you want to get the achievements. Chapter 3 was much more fun but I get the impression that it probably would have been more so had I already been attached to the characters and had a better understanding of what was going on.\n\nInexplicably for a chapter based game like this... I can't buy the missing chapters to find out what happened at the beginning as my only option on steam is to purchase all four in one go.

In four episodes, we find an FBI agent with psychic abilities follow a serial killer. The story was really nice, and the comicbook-motivated artstyle and creepy soundtrack fitted the narrative.\n\nHowever, I had some problems with the game: the user interface seems like designed with touch devices in mind, which means, meaning simple actions require multiple clicks, only a single mouse button is used, etc. Additionally, some puzzles were exceptionally hard for me, sometimes simply figuring out the solution, other times remembering the details that were presented in a case file previously.\n\nAlltogether, although clearly not the best point-and-click game of the 21st century, it provides a very compelling story, so I recommend it (at least to those who are not afraid of a very dark-mooded game).","April 12, 2014","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've thorroughly enjoyed this. You play as Erica Reed, a redhead-with-a-temper FBI agent, solving a series of rather gruesome crimes. Playthrough time is roughly 20 hours for the average player, and the game is divided into four episodes (each episode presents one crime case). The game has a great, comicbook-style art style, although the 3D models and animations are somewhat basic and glitchy. It has a moody atmosphere, supported by a good soundtrack. Interesting feature is Erica's 'cognition' power, which allows her to e.g. see things from the past. Rather than this being just a neat trick, this mechanic helps turn the game into an actual investigative game.

A lot.\n\nYou are Erica Reed, a mental wreck who breaks down every 5 minutes, suffers from regular visions and has her office in the hallway of an FBI building right next to the vending machine. Of course you also have the casual office flirt going on and a partner who seems to be incapable of doing anything by himself. Amazing... From the get go it feels like you are stuck in a soap opera, with cheesy dialogues, irritating behaviour and a lackluster main storyline.\n\nThe dialogues are so off, it hurts. The forensics guy is telling you stuff the coroner should tell you, the coroner tells you stuff the forensics guy should, in between your boss ♥♥♥♥♥es around and a whole bunch of FBI agents (2 of which look exactly the same) trample around the scenes of a murder, yet they wait for you to do some minor investigations. That just doesn't make sense either.\n\nApart from that, the graphics constantly glitch, which I wouldn't mind so much if the story was at least okay. Well, I guess if you liked Gray Matter, then you might like this. If you want to have a story that is consistent and combines some paranormal abilities with somewhat realistic police work, then stay away.\n\nI'm just in for a bit more than an hour and I think I will try to get the game refunded. It's a shame, from the store page I thought I'd really like this game.\n\nI would definitely suggest that, unlike me, you get the demo first and see for yourself if you think that this is worth buying.","September 19, 2015","false","1.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

This game style reminded me heavily on Phoenix Wright series from many years ago.There are a lot of running back and forth looking at places and talking to people for information/evidence. The story plot is a lot darker but keeps you curious.\n\nPros: interesting plot\n- interesting mechanics such as reading people's minds, going back in time and creating ghosts to look at the past\n- graphics is decent like telltale games\n\nCons:\n- the main character is ugly and there is nothing attractive about her\n- the main problem I have is the hint system doesn't prompt you sometimes until everything is done, so if you miss one or two things the hint system doesn't progress and if you're stuck you need to rely on a walkthrough\n- there are some little things that really need polishing - having to go through dialogues that you have heard already instead of being able to skip/fast forward, having to walk into the interrogation room and sit down to be able to talk to the person instead of choosing to talk to the person and your character will sit down on her own\n- soundtrack wasn't that good\n- way too many mechanics than needed - regression/projection, it really isn't necessary to make a game that complex, can easily do with just 1 skill for the whole game\n\ngame overall for me is a 7.5, it is a good start for the developers to look forward to more of their work but the key for this game is less is more.

I'm a big bookworm, and it was fun to play a game with such amazing story writing.  The best of gaming and reading combined :)  Got this game in a bundle and was surprised to find out how amazing it is.  I think it'd be worth paying full price for - I'd pay full price for a sequel right now.  Gameplay is fairly linear, until you get to the final episode, where your dialogue choices affect the story more.  Early in the game, the struggle is more with grasping the controls.  One of the last puzzles had me stumped, and I still don't know how I got past it.  If you're looking for a button-masher, this isn't for you.  But, it's not like the point and click adventures that are mindless, either.  It's an engaging story with four parts, and you can skip between them.  No need to complete the first part before the second, except for the storyline.  I'm rambling, but I just really enjoyed this game and have to dig into the other projects Jane Jensen (the writer) has done.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dizzychicpea/recommended/242780/","dizzychicpea","Dizzy Chicpea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dizzychicpea/","77 products in account","I first came across this game whilst looking for info about “Moebius: Empire Rising” by Jane Jensen (big fan of her work), so it was a while ago. Played the demo but wasn't too impressed with the voice acting (especially) and the dialogues... the story (from the little that is shown in the demo, which is the first part of the first chapter of the game) seemed predictable and not very well written. I guess this was because we're pretty much thrown into something that would have a bigger impact if we'd previously had some time to care about the characters involved - too much too soon. So I wasn't exactly motivated to buy the game after playing the demo.\n\nMonths later I managed to buy the game along with a some others for a very low price (including Steam codes, thankfully), and decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did because the story is actually very good, the demo does it no justice and the voice acting gets a bit better as the game progresses (or maybe I just ended up getting used to it, I guess). The dialogues can be cringe inducing at times (especially in the first two chapters) but because the storyline is so engrossing I managed to ignore that as well as the mediocre animation and models (Moebius suffers from that as well, which is a shame). But I am a lover of good stories and good mysteries and this game caters to both notions, I just wish that more attention was put into the quality of animation, models and voice acting. But overall, it’s a good game with a good story and interesting characters. The cognitive “powers” are well developed and are part of what makes this game so addictive - they were well thought out and make sense in terms of game mechanics.\n\nI would highly recommend this game for the storytelling experience alone, but I also liked it for its uniqueness and interesting themes. i hope the developer invests in better 3D modeling and animation as in the future I'll keep my eyes open for more games coming from them.","April 27, 2015","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like many point-and-click adventure games, the graphics might be considered "primitive" by some, but they are well done and have a definite artistic style that is attractive.  Erica Reed's "cognition powers" are fairly fun and the puzzles generally strike a nice balance in difficulty.\n\nOn the negative side, the game is buggy.  I didn't come across any game-crashing bugs, but several things give this game a "less than polished" feel.  Animations, interactions with characters or objects, even trying to walk can be problematic and sloppy.  The inventory system is poor. The writing and dialogue have a flowery "fan fiction" style, which combined with the bugginess gives the game an amateur feel.\n\nAs a whole, I give a cautious recommendation to those who like adventure games, mysteries, or who dig the music or graphical style.  Those who are used to more polished games from established studios should look elsewhere.","May 20","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tylmerand/recommended/242780/","Tylmerand","Tylmerand","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tylmerand/","81 products in account","I've just played through the first chapter and only the first chapter, so take this as more of a first impression than a complete review - though, spoilers, i intend very much to continue through the other chapters when I have the time.\n\nIn short, because I get carried away easily;\n\nPRO:\n- beatiful hand-drawn artstyle\n- compelling and well-told story\n- some very good voice-acting\n- intuitive controls\n- creative puzzle-solving mechanics\n- satisfying level of interaction\nCON:\n- animation duration\n- glitches [mostly minor]\n- some forced choices and obscure solutions\n\nRecommended for adventure-game fans and those in to interactive novels, since it fulfills most of those expectations either well or excellently. Most gripes arise from gameplay, which, if sufficiently engaged [and that's definitely possible], will be tolerable.\n\n\nOne of the first things you need to be aware of is the length the game takes to play. Clocking in at 5.6 hours for one of four chapters seems to be on the fairly slow side when looking at the other reviews, and is in itself not a bad thing either. But it's not JUST the lenght of the story that caused this time. It is also the overall slowness of animations that are, as far as I could tell, unskippable [some dialogue is skippable and some isn't, and depending on your memory and/or trial and error you may find yourself listening to a minute+ long unskippable piece of dialogue in order to verify a single statement]. You can run with double-click, which is nice, and in some cases you can directly exit a location, but overall the movement of the protagonist is slow. As someone who generally likes slow pacing, I'm not as bothered by this as others may be, I do however have a problem with the animations when sitting in front of a computer [a nice animation, though] or when opening a door. For the amount of times you have to do these actions, the animations become too slow too quickly. Finally, I tend to visit every location whenever I get new information, so that I can see all dialogue options and find potential hidden stuff. If you are anything like me, you can spare yourself the trouble [though if your anything like me, I know you won't]. There are cases where you are clearly meant to backtrack, but it's always clear where to if you paid attention ["get food" for example], and there are cases where you are convinced you don't have to backtrack, yet no option you have available works [when asked to "get food", you already have food in your inventory that isn't usable], in which case the duration it takes to go somewhere and back again will make you readily inclined to use the very direct but sufficiently helpful hint system. So overall, very sluggish gameplay-wise. Since it also lags occasionally, be prepared for slow progression and/or long playing sessions.\n\nThe plus-side is that the game's story is quite engaging. You have enough options and freedom to make you feel like you're actually doing some work on your own, and there are different ways to solve certain problems - though this is the exception - as well as a few different choices you can directly make [like accepting or declinging an invitation]. I can't comment too much on the story; so far it hasn't been the most original, but it was well-told and fairly well-paced, with appealing characters and adequate to very good voice-acting. The other strong suit of the game is the artstyle. I really like the comic style of the characters, but am particularly impressed by the backgrounds, so much so that I spent quite a while just looking at the pictures before even seeing what I can interact with. The cutscenes, aside from direct dialogue, are mostly minimally animanted [very minimally, like blinking], which I've seen done a lot worse and I think works nicely. The gameplay animation is 3D and might be quite glaring at first. It seems to go for a comic-like 3D effect akin to many Telltale games, but it comes across jagged and quite glitchy, with many animations clipping through each other [most glaringly the fact you can walk straight through most character models]. I got used to it quite quickly, but considering it is a major part of the game and does NOT look like the handdrawn backgrounds and cutscenes, you should be at least okay with them in order to gain any enjoyment from the game.\n\nThough I generally liked the artstyle, the presentation, the possibilities provided by the gameplay, the characters and the story, there were a few more undesirable aspects aside from the speed that I feel need a mention. Firstly, the game never crashed for me, but there is a chance that it might; save regularly [no or very rare autosave]. Instead, the game nearly froze three times in the span of five hours. All three times it was when I tried to move somewhere, and it wouldn't respond. Every other option was still available and I could highlight them, but none responded to clicking. After a while, the protagonist simply warped to the position I initially clicked for her to go. The last time had me waiting for her to "warp" for well over a minute, after which I noticed that I could just hit the dialogue option with nearby characters to make her warp instantly, allowing me to edge my way towards the elevator and to the next floor, where all worked fine again. A very minor glitch that may be entirely due to my graphics card is that the shadows cast by moving objects came out pixelated.\nSecondly, there are FAR too few dialogue options when clicking around stuff in the background. Perhaps I'm spoiled, but in a point-and-click game I expect more variety than the exact same dialogue for ~five crypts or –six graves [as well as their seperately selectable but identical gravestones], especially when you are expected to click on all of them in order to find something specific. Also, don't bother clicking on things more than once - so far, the dialogue has never changed [but if you're like me, you'll check anyways].\nAnd thirdly, while the puzzles are generally good, well-integrated and of various difficulty, some are highly obscure, especially when there's a perfectly reasonable way to solve them that the game simply doesn't recognise [I already mentioned the food]. Some of these problems have to do with the interface - you can choose to look at or interact with an object, sometimes with whatever item from your inventory you selected. But not all items allow for experimentation, and sometimes you get the option only after having checked something else first [which I could never stand adventure games doing]. A frustrating point specifically was when I needed to borrow an item from someone that was clearly very important to them. As soon as I was done, I wanted to return it, but there was no option to do so up to the end of the chapter despite me repeatedly trying [the text once even said "these two just don't match" or something, which is clearly false regarding the object that you supposedly only temporarily borrowed off the guy]. Probably the game will have me use the item once more [hopefully without also losing it in the process], or the guy I got it from will "remind" me to return it, as if I as the player have forgotten also. Speaking of which, there are a few instances where you have no choice but perform a ludicrous action that you yourself don't want to do. SPOILER: When reminded by my father to bring flowers to someone's grave, I was presented with the option to take them from another grave. I didn't want to do that, but I found NO other way to get one, even after revisiting every single open location. Finally I had to succumb with the justification that I had "forgotten" to bring flowers, even though I had done anything but that. Minor things like this can be very irksome when the game otherwise allows you reasonable liberty.\n\nDespite its flaws, I was engaged enough through visuals, narrative and interaction, allowing the game to more often than not get away with it.","July 21, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Recently saw an online sale and picked it up and was I glad I did! This was an AMAZING game. I really enjoyed it. It was spooky, eerie, (and a little gory!) but had a lot of great puzzles that were just the right amount of hard to enjoy solving without getting bogged down for too long. I never had to use the hint system, but I wasn't stuck for days beating my head against a wall. That, to me, is perfection in adventure game writing. The storyline was fun, though whoever came up with this serial killer idea, well, I hope you have a therapist to talk to! Disturbing! (but in a good way!)\n\nI I loved the soundtrack, the voice artist work was so fantastic (Raleigh Holmes, who does the voice of Erica Reed, is amazing -- She hit all the right notes, emotions and tones. Best voiceover work in any game I've played. I heard she was battling an illness, so I hope she gets well soon and does a sequel!!!!)

Putting it all together I'd still recommend the game which excels in setting scenes and telling a story, has interesting game mechanics but also is sometimes glitchy and bossy.\n\n+ Uses original music to set scenes, especially fitting for tense situations\n+ Overall story is interesting and well interwoven with game mechanics\n+ Metroidvania-esque\n+ Good voice-acting\n+ Decisions; at times the adventure includes sort of lifelike decisions, i.e. the game gets harder if you choose stupidly\n+ In-game notepad that can interact with the OS clipboard; good for reviews\n- Bossy, requires player to do odd things or things odd\n- Episodes made me visit website at the end of each credits roll even though I bought the whole series\n- In-game notepad not always available\n- Achievements sometimes require repetition of parts unnecessarily including lengthy scenes\n- In-game commercials\n\nFrom the start the game managed to grip me and put me into a tense atmosphere. This was immensely helped by the main musical theme, the non-distracting good voice-acting and the mystery surrounding Erica's supernatural powers. I laud all of those. Enjoyably those elements worked for me in pretty much all the pivotal scenes.\nThe game mostly kept me interested to see how the story would unfold and which of my questions would be answered. Though there are story drivers, twists and turns - some of which I'm made part of, some I just watch - I strongly disagree with.\nErica is a crime investigator, still she\nunnecessarily touches pieces of evidence with bare hands (artefact),\nbasically encourages tampering with evidence (dean),\ndisregards the account of a witness claiming to recently having seen a serial killer (Cordelia),\nis unnaturally easy to ambush (episodes 1 and 4),\nsteals without need a flower from a grave (story driver).There are more objectionable actions but they are sufficiently well explained by the storyline.\n\nWhen I say the game is bossy I refer to a certain linearity. Sometimes you are, without prior or subsequent explanation, required to do things in a certain order, sometimes you are hinted to do something which you actually cannot do yet and sometimes you cannot actively do an action that is immediately afterwards done by the game. Example: I tried to call John and Erica stated there is no reason for that. So instead I left the scene directly leading to a cutscene in which the first thing that happened is Erica calling John.\n\nThe game feels unfinished or rather unpolished in places. And several transition are not state-safe.\nThere is a clickable ladder that supposedly "leads to the roof" but there is no hatch above it.\nAfter sitting down at her desk Erica can walk away with the game thinking she is still seated. When the game catches up Erica runs through the stand-up routine wherever she might be at the moment and the chair magically moves by itself.\nCertain dialogues leave Erica broken, literally. Her upper body is bend back in an unhealthy way, arms sticking out and her head moves about in a fashion the makers of The Exorcist could only dream of.\nLeaving the actual interrogation room can retain elements of the GUI that shouldn't be available.\nThere is a graveyard scene where you collect the locket followed by a cutscene. When I clicked next I was presented with "Skip cutscene?" even though the cutscene ended already.\nAt some point Erica's synergy power was suddenly disabled, i.e. clicking the cognition sphere disappears the inventory and even the open inventory button.\nEveryone is obsessed with the Cain Killer, see office monitors.\nPlaying on the "Fastest" graphics settings I saw some pretty ugly facial animations. By the looks of it only half the points of the lip polyline moved.\nSometimes the safe at Longmore's apartment is available as an interaction point when inspecting the desk. When inspecting the safe from inspecting the desk and then exiting will have the desk gone as an item to interact with and looking at the keyboard afterwards takes you to the Boston travel map.\nPieces of the photo are mirrored in the inventory "Next - 7".\nFor some reason you can only retry the scene or close the game altogether after dying.\nAs said before, the player almost immediately learns about Erica's supernatural powers. Those powers focus on the past and develop over time into four branches specific to different situations and are later complemented by Cordelia's precognition in a way I find really satisfying and appropriately confusing.\nAnother well-established mechanic is the played character voicing inner thoughts to the player. The game is not quite breaking the fourth wall when one of those voicings is overheard and reacted to by another character. I found that pretty immersion-breaking. Fortunately that only happened once very early in the game.\nOne of the most interesting things I have encountered in Cognition and games in general in quite some time is the notepad that is available in Erica's phone. Not only is it editable but it can also cut, copy and paste and uses for those purposes the clipboard of the player's OS. This means that you can import text to and, more importantly, export text from the game. This is very useful for reviews and was used for this one. Unfortunately, the notepad is only available most of the time and doesn't transfer between episodes.\nErica's phone is also used to advertise real-world games for which Erica seems "totally hyped". Irritatingly, that excitement is apparently more important than to uphold the current atmosphere.\n\nIn episode 3 'exits' are no longer used but simply clicked. On the one hand this is convenient but you don't always know which object is an 'exit'.\nWhen coming into a room the game sometimes takes several seconds before actually letting the player do anything. This would be ok were a triggered sequence to follow but is irritating otherwise.\n\nHints:\nSave at the beginning of scenes to have access to dialogue and hints later on.\nIf an object seems useless there is about a 50% chance this is because of one of the decisions that actually influence the story.\nErica and strangely Cordelia as well may not be as clever and clear-seeing as you are. More often than I would have liked you sort of need to firmly establish a fact before Erica can act on it. So what you tried earlier to no avail may be fruitful later on.\nA few times I sort of fell out of the flow, i.e. I became unaware of what needed to be done next and twice went brute-forcing. Well, let's not blame the game for that.\nThe conclusion of episode 3 was very awkward and almost turned me away from Cognition - could be verbalised as "It almost looks like they will.. They wouldn't! Would they?! Oh no, come on man." Still, the story pulled me back.\nMy final gripes concern the fact that I had to visit the website of the publisher every time after the credits rolled in order to get back to the game menu and the fact that the main menu has a gallery which apparently should have concept art, cinematics and 'behind the scenes' but is consistently empty.\n\nFor all the problems stated above (and a few unstated) I'm unlikely to replay Cognition but I did enjoy the one play-through and recommend it to players that like adventures and a dose of mystery.","January 17, 2015","true","68.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You'll be solving murders as Erica Reed, an FBI agent with the ability to see into the past. Three years earlier from when the story begins, we look into the past and see a tragic case for Erica.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Episode 1 is problematic. The puzzles hang on tenuous links at best, and sometimes you'll have to bust out the guide. What should be a throwaway line of dialogue becomes super important for a puzzle, but the logic you have to link it up requires so much thought. But wait! Episodes 2 and 3 fix it, and you're no longer scratching your head. The puzzles are clever, they'll make you think without being impossible. Each episode introduces new gameplay designs, and so they each have a different flavour.\n\nAlso, the ability to see into the past adds often unique gameplay aspects. You'll have to look at certain objects and discover what they were used for. You'll have to regress people and fix their memories by figuring out what colour their wive's shirt was, what was the day they last saw. It's clever, it's different, and it feels different from normal point and click. You truly get into Erica's head and feel like you are an FBI agent, and also one with the power to see the past.\n\nStory-wise, all four episodes have a different flavour also. It did surprise me how the episodes turn out, and I won't spoil it for you here. However, I will say it's incredibly well-written. Episode 2 is a highlight for me. Sadness, frustration, intrigue, mystery, you have it all here, and it never feels forced. There is an overlying arc in the episodes, and each one make you to want play on further to solve the mystery. I for one finished episode 3 yesterday and finished episode 4 tonight ... and that leads onto the problem of Episode 4. It's shorter than the others, and it's very linear. You feel forced into the narrative, and it's not told as well. It's not bad, but it's certainly not as good as the rest. There are a lot of questions that remain, but it remains a good game.\n\nPlot-wise, great, acting - great. Puzzles - frustrating in episode one, but clever in all the rest. You truly do begin to like Erica as a character, and the people you meet along the way are well-written as well. Her 'walking stereotype' partner John, McAdams, Davies ... the game is full of memorable characters, which pull the story along. Some are forgettable, like Gallagher. The plot itself is worthy of any TV show.\n\nProblems - there are technical issues. I often got clipping with the sound, and there were a few animation glitches which took away from the story. Seeing Erica's head twist around her body like a possessed contortionist was funny, but you don't want to laugh in a psychological thriller. Also, some of the cinematic, drawn in a beautiful comic book style, sometimes ... aren't so beautiful. They can appear choppy and rushed at times. Nevertheless, they are fluid and they do work well. They go on quickly enough with higher quality images that you don't question the poorer frames.\n\nLike Erica, I don't look back into the past and see only good memories. Episodes 2 and 3 are both incredible, but Episode 1 has flaws in the gameplay, and 4 in the story. But ... adding up all the memories together, it created a wonderful and great experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone who's patient enough to get through the first episode's diabolical puzzles. Great story, great characters and highly ingenious puzzles, Cognition is a game that takes all the best aspects of an FBI thriller film, whilst making you the actual detective.","May 4, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While this game suffers from lots of back-tracking, it doesn't really borrow any other frustrations from its genre specific brethren.  No pixel hunts.  No insanely illogical puzzles.  This leaves you, the player, to settle down to a fascinating story.  The cognitive abilities make for a nice way to expound the narrative without being overly cheesy.  While the voice acting broke in places, it was very enjoyable overall.  The same goes for the soundtrack.  What gripped me was the dark story told in a very unique way.  And it was surprisingly complex.\n\nI also appreciate the very timely auto-saves, since this game will let you make mistakes (very little hand-holding).  I encountered graphical issues, some odd game behavior, and a few odds and ends that didn't quite fit with the otherwise brilliantly polished game, but none of those issues took away from the overall experience.\n\nEven with its issues, this is a must play game for adventure fans.  Its even recommendable to non fans of the genre if you simply enjoy a good story.  I'd recommend some old-fashioned pen and paper (or use the in-game note system) to help with a couple of the puzzles that make sense, but draw on multiple clues.  I'd also recommend lots of saves, since some of the scenes can jump multiple times before giving you back the controls.  (this was mostly only noticeable in the last episode as they closed out a lot of story in that one).  I.E.  lots of back to back cut scenes and conversations while you are itching to try something in the game.","May 28, 2015","true","22.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You get an artfully done flash of red, indicating a rush of blood at the fruitless attempt to boost her preternatural ability. Or take Erica's mobile phone, where you can do anything from choose tags for web searches for entertainment, to have Erica tell you that she doesn't happen to feel like listening to music at the moment, as her brother is currently being tortured. When you break the hand off a statue, in an act of possibly regrettable vandalism, the hand stays behind, instead of disappearing into hammerspace. Details like these can really make a game experience, providing immersion for some truly diverting story or gameplay.\nAnd this is where the game fails. The gameplay is fairly standard for a point-and-click, with a nice flourish from the cognition ability and the very streamlined interaction system, so that's not the problem... No, the game fails on story.\nThe first puzzle turns out to be very simple, something easy to solve while you're still leaning the interface. The madman who has taken Erica's brother has used a makeshift lock to hide in a masoleum, then buried the key out back. Without waiting for backup, Erica and her partner bust into the graveyard, where the only shovel has been cemented into the hand of the 'weeping angel'-style statue. It's a point-and-click, so instead of being able to dig in the loose dirt with her hands, Erica needs to use the hammer from the toolbox to whack off the statue's hand, in order to obtain the shovel to dig. Fine.\nExcept Erica can't dig. The shovel is tainted with the psychic unpleasantness of having whacked her brother in the back of the head. She tries, then tearfully informs the player that she can't use the shovel. An entirely psychic weakness from a psychic isn't very reassuring, and it's conveyed to be on about the same level as a fear of spiders, which is puzzling. It's one of my pet peeves in these sorts of games when the character refuses to do something; not because they couldn't, or it isn't really feasible, but just because they don't want to get their hands dirty. It's a tendency which disproportionately affects female characters. Okay, fine. Maybe I'm being unfair. After all, it's not like psychic abilities don't have downsides too. A blessing and a curse. In any case, Erica goes back to get her male partner and tells him to dig, which he ♥♥♥♥♥es about, but he probably doesn't know about her ability. A secret, double-edged ability, weilded gingerly by a ginger heroine. At this point, I feel like I may have been a bit unfair to label the exchange unreasonably sexist. Erica claims the key from the ground and heads to the front of the masoleum. Then things get really bad.\nFirst of all, in the upcoming exchange, her partner reveals that he knows about Erica's ability, which ruins my headcanon of Erica's careful management of her secret capability. Then again, the entire scene ruins Erica's credibility, and calls into question her ability to reasonably manage anything.\nErica trys the arcane stone wheel key on the makeshift lock, and tries to turn it. It won't turn, not unless someone is standing on the pressure plate. 'It's a trap!' says her partner, fat white male police guy, 'wait for backup!'. 'No!' snarls Erica, 'I'm doing this'. She turns the wheel... and spikes pop out near her legs. 'Stop!' says fat white police guy 'You see, I was right!' (Actually, I think I jumped the gun on his previous line of dialogue, so he doesn't actually say this, he says that instead, but w/e). And then Erica pulls her gun and points it at her partner's head. Erica has an FBI badge in her inventory, and my guess is that it isn't forged. Given that, her pulling of a gun loses all its melodramatic teenager-style charm. Erica should know how to use a gun, and would only pull it in two cases, to incapacitate, aiming at limbs to slow a dangerous target, or to kill, as a last resort. Given how her gun is directed, she's offering to kill her partner for worrying about her safety. Just wait, it gets worse. Turns out the cryptic message scrawled on the door indicates that the murderer who has her brother wants her to drive the spikes into her shins by continuing to turn the wheel. He's watching them through the camera her installed, so he could probably open the door at any time. Erica's plan is... to do it. Her resolution here is utterly baffling after her refusal to lift a shovel. She turns the wheel to do so, and gives shriek indicating low-pain tolerance, even after being totally prepared (if I was being sexist, I would say the shriek was 'manly', due to some studies which indicate that men have, on average, lower pain tolerances. Not everyone bases their sexism on statistically derived fact, however, so I feel that the majority of people would come to the opposite determination, were they being sexist). The door opens, and... the trap springs! Catching her partner in the chest, which Erica seems not too unhappy about. She slumps down the stairs, having difficulty walking on her wounded yet not overly bloody legs, making attractive poses against the walls of the spiral staircase. At this point, I could only come to the determination that the developers were of a sadomasochistic bent, who apart from that (in and of itself, not so shameful) likely enjoyed writing a female character due to all the irrational decisions they could justify with one (which is definately a shame). Erica is supposed to be an FBI agent, something which takes no small amount of work and competance. Instead, she's written like a troubled teenager, which utterly kills the story.","April 16, 2015","false","2.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I'd classify it as more of a horror game, honestly, given the content.  It doesn't seem to be marked for mature audiences either, which I think is a HUGE mistake.\n\nFor people who like a lot of uncensored blood and horror, this is pretty fantastic.  I personally love graphic novels as a storytelling medium, so the look and feel of a gritty comic really appeals to me.  The writing is great, the story is dramatic...very little to be desired there.  The voice acting is also pretty great.\n\nThe game itself...phew.  It's not great.\n\nFirstly, as an adventure game, this is pretty solid.  The puzzles make sense (gasp!) and you're given access to all the things you really SHOULD have as a cop (a gun, a phone, etc), and that gives the whole thing a stronger "no nonsense" feel than other games in the genre.  The cognition mechanic/system is also really cool, not gonna lie.  That's fine.\n\nBut, I'll say this...the game was made with Kickstarter and Unity, and it shows.  It is not well-built.  There are several time trials, which is alright...until you realize that the pause screen doesn't actually pause the game or stop the countdowns.  If you experience any lag - and there's a HORRIBLE amount of lag on some machines (thank you Unity), the time trials suddenly become impossible, giving you 15 seconds of being unable to click on anything, and 5 seconds to choose your action.  (Arguably) Worse, any lag you experience interferes with the cutscenes, making dramatic moments stutter, and sound falls drastically out of sync with what should just be static images.  It's really unfortunate, since story and drama is where the game really shines.\n\nThe artwork for this game is great, but I feel like the whole thing would be better if it was kept in 2D with the graphic novel images.  The character models do have...expressions...sort of...but they look sort of messy and strange to me.  The whole game might just run better without all that.  I don't know.  It seems unnecessary.\n\nLastly, the music is repetitive.  It captures the feel of the game nicely when there's a long enough piece of music in the area, but for crying out loud, the same four bars of ambient atonal sound gets real old real fast when you're wracking your brain trying to figure out how not to die.  A little more variation, and slightly longer tracks, would do wonders.\n\nI'm not going to continue playing this, partly because the content makes me a bit ill (personal preference, I'm sure others would love it), but mostly because it's difficult to play for all the worst reasons.  I could get into this as more of a horror title if it wasn't for the pain when this game doesn't run smoothly, or the interface itself.","March 1, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drachenhexe/recommended/242780/","drachenhexe","Dragonwitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drachenhexe/","514 products in account","On two levels I think this game is brilliant: artistic style of the backgrounds and cut-scenes fits the over tone this game tries to set.  It's subtle, muted, coloful, and simple.  The story itself is complex and deep (and somewhat convoluted) with unexpected twists, interesting concepts, and somewhat original gameplay mechanics.\n\nHowever that's where the briliance in this near disater of a game stops.  The puzzles, while some are clever, are at best average, and the music fares a bit better than average.  Everything else falls dreadfully short of average from horible character models and animation to weak, shallow, and often laughable characters, some horrendous voice acting, and questionable dialogue.\n\nThis amounts to what could have been a greaty story and gaming experience ruined by the way the story itself is told with poor production values in most departments mentioned above, with the voice acting, dialogue, and character animations being the worst of the offenders.  One particular puzzle has its hot spots off, causing you (well, at least me) to select the wrong answers in a critical moment even though you clik the right answer.  And the devs can't tell their left from their right and their center.  One puzzle, after every move, you get the exact same dialogue repeated that takes up 11 seconds before you can move again.  The puzzle is taking forever, just form the stupid repeated, and useless, dialogue.\n\n\nAlso, the actual game engine (Unity) itself detracted much form the experience with several lockups and frequent delays (the engine seems to need time to recover from every action you perform causing a delay of a few seconds before you can take another action).  Also, the default Unity start up screen that asks you about game setting before actually getting into the game is a put off as well.\n\n\nSadly, I cannot recommend this to anyone as an overly enjoyable experience.  You can play this game and you probably won't regret it, but you'll be overly disappointed because this game fall so short of what it could have been.  It borders more on being an amateur title than an indie one.","August 20, 2014","false","19.5"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","1","14","0","0"

By the end it was like trying desperately to watch a DVD with a scratch, or watch a streaming video when your internet keeps dropping out. The game would freeze up on me so I'd have to kill it in task manager. It never happened in the 1st episode, happened twice in the 2nd, happened regularly in the 3rd, and the 4th was nearly unplayable. There's a scene in the 4th where two characters talk in the car, with no opportunity to save partway through in case of a crash. It took me more than a dozen tries to get through that scene, because it kept freezing up in the middle. Honestly, if I wasn't so into the story, I would have given up on it, so take that as you will.\n\nI've glanced at the discussion boards, and it looks like the developers were fighting alot of these issues. It looks like they were very responsive too. But the game is 2.5 years after release, and it still feels like early beta.\n\nOk, technical issues aside, I loved the game. If you play the demo, I just need to say: the game is better. Each episode was better than the previous. Now the 4th episode was an exception... I thought the ending was pretty weak, but I may have just been distracted by the crashes. There were a few little things... Erica's voice actor was obviously working on her accent as the games progressed, so her dialect drifted from midwestern to boston as the games progressed. Still though, the game really was one of the most intense point n clicks I've ever played.\n\nSo I loved the game, except that the freezes ruin it.

It was never so bad that I put it down, but it felt very much like they had stumbled en route to what could have been a legitimately great adventure game.\n\nOverall, I felt that Cognition's highs outshone its lows enough that I would suggest you pick it up - but only on sale.","November 28, 2015","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let´s get those out of the way first.\n\nEpisode 1 isn´t that great. It´s bit meandering and more like an extended tutorial.\nEpisode 2 is merely ok, and acts as a setup for the last act (3 and 4).\n\nUI can be clumsy at times and occasional small bugs crop up (no gamebreakers experienced).\n\nAnd then to good things:\n\nIn general, game has this painted comic book style that works pretty well.\n\nMusic is also definitely good enough and supports the action at hand.\n\nEpisodes 3 and 4 are practically one long episode, and of pretty high quality at that. Puzzle quality goes up, game just flows more smoothly, extra background characters no longer interrupt the story. This is where the meat of the story actually lies. Like most stories, you can find missing things, gaps and perhaps some logical errors at closer examination... But not enough to stop me enjoying it till the end.\n\nEnding was pretty good as well. It has some variability based on your choices too. All in all, I was reasonably satisfied. Especially since I got this game with a discount price. Definitely can´t complain too much.","December 31, 2015","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where do I start?  Let me break this down for you.\n\nStoryline - 10/10 - Absolutely fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic!  And I do not put that lightly.  It's very deep with multiple twists and turns and on top of it all: it is INTENSE.  The term "thriller" for this plot is an understatement.  You will encounter situations and plot twists that will rack your brain, wrench your heart out, and even disturb you greatly.  Simultaneously, you will also find yourself getting rather attached to the characters you encounter and the relationships you develop with them is on point.\n\nGameplay - 8/10 - Controls are simple enough since this is a point-and-click game so you only need the mouse.  The downside is that sometimes things can get a little slow.  For one, there are a few glitches here and there that affect if you can interact with something.  Granted, I only encountered this with a figurine in the very last episode.  So, yes, there are glitches, but they are rare.  On top of that, it can get tedious getting around to different locations and picking up items from certain places, then taking them to other places, etc.  Other than that, the gameplay is very engaging and the puzzles are challenging but not impossible.  Overall, it's very excellent.\n\nArtwork - 10/10 - This is a bloody beautiful game in more ways than one.  The artwork ranges from beautiful, to disturbing, to frightening, to aesthetic, to calm, to intense, etc etc etc.  It's never boring visually with this game.\n\nSoundtrack - 10/10 - Very original soundtrack and it is very fitting for each situation you encounter.  Personally, I love it.\n\nNow, here's my regret.  I did not pay full price for this game.  In fact, I bought it on sale.  But even if I paid the full price, I definitely would have gotten my money's worth and Phoenix Online Studios would deserve every penny.  Trust me when I say, this game is definitely worth the price and I'm praying for a Season Two which I will definitely pay full price for if it is ever released!","November 23, 2015","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If like myself you're a fan of detective games then this is a must. I can't even compare any other games that match it in terms of how well thought out the story is. The twists, murders, story/skills development and style flow seamlessly from episode to episode. This is how episodic games should be done, full stop. The suspense and cliff hangers at the end of each episode have subtly been built up from the beginning of each ep, they're not just thrown at you in the last 5 minutes in hopes to keep you invested long enough to buy the next one.\n\nThe use of the cognition skill works really well in the game. You do equal amounts of normal detective work with a nice topping of physic abilities. You don't feel as Erica is over powered in anyway, even without the powers she makes a kick ♥♥♥ detective. With some top quality voice acting going on I might add.\n\nThe puzzles are original and unique the majority of times. So you don't run the chance of becoming immune to them, you can't just jump head first into them because there's a good chance you could get yourself killed. They're not gonna hold your hand either, there's a level of effort you got to put in.\n\nSo negative point, I found the animations to be a bit jerky, and it would take Erica nearly 10 seconds to register how to  turn around and walk across the room. I don't know whether this was because I played most of the game on the "Fastest" setting (cause's some hilarious glitches in the character model) but for the last ep I did change the settings to beautiful and most of what I just mentioned above disappeared. So do yourself a favour and don't play on the fastest settings; your computer can handle it at peak quality! I was just an idiot.\n\nEnd mark, I give it a 9.5 out of 10.
