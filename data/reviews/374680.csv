Throwing spears is fun enough, but the special attacks are where the game shines. When someone's spring trap launches you off the map and into the jaws of a shark, you can't even be mad about it.\n\n","October 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","19","25","6","0"

(The effect needs changing to be more subtle or removed completely)\n\n- The game also comes across as badly optimised seeing as attaining an acceptable frame seems unlikely even after editing the options to lower features that might affect this like shadow effects and anti-aliasing.\n\n- The game also prevents party chat from steam and while steam says it's being "used in-game" I couldn't get it to work.\n\nConsumer Sidenotes:\n\n- Also this game doesn't have a resolution lower than 1440 X 900  for those of you who may not have a compatible screen size.\n\n- This game also seems to lack a playerbase currently so if you still plan on buying this title be aware finding a match maybe difficult unless you have friends who have this game.\n\nOverall this feels like an early access rather than a full release which needs to resolve these issues to allow for a more enjoyable experience.","October 13, 2015","false","1.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","3"

The power-up traps make the game seriously hilarious, especially when you've got a bunch of people running around in the same place flinging spears like madmen. And, if you get explorative like me, you might even find New and Cool ways to die in lava.

Some of the sound effects can get old quickly and the animations feel a bit repetitive. Great character customization, maybe if the game gets a bit more popularity we could have a market system to purchase new clothes and masks. Good game overall, gives me a bit of nostalagia as it reminds me of Zack & Wiki: Quest For Barbaros' Treasure or Crash Bandicoot.","October 31, 2015","true","0.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

But that doesn't affect my review.\n\nThe game looks nice, I never got to play online because there was no one ever on that I ever saw. So I opened my own server and the game runs well from what I can tell and the maps I played on were big but the sounds got old...really fast, the same couple sounds for picking up heads got really old. I cant comment on the combat just because I never got to play with anyone. Botom line as It is right now the game isn't worth picking up unless there is a bot match added or more people start playing. The game is fun so its a 5/10, Not entirely bad but definitly not worth getting because its online only.","February 5","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Like...where has this game been all my life!?!?\n\nSeriously, its a fun game to play, I just wish more people would discover and play it. So far i've only played by myself, but I have a blast just running aorund chanting tribal jubberish and admiring the stunning visuals\n\nI also love the customization feature of the tikis, customization and being able to make ones character unique, espesially in a multiplayer game, is a huge plus in my opinion\n\nAll in all, totally worth it. 3 bucks and bam, you instantly have a creative, fun little game that you and your buddies can have an absolute blast on","April 11","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
