Straightforward, solid and well done.  Very light combo of hidden object, point-and-click adventure and infotainment.\n\nHere's a link to my video review of the game for JustAdventure.com:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r8oPWJW1u0\n","May 3","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Remind me 'Ween The prophecy' and the good old times of clic based adventure games, with a bit of 'search the  item' style of games. Nice ambiance and arts.\n\nTo the guy who feel it's too short: at this price, i wouldn't expect the game to have 30 hours of gameplay. And if you take time to search instead of using help, it may be more interesting and with a longer play time it think :)\n\nThanks for this nice journey !","November 5, 2015","true","1.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"
