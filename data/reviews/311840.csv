It runs well on modern OS. I have had little to no frame loss or crashing.\n\nI am enjoying it but I played it when I was young. If you buy it please note that it has oldschool UI jank.\nIt does hold up and run well however.\n\nheres a screen shot of the options menu http://imgur.com/iNUBw4I\nI recomend it if you played it back in the day. Its still way better then Wildlife park 2.\n","April 2, 2015","true","0.7"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","33","36","6","0"

The problem is there are serious graphical glitches that render the game unplayable in any mode other than windowed at the lowest resolution. It's difficult to see things and read the text at that size, and it's annoying that I can't play fullscreen.","April 12, 2015","false","0.3"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","29","43","5","1"

I was happy to see that it came out to Steam as my laptop has no CD driver I couldn't play the game anymore, and even better, it has achievements. The only problem is that the Steam version has graphical glitches (the cursor keeps vibrating for me, and the resolution settings is also weird), I hope that this will be fixed. I recommend the game for anyone who enjoys zoo simulators and is not being afraid to try something "retro", I still think that Wildlife Park (and NOT Wildlife Park 2 or 3 or any of the Zoo Tycoon games) is the best in its genre.","August 29, 2015","true","6.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

Old-school type gameplay and old-school graphics but it works really well. When you start out you might want to pay attention to the tutorial because it is difficult to understand some of the animal ♥♥♥♥ without it","April 5, 2015","true","4.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","12","15","4","0"

Even though the graphics could have been better, but hey.. it's an old game now.\n\nThere's a few things I'm missing, like the ability to move a building if you screwed up, but it's minor issues like that.\n\nI have wildlife park and wildlife park two. I bought them at the same time. The reason is, that WLP2 doesn't have trading cards or steam achievements.","August 31, 2015","true","7.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Not as "childhoon Tycoon" games. Stuff was "outgrayed" as if I couldn't afford the stuff, wich was bs cause the game JUST started. So it was fun buying food, water, leaves and some trees.
