"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/329650/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","If you are a fan of the early DOS FPS games such as Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem, Wolfenstein, Blood etc. then Nam is a must-have for your collection. I was never fortunate enough to own this game when it was released in 1998, but even now Nam is a great example of a challenging (though sometimes punishing) game. This is probably (to my knowledge) the oldest FPS title that has strong ties towards realism.\n\nThe game is set during the Vietnam War, you fulfill the role of Alan 'The Bear' Westmoreland, a genetically altered Marine Corps sergeant, you are given different tasks and missions throughout the campaign which could simply be for example a case of elimiating all enemies or destroying a stockpile of enemy ammunition in the dense, hectic jungles of Vietnam. But the most important and difficult task is to simply survive what is ahead of you.\n\nNam uses the Build Engine, the same used by Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior & Blood, if that wasn't obvious enough, so the mechanics are essentially the same as those in the forementioned games, but the difficulty level (even on the easiest settings) is much, much more prominent in Nam. It doesn't take many bullets to kill enemies or yourself, ammunition feels limited and anything explosive will most likely kill you in an instant if you're careless.\nThe game is difficult, which is one of the reasons why I like it. It's not a walk in the park like many other games of the same genre, it is dangerous world in the jungles of Nam where Enemy Snipers, Booby-Traps and suicide bombers roam. The graphics however are one of the things that would ever hinder Nam from getting a 10/10 rating anywhere, even for it's time they were questionable, but could definitely be much worse, the team did a good job with the limited amount of resources they had at their disposal back then.\n\nThis review ended up being a little bit longer than I had planned, but as there are hardly any reviews as of yet I thought it would be good to give you some more insight regarding this excellent game! So to cut a long story short: Nam is a must-have for your collection if you are a fan of old-school FPS shooters and a bonus if you're a fan of a realism factor. Though it's graphics leave much to be desired, it still has that great charm to it that gives you that wonderful nostalgic feeling.\n\nAlso just for your information, I am playing this on Windows 8 and it works perfectly, despite Windows 8 not being listed on the store page.","November 12, 2014","true","8.5"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","52","58","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kailen/recommended/329650/","Kailen","Kailen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kailen/","1108 products in account","This game is bad.  Let's just get that out of the way right now.  If you're going into this game expecting a AAA style shooter (even for the day), you're going to be disappointed.  So why am I giving it a positive recommendation?  Because of what it accomplishes with what it had to work with.\n\nThis is a build engine game.  (Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Blood, etc.)  The engine is limited.  When it came out it was impressive, because its main competition was Doom.  What this engine excelled at was "work-arounds."\n\nThat's what the devs had to do to make something work using this engine.  And work it does.  There's a lot of little tricks used in this game, to varying degrees of success.  A lot of miscellaneous items were all actually the same item, with a different value - displayed in percentage - to determine what it did.  This also meant that there was one collectible item that was randomized.  It could be a health pack, it good be ammo, it could be nothing, it could even explode.  All the same item on the same map, just a different effect when you collect it.\n\nNow, that does mean that a lot of things are not clear until you play with them.  But it does stretch what the engine was capable of, and give a bit more randomization to the game.\n\nBut, is that a good thing?  For most games, probably not.  But again, that is where this game differs.  This is not a traditional Doom or Duke Nukem 3D clone.  Not by any means.  The developers wanted to make this feel more like the war in Vietnam.  (Note: I, like many of you, am too young to have actually been there, but this is a stylized version anyway.)  The enemy is well hidden.  They hide in the trees.  They hide behind bushes.  They hide on ledges, and around corner.  The enemy is hidden, everywhere.  There are land mines, and claymore mines.  They are hard to see.  You have allied planes dropping bombs now and then.  Sometimes with little warning.\n\nWhat all of this means is that you are going to die.  A lot.  And often in very unfair ways.  This game is cruel, this game is brutal.  This game is challenging.  And the ending is totally not worth reaching.\n\nBut it does make the game fairly unique.  It's a noble effort, and I think they pulled off the atmosphere well.\n\nThis is not a game for everyone.  There are also several signs that this was not a very high-budget endeavor.  Some of the graphics are off - and in the case of any indication from the player that you've hit an "end of level" switch - missing altogether.  (When you do so with Duke Nukem, you see his fist come up to press the button.  That is absent here.)  There are a few sound effects held over from Duke Nukem itself.  In essence, this is a bit of a Total Conversion.\n\nBut there is a lot to like.  Some of the level design is interesting and fun.  The enemies are not the standard fare.  The weapons are mostly reskinned and tweaked from Duke Nukem, however, there is a new flame thrower, and a sniper rifle which sadly does not zoom, but does have the scope effect.\n\nNow, as a note, I played this game using EDuke32, in order to have it run more smoothly on my PC.  It does work fine in DOSBox.  You *CAN* change the controls, you just have to start with the configuration and go from there.  (Be sure you set "up" and "down" at the bottom of the keyboard config, otherwise you can't scroll through the menu.  And yea, that's pretty bad design.)  You will also probably want to adjust the mouse Y scaling as high as it will go, and note that what they call "inverted" is not.  This WILL make the default game play more like a modern FPS.\n\nIf you can get this game cheap, and you know what you're getting into, then by all means pick it up.  But just know that this game is going to be unfair, unforgiving, and jury-rigged together to give the experience.","June 15, 2015","true","6.1"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","43","49","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/recommended/329650/","praisecheadle","c5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/","1138 products in account","I'm a huge fan of the classic Build Engine shooters such as Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, and Blood, so I was surprised that I had never heard of Nam before it popped up on Steam. After playing through the singleplayer campaign, I now know why.\n\nThe basic shooting action of Nam is enjoyable and I had fun with the game overall, but unfortunately Nam falls into the trap of lazy production and bad game design too often to be considered a true classic. Like i said before, the shooting aspect of this game is solid. Enemies go down in one or two shots and the player character doesn't survive much more, which makes for some tense, thrilling shootouts when the game decides to play fair. The difficulty kind of reminded me of Hotline Miami and this is definitely a game where you'll be saving anytime you kill an enemy. What also impressed me is that even though this is an arcade shooter at heart and not really "realistic", the enemy placement does actually seem to conform with the tactics used by the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War. Usually enemies are hiding around corners or behind plants, meaning they can take you by surprise quite often and you'll oftentimes find yourself shooting blindly into the jungle to try and wipe out as many as you can before walking into their hands. It is these moments when Nam is at its most interesting, and the number of deaths you will go through during the game's 14 or so singleplayer levels will definitely drive home how effective the tactics the Viet Cong used in the Vietnam War were. Beating each level genuinely felt like an accomplishment and trying to get through without dying was an intense game of survival. There are really only three or four kinds of enemies (grunts, suicide bombers, tanks, and snipers), and while I usually rag on games for lack of enemy variety, I didn't feel like that was a detriment here, as the enemies the game does have provide more than enough challenge.\n\nUnfortunately, Nam's moments of quality are severely hampered by some bad design decisions and lazy production choices. The main thing that drove me insane in this game were the landmines and airstrikes. Each level is littered with green landmines that blend with the grass. You generally won't see these until it's too late, so tossing some grenades or rockets into an area you're about to enter is advisable. I guess the landmines fit in with the theme of realistic Viet Cong tactics and again it does drive home how hard it would be to survive in such a situation, but from the standpoint of game design they just added cheap fake difficulty and didn't really do anything to make the combat more enjoyable. You'll also find yourself being driven insane by so-called "friendly" airstrikes. Throughout the levels, you can find radios to call in an airstrike on the area ahead, which is pretty cool and fun. Unfortunately, this game has tons of airstrikes that you don't call for and these can happen very quickly, giving you little time to take cover sometimes. The game also has a "bleeding" mechanic where you can gradually lose health over a period of time, but the bleeding doesn't seem to happen logically. When you get shot, you instantly lose health, but don't bleed. Instead, bleeding seems to be caused by bumping into certain walls and corners, and sometimes by jumping. The fact that the bleeding only seems to happen when your health is in single digits does not help things, and overall it makes for a pointless and annoying mechanic. Furthermore, some of the level designs employ some really bad game design choices. One of the levels near the end has a part where you need to drop down from a fall-damage inducing height not once, but twice in a row, and doesn't give you any compensation for it, which takes a massive chunk of health away from you and made the level unwinnable for me until I reloaded an earlier save where I had more health. With that said, when the levels were good, the shootouts were fun, but this game really does make some boneheaded mistakes that are detrimental to its enjoyment.\n\nFurthermore, this game has lots of rough edges and parts where you can obviously see cut-corners and half-implemented ideas. Where other Build games such as Blood and Shadow Warrior had their own identity, this game constantly reminds you that it's basically a mod of Duke Nukem 3D. Lots of sprites and art assets are recycled from Duke, which is fine for some things like environmental textures, but then you've got the shotgun ammo box using the same bright-red sprite as it did in Duke, which doesn't fit in with the Vietnam theme and the general look of the game's new content. The game also uses Duke's grunts of pain when you get shot, which is jarring, as the newly recorded lines for this game's character sound nothing like Duke's voice. As for the new art assets, they really aren't that good, even by build engine standards. Duke, Shadow Warrior, and Blood all had beautiful sprites that make those games look great despite their age. This game (which came out 2 years after Duke) on the other hand looks like most of it was drawn in MS-Paint. The tanks are cartoony and have no presence in the world (previous games on this engine avoided this through skillfully detailed sprites), and while the Viet Cong enemies are reasonably detailed, American forces look downright amateur (although they're kind of cute in a goofy way). Also, the weapons are renders of cheap-looking 3D models and the weapon sprites really haven't been worked with to make them look particularly good in the engine. It might sound harsh to criticize a game from 1998 for its graphics, but compared to games that came out two years before (again, Duke 3D and the like), this game doesn't hold up. The environments aren't bad looking, but that's mainly because they reuse Duke 3D textures.\n\nThis game did try to add a few interesting things to the Build Engine formula, but unfortunately most of the new features are half-implemented or otherwise broken. One cool thing this game attempts is that it has NPC's who do things and sometimes talk to you. For the characters that give you the mission objectives, this works well, but once you start trying to use the combat NPC's, things fall apart. There's a medic you can talk to who heals you back to full health, and you can ask him to follow you, which is useful and he generally doesn't have any issues navigating flat terrain (although the NPC's can't jump, so they won't follow you through the whole level). Overall, the medic's pretty impressive, so he gets a pass. Next up is the gunner, and this is where everything falls apart. You can ask gunners to follow you around, so you would expect them to provide backup, but unfortunately they don't seem to actually shoot anything, making their entire existance pointless. Furthermore, there are only two or three levels that try to involve these NPCs beyond the briefing guy at the beginning of most levels, so the game really doesn't make use of its friendly NPCs (other than the medic) in any meaningful combat capacity. The game also peppers "Viet Cong Ammo" throughout several levels. You can't use it in your own guns, so for half the game, I was wondering what the point was. Then, in exactly one level, I came across a mounted gun that supposedly uses this ammo.  I hit the use key and a message came up saying "you need Viet Cong Ammo to fire this gun", even though I literally just picked up some that was lying next to the gun. It's a mechanic that only actually shows up in one level despite being teased in several, only to not work when it does show up.\n\nFor all the ragging I've done on this game, I did have fun with it when the level design was good, and the bad parts don't destroy it. I wouldn't reccomend it as an introduction to 90's shooters, nor would I say it's worth $7, but if you've already beaten the Build classics and can get it for about $1.70 like I did, it's fun. It's not a classic, but it's not awful either.","December 13, 2014","true","5.1"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","36","41","2","2"

There is the whole "you're a genetically engineered experimental soldier", but gameplay-wise it's just a game about the War of Vietnam. The game really does a lot for immersion, putting you right in the middle of hell itself. There are several vietnamese and american bombers flying low all over almost every level, dropping bombs at random intervals everywhere, there are vietcong ambushes waiting for you, anti-tank guns, snipers, booby traps, mines, napalm and many other ways of killing or getting killed in this game. You'll play some missions during the night and you even get to use night vision googles, which are actually helpful, by the way. In some missions, you'll get that Apocalypse Now feeling of being stranded deep in enemy territory and slowly going mad by all the ♥♥♥♥ you're seeing and doing. That's how good the atmosphere in this game is. Soundtrack really adds into it, some songs are downright batshit insane combinations of slow, eerie sounds and fast string instruments. It's amazing.\n\nAbout the gameplay, expect the exact same as Duke Nukem 3D. It's as simple as that. NAM is just a remake, stand-alone game of a mod called Platoon made with Duke Nukem 3D. You move at the exact same speed, you jump the exact same way, you shoot and duck just the same. You have 6 weapons at your disposal, including a M-16, a M-60 machinegun, a shotgun, a KA-BAR combat knife, a granade launcher and a rocket launcher. While there is plenty of ammo for the M-16 and M-60, you'll have to think before shooting the other guns, since they are essential to getting out of hell alive and you won't trip into rocket ammo every 2 minutes. Talking about thinking, get ready not to run and gun. The game is hard as balls and, unless you already played it and know exactly where to go and what to look after, you'll be ambushed every thirty seconds and it takes only a couple of seconds of fire from a single guy to ♥♥♥♥ your game up. The game is really, really short: There are two tours of duty with six missions each, I've completed the game in only four hours, but I remember taking weeks of play when I was younger to find out how to play, where to go and how to stay alive.\n\nIf you like old 3D shooters and have a least a little bit of a fall for the Vietnam War, like most of us do, get this game, you'll love it.\n\nGameplay - 7/10\nSoundtrack - 9/10\nGraphics - 7/10\nContent - 5/10\nChallenge Level - 10/10\nReplayability - 5/10","June 19, 2015","true","4.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

First off, It's a Build engine game, so right off the bat I knew I would get at least some enjoyment out of it.  If you love Duke Nukem 3D and can't get enough even with all the add ons and community maps, then for a a few bucks during a Steam Sale I'd say go for it.  Everyone else, best pass.  NAM is basically a cross between Duke 3D and a campy Reb Brown war movie but without the budget and polish of either.  It's super cheesy to an enjoyable point how seriously it seems they were trying to take the Vietnam War immersion, but that's also it's main downfall.  Let's be totally fair though, how many great Vietnam War games do you know of?  It's not exactly a theme destined for any Game of the Year awards...\n\nThe Pros:\n-It's a build engine game and unavoidable for fans of the style for that reason alone, at least in my opinion\n-The theme is so-bad-its-good territory with ridiculous sound effects and "story elements", i.e. badly acted war movie tropes played out by pixelated soldier with 2 frames of animation and blank expressions like simpletons.\n-Level design is at least a bit interesting.  Seems like they put some effort into it, despite some glaring flaws (see below).\n-Configuration, while super old-school, is robust enough to set your controls like a modern FPS with WASD and mouse aiming.\n-Cheap, at least when it's on sale\n\nThe Cons:\n-The level designer was a huge troll.  This is by far the biggest flaw in the game, making it a bit of a save crawl and extremely frustrating on a regular basis.  Mines are almost impossible to see, enemies are almost impossible to see, and most of all, there are air strikes.  Considering you can't look or down easily, you are going to die randomly and unavoidably because of these damned airstrikes.  While not a total deal-killer, I've so far found myself just done with it after only 20 minutes at a time.  I'd play a lot longer in a sitting if it'd just stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off for a 5 minutes now and then.\n-The sound is just sort of all around bad.  Don't get me wrong, that's part of the fun here too, but the background soundclips are just so inappropriate for ambience because you just can't tell if gunshots are actually being fired at you.  Also, get ready to hear "MEDIC!" being shrieked at you every 30 seconds in a weird distorted voice oddly reminiscent of a cat being stepped on.\n-You'll need to ok with running a 1990s style DOS setup to change pretty much anything besides volume and gamma.  You'll also need to muck about in the controls a bit to update everything to a more sensible scheme for modern mouse and keyboard gameplay.  I'm not sure why, but I also have to run this every single time I play because the game won't start if you try and just go straight into it.  Odd.\n\nIn summary, if you like old-school shooters and 90s cheese, and you're not too prone to rage quitting, it's worth picking up on sale.  Not sure I'd have paid the full $7 for it, but it's a good distraction for a half hour at a time.  I wouldn't so much describe it as "quality" (or "playtested") but it's at least competent enough for some mindless fun, and if you've already worn out Duke 3D and Shadow Warrior you might as well give this one a go.\n\n","December 13, 2014","true","1.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Old school FPS. You know what one of the best old school engines is that just oozes an old school vibe? The Build engine. And NAM runs on the Build engine. Run this with eduke32 and you even have proper widescreen support and exceptional mouse movement. Just being in this game is an absolute brilliant experience. Yeah sure the animations are bad to non-existant (especially reloading), but the atmosphere is still unmistakably there. From the sound design to the dated, yet nostalgic graphics, it is just fantastic to control and play this FPS.\n\nThat is until you get to any gameplay. I'm pretty sure that changing difficulty has next to no effect on anything. With that in mind, even the weakest enemy will end you from full life and armor to nothing in under 1 second. You will get sniped from offscreen without any visible possibility of seeing your enemy. You will get rocketed from offscreen without any visible possibility of seeing your enemy. You will have to run up and die, remember their location, and reload. Don't take too much time either or the occasional enemy will sneak up behind you, then you'll die and have to reload again. You will die to land mines that have no visible indicator whatsoever. You will have to memorization their location, die and reload again. You will die to seemingly randomly placed overhead airstrikes, attempt to memorize their location, die, reload, then die again because the airstrike happened somewhere else. You will try to memorize the location of every tree on every level, because enemies that you cannot see will shoot you from them, oftentimes again from offscreen. Oftentimes you will be ambushed by multiple enemies when you are out in the open as you learn where certain trigger spots are. You will die, reload, and prepare better. Ad nauseam. All this may not be so bad if again you didn't die from even the weakest enemy in a split second.\n\nThis game might have been okay if it didn't beg to break your Quicksave and Quickload keys or had any semblance of fairness given to the player. Classic engine, absolutely not a classic game. Thumbs down.","May 25","false","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I own both Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior and they have flawless controls. Blood on here has customizable controls....but for some odd reason it won't let you (me) use the mouse buttons to actually change anything. So I'm stuck with remapping the controls strictly with the keyboard which has mixed results. Which brings me to NAM....which has the worst controls that I've ever had to endure....and there is no changing them. So you are stuck with moving via the arrow keys....jumping with the A (!!!) key.....and firing with Ctrl. I didn't bother to learn any of the other keys because I kept getting killed by random mortar fire. What is really interesting....is that you can get within a few feet of the mortar team that is causing you so much grief....but they are invulnerable.

There are build engine mods with better gameplay than this and this even feels like a mod due to its reuse of DN3D sounds and some art. The gameplay is linear corridors of trees (yes, this game is more linear than Call of Duty, I'm not even joking) and you will be randomly killed by planes dropping bombs and invisible mine fields. You have to save every few steps and/or memorize where mines are by constantly dying in order to progress. Does constantly dying due to scripts you couldn't know in advance to avoid and invisible mines sound fun? Because it will happen. A lot. The enemies are just basic human enemies, obviously, and there is nothing particularly interesting or fun about fighting them. Same goes for your own weapons. The grenade launcher doesn't even have physics, it just shoots straight forward like the rocket launcher.\n\nStick to DN3D, Blood, and Shadow Warrior. This game is not just bad, it is one of the worst games I've ever played. This is Paint Brawl levels of bad.\n\nTLDR, Horrible linear level design, boring gunplay, and constantly being killed by invisible mines and airstrikes regardless of skill.","August 9, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It even reuses some of the sounds and sprites. Unlike Duke3D, NAM tries to be more realistic and features guns that were actually used in the Vietnam war. The weapons look nice and are fun. Most of the enemy sprites, on the other hand, are pretty lackluster. The maps are very open, and there are multiple paths to explore. You often have to flank your enemies to survive. Playing a level for the first time you will often die from unpredictable airstrikes and other random explosions. Also there are very view details. Everything looks just green and brown. The maps are littered with invisible walls. Generally the level design is pretty weak in comparision to Duke3D or Shadow Warrior. The same goes for the uninspired soundtrack that was probably composed and performed by keyboard cat. Despite all of these downsides the game is still surprisingly fun! The voice acting is cool and there are even friendly NPCs you can interact with. If you love old "2.5D" ego shooters, you will have fun with this. I'll definitely keep playing.

You are always meeting new people, having to sell yourself and your skills, and often getting the third degree about what you know or don't know. And, you have to stay upbeat and enthusiastic throughout each interview.Here are job interview tips to help prepare you to interview effectively. Proper preparation will help alleviate some of the stress involved in job interviews and the more you prepare, the more comfortable and successful you will be interviewing.\n\nHere are 7 Job interview Tips\n\nPractice\n\nPractice answering interview questions and practice your responses to the typical job interview questions and answers most employers ask. Think of concrete examples you can use to highlight your skills. Providing evidence of your successes is a great way to promote your candidacy. Also have a list of your own questions to ask the employer ready.\n\n\nResearch\n\nDo your homework about the employer and the industry so you are ready for the question What do you know about this company? Know the interviewer's name and use it during the job interview. If you're not sure of the name, call and ask prior to the interview. Try to relate what you have learned about the company when answering questions.\n\n\nGet Ready\n\nMake sure your interview attire is neat, tidy and appropriate for the type of firm you are interviewing with. Bring a nice portfolio with copies of your resume. Include a pen and paper for note taking.\n\n\nBe On Time\n\nBe on time for the interview. On time means five to ten minutes early. If need be, take some time to drive to the interview location ahead of time so you know exactly where you are going and how long it will take to get there. Here's more on preparing for an interview.\n\n\nStay Calm\n\nDuring the job interview try to relax and stay as calm possible. Remember that your body language says as much about you as your answers to the questions. Proper preparation will allow you to exude confidence. Take a moment to regroup. Maintain eye contact with the interviewer. Listen to the entire question (active listening) before you answer and pay attention - you will be embarrassed if you forget the question. Check out these tips for avoiding job interview stress to help stay calm. Also review our interview tips for introverts.\n\n\nShow What You Know\n\nTry to relate what you know about the company when answering questions.  When discussing your career accomplishments match them to what the company is looking for. Use examples from your research when answering questions, “I noticed that when you implemented a new software system last year, your customer satisfaction ratings improved dramatically. I am well versed in the latest technologies from my experience with developing software at ABC, and appreciate a company who strives to be a leader in its industry.” Here's how to make a match between your expertise and the company's requirements.\n\n\nFollow Up\n\nAlways follow-up with a thank you note reiterating your interest in the position. You can also include any details you may have forgotten to mention during your interview. If you interview with multiple people send each one a personal thank you note. Send your thank you note (email is fine) within 24 hours of your interview.","April 9, 2015","true","1.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","44","7","16","8","0"

The biggest problem is the punishing difficulty level; hitscan enemies that can see you through thick vegetation while you cannot see them aren't really the most fun to fight against (and neither are landmines or mortar bombardments), so you're probably better off playing this on easy straight away.

This is basically a Duke Nukem 3D MOD for people who take war far too seriously.\n\nI am not one of those people.\n\nI'd never have even heard of this MOD if it weren't for eDuke32 - I wonder if perhaps some of the same developers worked on it. Actually, I don't think I should call it a MOD as it's a standalone game which doesn't require Duke to play. BUT - it's not quite a Total Conversion as there are still some elements of Duke's art and SFX in Nam.\n\nBut yeah. It's a drab, deadly serious attempt at recreating the Vietnam war experience in the Build engine. It's playable, but it's VERY difficult - downright unfair at times. Perhaps that's the idea. I don't know. I like Duke because of it's hyper-realism. I don't buy games to simulate real life. That's what real life is for. And war is an element of real life I certainly don't want to experience.\n\nIf you do... then go for it. Knock yourself out.

Comes with console commands, anti-aliasing, mouse movement and much more smooth jazz!\n\nWith that in mind, playing NAM through EDUKE32 isn't required but it is great for those who are on a nostalgia binge and can't get past the state of the current game.\n\nNAM itself started out as a Duke Nukem total-conversion called "Platoon" and was pretty damn good for what it was, and while I'm not sure what led the dev team to jump into the indie-scene I'm quite glad they did, even if their product was panned at the time of release for it's engine and graphics.\n\nGameplay wise, NAM is quite hard and in some areas is unfair, with airstrikes routinely killing you moreso then the Vietcong scrambling out of the woodwork. However, the meaty gunplay and pretty damn articulate level design (for the build engine) kept dragging me back in. The Story included in the original manual is laughable but is not necessary to enjoy the game entirely. Just shoot VC and don't get blown up.\n\nGraphics and sound is pretty good for the build engine but those who judge by graphics will not be pleased, as even at the time of release NAM wasn't the best looker.\n\nLong story short, NAM is a brainless shooter and has a certain niche amongst older FPS fans and is a favorite in the Duke Nukem modding scene. So grab both NAM and Eduke and kick back for a couple of hours, but make sure to watch your head, those damn airstrikes will certainly get you more then once.","May 12","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Infogrames did a remake with better art with the product manager from the game Blood (One Unit Whole). U.S. Marine Sergeant Dan Snyder helped with the computer simulation training for American troops with a Doom army mod.\nNAM was published on the Steam platform in 2014 where people can buy a virtual copy of the game.\nA sequel to NAM is World War II GI which is also developed and published by the same studios and runs on the same engine.\n\nIn NAM you play as Alan Westmoreland ( also known as The Bear), a U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant during the Vietnam War in 1966.\nIn fact you are in service of the Central Intelligence Agency and you are genetic engineered to become a super human war machine.\nYou are given standard military orders and most of the time you wander alone or you are assisted by small teams.\nIn order to survive you have to fulfill several tours of duty in order to show that the side effect of the serum can be overcome.\n\nDuring the game you have to deal with ambushes, booby traps such as anti-personnel mines, firefights, gas, air strikes, snipers, tanks, cannons and many more who will block your path towards the end of every level.\nIn some levels you receive help from AI U.S. Marines like a medic.\n\nFor me the game is everything except easy because of the high presence of hostile surprise elements in each level which I really liked because it makes the game quite challenging.\nSaving multiple times while playing NAM is a good thing to do but don't do this when you are being shot or wandering through large open areas otherwise your saved progress can be a total disaster by limitless dying when the save game is being loaded.\n\nI really enjoyed this game because of the looks and feels that blend in very well even though it is pixel art.\nIf you have played the Doom series, Duke Nukem 3D, Blood (One Unit Whole), Shadow Warrior, Redneck Rampage you will probably like this game because of the Build game engine.\nI highly recommend this game to people who like challenging retro pixelated first-person shooters with great gameplay and level design, certainly when the game is on sale!\n","February 24","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played, even knew, this game although it's from the year i became 18.\nthen the dying ... this game has such bad controls and such fierce enemies that even on the rookie setting (yeah, i tried that one too after being pummeled to death on the normal setting) i could not manage to get past the first level; heck i couldn't even get past the first ZONE of the first level... (you start on an open area dropped by a heli, then you see some bamboo "forest" where you need to go through...) by the time i'm running between the bamboo i've already lost half my health... i did manage to pick up an m60 in the basement of a small building in front of the heli and tons of ammo... but every time you stand still for a few seconds you get shot by enemies you cannot see ... if you see someone running in the far distance; do not stop and aim for him because in the meanwhile other guys are shooting you and you can't see them.\nthis game just isn't fun... you cannot edit controls (arrow keys are fine for me, but then at least fix the other controls to be around the arrow keys so you don't have to search for them on the other side of your keyboard; also moving forward with the mouse... have they ever even tried this game???) whatsoever and there is no 'list' of the controls either so you have to find out yourself IF you can jump, duck, look up/down, and so forth....\n\nin my opinion, at this state the game is worth dog sh!t, but only the bit that's left over after you scooped the hump from the ground... the other part is more worth than the game because you'll have more fun when you put it in a bag, leave it in front of the front-door, set the bag on fire and ring the doorbell...  or you could put some explosive fireworks in it and place it in someone's letterbox and see what happens... yeah, those things are waaay more fun than playing this so called game...","February 15","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
