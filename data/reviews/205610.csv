I'm an avid fan of the Port Royale series, and loved Port Royale 2. I was nervous getting this will all the mixed reviews, so it took me well over a year to finally go through with it.\n\nOverall, I thought it was pretty good. For anyone wanting a comparison of this to Port Royale 2, they are very similar in most aspects, with some differences good and bad. First off, trading in port looks very different. There's a slider to select the amount, as well as green and red bars to tell you how over or understocked (and priced) a particular item is. A lot of people hate this new layout, but it's really not that bad if you can get used to it. The town palace now holds both a town administrator and sometimes a governor to hand out distinct missions. This is a bit unbalanced, especially once you advance in rank, as bringing lets say 67 crates of tobacco can get you a hundred thousand dollar bonus. One thing I HATED was the nation's reputation system. It drops way too quickly on it's own, that unless you're constantly doing missions you're going to be stuck at 25. Also, when two nations form an alliance, your reputation between them gets averaged. This is the most frustrating thing when you're trying to take over a town economically and suddenly your 100% reputation gets dropped down to sixty because your mother nation decides to form a treaty. Fortunately, this also means that nations that hate you get bored pretty quick. Still, they can pack quite a nasty punch if you're not prepared. War is also completely different, but in a way I enjoy. Each convoy uses 3 armed ships each battle, and you control all 3. It's a bit tougher to fight and board enemy ships, but now you can't make a fortune capturing and selling Ship of the Lines. There's a really dumbed down system for attacking in the harbors. Most nations will first have anywhere between 3 and 10 military convoys you have to fight through to make it to the harbor, instead of the max of 1 in the previous game. And thank goodness they got rid of those annoying harbor cannons that would completely obliterate your fleet one ship at a time. Instead, you send in your three ships that park, bomb the heck out of a fort, and then unload your soldiers for a land battle. Pirates have no fort, just a gazillion soldiers. Luckily, they are a lot easier to take down this way later on, if not more difficult in the early stages. The last part I really like is that you can take over pre-existing towns forming your own nation (Long live the free people of America!). This can be done either economically (own 75% of a prosperous town, and then go whine to the Viceroy and he'll probably just give it to you). Or you can attack the town and annex it for yourself! If the nation you attacked liked you enough before, they'll let you keep it. Also, there is no more waiting til a nation is weak enough to annex a town.\n\nThe only DLCs that seem to do much is Harbor Master. None of the campaigns seem to amount to much compared to the sandbox game. Still, the new buildings are very effective in preventing droughts, outbreaks, pirate attacks, etc. Ship building is pretty cool, if not expensive and time consuming. Still, it's better than having to travel port to port searching for that particular ship you want.\n\nOverall I recommend giving this game a shot. Not sure if it's all worth $30, but if you get it during a good sale I say go for it!","November 29, 2013","true","103.8"," 147 of 156 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","147","156","0","1"

Despite starting to play a buggy and unstable release, I really enjoyed it. The gameplay is amazing, in my opinion, and by now all the bugs are gone (as far as I can tell, at least).\nThe main idea in the game is to either be a pirate and build your own naval empire, or be a trader (my personal preferred choice) and build a huge merchant fleet, and later on gain control over cities.\n\nThe game takes place in the Caribbeans, during the European colonization in America. Therefore, you can choose to be either Spanish, English, French or Dutch, but you're not limited to trading just with your country's own colonies. Also, even for people like me, who aren't die-hard fans of "Pirates Of The Caribbeans", it's impossible to miss the connection. :)\n\nThe trading mechanism is quite realistic, and is a lot of fun, as you need to start small, trading stuff yourself, until you get rich and famous enough to buy more ships and more goods, so you can buy more ships and build businesses in cities, so you can manufacture goods yourself, which is obviously cheaper than buying them from someone else.\n\nIf you're into trading simulation, get this game. You won't be sorry.","July 25, 2013","true","243.2"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","55","60","0","0"

This game is a huge disappointment compared to that, you don't need to ever trade manually, you can simply start out with a strong trade route on the first day that generates 20k gold each month. If you try to fight pirates, you need to get at least 400k-500k gold to spend on warships to have a chance of defeating the weakest convoys even on the first day they appear.\nThe campaign maps are horrible, they're just long tutorials (and can be finished within an hour or two).\n\nIf you haven't played PR2 and are looking for a trading sim, this game might be good for you, though I'd still recommend trying to get a working version of Port Royale 2 instead.\n\nSo, what does the game offer?\nTrading around the Caribbean, production differs in each city, prices change with supply and demand.\nPossibility to attack convoys and cities to plunder or even capture them.\nMissions (get X amount of Y goods in a month, find something on the ocean with some hints and deliver it), treasure maps, random "drops" you might find in the water (and you have to spot it and pick it up because it disappears after some time).\nDynamic wars between the 4 nations, respect with each of them and reputation in every city (modifies possible missions).\nSetting up production facilities in cities to create your own goods (which is cheaper than buying them, so more profit).\nEvents in cities like plague or gold rush, they modify production, life quality, demand for some resources.\nControl over multiple fleets (based on rank), each having one or more ships, they can be set on automated traderoutes (very easy to set up a profitable one, once you've done it it's AFK Simulator 2000).\nMutliplayer (haven't tried it, can't say anything about it) - the only thing Port Royale 2 does not have.","December 31, 2013","false","11.9"," 59 of 74 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","59","74","0","0"

Different towns have different produce and needs. You buy where it's cheap and sell where it's expensive. The more goods you buy of a particular type in a town, the more it rises in cost and vice versa. Later on it seems to get a bit more complex, you'll be able to establish trade routes and so on, but on the grand scale of all, it's simply buying and selling.\n\nBut there is so much more baked in. Maintaining reputation, new ships, crew, equipment, battling pirates and different factions, plundering, gathering influence in a town so you can start your own production, managing settlements, doing quests. I was incredibly surprised by the sheer massiveness of a game that seemed so simple.\n\nMy only "gripe" with this game is that the different ways you can lose is not emphasized enough. 4 hours in and I was almost completly wrecked. The game went from "this is to easy" to "is this the same game?!!" in such a small time window. Still, I'm looking forward to restarting as much as it takes to win (Shogun 2 player haha).","June 17, 2015","true","7.9"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","35","38","0","0"

In fact I disagree enough to positively recommend this game.  Port Royale 3 is a trading and economy simulator with minor RTS elements.  It's not a perfect game, of course: boat combat is best left on autopilot, as is most of your trade empire.  That said, the challenge lies in learning the somewhat mystifying AI, fanaggling trade routes to suit the needs of the economy, and so on.\n\nIf you are an econ nerd like me or simply fall for the simple charm of the story spun around Elena, daughter of the Viceroy of Port Royale, then give this game a try.  At its sale price, it's not too shabby.\n\nI would be remiss to not address the Metacritic score of 54 however.  Upon review of, uh, these reviews, I have determined that most of Port Royale 3's detractors succumb to puerile "it's not as good as Port Royale 2" grognardism.  For better or worse, I never played Port Royale 2 and therefore take this game solely on its own merit.

If you're buying it for the trading get it, if you're buying it for the combat look elsewhere.\n\nThe trading simulation is very good, much better than PR1 or PR2. Auto trade routes are very easy to set up as well, and it's easy to become a millionare fairly quickly on normal. If that puts you off just select "my strategy" and see how that pans out. Having buildings that produce and need various goods adds another aspect to think about. It's a bit difficult to plan without a map listing the resources, but I'm sure they have one online somewhere. In any case, if you hit the middle mouse button over a town in the map view, it'll show you the resources that town produces.\n\nThe combat is... terrible. There's really no reason to do anything but auto battles anymore. I remember PR1, where you had massive battles (I think 10v10, it was a long time ago), and here you're stuck with a maximum of 3v3. As far as I can tell, you can't adjust the speed of your ships (or even tell how many knots they're going), and sometimes they randomly switch ammunition from what I selected. And trying to board a ship makes me want to pull out my hair. I had a set of 3 Liners with 250 men apiece lose 4/5 of their health and half the crew against a ship at a virtual standstill with 1 sailor and 3 hp left until they finally managed to board after I held down the spacebar for three minutes and my ships grinded against it for twenty seconds at a time until the boarding icon showed up. This happens nearly every time I attempt to board. And taking control and ramming the enemy ship myself never helps either. It's aggravating, to say the least.\n\nI also remember the challenge and feeling of accomplishment when I annexed a town after expertly manouvering my ships to avoid cannon fire from shore. Now all that happens is you click a ship, click a spot. Click a ship, click a spot. Click a ship, click a spot. Wait for fortress to be destroyed. Repeat for other fortress. Click a spot for a land battle. No more picking formations for your sailors. The lack of challenge and variability is awful.\n\nOther minor things:\n\nThe graphics are fairly nice and it's fun to be able to rotate the map, something the first game couldn't do. The "campaigns" were very similar to each other and even had some tutorials on how to do the same stuff. And a tiny gripe is that there weren't a ton of flags to pick from, maybe seven in different colors. Not very fun. It would be cool to have an option to make your own flag. I also think player mods would be great, maybe someone would fix the combat system. And a few achievements seem broken. I've captured several towns but none of the "Veni, Vidi, Vici" ones have popped, and it's impossible to get "Checkmate" as you aren't allowed to annex a town if there are only two left. Frustrating.","February 7, 2014","true","18.4"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

You then buy that product somewhere else and send your ship to sell it in that town. There is a little bit more to it, as you can buy buildings in towns and at some point there are enemy ships to worry about and such, but in a nutshell this is it.\n\nI thought the trade aspect would be much deeper than that. Despite all the changing numbers and stats in various menu's, this seems like a shallow game to me.\n\nAn important aspect is the graphics. The game looked good in screenshots and I could really use a mini-vacation. Although it does at first look appealing, you qickly realise that all the cities and islands look the-bloody-same!\n\nI don't get it....maybe someone can explain it to me what I missed, but I do not get it, and so I kind of lost interest very quickly.","March 21, 2015","false","3.8"," 55 of 76 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","55","76","0","0"

Well I have - .\nJust imagine being in a time where you have more control over life - no atomic bombs just cannons swords and primitive guns and your own skills.\nYou travel from town to town as a merchant buying and selling and if you are good at it you amass quite a lot of money.\nYou make a lot more when you gain experience and title then you get assignments from towns - and oh how good is that - you feel good because the town folk or government leaders talk with you and want you to marry there daughters.\n\nGoing into a harbour which you eventually govern yourself if you take it by force or earn the right because you set up your businesses succesfully.\n\nIt is simply idealistic when you have a wife who feeds you gossip and says nice things to you and you put on a fair for the town via the church then when the fair is going you look back over the ocean , parks beaches and watch the fire works at dusk and all your town folk are happy and celebrating.\nYou watch the sun setting over the ocean at dusk with the golden cloud wisps - just brilliant.\n\nwhen you get good at fighting then when you aquire a letter of mark to fight a governments enemy you attack their treasure ships and really make a lot of money, like $1,000,000 plus their ships where by if you are systematic and patient you can build your towns, you govern, to the maximum defence and then they are fairly secure. You also collect taxes.\n\nIt is great to have all these business's making goods for you and if you are savy you can sell all of it and keep the money flowing.\n\nFighting is just so rewarding - my method - don't know whether it is the best or not, but works for me - is you build up to a convoy of 2 liners, 2 carracks, and 2  caravels. You go in with  a liner a carrack and a caravel. The graphics are the best I cannot emphasise how good it is and also the music is very very beautiful.\n\nYou have to have tons of chain shot, grape shot and regular shot (infinite).\nImmediatly when the battle starts you select "attack my convoy", and chain shot for the sails  and all 3 boats shoot the sails out of one boat quickly then choose another boat to attack shoot its sails out etc.\nFollow up by shooting all the crew and boarding 2 of the enemy boats if 3 enemy then after that run around and collect all the swimming crew in the ocean by clicking "give me a hand"  then board the last boat after you have shot out its remaining crew.\nHaving 3 different boats to fight with makes it a lot easier to choose which boat to control.\n\nThe trading is so well set up - that is the trade route convoys - which you need to do early as my memory isn't good enough to remember where you are upto with many convoys and tasks to complete etc. So some automation helps imensly.\n\nThe harbour graphics are simply beautiful except when there is a drought.\nThe minister in the churches where you can get missions but more importantly you get married and have celebrations etc is a kindly voice very rewarding.\n\nThe governor cgi is very good although more could be done there - like your father in law could have more interesting things to say to you when you take his towns by force etc.\n\nI think the world view to harbour view is the best in this game the down side is when you look seaward  at convoys coming and going they just appear (only way you can do it) or dissapear aproaching the horizon. In "rise of venice" the different aproach is good but loose the realism of towns being a long way apart so look like suburbs instead. Still good just the choice the devs need to make.\n\nI liked port royal 1's  lots or a little business per town better than always 5.  Some gamers must have winged about it but more realistic to have maybe just 2 items say wood or corn at one town then 7 or so at another. I think if you start a new game then the goods need to change at the towns but keep the area produce still like dyes up north , tobacco in the middle and cocoa south etc.\nThat way you have to learn the town roster again which keeps you interested.\n\nAllthough I liked the ex pirate den as your own town, as it was in the original port royale but  the way it is done in this version is better much better just that the pirate hideouts are so attractive with there smaller cabins etc i wish you coud get one of those and develope it but only cabins a warf a shipwright for free repairs etc and maybe the larger infinite supply hall.\n\nThe only down side to this game is I liked the extra jobs you got from the governors like raiding an enemys merchant fleet and steel a shipment of wine or whatever or sink an enemy captains convoy etc\n\nBottom line -- I really wish the developers would grow this game to version 4 with the same beautiful or better if possible graphics etc. Use the same town to world map switch.

What we get instead is a rather shallow system (oddly similar to the X-Beyond series) in which prices arbitrarily follow supply levels, without any regard to taxation, government, or anything else for that matter.  Likewise, buyout costs for existing businesses have nothing to do with the economy at all and are instead just linear figures based not any economic factors other than how much stuff you already own.\n\nThe combat aspect works... mostly.  You're not going to see anything more in depth than you did playing "Sid Meier's Pirates" back on the Commodore64.  Grape shot for crew, chain shot for sails, ball shot for hull.  It's a trope-worthy as elves & dragons in a fantasy game.  Zzzzzz.  Actually, I take that back: Ye old C64 version was more invovled, because you actually got to participate in boarding actions and land combat.  This game just counts down numbers, and the bigger number wins.  The same is true of land invasion - it's a static sit & shoot against towers, followed by tossing more guys at the town than it has.  Again we saw more combat depth in C64 games from the 1980s\n\nDevo was Right.\n\nWhile automating trade routes can be interesting and appealing to any EvE Online "Spreadsheet Warrior" types, even that has been rendered mostly pointless in this iteration of the series through liberal application of random salvage finds and endless randomly generated mini-quests that pay far, far, far more than you'd ever make as an honest trader.\n\nYes, they've added a few new buildings and game tweaks since the last version of the game, but they've left all the old problems from previous games intact and even added a few new ones.  The ranking system is just an excuse to add pointless grind time, the influence system is nothing more than an annoying, artificial obstacle that doesn't add anything to the game and the new pirate system makes about as much sense as the aircraft spawns in Silent Hunter 4.\n\nMind you, I was one of those "Spreadsheet Warrior" types from EvE Online and even I can't enjoy this.  I can deal with the shallow combat, I can deal with the slapped on quests and the needless new pirate features... so long as the economic part worked right, worked fairly, and was believable.  Sadly, it doesn't, it can't and it isn't.  I've seen 1990's x4 wargames that put more depth into their economies than in this game that's supposed to be about trading.\n\n"You had one job!"\n\nThe game isn't without it's merits, and I would love to see an "Age of Pirates" types game with a strong economic model and an empahsis on trade over combat done right.  Unfortunately, while this game gets most of that description down, it fails at the "done right" part.\n\nNote: "But.. but.. pirates!  Action!  Adventure!"  Ok so maybe you don't want to play Book-keeping, the Game.  Maybe you just want to go out and smash some ships.  Fine.  Read above again.  You'll be even more disappointed than me.","August 12, 2015","false","16.8"," 49 of 70 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","49","70","4","0"

Also it gets better with harbour master DLC.\n+ Being able to change the Nation's fate, being part of wars looks cool only bad part of that after the war is over your reputation with the other nation isn't rising after your letter's of marque ended, so it's like nation you're fighting for leaving you alone on the war zone.\n+ Pirates\n+ Effects of captains\n+ Sea battles\n+/- Too many advice...\n- I couldn't find any option about rising the populations of towns, looks like they're only rising with your own buildings(In fact you can change the town population to 0 and it won't rise back). If you consider that trading is limited with the population and it's not rising itself you can't do any mass production and if you do, you can't sell it. Ofc if you can rise whole 60towns populations on your own. But then you gonna feel lonely, it was much better at PR2\n- As much as i see military convoys don't attack to pirates and again you're all alone to do that. That's good when you have your own warships but if you don't, pirates gets too strong and plunder your trading convoys all the time. Pirates aren't big problem anyway but military convoys are looks like allies with pirates.\n- An other big problem about the game trading convoys aren't effecting your reputation with nations it looks like a bug(I'm saying that because it was effective on PR2 and it's really make sense), so it doesn't matter how many trading convoy you have, you have to fight with pirates, do misions or fight for nations all the time.\n\nTips;\n* Start the game with trading convoys(as much as you can, one or two ships without any sailor) make at least 8 trading routes and only use short and safer routes away from pirates or nation you gonna fight against.\n* Don't destroy the hideouts, put strong convoys to nearest town or at the sea activate patrol so whenever pirate convoy gets out the hideout your convoy take it down automatically so you can gain reputation and money. But don't forget the check your convoys.","December 27, 2013","true","79.0"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

For example you basically need to write on paper how many different kinds of factories you have already built on a city.. but then you have already won the game I guess.\n\n74h, I am unlikely to play more, but I have still not uninstalled it.\n\nIt is a mix of Pirates!, Colonization and Settlers. Too bad the battles are only with first 3 ships, and you cannot do a real Line Battle with your Ships of the Line. The battles are funny Pirates! battles, but not really authentic, but that is forgiven. The taking of towns is tacky, just clicking ships to "dock" on attack points and sacrificing them and your men to take a port. Could as well be automatic when you have enough of them.\n\nA lot of microing the boats, unless you have your trade network all unarmed and unmanned going automatic routes, not caring if pirates do this or that. After all the unmanned boats surrender their cargo and go for repairs. "Striking rich" is dependent on the availability of cargo on ports, and thus you need to make the factories, or have a cap on your worldly dreams. Otherwise you will never have enough, when you already have too much to even control.\n\nStill recommended for a few hours.","February 8","true","74.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In PR 2 you had always one ship against all others and had full control over the fight until you let your ship retreat.\nAlso in PR 2 you could take out a pirate nest with a little ship, if you had the skill to do it.

I have a bit of a soft spot for Mechant Trading games, and it has pirates! Honestly, I put about 45 minutes in to this game. A good 20 of it was frustrated swearing. I suppose if you have the time to invest in trying to learn the clunky controls through the painful tutorials, it might be pretty fun. However, my experience was as such. I jumped in to the campaign and I mean that quite literally as there is no tutorial given to you, you have to find it buried in one of the screens under a tab. And that hunt portends to the rest of my experience. "Go trade some goods to another town." I'll make this short, you load the world map, look at towns, try to decipher their system of icons (which I'm sure is welcome if you know what they are, but I don't, and it's a pain to learn them all right off the bat), then figure out the weird way of sending your ship to that town, load that town, go through the clunky interface of buying and selling, wash rinse repeat. If you change the time rate to sail, be sure to change it back when you get to your spot or it screws up your quests. Really, there are so many things I disliked about the game, that to name them all is as much of a chore as playing the game.

I was thinking well it won't be so bad, I can have some fun sailing some ships and be a pirate. Save a few fair maidens and have myself a fancy voyage.\n\nDo NOT let the introduction videos FOOL you, or the "positive" reviews. While there are videos that explain what to do, how to do it, etc. needless to say there is a LOT wrong with the actual controls. Such as in ship combat you can swap between multiple ships in your convoy, or you can give them "orders" to assist you, defend you, swarm out -free for all-, or surrender. In every battle I told my ships to assist me or to defend me thinking "Well hey if we focus down on target, then we'll win easier and no problem." Your ships listen about as well as a brick wall. They continued to swarm around being singled out by the enemy convoy and having 2 or 3 against them and became easy prey to be sunk.\n\nThe trading system is based on randomized fluctuating numbers that are made up randomly as it goes along. You can have a ship full of Rum heading to a city that is "low on Rum" and then when you get there SURPRISE they randomly don't need it and have 300+ in their city resulting in you wasting your time, the long travel used up gold in monthly maintenance fees on your ships, and you are forced to find another city nearby to sell it at hoping you can at LEAST get your gold worth in purchase cost back or take a cut and get screwed over.\n\nThe game has a good concept and if you like bashing your face on the keyboard for a few hours wondering why controls won't work like they tell you it "should" work and you're doing what they say then this game is for you! :D\n\nHowever, if you'd like to save yourself the sanity and not face smash your keyboard into oblivion then I highly suggest your find another game that has sailing or trading in it, like I am not going to go find.\n\nCheers","August 15, 2015","false","2.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

This is exactly that,  only without the whole Tropico 5 deal.  Theres minor city building, but it'd need quation markes to be proper....\n\nRegardless,  We have a game with a gimmick that isn't entirely well done.  If you can get past the learning curve (There's no shame in looking up toturials) Then you get a classic concept of a game.   Put stuff on your ship, sail it somewhere, sell the stuff, buy stuff, sail it and sell/buy again.   Battles happen.   apparently an economy happens,  staleness sets in.  Lack of variey in ship choice, lack of variety in towns,  it really just plays like a very pretty facebook game.\n\nIt's unfortunate that there already is a game that mixes trading, city building, and combat.  It's called Anno2070.   This, I feel is the game that Kalypso wants to make, but just can't figure out how.  Which is a shame really because if they did,  it'd probably be quite good.    But no,  we'll just cut it up into three games (tropico, port royale, merchant of venice)  and keep rereleasing the same game ever so many years with a graphical update.\n\nTLDR - You won't regret not playing it.

I played Port Royale and it was much better than Port Royale 3 in my opinion. As big disadvantage is that you have all cannons and cannonball on your ship right after purchase. No need to thinking about what to buy. More cannons, or more cannonballs? In Port Royale you must have money to buy ship and go to fight enemy. Now? Just buy ship.

In game you can battle but I find I spend most of my time building and setting up trade routes. Also, the game freezes up alot and I have to log off and back on again to restart game.\n\nThe company that makes the game does a bad job with updates. No suppport from what I can see. I say that because the freezing up should be fixed. I'm also getting mad about buying games that have bugs and glicthes. It's B.S. when you buy a game not a pre release and they want you to spend 40 dollars when it's broken from the word go.\n\nIt's been a couple of years since this game came out and no fixes and no new DLC content = crappy support from a crappy company that's makes a crappy game.\n\nI think I did a bad job on explaining so i decided to update this review by saying this.\n\nIf they called this game Port Royal 2 HD with new dlc content I would have no agurments about it and as a results proably would have given a thumbs up.","December 24, 2015","false","109.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The mighty kingdoms of Spain, England, France and the Netherlands fight over the colonies. And there you are, a young sea captain whose only goal is to become the most powerful man in the New World. To achieve that goal, you may choose one of the two available campaigns: will you become an Adventurer or a Trader?\n\nIf you chose the way of the Adventurer, lead an unforgiving campaign for the conquest of the seas: invasion, piracy, bounty hunting, raiding; do whatever it takes to build your own empire in the Caribbean. And of course, trade will have a less important role to play in your rise.\n\nThe way of the Trader is, on the opposite, mostly about developing your riches and your economic power. To be the most powerful Trader of the New World, you have to create trade routes, build industries and develop the economy of the colonies.\n\nOf course, in Free Play mode, you can mix both of those in any way you want, letting you create your own unique and exciting story.\n\nFor the first time in the acclaimed Port Royale series, you are not alone in the beautiful and seemingly so peaceful seas of the Caribbean. The Multiplayer mode allows up to 4 players to play through LAN or over the Internet. Develop a successful trading company, lead your ships in beautiful 3D naval battles and force your opponents to their knees!","January 14, 2014","true","193.2"," 12 of 31 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","12","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Clarke03/recommended/205610/","Clarke03","Matthew McConaughey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Clarke03/","639 products in account","Port Royal 3 is a turn-based strategy game based around building up a selected society into a world power.\n\nPort Royal 3 has no campaign, instead it simply allows the players to create a world of their devising and jump right into it either by themselves or with others in multiplayer. The biggest choice a player will make is what port they're going to play. And hell yes, this is the type of game that you want to just play over and over. Like its predecessors, Port Royal 3 is amazingly addictive, with games commonly drawing more than five or six hours out of me in a single sitting. The reason? Because win or lose, Port Royal 3 allows players to guide an entire society and craft their own story, taking them from the dawn of history and far into the future.\n\nI say Port Royal 3 is only "good" -- and not "great," as I would have said about Port Royal 2 -- at crafting stories because I feel like the game's taken away some pretty important tools for customizing your society.\n\nPort Royal 3 is one of the best turn-based strategy games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. Whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the game’s endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out. With all the tips, advisers and tools in place, this is the first Port Roayl for PC that I feel is worth just about every person’s time. Go forth and create, subdue, and exploit. Do as Firaxis has done, and bring Port Royal to the masses.\n\n4/10 Could use some work.","October 14, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","18","0","0"

I'm a fan of a past game in the series Port Royale 2, and this game doesn't dissapoint.  Just know that this game is a trading game, with a bit of ocean combat layered on top.  You can always play the game as a goodie-goodie trader and pretty much avoid any sort of naval combat, or blow up every ship in the carribean (but then who could you sell to with such a bad reputation?) but you will have to do some trading either way, at the very least selling off your plunder in the nearest town for repairs and to restock sailors and ammo.  This game lets you own any part of the production chain you like, or the whole thing.  And if you think about it, to be a real tycoon you need to be the farmer, artificier, teamster, guard, and merchant owning all parts of the production system.","July 27, 2014","true","96.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clairne/recommended/205610/","clairne","fista1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clairne/","43 products in account","I've played Port Royale 3 and I can reccommend it.\n\nThere are two campaigns and a Free Game mode. The campaigns serve more like tutorials. Besides, each of them has a story. The first campaign will guide you in a path of a trader, in the second you will take a role of an adventurer. After you complete them, they will transform to a free game, so you can continue playing them if you wish.\n\nThe principle of trading remains the same. Buy cheap, sell as expensive as you can. After some time, you can build your factories, hire workers and build residences for them. The products will go in your warehouse. In Port Royale 3, you can hire a steward for your warehouse. This will automate the warehouse and make your life easier. You can tell him to sell goods, buy raw materials for your factories, keep raw materials so he won't sell them or specify which products should stay in the warehouse(and the amount of it too). Trade routes are now easier to manage. You just choose a convoy, select towns which will the convoy trade with and choose a script. Then activate the route and watch how your wealth grows. But if you wish, you can still create your own script and tell your captain where, what and how much to buy/sell or transfer between convoy and warehouse. In my opinion, this is not necessary, as the scripts are well made. There is even script for supplying your factories and selling the goods they produce. This makes life of a merchant in PR3 much easier.\n\nThe path of an adventurer includes many naval fights, attacking towns and pirates hideout. Frankly, the combat system from the first Port Royale is still unbeaten, as there you could use all your ships in a naval fight. Here, you can select a maximum of three ships from your convoy that can fight. But at least you can use them simultaneously, unlike in Port Royale 2, where you can only use one ship at the same time.  Convoys will have the basic crew available automatically. But it's vital to hire more sailors if you want to fight other convoys. There are three types of ammunition. In Port Royale 3, you don't have to buy the basic cannon balls, as they are always available. The other ammunition types are chain-shots and grape-shots, which you have to buy in towns, along with sabers and muskets. The rest of combat is very similiar to the games predecessors. You can sink, plunder or take ships from enemies convoys.\n\nYou can also marry a viceroys daughter, as you can in the previous games. But first, you must have your own manor in a town which you rule. You can obtain your own town either from a viceroy, or by force. A viceroy will give you a town if you are popular there, if the status of the town is Prosperity(the satisfaction of citizens is 75% or higher), if you have enough workers there. In addition, your popularity in the nation of which town you want to rule must be also quite high. A viceroy will not give you command of a town when the nation have 5 or less towns in possession. I don't know if you are able to have your own hideout, like you was in the first Port Royale. I think yes, since I believe you can become a pirate in PR3.\n\nAnother novelty lies in acquiring higher ranks. In the previous games, you only had to increase your wealth. Now, you also have to hire more workers and enlarge the storage in your convoys(which you can do simply by buying more ships to the convoys).  The rest of the game is the same as the previous ones. You can buy pieces of maps, save castaways on sea, etc.\n\nIn general, I find Port Royale 3 a good game. In my opinion, it's better than Port Royale 2, but the first Port Royale is still the best from the franchise because of the combat system. Port Royale 3 is the easiest game from the franchise. The campaigns won't last long. I finished the trading campaign in 3 days(cca 9 hours) and the adventure campaign in one day(cca 3 hours). The only problem I have with this game is the flickering when I turned on anisotropic filtering. That I think is problem related do AMD graphics cards.","December 27, 2014","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to say I had a very great time with this game. The major difference I saw between this and patrician IV was the naval battles, the naval battles in patrician IV were horrendoes, not so in this game, although it is not perfect, I was enjoying myself nonetheless, if you want a game like patrician IV but with better naval battles, then I would whole heartedly reccomend this game.","June 13, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I have had this on my wish list for a while now (I became interested after seeing the screenshots and reading what the game played like in some reviews), I just could not handle the poor UI/interface that was presented for the player. The game looks okay and I can get past graphics for good mechanics, but the game could not keep my attention after 15 minutes or even make me care to continue to read or watch the tutorial videos given.  Most of the icons/buttons you can't simply mouse over for a pop up text saying what exactly what is was. I probably could make a guess as to what the "house" > "ship" icon means, but then there are even more menus, more items that you can't mouse over to understand. It wasn't that I was overwhelmed by the menus, it’s just that they lacked an ease of understanding to the naked or were presented in a manner that let the player understood what was going on simply. It’s a shame that the game did not work out for myself, but my suggestion for other that really want to dive into the title is that this is definitely not a game you cannot play without reading a manual and memorizing what certain the icons mean. I will also say, I could not find an easy command to highlight all buildings or highlight certain ones. For instance, a lot of the farms on the islands match the somewhat nice looking terrain in the background. What you may think is just another doodad is actually a useful tool for the player.  It would have been nice to have an icon to turn on/off to highlight certain buildings. IE: green highlight for farms; blue for government buildings; orange for businesses/factories and etc… Maybe I will come back to this game after seeing if there is any mods that fix the UI, but for now I cannot recommend this title even at 75% off for $5.00.","August 15, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
