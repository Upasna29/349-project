The combat takes skill and requires teamwork for Orcs vs Human fights. Your clan can become successful and run around with cool looking capes!\n\nCons:\nBiggest P2W model in the world\n-You need premium to get in or else you wait in long queue\n-Premium users easily get 300%+ exp, money, and countless rewards\n-Game is run by gold farmers who sell in-game items for real money\n-Best gear is obtained through gambling, using cash items GREATLY will help your gambling rates\n\nMoney Hungry Developers\n-Game is designed to make money, great example is they had a huge hacking problem and instead of mass banning the hackers, they implimented the hack into the game. You can actually buy "legal hack" with you guess it, real money.\n-Game gives stat perks and damage buffs which can be purchased.. this ties too much to P2W it's insane\n\n♥♥♥♥ Community\n- If you aren't prejudice against Turkish people, there's a 90% chance that you'll learn to hate them. I have met a handful of Turkish people who are great people so I have learned to not be so bias.\n\nBUT:\nA hacker? - 99% Turkish player\nA person who tries to ruin your experience (through "ksing", "trade spamming", and "scamming") - 99% Turkish player\nPerson who flames and swears in their native language - 98% Turkish player\n\nThis game has been around so long and is so Turk dominated, it makes sense that the majority of violaters are Turkish (every country has its bad apples). However, I can almost guarentee you that if you play this game you will understand why most of the English playerbase really really really really dislike Turkish players. That being said, my Turkish clan members, I salute you all.\n\nGame is run by idiots, money hungry executives, community PR sheep, or community members with almost 0 power.\n- Has a max level race that gets people competitive and to really put effort in their strategy and leveling. Then has a "surprise exp event" that gives a player 1 free level for each level they achieve. This surprise event was not known by the vast majority of players so those who had to work or had school fell behind tremendously. This ruined the race for many of the players and benefitted those who were "in" on it.\n\n-There is also an english steam group chat for this game. The community manager said that all chat must be in english. If you go to the chat, it's all Turkish spam. All the managers are good for are annoucing money events, maintaince times, and PR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to keep gamers sucked in.  Remember, if you have a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lover, you should try your best to help them change. But if they don't change but get worse after 10+ years, leave them and leave yourself for being stupid enough to stay that 10 years. Same ♥♥♥♥ with this game, but in this game's case, they are the lover that mass murders people and eats the hearts of babies.\n\n\n-The game design is 10+ years old, the characters, monster, landscape, and skills look like crayon drawing compared to most games that came out within the last 5-10 years.\n\n-Game is filled with a tremendous amount of bugs, that is expoited by many players to get ahead. People are either playing legitly and getting screwed/behind, playing a lot of real money to stay ahead, or hacking to be ahead and make real money.\n\n-The new steam community server is run by some community managers and "gms". From what I can see, they are trying but they have absolutely no power and say that changes will come in the future hopefully. No estimate time, no real evidence of change, just blatant PR words for most problems.\n\nAlso, the quest are the same repetitive kill this monster, for kill this monster and hope for a certain drop and turn in, or run around and find a certain npc. The questing is sometimes broken so the NPC either talks in Turkish or in ########.\n\nAll the good reviews of this game are either jokes about how much the game ruin their lives and the bad reviews actually listing out the problem.\n\nThis game needs to be taken off of steam. Most of us were hoping that the game would be somewhat monitored to meet the expectation of a Steam sponsered game. But unfortunately it's just the same old ♥♥♥♥ just repackaged for a money grab.\n\nDo not play this game, play any other ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes such as Guild Wars 2, Diablo 3, PoE, Tera, Blade and Soul and if you start thinking that their support/game management suck, come to this game, lose half your I.Q. and then shoot yourself in the foot for ever trying it.\n\nBut I'm still playing it. It's too late for me.  Don't do drugs and never touch this game.\n\n","January 27","false","061.8"," 765 of 810 people (94%) found this review helpful 246 people found this review funny","94","765","810","246","42"

From my long experience in playing this game those stats are false.  The stats are being inflated by hackers/cheaters making hundreds if not thousands of accounts daily to bot farm all the "fun" parts of the game and to earn real cash in black market sales.\n\nImagine one cheater in a game and the damage it can cause.  Now in Knight Online, that one cheater has 8 or more additional characters repeating the first cheaters same exact moves and attacks.  What is now being termed as "Train Botting".\n\nThis is why there are so many accounts linked to Knight Online and part of popularity.  They are all false.  They are not real players.\n\nAnd this is just one of the issues with cheats in game.  I do not want to even get into the bugs and technical game issues this very old game has and never will fix if the past 10 years are to be used as an example.\n\nSteam should freeze this game or cancel it completely.  The "player base" of bots make it appear to be popular.  The game is full of hackers and hacks that endanger Steam users.  This is fraud.\n\nI was very hopeful and happy that this game was coming to Steam.   I played this game over a decade ago and was force to quit due to the cheats and lack of effort from the developers.  Steam, to me, had a really good reputation and I was sure they would make sure that the game environment was safe to play in, this is sadly untrue.\n\nTo add...Some have been saying that a quick makeover with new code will fix the game and help stop the cheats.  The problem with that is that the reason the PvP is so good is because of a technical anomaly that allows a combo attack.  Any new code would lose this effect in the combat system which would make the game less than zero.  That is why it has not changed and also why it is so easily hacked and exploited.","March 8","false","96.3"," 324 of 347 people (93%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","93","324","347","21","15"

READ BELOW!\n\nThis game has been around for more than 10 years...  Almost every player is Turkish (%99) and most of them can't speak english :( BUT! That's the least of your concerns. This game is purely pay to win, there had been many item duplications before, many bots etc. (BTW I'm a Turk)\n\nPROs:\n+Maybe you could practice your Turkish...\n\nCONs:\n-Many bugs...\n-Too much grind\n-Not much to do\n-Only Turkish players\n-Pay to Win (forces you to buy ''Premium'' etc.)\n-Player base is stable - only veterans and very few players\n\nThere are sooo many cons...

The forums where you should be able to go and get help are useless. post are constantly deleted instead of fixed and the staff bans you if you point anything bad out in the staff or game. the game is extremley pay2win but if you know ko that has always been the case. the bad part is even when you choose to buy stuff from the in game store there is a 50/50 chance you will get charged and eithe A. not recive the item or B. recive an item you didnt pick. Then your told to submit a ticket so you can get an automated response that solves nothing. or your ticket is just flat out deleted. But dont go complain about it on the forum cause then the 12 year old kid they gave admin rights to will ban you. (we all know im talking about, lets be honest) Bottom line there are tons of bugs and its full of cheaters and they just dont care. 10 years later im still here playing the game all for the pvp. SMH\n\n\nEdit: just would like to add on that a certain someone in there staff was found to be bug abusing on the USKO client he was banned along with the majority of his clan for this bug abuse. And not even 24 hours later he and his clan were unbanned. freeley cheating in game without any reprocutions. at the same time the guy i mentioned above is still waiting on the "support team" to unlock his account for an error on there side. corruption at its finest.","April 4","false","695.4"," 199 of 205 people (97%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","97","199","205","19","9"

I was never a "pro" in this game but almost over a decade ago while actively playing it I guess I didn't have the tools I have now to evaluate this the way I can now;\n\n*Best Parts*\n- Even though it's incredibly tough to build up your character the reward is great enough to keep you addicted. If your gear is top of the notch and you are a skilled player you will be a respectable member of the community and you will earn reputation not just among your own faction but also among enemy faction too(They will respectfully run away from your reputation when they see your name on their screen)\n\n-Incredible PvP mechanics. The combo skipping is a thing that people generally hate in games but in this one if you can do it right with your keyboard as if you were a pianist you are a god(not that regular pianists aren't, those guys are great)\n\n-Even though there are only 4 classes in the game the diversity of each class is so vast you could almost think that they could have separated each talent tree into different classes which leads up to a very unique experience in PvP and/or in general gameplay.\n\n-Despite the fact that you need great endurance of the far east people to farm for hundreds of hours to build your character(and presumably at liest 40$ a month) there are A LOT of things to sink time in the game. You could mindlessly farm to level up/earn money(those are generally seperate ways of getting yourself the carpal tunnel syndrome), you could PvP in minigames, faction vs faction wars, in PvP area or occasionally invading enemy faction PvE areas, you could try to upgrade your gear to a higher level, you could run around in a market area to make a profit(some people spend most of their time in this) you could hunt bosses for great drops with your clan and friends around the maps and on and on it goes..\n\n*Bad Things*\n-The F2P concept is received very poorly by the developing company. What they didn't realize after the success of games like LoL, DoTA or some MMOs with a f2p or at liest b2p bussiness plan out there is that you can NOT allow your players to get ahead by huge margins by paying more money. Especially if you are forcing them to pay you 40-50 bucks a month packages to steam roll the plebs like myself whom actually make it more fun to play for everybody. Hell, if you even provide 10-15% advantage over people who doesn't spend any money in this game is already a great boost since it already is a grind heavy game let alone giving a 300% exp boost. Yes. 300%.(This may not hurt much until you are level 70 since most of the exp comes from the quests but after that the great miracle of exponential function kicks in where you have to earn x^2 of times of the experience you needed to gain the previous level*)\n\n-Obvioulsy community.\n\n-Brain hurting English, no real quests, no script, no scenerio no nothing.\n\n*Conclusion*\nWhen I did my first PvP after I reached level 70 with my assassin in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gear I immediately recognized how much I have missed to do PvP in this game even after playing almost a dozen of MMOs out there that came out in the last decade. This game still is in the top 3 of my PvP enjoyed MMOs. But after a couple of hours later I realized I had to stop PvPing because I was running out of money for spending potions, loosing money because of the repair costs etc. And so I knew that game was demanding one of these two simple things,\nMy soul,\nOr my wallet.\nSo just like that like a second chance given failed marriage I had to end it once more.\n\nRest in peace old friend. May we meet again when I reach my mid thirties.\n\n*Writer might have exaggerated the actual experience amounts needed for each corresponding level to prove a point.","February 6","false","135.5"," 218 of 247 people (88%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","88","218","247","66","2"

I currency capped multiple times, spent more time than anyone rightfully should grinding.. When you kill a monster that gives you .0001 exp even though that monster can kill you with 1 hit and you lose 5% experience one death can ruin an entire day worth of grinding. The playerbase was as unfriendly then as it is now, but nothing was more fun than walking through a field of standing bodies during pvp and slaughtering everyone you could before they dissappeared due to an entire country disconnecting from the game.\n\nPlenty of good memories.. like instant mage casting with the skeleton scroll.. aoe groups, rogue kiting like a pro.. christmas events.. but it's definitely not a game I'd reccomend to anyone in this day and age.

The graphics have been similar since the game's first launch, there haven't been any major changes. If I were to talk about pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\nAmazing pvp system, pulls you right into it.\nUnique merchanting system\nUnique upgrade system\nOld school MMO atmosphere\nActive communityCons:\nThe game is very grindy, it's super difficult to reach level cap without having a paid subscription\nThere are some broken quests but they aren't game breaking\nLack of a proper anti-cheat software causing cheaters to take advantage of it very easily\nIn game store to buy goods to benefit one's character during PvP (pay to win element). The store is called Power Up Store (PUS) and includes monthly subscriptions, potions and scrolls that increase your health, armor, attack and stats.\nWebsites that buy and sell in-game money illegally\nMonthly subscription plans are more expensive than any other modern MMO on the market, convenient ones starting from $30/mo going up to $40/mo\nLack of communication between the publisher and the developers, causing confusions and delays on some occasions\nSo in my opinion, the cons weigh out the pros and I ended up quitting the game after playing it for more than 3 months and spending over 800 hours and a ton of money. If you still want to play, it's completely up to you. I'm not saying that you won't enjoy the game, but the facts are out there.\n\nCheers to whoever takes their time to read this","May 20","false","888.3"," 77 of 81 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","77","81","3","0"

Actually the people who bought premium should sue the steam and KO because they do not provide a cheat free game. The reason why i started to play again KO was STEAM. Because i thought that steam would be enough to prevent cheating. However, the STEAMKO is worse than the USKO. There are thousands of cheaters, Just log in to any 3rd or 2nd servers and see with your own eyes. Train parties are everywhere, farm slots are full of TPT users. I myself found a lot more k0xper than the Game Masters found. The hilarious part is if you try to say the truths about the game on the steam forum, they delete your post and they ban you. This is not Knight Online anymore, it is CHEAT ONLINE and the developer team does not care about the KO Population. YOu can not find a online gm 7/24. Koxpers laugh at you when u try to record them on the video cuz they knew that no action is going to be taken against them.\n\nI would not give even 1/10 to this game and i will start to ask refund the money i spent on this game.\n\nTheir reseller webpages are selling third party tools, gold bars and items with real money.

Lots of private servers on the internet.Some of them are even better than the original KO. Enough said.\n* Customer support. There is none.\n\n* And last but not least,PREMIUM ! This game has something called bronze,silver,gold,platinum premium (names probably changed but the concept is the same),where you get some huge perks and bonuses over someone that doesn't have the same premium,like : insane EXP gain boost,up to 500%. Yes,500 %. You get more coins from mobs,you only lose 1% of the EXP if you die,where you usually lose 5% if you don't have the prem.You might think 5% is not a lot,but if you die on lvl 72+ to a mob,it would literally take hours of grinding to get those 5% back.\nAlso you get something called KNIGHT CASH with every premium purchase (even tho you can buy the KC on its own) which you can use to buy various scrolls (which increase your HP,defense,move speed,base stats) and also cosmetic items which are not purely cosmetic since they give bonuses as well.\nAlso a thing called TRINA,which increases your chances of upgrading an items quality (and upgrading is really important in this game).\n\nPROS :\n\n* Unique PVP system.I still hold it for one of the best PVP systems ever created and that is why this game was so dear to me for so many years.\n\n* Upgrading....oh the rush of upgrading.Every item can be upgraded from +1 to +10. Upgrade chance reduces with each +1. From +1 to +3 its 100%. +4 is 80% , +5 is 60% , +6 is 40% , +7 is 25 %, +8 is 10 % (or even less not sure), +9 is 5% and +10 is less than 1%.With each +1 your weapon does more DPS. On +8 your weapon gets this cool particle effect which makes it glow and thats why everyone is going for +8.\nAlso,remember the part where I said you can purchase TRINAs ? Well those things increase you chances of upgrading an item by 15 %. So,if you can't afford them,you probably shouldn't be upgrading your stuff at the first place.\n\n* Can't think of anything else.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nInstalled.\nUnistalled.\n1/10.\nAnd that concludes my review.","January 26","false","0.2"," 117 of 139 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","117","139","13","1"

And it was free to use cheat programs as long as you were buying premium packs.\n\nWhen NTTGame decided to release this game on steam, I hoped that they might fixed the bugs and improved the game, like improving the graphics, using VAC, etc. But game is still same as I left it.\nI've encountered same quest bugs that I've encountered years ago, which prevents you from completing the said quests. They still using Xigncode as anti-cheat. I hoped that they were changed it to the VAC.\n\nI would like to play this game, but they need to fix these (a.k.a. Negatives):\nUse VAC instead of Xigncode\nFix the quest bugs, monster name bugs, wrong monster location indicators, wrong item names, etc. Add a bug report system so we can inform you when we encounter them.\nImprove the optimization. Even my high-end pc working like crazy when I play this game.\nRemove all power-up items, scrolls, etc, only cosmetic items should remain.\nUse one mega server. You've Cyper 1, 2, 3 so why keep opening new servers with new names. Why not increase these numbers to like Cyper 15-20?\nGraphics should improve. NTTGame should know their rival games are TERA, Rift, etc.\nTo be just, here is the positives:\nI saw banned player names flooding in chat panel. At least they're ban hammering like crazy the cheaters, trolls, bad language users, etc. (But I still prefer VAC over Xigncode, since Xigncode can give false postive much more)\nAfter fixing negatives I've mentioned above, these would improve the game even more:\nAll big MMORPG games have PvP servers. A PvP server where you start at max level with fixed equipment would be good. This way players would skip all the boring leveling and jump in the PvP right away. And by fixed equipment, only player skill would matter.\nAll big MMORPG games also have language specified servers. If you really want to open new servers, there could be language specified servers like, English only, French only, German only, Spanish only, Turkish only. Using another language in specified server would cause a ban from that languages server. I mean like, 1 time warn, 2 times banned for some days, more than 2, banned forever.\nI've heard that NTTGame says that the game engine is not capable of somethings like increasing servers max player capacity, etc. I've saw some games remade with Unity by some modders. If some modders can remake a game with Unity, why NTTGame not demanding a remake of this game from MGame, with a newer engine, like Unity, Unreal Engine etc.?\n\nI'll update my review if they fix these. If these conditions does not apply to you, go ahead and try the game. It's free anyway.","January 28","false","165.3"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","61","67","5","1"

But it never changes... This game is the definition of P2W. Its sad to think that such an amazing game with awesome PvP is a p2w hell. Gear is very important in this game and every item can be sold with coin(gold), and guess what you can buy gold from lots of sites. Not to mention you can buy hacks(koxp) as well. There are lots of hacker/botters in this game which ruins both PvE and PvP. One of this gold selling site actually has an agreement with NTT if you can actually believe that. I guess they wanted in on money huh?\n\nIf you go pass the gold selling and hacking there is Power Up Store item that can drop one of the best items in the game, some players work months to get iron necklace because its so OP in PvP, but you can just boxes until it drops one if you want too ...\n\n\nSteam Lauch\n\nI have been able to level to 62lv in 7 hours into the game this does feel any different from normal version of the game.\n\nFirst disaster: They said Power up Store will be closed for some(like a few days) so paid players wont go too much ahead and its a fair game. Because exp premium gives a lot advantage starting on a new server. But they failed to remove Power Up Store in some npc and People used it and they had to open Power up store a few hours after.\n\nGame is still p2w people are buying gold from the sites aldready to build gear and go to Ronark Land to slay bosses that drops very valueable items.Dragon box has not come to Power up store yet but it seems it will come in a week.\n\nPeople on the forums tells me why do I even play this game If im not spending 500$ on buying gold/premium. I dont know If they aware that this is a F2P game and I can't understand how can they spend so much money to get good items and one shot people who didnt spend that much money, blows my mind.\n\nHere are top Pros and Cons\n\nPros	    Awesome PvP with big Lunar wars(200vs200 or more?)\nFun combat /Skill cancel stuff\nEasy to learn Hard to master\nCons\nP2W aspects of gold selling and premium items(If they will allow gold selling items should be bid to char.)\nHacker/Botter are still a problem you will see them a lot and they will annoy you in both PvE and PvP\nToxic Community, as a Turkish guy I dont think general turkish gaming communty is that toxic but this game is toxic hell. Don't expect getting welcomed by this community.\nVery Gridiny leveling for most of the people to be max level you need to have experience premium package or it would be just very very hard.\nI don't recommend this game if you are new to this game. Your experience will suck. You can try other newly realeased mmos like B&S or wait for Black Desert but not this game.\n\nFor old players you can look for yourself but I still dont recommend it for you because you will get disappointed. Looks like this game will never return to its glory.\n\nHope you find this review useful thanks for reading","January 26","false","567.8"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","0"

As you can see, it won't be positive, so let me explain carefully and in a very detailed fashion why this game is not worthy of your time, whether you are a new player or like me, a veteran who has spent way too many nights grinding in this outdated korean mmo.\n\nLet's start with the basics, a quick recap.\n\nKnight Online is a game released in the US (USKO) in 2004. What started like an average korean mmo soon after became a religion in a certain country that shall not be named yet. It goes without saying that this game is old, and it clearly shows in the graphics and gameplay. If it still exists nowadays its solely because of how popular it became within that nation previously mentioned. Now, it has been released on Steam, but let it be known that this game already has a huge amount of releases and re-releases in its standalone USKO client.\n\nBut anyway, what exactly made this mmo different? Knight Online at first glance looked identical to every other mmo released around the same time. The answer is the pvp system. Knight Online was unique back then because of its fast paced combat style, and most importantly, the ability to "combo" skills, as it was called. By cancelling weapon's long swinging animations, you could inflict damage in a quicker and more deadly fashion. This added a thick layer of complexity to an otherwise barebones game, a physical execution barrier that increased the skill cap between a regular player and a pro immensely, and helped KO become as popular as it is still 12 years later.\n\nThe funny thing is, that the whole 'combo' feature was nothing more than an unintended bug. And that's how the story of Knight Online begins, a game full of bugs, GM corruption, extremely overpriced micro-transactions, money hunger,  terrible customer support, hackers, cheaters, and an unsurmountable amount of turkish players that do not speak even a tiny bit of english.\n\nThe Knight Online playerbase is probably the most loyal out of any mmo in the entire planet. Because despite every punch in the face that the ever-changing game publishers delivered to us, we kept going out of sheer love for the game, or call it addiction if you will. You, as a new player, cannot imagine how many disappointments and fiascos we've had to endure throughout the years. People these days would quit any game over a minor nuisance. We, endured cases where regular weak monsters would randomly drop items belonging to the strongest boss ingame (these items stayed), random rollbacks, unfair punishments, no moderation for in-game cheaters, gold farmers galore, absolutely no support in case you lost your items by someone logging your account, GM corruption where they would sell players the best items for real money, etc. You cannot imagine, like I say, all the s*** that this game has gotten away with.\n\nKnight Online is also a competitive game. Every time a new realm (or most commonly known as server) releases, the race to the level cap and top pvp ranks begins, with the former being extremely excruciating and grindy. This is the time in which the company behind KO gets the most money, as everyone spends insane amounts of USD to remain competitive and aim for the top. Monthly premium membership (35$) becomes a must buy, and so does buying a couple more luxury monthly-renewable items (over 40$) to even try to stand a chance in pvp. This is not even mentioning the new RNG micro-transaction item that allows you to get BiS items day one.\n\nPVE in this game is painfully basic and simple. There is no lore, there is no creativity. All you can do to level is hunt X amount of monsters to complete a quest or to grind the same monsters for hours upon hours, and unless you have the EXP premium membership (EXP for experience points), it will take you weeks if not months to reach the level cap, depending on how much time you have to play per day. The parallel between an EXP prem user getting 80 in a week or less vs a non prem one is ridiculous to say the least.\n\nLast but not least, the language barrier. A massively crowded game can be fun, but not when 95% of the players speak a foreign language while making absolutely no effort to even try to speak english. The country in question is Turkey. Most turkish people are abusive, ignorant, uneducated, cheaters, and downright disrespectful. Generalizations are annoying, but this is true. There are a handful of really nice turkish people I've met, but they are scarce. Those nice turks tend to be self-aware as to why turkish players can be considered obnoxious, and I like that. Anyway, there's a lot that can be said about turkish players, one could describe them as the common plague that torments a specific game (EX: brazilians, russians, etc) but their most common trait is that they are a very proud and patriotic bunch. They simply refuse to speak english, and they take MAJOR offense if you dare say anything bad against turkey, as justified as it might be. Bottom line is 1. KO will make you end up hating a country that is known for being very warm and welcoming in real life and 2. KO would be dead for a long time without turkish players feeding NTT (current developer) money.\n\nAll in all, KO is an extremely outdated and expensive game (albeit advertised as "F2P") with its only redeeming grace being its sort of engaging pvp. Pve, graphics, interface, bugs all get a 1/5 rating. The dark days of corruption, cheating and gold farming are mostly over, but the other issues persist, and will forever be a part of this game.\n\nI would not recommend playing here to any veteran, and certainly NOT to any new player. It's more of the same, despite being advertised as being different... despite this being their golden chance to finally start anew. Greed is, in the end, a way too powerful adversary to overcome. Isn't that right, KO developers?","January 26","false","18.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","14","17","3","1"

They promised not to publish a game like USKO with pay2win system however this is more than pay2win since the prices are too expensive, even more than USKO. Unfortunately I was expecting an older version Knight Online. NTT Game again ruined our expectations, they still focus on the "how to make money" not "how to make new customers".\n\nWhat I found improved is the quest system. You don't have to kill same monsters until morning, quests will help you much better to farm exp and even basic items. However still if you want to farm to level 80 you need to pay and buy premiums.\n\n1/10, 1 point for the sake of "Knight Online" name.\n\nAfter playing several hours I encountered bugs. One of them is very annoying. BDW, the most exciting war in the game, kicks you out for no reason. I reported it and they told me that they're currently working on it. I can increase the total overall of this game to 3 (I would increase it if there was no bugs to 4), since the populution is crowded and for that reason it is partly enjoyable.\n\n3/10, increased for crowd and quests.\n\nWoops when I was writing that I remembered that there is also "login errror" which occurs at every first login to game. So I decreased the overall again.\n\n2/10.\n\nServer: Xigenon\nCharacter name: 155","January 27","false","240.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

It's a very grind-heavy game where you have to spend time to farm up xp and items. The end goal is to be effective in PvP which is heavily reliant on gear and skill.\nEvents are fun, amazing PvP, and pretty good role play.\nThe cons of this game are endless however. I honestly believe that if this game were run by a better gaming company such as Blizzard or Riot, it would be one of the top MMORPGs.\nThe company who runs the game (NTTGame) is beyond corrupt. The game is literally pay-to-win and it is nearly impossible to compete with other players if you don't pay at least 40-50$ to start the game off.\nFurthermore the support system is complete garbage. There are tons of bugs and god forbid you get affected by one of them (items missing, character bug, etc.), you will have to send a support ticket in, which may very well never get answered. Mines been up for 21 days now, and I know others who have been waiting 30-40 days.\nAlso the quests aren't very entertaining, the game was translated from Turkish to English so most of the dialect with NPCs is incomprehensible, and there is a pretty loose anti-cheat policy.\nThe game allows cheaters to play to increase the player count as well as to force them to purchase things via the Power Up Store (real money) and then slaps them on the wrist so they can continue reaping money off of them.\nThe game has an incredibly small staff, the support team is inefficient and the system for handling tickets is very poorly designed, and new bugs are always introduced every patch (developers are mediocre at best).\nWhen you think of good games, the software cycle for them is usually well defined and everything is done by procedure. This game appears to be hacked together and each patch introduces new problems due to this (as any programmer would know...hacking for large scale projects is never the route to go).\nI hope to god this game gets new management or some changes are made to the staff...because this game honestly has potential in the right hands.\n","April 3","false","556.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

It was my first MMO, before Guild Wars or World of Warcraft, this was the game everyone played. It had a huge expansive world, tons of quests, but the most fun thing was hopping on voice coms and mindlessly grinding in a group of friends.\n\nSadly the original developers sold the game, and the new dev team quickly went to work redesigning the world and quests, removing many of them and forcing the game into the first cashshop game I ever played. It went down hill very quickly, and all of the english speakers I knew quit. I stayed around for a while but I do eventually quit, though every few years I get nostalgic and go play for an evening.\n\nThe game has gone very down hill, and no amount of good memoeries could make me recommend this game. I miss the fun I had in it in my early teens as my first MMO, but the game it is now is a disgrace to the name of the original.\n\n(PS: I'm pretty sure my old xfire account had about 3000 hours on this game.)","January 28","false","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

And to think that a lot of us were expecting something different from this Steam Launch. I've been playing this game on and off for about 10 years now and was really expecting the Steam version to have a different approach on the Power-Up Store (PUS) and server access.\nNot only there's a huge queue of around 800 people on all 6 instances of the 2 servers, but the queue doesn't even work. You get disconnected half way through and have to start the queue again. There is no premium option outside the game, so even if you would want preferred access, you have to login first to buy one of the options. GREAT WORK!\n\nBottom line - the publisher changed a few times but the goal remains the same: suck up as much money as possible using PUS and new server launches, don't care about the community.\n\nIf you are new to the game, avoid it at all costs. If you are an old player - yes, there are some new things in the game but the core Pay2Win style is the same. Premium costs 40$ , enough said.\n\nMalak - Cypher server","January 26","false","363.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I hadnt seen any gameplay before I decided to give it a try. been playing incredibly casually but to be honest as far as MMOs are concerned, especially OLD MMO's, this game isn't all that bad. I'm a primarily enligh speaker and speak almost no Turkish except the few curse words I learned in Germany. Frankly, the game is old school. There is a difference between a BAD and a GRINDY MMO. Kids these days require immediate gratification and from what I've played you will NOT recieve it. Requires a lot of patience and understanding due to the amount of non-English speaking players. Granted, this is all irrelevant if you speak Turkish/Russian.\n\nAs far as the gameplay is concerned, the animations seem a little clunky but nothing that can't be gotten used to. Questing seems very repetitive, even for an Kr MMO, but guides you along at a nice pace. The free buffs up until lv35 are hella important for speeding through the earlier stages of leveling it seems.\n\nAs someone who has played many MMOs in the past and will more than likely continue to play MMOs this game isn't bad at all. If you can look past the boring graphics and 'kill 10/10 orcs' questing situation you will be rewarded with an fun, learnable MMO. Take the time to play a game and don't require it to fullfil your "2016 fueled 'I NEED THE BEST GEAR AND LOOT NOW' " mentality. If you enjoy, seemingly, hardcore MMOs from yesteryear give this a download and see if you enjoy it.\n\n-itcHy, the only english speaker on Cypher","February 14","true","9.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","13","23","3","3"

Which admittedly is pretty common these days. PvP is still partially skill based, so that's good. Premiums in this game are the most expensive I have ever seen in any game I have ever played, its truly absurd. The game is grindy, the UI is pretty cluttered and annoying. The DEV team must not really do to much because I see very little change to this game since I first played it roughly 8-9 years ago. So don't expect anything new for long spans of time, let alone new features. It could use quite a bit QoL improvements.\n\nAs for the community, its 70-80% of the population are Turkish Muslims. They don't speak English, and they most definitely are not going to interract with you if they can get away with it, and if they do, they are going to treat you unfairly, and get rid of you the first opportunity they get. They don't have a server for these people so its hard trying to find anyone to play with.\n\nSo key points are:\n\n-Good PvP\n-Bad Dev Team\n-Unholy premium prices\n-Grind-fest\n-Turkish Muslims who hate you, and control the servers.\n\nDo not play this game.","May 28","false","299.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

After grinding to 60 on my healer over months, I got invited to join the top guild on my Malaysian server (where I PvPed from Germany on a dial-up connection). My Malaysian guild master would spend his weekly income on cash-shop boosters for PvP and would hook the rest of us up too, even if it meant he couldn't afford food.\n\nIt felt great being part of a good guild, swaggering about in our fancy cloaks with our logo on it, I had an absolute blast despite 90% of the playerbase consisting of 12 year old Turks in internet cafes, and 10% being 12 yeard old Malaysians in internet cafes.\n\nPvP was fun and never got old to me, due to animation-cancelling (you could combo in a very efficient way) and sliding (allowing you to stay moving as you attack). I don't know if I would have enjoyed the game nearly as much or even stuck with it as long as I did without those.\n\nThe game was absolutely plagued by bugs and poor programming (no leashing, ridiculous threat mechanics, rampant botting and straight-up hacks) and more than once have I witnessed guildmates' accounts being stolen (internet cafes, remember?).\n\nI don't know if this changed since MYKO, but you used to lose 5%(?) XP every time you died (several hours worth of grind beyond level 60), so my friends' compromised characters would often be seen running into mobs face first, in an attempt to de-level the character. Yes, you could level down if you lost XP while below 5% XP into the next level.\n\nIt was an awesome, terrible game, and I will always think of it lovingly, with good memories- but I have no idea why anyone would subject themselves to this now...why is this even on Steam?!\n\nI'm gonna faff around in it and maybe even try to level, but I can not honestly recommend anyone play this. Under modern standards, this game is a piece of crap (and the monetization is almost criminal). Just go play Blade & Soul.","January 26","false","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TengriKhagan/recommended/389430/","TengriKhagan","Tengri Khagan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TengriKhagan/","1 product in account","[UPDATED: 3/2/2016]\n\nMy review WAS a thumbs up. In fact, the publisher (NTTGame) held a contest: “Whoever posts a positive review may be selected to win a prize.” Guess what? I won. At the time, the game was brand new to Steam, and I had high hopes that NTTGame wouldn’t purposely ‘screw over’ their customers.\n\nI’ve played Knight Online since I was 14. I’m 26 now. Knight Online has many different versions based on region: MYKO, KRKO, JAPKO, TWKO, USKO, EUKO (a western-friendly name for TRKO), and now this SteamKO. My excitement about the Steam launch was my misjudgment that the publishers would re-invent how Knight Online is marketed, and how their cash shop was offered. KO already had a bad reputation as a P2P/P2W while labeling themselves as free (even using the trademark “Free2Play”). However, since the launch on Steam, it went from bad, to worse.\n\nTHE GAME ITSELF IS NOT BAD. The company that runs the game appears to drive it into the ground. We regulars can’t figure out why. All they need to really do is boost their communication and TAKE our suggestions. KO players are very patient, but not when they are utterly ignored.\n\nSo why should YOU avoid this game?\nWhile I will always believe you should at least give the game a shot, I DON’T want you to spend a dime to do it. Here’s why:\n\nServer connectivity can be extremely laggy at times, and you will certainly be disconnected a few times in a day. Sometimes it’s routine maintenance, but other times it’s completely random. Their staff does little to keep the community informed, so you’re left thinking “is it my connection?” Not to mention, if you aren’t premium – you won’t stay logged in regardless.\n\nServers have a population cap of 3,000. It used to be a lot more than that, as the maps are huge and designed for about 8,000 people per server, but the game doesn’t fair that well, so they reduce the cap and you are forced to be on a waiting list during peak hours. The waiting list can be up to an hour long, and if you wait too long, you will get an automatic DC. This is with or without premium. Oh yes, even premium members will be waiting.\n\nThe prices in SteamKO are outrageous. You are forced to buy almost double the amount, even if you only want a few small things. It’s all or nothing, basically. This was a horrible idea for a new Steam launch. Their marketing manager should be fired. Not to mention, prices have been increased dramatically for certain premium items, WITHOUT NOTICE.\n\nThere’s different monthly premium options. For example, EXP Premium lets you level up faster, WAR Premium lets you rank higher during PVP. They’ve enabled you to buy both, at the same time, but they aren’t stackable. They will run out in 30 days, regardless if you use it or not, as if you were actually just leasing premium from them. This wouldn’t be a huge problem, if they didn’t have a lot of issues that happen within those 30 days, preventing you from playing/enjoying the game.\n\nHackers. Hackers are everywhere, it makes your eyes bleed. They either only have 1-2 GM’s, or the multiple GM’s online just don’t like to do their job in-game as much. Regardless of the reason, there’s no excuse for the excessive hackers. There have been SO MANY positive suggestions from the community regarding how to deal with hackers, but the staff appears to ignore the problem as if it doesn’t exist. This is literally what killed the older KO games, and it seems to be doing a number on SteamKO as well. You want to PVP? Too bad, you get a party full of hackers attacking you instead. You want to kill a boss? Sorry, hackers already killed it. You want to Exp? Too bad, all the spots are taken by hackers. The freaking game already has an “auto attack” option for paying players (P2W again), yet people still would rather buy actual hacks to do it.\n\nPay to PLAY: Oh yes, consider this game “free to try” but “pay to enjoy.” You can certainly log in for free and play for a while. But consider that no clan will ever recruit you because you aren’t competitive, you NEED premium items to PVP (or you will always die), you NEED premium items to reach the level cap, you will NEED premium to have a stable-enough connection to merchant. You NEED premium if you want to log into the first server and have a chance to bypass the waiting list. Don’t come here if you think you can stay without paying, you will be gravely disappointed.\n\nPay to WIN: You could play the game – without paying – for a whole year. Once a premium member enters the picture, within a month he has surpassed you. The more money you throw at the company, the more intense your character becomes. It’s far from cosmetics. This has always been the case, and this will never change. Some people prefer it that way, because they’re fine throwing away half their paycheck every month. Personally, I spend as much as I would on eating a cheeseburger.\n\nExtreme community censorship. The forum moderators like to lock as many negative posts they can find. This is typical of the old community, but it carried over to the Steam forum as well. It’s highly censored, and anyone who disagrees with moderators is promptly banned with their post deleted. There have been complaints against the moderators, but in reality it has always been the case.\n\nThe admins have limited 1 computer per IP address. Supposedly they’ve done this to combat the hordes of hackers who are using the same ISP, but given the pattern of late, it appears they are actually doing this to force the lower 15% of their player base who live in dorms, play in cafes, or have a family playing together, to buy premium. The IP restriction doesn’t apply if you have premium. I draw this theory due to the fact that these hackers are indeed… hackers, and they just use masked ISPs/proxies to bypass the silly IP restriction. So in reality, all of the legal players are being punished. There has been no slowing down of the hacking trend.\n\nThe most irritating part is the lack of communication. The community has been *demanding* certain standard features that have been locked for no apparent reason (DCZ/RLB, for example). There has been no explanation on why certain things have been locked, or when they will be open, or when certain bugs will be fixed, or what they have planned for upcoming events. Not a peep.\n\nRECENTLY, they've decided to hold an event that literally says "Whoever spends more money will win a prize" -- is this not the very definition of Pay-To-Win?\n\nThis is merely a shadow of why you see so many negative reviews. I tried to keep an open mind, and be positive. But they’ve clearly made that impossible for any sane person.\nHypocrite much? Why do I still play?\nI am approaching 1,000 hours of game-play as I type this updated review. I’ll tell you how I do it – all I do is sit in /merchant mode, while I play other games, do homework, play with my son, play with my dog, or go to work. I had 8,000 hours logged in X-Fire doing the same thing. My max level is 55, and the level cap is currently 80. If you know anything about this game, you’ll know that I barely play it. I just like to be a merchant.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned before. I was practically raised playing this game, so letting go completely isn’t easy. As Darth Vader said to Luke Skywalker before turning him over to the Emperor, “It is too late for me, son…”","February 5","false","064.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I couldn't even start the game\n\nPROS\n1. None that I can think of, I couldn't start the game\n\nCONS\n1. XIGNCODE3\nYou put spyware/anti-cheat in your software. It's from Wellbia.com (South Korean company). Honestly, as much as I understand creating a cheat-free community, it's annoying. It's used for other games\n\nFound a report detailing how to beat XIGNCODE3. Seems that the software is only capable of checking out "brand name" cheats and nothing else. It's not a good method to stop cheating and it annoys ME.\n\n"I discovered that my issues with Xigncode3 killing the game were related to it now somehow being able to retroactively peek at what was running during the launcher. Well then, looks like my clipboard paste script won't work anymore. But, what will?\nActing on a hunch, I wrote up a very simple keystroke injection testcase; you can see the code here. It's as simple as it gets while still doing what it needs to -- wait ten seconds, then synthesize keystrokes to produce "1aoeuaoeu" in a focused text entry. Using the exact same API AutoHotkey uses to do its thing, mind you.\nI compiled this with MinGW GCC, just a simple "g++ -o injectiontest.exe injectiontest.cpp", with env CXXFLAGS="-O0 -march=native -ggdb" (on a Haswell i7). No optimization, no obfuscation; even the most primitive and basal heuristic analysis will be able to immediately deduce what it's supposed to do.\nOn to the testing. I started the launcher, started the testcase as an elevated process, and put the password field in focus. Pasted right in; okay, AHK did that fine, but XC3 would flag it once the game started... nope. Didn't even notice. I hopped into a channel and walked around; this is WAY farther than XC3 would ever let AHK get, even if AHK had been killed off before hitting Play in the launcher.\nBut what about ingame, now that XC3 is open and actively monitoring? Nope again. The testcase dumped its string into the chatbox without any interference or notice from XC3. The game continued to run until I manually quit.\nSo, Xigncode3 appears to be a simple blacklist scanner, checking for specific programs and killing off the game if they're found. ♥♥♥♥ poor. Circumventing it is as simple as obfuscating whatever it uses to fingerprint programs, which would be trivially easy, or even simply writing a custom program, which as I have proven would be completely passed over without any additional effort whatsoever on the coder's part. If this is supposed to be a first-line defense against botting, it's a miserable failure right out of the gate. Any skiddie with half a working knowledge of any of C/C++/C#/VB (and more!) could write a bot that'll go unnoticed by XC3. Perhaps there's hidden heuristics to catch new botting/scripting tools and ban accounts using them, but that will only put you at a miserably hopeless disadvantage in an escalating arms race.\nNeople, if you want even half a prayer of beating the gold farmers, you better be using a smarter tool under the surface. Xigncode3 is doing you no favors and only causing headaches for legitimate players. Far as I can tell, there's a significant chance you currently have higher priorities, but this really needs to be addressed at some point, before ending OBT."\n\n2. It Couldn't Start\nAfter 5 repeated attempts, I've given up on this.","February 1","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Pick a side.\n\nStuff in bold are TLDR.\n\n"/town" command to teleport back to the starting town/castle place pretty convenient.\n\nThe controls need some work. POV is pretty bad. When you want to remain third person as you move the screen moves closer to your character at times. The game gives you options of WASD movement BUT it does not work out well. WASD movement makes the game more realistic so its a plus. when you turn with "A" and "D" you have to take a massive turn, and when you use "S" to move backwards you move extremely slow. The main method of moving that I use your left mouse button to move toward your pointer and your right mouse button is to move your POV. Using your mouse makes you move normally, you can do sharp turns and turn around and stuff.\nTLDR: WASD for realistic movement and mouse for normal movement\n\nThe combat system is your typical mmo "1234567890" hotkeys for your skills and multiple skillbars. When you fight with melee the range of your attacks is pretty sketch some you have to close some you don't really have to. When you attack you have to keep moving toward your target or away from your target to attack. I think the distance from your target is part of the fighting system. Sometimes when I am a little farther away I will miss most of my attacks but when I move closer I can hit most of my attacks. You sort of need to keep adjusting your distance/position from your enemy. You should combo your skills when you fight to do max damage. There is no auto target procedure so you have to manually pick and fight with your mouse.  It seems a bit difficult but quite easy once you get use to it other than that there is nothing really special about the combat system.\nTLDR: The combat system is a bit realistic and tends to get annoying. No autotarget procedure. When you fight you have to click on enemy, Once you get used to it not that bad. you pretty much need to see what works with you.\n\nLooting system wait until you finish killing and a box to appear then click on the box. The loot that are generally dropped are apples money (called noah) bosses drop equipment but you get better ones from quests. most of the loot you get you cannot use or is a lot worse than the stuff you get from quests. Decent money ago.\n\nThe quest system...."APPLES" when/if you start the game you will understand. The quests are mainly kill quests. There is not really any quest help things other than where the monsters are at. Like if you are suppose to find an npc you have to look for him/her. There is a quest early on the game that you get from a black smith in the starting town/castle. Is to strengthen a dagger. Tells you to get a dagger from the weapon merchant and upgrade with a scroll. But WHAT SCROLL and HOW do I use the scroll to upgrade? Do not need this to progress in the game but stuff like this is difficult.\nTLDR: Kill quests. apples. and no help at all from the game.\n\nThe class system(and skill system I guess). There are 6ish main classes in the game. Say 6ish since some are race dependent. Main classes for both are warrior, rogue, mage, priest. Warriors tank and dps class with swords shields maces hammers and mallet and stuff. Rogue is assassin or archers, Mage wizards magic what else? and Priests are typical healers. Once you get to level 10 and get your first job change into the main class of the person you are using. Starting at 10 you can put skill points into specific areas to start unlocking skills. For warriors there are 4 attack, defense, passion, and master. Every 5 points in an area unlocks a skill. Attack is for front line attackers, spend lots of mana to use skills and do damage. Defense you need a shield for the skills to take their full effects are every effect will be halved. I havent seen a shield at all in this game yet except on other people. Passion is more for self buffing i guess. consuming hp to gain mana, use your mana as a shield, spend mana to gain health regen. I have not been able to put any skill points into the Master category, but I assume that it becomes unlocked once you get to a higher level. Unfortunately I havent played any of the other classes so I can not give much input for them. Most other games once you choose a class you have to stick with it ie: warrior gaurdian mage ranger, bladmaster etc. but this game you can choose any you want and change at any time. But have to stay within the class you selected warrior rogue mage priest. It is not like archage which you can change you class completely into something else.\nTLDR: Class system may appear restricted but actually gives you free reign. There is a wide variety of skills and have to choose carefully which ones to use.\n\nInterface is pretty cluttered. but if you have a bigger screen I do not think it will really affect you much. The minimap is attatched to your health bar and you cannot move it anywhere.\n\nOther stuff. There seems to be fishing mining refining(strengthing equipment i guess?) smithing jewelry crafting. This is all mid game gameplay where in the first 40 levels I have been playing does not even touch upon. There is a mining spot next to the worms(lowest leveled monsters in game) that you can get a free pickaxe from the miner npc walking near it. When you mine you get ore which you can exchange the miner npc for some goods like health or mana potions.\nIf you want to start mining there is a guy in the town/castle with a giant hammer floating above his head were you make stuff. He offers you to buy a pickaxe from him. DONT you need 1 million noah....I did not know and I am currently crying right now when I learned that I could get a free pickaxe. The other stuff you can buy from a merchant like a fishing rod, but there isn't any fishing spots. You have to find it yourself.  The bait for fishing you can get from mining.\nTLDR: This game is really painful for early game players since you have to learn almost everything by yourself or you will start crying a lot.\n\nThere a lot of field bosses that you can kill, better exp and drops some items(bad ones though).\n\nOften times you see some high leveled played camping at one spot for an extended period of time. There is this thing called combat genie that auto farms for you and I think is the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing in the game. So some high leveled player just sets this combat genie on and kill every monster that you need to kill. At a certain level you stop getting exp for killing the mosnters.\n\nSome quests are extremely difficult. since sometimes it requires some help from the game to tell you how to do it but they dont offer any help. EX. say you need to get apples from a tree but the game doesnt tell you how to get the apple from the tree. There are no options at all. There is absolutely nothing. Just get the apples from the tree.\n\nSummary. This game is not newbie friendly and you have to learn most of it by yourself. There are some buggy features that the developers need to fix like when you walk you constantly zoom in and sometimes when you fight you walk past the enemy. Thus game will be difficult for new players to mmos but for experienced people for them may be quite interesting and fun compared to other games. It gave me a tiring and sometimes stressing situations. I would not reccomend this game for others. I would just say try it out its pretty difficult to learn.","April 17","false","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

( da fuq. premium to do bdw,ft,chaos, etc now? joke..)\n\nSome english players, mostly on cypher.\n\nLots of turks. Some friendly. Some have learned english and or are at least educated, matured.  Just like any other country turkey has its' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nA universal language that has given some amount of communication between the different players from different regions.\nIE: 44 = tp "HoldOnMyBanana: 44444 noob mage  444444444 tptptptptptptptptptptptptptpt"\n55 = Enemies in view. Used in pk.\n+++ = buff\nand there is many more.\n\nA giant line of quests, some that have been bugged for long time. Some that have just been bugged recently. IE: El morad swift breaker quest line is damage and unable to be finished currently, but the karus side quest for it is working.. Hindering a lot of the players leveling up a bit.\n\nMonster stone bugs, you never know if your MS will bug or not. Some people have 0 problems with it and do 20 a day. Never having ever seen the bug themselves. Some people only get 1/15 MS working and only see the bug all day. A huge pain and one of my most headaches comes from wasting these stones after sitting in ballsweat for 4 hours farming them and only having one out of 15 work.\n\nA built in P2 auto loot faierie, as well as a built in bot/auto hunt  for afk xping/farm. (Genie)\n\nA MASSIVE P2W market, money runs the game obviously. Perhaps a bit too much though? NTTGame: Nah..\n\nExpensive potions, making it hard to level a new character unless you pay for premium potions or put xping on hold to farm coin somehow. Leaving you broke as dirt 90% of the time while leveling. Unless you want to risk dying a lot and losing xp everytime you die. Luckily the coins from quests barely make up for it and dont leave you at 0 coins.\n\nBuilt in KOXP practically. Botting is okay as long as it brings in money, IE: You buy premium and genie.\n\nHard to make money unless you are high enough level to farm things to sell, possible to make money from drops from events like ft chest. However impossible to get into server #1 without premium it seems to have access to it anyway.\n\nAnvil rates are worse and so are the drop rates compared to USKO. Burning personals at +5 with trina, bad luck seems to be around every corner when you touch an anvil.\n\nGiant parties of either k0xpers, or people who pay to bot and use genie taking up monster/farm slots.\n\nMinecraft capable of producing higher quality graphics than this game.\n\nBaba shoppers = fathers money to buy gears, lots of joke for the big pay2winners.\n\nSame game for the last 10+ years.\n\n___________\n\nActual good things about this game? Of course.\n\nOne of the best games for pking/pvp. Skill can take you places here and has a high cap, even if you are not p2w.\n\nA whole lot of quests, KO use to be strictly grind and very little quests. Leveling is not as bad as it use to be, and getting to level 60 can be done in 6-9 hours of game play without premium. Despite a few quests not working as intended.\n\nIf you can afford premium the events are a lot of fun and the rewards are usually good.\n\nGood communities of all regions for KO.\n\nMaany items to farm and upgrade, the race is never ending. Good gears can compensate for lack of skill.\n\nDue to the monetized structure there aren't as many cheaters as there once was. No reason to bot and risk being banned when you can just pay for the bot. Not a bad move by NTT , but not the greatest either.\n\nA huge selection of spells and skills to acquire for most classes. I would say the classes are balanced as they are.\n\nA lot of help in the discussion board and active moderators that will try to help everyone with their problems in the game, as well as report bugs/concerns to NTTGame devs. At that point it's mostly up to the devs, however at least steam does its part.\n\n\nIn conclusion i give this a 11/10 would go back and ruin my childhood with this game all over again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 6","true","291.0"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","50","11","22","21","1"

( and or maybe using other hacking software, idk )\n\nAs for the game itself in regard to people who aren't familiar with it already.. It's an old game that has 10 years+ to its name.  The game is marvelous and challenging yet steadily rewarding.  Pve is very simplistic, yet can be hard to master bc of the risk vs. reward factor. If you want to take on that big-butted boss or scary looking mob, go ahead..\nIt is essentially a huge game world with ever progressibly harder mobs around each corner.\n\nAs for pvp.. Definitely present. Im not too familiar witht he pvp aspects but I have definitely heard that the game is very challenging in pvp.

The error code is completely unhelpful, and then the game sits in the background frozen, unless I choose to kill the program. The fact is, I run a VERY strict ship with my computer.

The graphics aren't what newer games are, the game play (to anyone who is new to the game / hasn't played it before) is sub par, and the only thing that set the gameplay appart for those who have put time into the game is, technically, a graphical glitch called comboing in game. There are cheaters and it's hard to understand people.\n\nThe big reason i'm writing this is because of nestalgia. If you can get a group of people together, and that has become extremely dificult, the game is amazingly fun. Once you have your combo down and are hitting twice as fast as other poeple, NO i'm not talking about the cheaters that run around shooting 5 arrows at once there is a simple way to interupt the attack animation for melee attacks that the game has dubbed for years as legit even under the old owners, it has been some of the most fun game experiences i've ever had. There would have to be a big influx of english speaking people to return the game to where it was back when I used to play it. Back when you could get a full alliance together, meaning multiple clans of 32 people each all working together to break the enemy lines during the war and invade the oposing country's castle all for the sake of "nation points" that really didn't have a use other than a neat cape and and emblem next to your name, and you could develope lasting rivalries with enemy clans and poeple because the servers were limited to a number that you could actually learn peoples names and know who was good or not (unlike wow and most other more popular games), the game was truely amazing.\n\nI know it will probably never get back to that point. Americans have "better" games to be playing with graphics developed in the 2000's, and the owners haven't bothered trying to get rid of the cheaters in years, but it was once a fun game and i'd recommend it to everyone if only to desperately, albeit hopelessly, try to increase new people.\n\nI know my played time probably says something like 5 minutes but in actuallity, I have put more time in this game than any other single game long before it came to steam.\n\nWARNING!!!: It's not really a good way to end a recommendation for the game but I gotta say it. If you do ever decide to play the game, unless you really love it and want to pay for premium (not recomended) you will have an amazing ammount of trouble reaching max level. At level 68 ish it becuase a game of grinding for and hour to get 1% of your levels exp and thats if you are good at killing stonger monsters or are in a strong party.","April 1","true","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

Then comes the quests which are not %100 English, you can see the translations are failed and you cant understand much. Then comes the %95 Turkish people. %90 doesnt even know English. So you cant communicate with anyone, you just play. The game is pretty old, and you dont have fun till you are +50 +60 lvl. And there is a new thing called "Genie" which is kinda bot(ofc you pay to buy it), it controls your character and plays it when you are away. That is SOOO STUPID imo.

I stopped playing because of the Pay2Win system and the experience bots called "k0xpers". And at that time i quit Knight Online, the game makers developed their own "bot" which is called "Knight Genie". You need pay a lot of money on premiums, boosts, even the in-game cash. Without spending any money on that game, you won't get your back straight. If you are good with paying a nice amount of money and play an MMORPG game, go play WoW instead.\n\nAnd i must mention, Knight Online's player community is made of %99 Turkish people. You are quite wasted if you wont find any English speaking person.\n\nPros:\nOne of the best oldschool MMORPGs\nEvents and maps are nicely developed\nQuesting is all you need for PVE\nPVP system and PVP maps are fun\n\nCons:\n%99 Turkish people\nPVE slots are full of bots and "Knight Genie"s\nPay2Win\nUgly graphics\nUgly UI\nBad and misunderstandable quests\nPay2Win\nBad animations\nA lot of disconnections\nAlso pay "not to disconnect"\nAnd before i forget to mention, pay2win.\n\nI spent a lot of hours to play Knight Online, but now i won't worth to play that game. Go play another MMORPG if you are an MMORPG fan. Knight Online is dead, unfortunantly.\n\n\n","January 26","false","120.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That needs to be pointed, since premium accounts get some privileges, as, for instance, priority while logging in.\n\nI used to play this game back in the day, before its release on Steam. Game had its share of problems back then, which "translated" well into the Steam version. First of all, disclaimer: I'm not saying Freemium or any other pay to play kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥me is a negative thing; heck, no one can work for free!\n\nHere's a list of some bad things you probably will run into:\n\nProblems logging in: servers are crowded with people and logging in, generally, takes time... a lot of time;\n\nAutobots: I read that people are already using hacks inside the game. I think that's true, since, when I played, besides the server being crowded with people, I couldn't get almost any mob kill! Once they spawn, they already get killed almost instantly! It's aggravating!\nNo comments on most of the community being Turkish. I mean, so what? Ok, it's hard to communicate, but that can not be count as a bad point on the game (or any game). There are other nations besides English speaking ones! (What!? Games can't be successful in other countries!?)\n\nOverall, it's just not worth it, giving the dimension of problems.","January 30","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I am running on Windows 10 and 1080p resolution, no issue at all.\n\nKnight Online is a old game which is at least 10 years old. It still retain the old graphics and control from back then. It was one of the most popular MMO title at that time.\n\nLike all f2p games, it is accompanied with ingame shops.\n\nTypically, if you are not picky about graphics, old school controls and have cash to spend, this game is pretty good with all the interesting events. Also, this is not for PvE oriented players, this game is more towards PvP.\n\nI saw this game on steam so I kinda check how much has it change since 10 years ago. There seems to be a lot of new stuffs in the game compare to then.","February 21","true","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

It's not Knight Online, it's "Turks Online". You will literally see 95% of the chat/global chat being written in turkish language.

It has a medium learning curve I would say. The game does not focus on PvE or stroy telling AT ALL. The sole aspect of he game players stay for is the party oriented PvP system. If you have a friend who plays it ask them to give you a hand as starting this game solo is hard to do and a lot of new players quit because of it. If you stick around long enough you can usually find some people willing to help you out. Beware, the majority of the playerbase does not have english as a first language.","May 18","true","239.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Only play if you can afford to pay,  if not i would not reccommend playing it. You will just get killed in pvp as you have no good gears and you cant level up fast with no exp premiums or genie. you will level up almost 10x slower because you cant genie through the night with exp prem. Free players will spent 90% of money earn in repair and potions so good luck farming up your gear.\n\nI love the pvp (war,cz) aspect of this game as it is great and well balanced classes make it possible to kill anyone if you know your stuff.\n\nThings to consider improving on:\nMake Cz entry not just for server 1 as you have over 100s of people trying to farm for the level 70 skill quest item which just makes most of everyone without their level 70 skill even when maxed level.\n\nAnswer your support tickets quicker and also try improving on helping players resolve their problems instead of saying things that do not help the player's situation.\n\nSummary:\n1/10 if you are free player, 6.5/10 if you pay. 8/10 if you improve on those issues stated above.","February 1","true","140.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","20","1","5","3","0"

I also love the fact that this game is currently one of Steam's top player based game(20k+ active users daily!) and the game has not even been out for a whole week on Steam! KO is great and I highly recommend it because it's not a pay2win game. Everyone has a fighting chance, even if they choose not to pay. I highly suggest this game to anyone and everyone who is looking for that medium end game grind with great events and dungeons/wars, not the mention the Player vs Player is still the best I have experienced threw-out my 15 years of gaming. I highly recommend this game to those looking for an amazing MMO expierence! Feel free to add my steam account if you play this server and have any questions. Nothing is better than playing with people from all around the globe any time of day. I have seen players from US, AUS, Canada all the way to Turkey. +1 to you Knight Online!! I am extremely greatful and recommend this game to any MMO head or those who never got to experience how a true MMO should be. You will not regret it, I promise you.

It is hard, fun and if you can't combo in this game you get killed immidiately. ps what kind of weapon you wear kinda doesn't matter sometimes.\n\nlet's talk about pros and cons\n\nPros\n\n+This might be the best gameplay I've ever seen\n+This game is 10 years old but still have too many players\n+Events are amazing\n+It's fun when you play with/without your friends (you clearly can play it just by yourself)\n+It's hard\n+Not P2W\n+CZ and Ardream wars (don't judge the game before you see this)\n\nCons\n\n-Really bad graphics\n-Too many Turks\n-You have to wait a lot to join the cypher1 2 and even 3 (That's kinda a good thing but still it's bad)\n-If you have premium you have advantages (NOT A P2W)\n-Power up store have 4000kc limit (40$ I guess)\n\nI hope this will help and I give 8.2 to this game which is worth to play\n\nAnd I played this game for 5 years... Best 5 years of my life","January 28","true","1.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

This is a 11 year old game with a dedicated userbase. It isn't free to play, it's actually pay to win. It is traditionally babashopping central. Most of the time you won't even be able to connect without buying a premium. The only good thing about the game is the PvP mechanic which requires you to heavily invest your time (grind towards level ~80) and money to even begin enjoying it. Also the community is 90% Turkish and yes, the launch was terrible.\nDespite all this if you decide to take the plunge it offers solid and satisfying PvP action, if you can actually get there.\n\nTo the USKO players/recent returnees: Pretty much the same. Level cap is 80 for now. Krowaz, Dragon Boxes etc. are disabled for now, along with Ardream and RLB. You can get more info at the community hub. PUS and the cash system is a mess right now but it will get sorted out eventually. Servers are still a little wobbly but that is to be expected since they are filled to the brim. Queue is around 1000 players for each server right now (6 a.m on a weekday).

Çocukluğumuzun bir diğer oyunu olan ve benim 2004 de oynadığım ilk oyun olan Half-Life'nin yapımcısı olan valve ile birlikte Knight Online'yi görebileceğim hiç aklıma gelmezdi. Bu oyunun incelemesine her şeyden önce insanlarımızın zamanla efsanevi haline gelen ve birçok dostluğun başlangıç yeri olan Maradon'undan başlamak gerek. Gerek exp slotları olsun gerek mükemmel skill ve achivment ağacı ile bu oyun Türkiye'de yaşayan 70-80-90'lı nesillerin gönüllerine taht kurmuştur.Bununda yegane kanıtı 56 yaşında olan babamın ve kahve(kıraathane) arkadaşlarının peynir ekmek yer gibi bu oyunu oynamasıdır.\n\nHayatımda bazı yegane arkadaşlarımı bu oyun sayesinde edindim. Bu oyun bir oyundan öte olarak insanın kalbinde başlangıç müziği ile bambaşka bir yer taşıyor.\n\nDünyadaki hiçbir başka oyun bu oyunun tadını veremez.\nKesinlikle ve kesinlikle oynamayan ve burada gören arkadaşlar bu oyunu oynamalılar.\n\n\nGeçmişteki tadı kalmasa da yine de bugün bunu yüklüyorum ve nice günlere Knight Online diyorum. 12.

There are some quests which basically you can't deliver and complete because of those bugs. NO technical support at all.\n\nYou need to have a premium account if you want to contact to customer support about anything.\n\nThere are lots of hackers and macro users which ruins the already broken game.

People played together, helped each other and quested together.\nOver the years it was getting more and more unplayable. Tons of dupes, hacks and exploits were used.\nThe publishers didn't really care about stuff like that and kept the money that came in.\n\nPro:\n- Unique PVP System\n\n\nCon:\n- Pay 2 win model (Freemium)\n- Overpriced Premium and unfair advantages (Over 300% exp boost)\n- English community is really small (almost not existing)\n- Turks are dominating the servers and like 95% of them speak no english\n- If you say "english pls" you'll probably get insulted\n- There are bugs that haven't been fixed for years\n- There is a build in "bot" you can use if you pay $$\n- The item upgrade system is really frustrating (you can buy expensive items for $ to increase the chances for upgrades)\n- The sounds/graphics suck\n- You need premium to connect if too many players are online\n\n\nI could write even more, but I think this is enough for now.\nIf you want to play this game, google for ApexKO. It's a private server completly rewritten by a great developer team.\nThey have a great support, lots of english speaking players and fixed as far as I know all bugs.","February 28","false","407.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It decided the first time I tried that it would crash itself and then open up an Internet Explorer tab to their homepage(which I use chrome as my default browser) and when I decided to give its 2nd and final chance it decided that it would just crash and not work. On top of which they make the same mistake that every failed Indie RPG makes when they show how your character will look in 50 levels or whatever it might to become as powerful as possible instead of just showing how your character will look as you get into game. Do NOT play this dumpster trash game for it will only make your life worse. Thank you and have a nice day.","February 19","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People played together, helped each other and quested together.\nOver the years it was getting more and more unplayable. Tons of dupes, hacks and exploits were used.\nThe publishers didn't really care about stuff like that and kept the money that came in.\n\nPro:\n- Unique PVP System\n\n\nCon:\n- Pay 2 win model (Freemium)\n- Overpriced Premium and unfair advantages (Over 300% exp boost)\n- English community is really small (almost not existing)\n- Turks are dominating the servers and like 95% of them speak no english\n- If you say "english pls" you'll probably get insulted\n- There are bugs that haven't been fixed for years\n- There is a build in "bot" you can use if you pay $$\n- The item upgrade system is really frustrating (you can buy expensive items for $ to increase the chances for upgrades)\n- The sounds/graphics suck\n- You need premium to connect if too many players are online\n\n\nI could write even more, but I think this is enough for now.\nIf you want to play this game, google for ApexKO. It's a private server completly rewritten by a great developer team.\nThey have a great support, lots of english speaking players and fixed as far as I know all bugs.","February 28","false","407.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice.\n- You'll randomly get the error "Failed to register the symbol. Please try again". Wtf?\n- When you start your first game you will be met with a complete mess all over the screen. This mess is a combination of the default, cluttered GUI (hotbars on the middle of the screen, weird hotbars with unclickable buttons popping up, tons of buttons so you can barely find the menu, etc) and your start location being filled up with bot players spamming the chats.\n- Your standard hotbar with abilities is by default placed on the middle of the screen. This hotbar does not snap to screen, to other GUI objects, or anything. You can make new hotbars, but the new ones will have exactly the same buttons as the first one. Very useful.\n- Skill tree? There seems to be 5 skills you can invest into. What do they do? No idea, there's no information.\n- There are hardly any tooltips for anything at all.
