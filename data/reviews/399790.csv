This same "company" has left a positive of the review after logging 0.1 hours, basically playing long enough so that steam would allow them to leave a positive review (edit: HappyPanda has mysteriously decided to actually log time into the game after this review came out, almost as if he now realizes having a positive review with between 0-6 minutes played is a dumb move). The review also says "Seems to be well worth the price so far" worth what price? He's the "game promotion company" handing out free copies of the game so he clearly didn't pay any money for it. The same people that are handing out review copies leaving a positive review is sketchy at best, it seems like a ploy to get positive reviews in at the start to scam people into buying the game.\n\nEdit: The user HappyPanda is confirmed to be a dev for Road Redemption (the game they are handing out codes for next week), whether they are a dev for Destiny Warriors I am unsure of but the the fact that they are hiding that they are devs when reaching out to people and calling themselves a "game promotion company" just makes it all that sketchier.\n\nOnto the game itself: Not good.\n\nStoryline: Lazy ripoff of Naruto with cringy dialogue and a ridiculous amount of grammatical errors. In one of the first scenes, you meet one of the characters named Kitt his own name is mispelled everytime he talks while everyone else says it properly, this no longer happens in later scenes, there are constant grammatical issues and entire words missing from the dialogue.\n\nThe actual story: There is a Kage of the Grass village who sealed rampant beasts inside children (sound familiar? keep reading). Your main character is a slacker/klutz type put in a squad with someone classed as a "bookworm" despite him clearly being the strongest and macho-esque one in the squad. There is a girl healer and a male who is LITERALLY classed as "The Emo" just so they can have the Sakura-Sasuke relationship thing going on. The first mission as a squad? You must collect a bunch of bells your squad leader has hidden...bells. You could literally be finding ANYTHING but they couldn't be arsed to even change it to something besides bells.\n\nGameplay: Not good, abilities have little or no animations that make no sense to them at all. A "clone x-tu" (jutsu but they clearly couldn't even bother to find a new name for it so they just wrote X-tu) is literally just your character walking up to the enemy and attacking it, there is no clone of any sort. A fireball is just a random burst of fire where the enemy is standing. They haven't even programmed in the ability to choose 2 targets on abilities so your 2 target abilities hit random targets, sometimes targets that aren't even alive anymore. Enemies do little to no damage and spend half their turns defending and just dragging the battle out, one mob does about 20 damage when it attacks yet when it poisons a character they take 100+ damage a turn. Oh yeah, your characters start out with an absurd amount of health and level up at an insane rate despite killing the exact same weak enemies. Your main character does around 100 damage with his standard attack, the enemies you encounter at the start have about that much health. The kicker? Your characters do not actually have any weapons equipped when you get them, not even a basic rusty sword or anything which is just plain lazy and makes me wonder what in the hell are they infusing when they use weapon enhancement abilities? The majority of the ablities are lazy renamings (your non-clone clone jutsu also has thunder clone, fire clone, etc. variations) and have animations that don't match them at all. Based on the clips provided on the steam page it appears that even later in the game the damage values barely change if at all.\n\nOverall Impression: Not worth the time, I quit after 40-something minutes because of how bad it was and I was trying to push myself to give an accurate review. Hell, if you really want to try it go contact HappyPanda he'll probably give you a free copy if you say you'll give it a good review.","September 12, 2015","false","0.8"," 502 of 587 people (86%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","86","502","587","38","29"

The story focuses on the four main player characters, who share some rather humorous interactions during the course of their adventure to destroy the numerous bosses (I know its a generic term, but thats basically what they are) to protect the land. Anyway, summary over, on to the review!\nThis game is enjoyable, I will be finishing this game. So, you may be wondering why I am giving this a negative review.\n\nPersonally, I do not think the game, in it's current state, is publishing worthy. I am not just saying this because it is a RPG Maker Game, I actually am adept at using RPG Maker and applaud the creators of this game for attempting to publish it. So I have some words of advice for the creators of this game. If you are going to post a RPG Maker Game, unless it has custom materials, forget about it. The major let down for me during my playing time is the lack of unique, custom assets. Anyone that has either played to many RPG Maker Games or has used the program itself will not find the use of default materials exciting. I liked the comical aspects of the story and characters, but when compared to other similar games, it is still lacking. I know how hard it is to make a game that can be competitive in this market, but I have high hopes that with some changes, this game could become something. Having created numerous RPG Maker games (none of which I have published/monitized), I know the efforts that go into making one of a large scale. So, to review what I have said concerning what this game needs...\n-Custom Material is the most important thing. Using a example map with a few small changes isn't going to make it. Also, although sound doesn't seem all to important, the right sounds can make or brake a game. Although some of the sounds work, I would suggest changing up a little for variety.\n\nThere are some things that I did find interesting, and think is a job well done...\n-Menus. The menus were actually very nice, well edited and so on. Some of the menu designs look similar/exact to some that I have found online, which is fine, as long as you have recieved proper permissions to use them (if applicable).\n-Combat system, although not overally so impressed. The combat is a basic sideview battler system, so that does seperate it from the typical first person battle view. Might I ask though, did you create the battle system yourselves, or did you use one of the common online scripts such as Yanfly's Battle System (I hope I named it right, I haven't used RPG Maker in a while, so I have forgotten a lot of the script providers names).\n\nIn short, the game is not of the level where I think it should be monitized. I have personally created games that are on par or better than this one (based on unique materials, custom scripts, so on), and even those I would not feel confident enough about to publish commercially. I do intend to beat this game, and will most likely enjoy doing so, but overall I cannot approve of this game. I applaud the developers on their work, but this game is just lacks the uniqueness that games like this desperately need.\n\nMay your adventures be many and always end in reward!\n-Donoknight, Guildmaster of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League\nNote to the Developers: If you have any questions concerning my review or need any help concerning the future plans/changes to this game, I am happy to help in whatever way I can to help this game thrive in this competitive market.","September 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 142 of 178 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","142","178","9","11"

Sorry, I mean a group of kids who are training as ninjas. They must complete their missions and report back to their leader. Most of their missions involve tackling the evil ninja rouges (no, not the ninja rogues).\n\nWithin Destiny Warriors lies a complete disaster of spelling/grammar mistakes (including the previously mentioned ninja rouges) and an annoying battle system. Do you like getting stun locked? How about frozen? Maybe, perhaps, you also like being paralyzed? Well, all three of these do the exact same thing! Oh and enemies absolutely love to spam them too! Don't bother leveling up either, as all this does is make battles even harder. Enemies scale with you as you level (because, as we all know, this is a completely fantastic system that no game should ever use), except for the fact their stat scaling goes up a lot faster than yours and just manages to turn every battle into a complete chore.\n\nIf you value your sanity stay far away from this game.","October 2, 2015","false","12.8"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","53","58","10","5"

Let's start with the story, it makes sense even though it's very Naruto-alike (by very Naruto-alike I mean it's actually Naruto but just different names for the characters), with just a bit of creativity you could do something better. The dialogs are down right bad, many grammatical errors , spelling errors, overall poor quality (makes me wonder if they put some 13 year old teenager writing it), once again, with a bit of effort they could have had someone spell-proof the dialogs, and it would have felt better for us players. Then there's the combat, great customization many spells, but what for? Most of the battles are downright unbalanced, most of the spells are either badly scripted/bugged (many of them hit for 1hp) or just useless when compared to others, why not cut the spell list a bit and make sure every single spell is actually useful?\n\nFinally the thing that upset me the most, script class exceptions happening in the game, literally in-game errors that caused the game to crash, was this game tested before it was deployed on Steam? Was there a beta version? Did you receive user feedback? I bought an in-game item and was all happy, went to use it and get an error saying basicly that the game wasn't tested enough. This is not admissible, not if you want to charge people for the game.\n\nThere's much to be done for this game if there's still will to improve, and a good start up point would be to review all the dialogs and remove spelling/grammatical errors and cursing all together, followed by a revamp on the combat system.\n\nOverall a mediocre at best RPGMaker game who strived to be good but just couldn't due to basic errors that could have been avoided with a bit more planning. 3/10","November 16, 2015","false","11.5"," 42 of 42 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","42","42","0","0"

Probably a drunk night.\nWhy are there so many chests? Some of them just spawn annoying mobs I cant avoid.\n\nSince the enemies level with me there is no reason to fight. But wait! I still have to fight since there are plenty of forced ones I can't avoid or escape. I need several rounds to kill one enemy at my level and have to use a lot of my Chi (Mana) to defeat all before they kill me. Why are there so many fights with more than 3 enemies? It just takes too long for one fight and it feels like it's never going to end.\nThere is plenty of poisoning, stunning etc. I once forgot to get rid of my poisoning and when I unvoluntarily entered the next fight I had 1 hp.

It's a Naruto-inspired game mixed with Dragon Quest and Pokemon concepts. I'm quite a fan of RPG Maker games but this one disappointed me the most for quite a lot of reasons.\n\nPros:\n+ The graphics are okay\n+ The game is quite cheap\n+ Has trading cards\n\nCons:\n- Dialogues have a lot of typos.\n- The story/plot is terrible. (The story is a naruto rip-off)\n- Dungeons are poorly-made leading to a very repetitive gameplay. It takes out the player's interest to explore the world (should stick to only one style of dungeon design either random monster encounter or placing actual monsters on the field)\n- Bad level up system. (Some characters will be used at the latter part of the game and you get to use them at level 5 when all of your characters are already level 10+. Max also gets stuck at level 15.)\n- Battle System is not balanced. (All your characters have high HP but their attacks just won't get strong. The enemies' HP gets higher but their attacks also don't get stronger at all. Having a higher level only shows that you have high HP and MP)\n\nIt's hard to make a decent game from RPG Maker that would actually sell because of the lack resources, etc. This game has a lot of potential but seeing the story is nearly similar to Naruto, it actually blew out the whole experience for me. It doesn't mean that if you change some of the terms, it's already a different game especially if it was based on a very well-known game/anime such as Naruto. It's not easy to make a nice and interesting story especially for a game.\n\nAnyway, I don't recommend this game to gamers who have played quite a lot of RPG Maker-made games but if you're a Naruto fan and you don't mind a somewhat retelling of the Naruto story under different names, then you can try this game since it's quite cheap.\n\nPersonal Rating:Gameplay: 5/10 (very repetitive)\nStory: 4/10 (Nearly same plot as Naruto with a slight few modifications)\nMusic: 6/10\nGraphics: 6/10\n\nOverall: 5/10","September 19, 2015","false","8.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

Endlessly repeating the same things (skills, combos etc) over and over again. Even worse, this game has unseen enemy encounters with those that you can see. Which is pretty idiotic. At some point of the game even normal enemies start to have so much hp that random encounters vs normal enemies last for minutes. And you have to fight them ... a lot. Also 90% of the skills are completely useless. And with enemy hp so high even your best skills dont do enough damage. And at some point enemies will start to stunlock your whole party forever.\n\nAlso that genius who thought its a good idea that enemies can spawn from treasure chests should never make games again. Also the other thing about combat later is that only your skills that use TP[TP is another mana, only worse] do any damage. And of those only those that use all your TP (100) at one time. So combat turns into use a potion to get 100 tp, use skill, use potion to get 100 tp etc etc, and the best part is that those skills can even miss, losing all your TP.\n\n\nAlso there is no use fighting after one point, because enemies scale with your level. So everytime a random encounter starts you can try to run away, except from chest and visible monster (what the hell?). Most of the time the running away doensnt work and because you cant access menu or load in combat forces you to close the game and when you have to do this all the time, it really buggers your steam friends receiving constant notions that you are playing this awful game. The story is pretty nice (in a so bad dialogue it turns kinda into good way), Naw who am I kidding its bad as hell.And nothing can save it as the abyssmal combat ruins the game.\n\nAnd the last thing, I've never ever wished that game would end more. But no it just keeps going and going, and splitting the party all the time forcing you with horrible party combinations and with less people easier for enemies to stunlock you to death. Theres lots of content that should have been scrapped and even cheap things like big maps with mazes and levers(are there just to make the game longer) that you need to push in correct order which you cant see as theres no map and view distance is too near. All while trying to avoid combat from invisible & visible enemies and saving everytime you open a chest, because if theres combat, you need to restart the game.\n\nExample battle I might never win. 5 Enemies vs 1 my hero. They use 3 different stuns (stun, paralyze and ice) If any of them stun me, combat is automatically lost. You can only protect yourself vs stuns with armors that have worse stats and only protect vs 1 effect so no dice there. If I luck through one enemy turn without stunlock, I can use 1 spell, which is my best spell and it does about 500-600 damage, enemies have about 10k-15k health.\n\nSo 1/10 avoid like the plague.","November 7, 2015","false","20.0"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","1"

However not even as a copy the game got to be functional.\nIt has terrible characters, and they do not even have motivation.

Or even if they pay you, do not play this piece of junk!\nIt is not worth it in any way possible...\n\n\nOh, and the part of "over 12 hours of gameplay", read it as: you will be 5 hours trapped in each puzzle, inside a maze with several forced battles.\nResulting in more than 20 hours of torment, because the game does not know when to finish...

Avisem ao criador que isso é propaganda enganosa!"\n\nComo não bastasse ter mapas ridiculamente malfeitos, nomes sem criatividade, péssimo uso dos recursos graficos e sonoros do RPG Maker.\nO jogo tem sistemas, gráficos e músicas de terceiros... e não há creditos a ninguem em nenhuma parte do jogo!\n\nComo não bastasse, o jogo é um plagio sem tamanho do Anime Naruto. Porém nem como cópia o jogo conseguiu ser funcional.\nEle tem pessimos personagens, nem motivação eles tem. Fora que você vai se ver lutando diversas vezes, sem nem saber o porquê!\n\nA história do jogo como ja disseram parece ter sido escrita por uma criança de 7 anos... E acreditem, ja ví bons jogos feitos por crianças que conseguem ser melhores que muito jogo aqui no steam.\nFora a existência de inumeros bugs de programação, inimigos mal balanceados... sério, você tem mais de 15 magias, e só uma delas causa algum dano ao inimigo.\n\nÉ sério, não comprem esse jogo, nem se ele estiver de graça. Ou melhor, até mesmo se te pagarem, não joguem esse lixo de jogo!\nEle não vale a pena em nenhum aspecto...\n\nAh, e quanto a parte do "mais de 12 horas de gameplay", leia como: você vai ficar 5 horas preso em cada puzzle, dentro de um labirinto, com inumeras batalhas forçadas.\nResultando em mais de 20 horas de tormento, pois o jogo não sabe a hora de terminar... E, sim, ele tem uma continuação... mas espero que ela nunca saia. Mas duvido da eficiencia do Steam em saber quando um jogo deve ou não ser publicado.\n\nE pergunto... Como alguem consegue recomendar um jogo malfeito como esse?","December 14, 2015","false","35.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/recommended/399790/","badhairqueen","badhairqueen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/","55 products in account","Everything wrong with this game can be summarised in one sentence:\n\nExtremely $hitty battle system.\nIt's not obvious in the beginning, but once you level up to 20-something, the absolute r3tardedness of it all becomes clear.\n\nSome examples of what I mean:\n\n1) At level 27, ceteris paribus (i.e. all conditions being equal), your normal attack is 61, versus your enemy's normal attack of 519. This is with the best available gear and maximum power-ups in the form of various item purchases.\n\n2) The elemental attacks are frigging meaningless - e.g. you would think a "flaming rat" would be immune to fire right? And yes, for some fire attacks they get very little damage. But for a few fire attacks, they receive the same damage as others, and can also suffer from the "+burn" status effect - even though the graphics clearly depict them as being already on fire (and their element is fire)! Where's the logic?!\n\n3) At the ninja tournament, you are suddenly made to use characters you were not using on a regular basis before. (The game always forcefully assigns characters to you to fight with throughout.) As a result, because these characters were not prepped or appropriately levelled up for the challenge, it is nigh impossible to win the battle using them. You have to be popping +HP pills all the time, and even then it's a huge challenge (you just have to betting on the fact that your opponent won't kill you using one of their specials, which have the potential to wipe you out at one go, since your opponents are several levels higher than you are, and equipped with the best possible gear!!!). Where's the fun in that???\n\n4) Normal attacks, which consume no MP and TP, deal WAY more damage than magic/skill attacks. I'm talking figures like 448 (using normal attack) as opposed to 92 (using MP/TP attack). Get lost!!!!!!\n\n5) You never ever get a chance to remove status effects like +poison, +blind, +burn, etc because some of your enemies are so fast that their turn keeps coming before you even get a chance to move. This in particular happens during the ninja tournament. So, just wait to die. Kthx.\n\nI suspect most of the these problems have to do with the fact that, after you reach a certain level, the game just suddenly starts assigning you enemies that are at least 2-3 levels higher than you. So when you're at level 27 for instance, you could be facing 6 enemies at levels 28, 27, 29, 29, 25, 28 respectively. And yes, it's YOU (one person), versus 6 of them. What the hell.\n\nIt's a pity because I kind of enjoyed the game in the earlier stages, before it started going completely insane with the battle system. The story was corny, but the narrative and goals were clear, and there were many places and items to explore. (Speaking of which, some of the items were bleedin' USELESS. Once again, you'll only find this out later on in the game when more items start becoming available, and you realise they are 100% redundant. You can't even use many of them during battle. Shan't elaborate because my consternation at this game is growing with every word I type.)\n\nSo, yeah. I basically wasted my time going this far in this game, because I've concluded that it's impossible to proceed without some extreme hair-tearing and head-banging (against the wall or table) due to the anger and frustration that this game's battle system will induce in you.\n\nI should also mention that the English is beyond atrocious. E.g. "insensitive" used instead of "incentive"; "peak" used instead of "pique", and so on. And you get spellings like "rouge" (instead of "rogue" - and the wrongly-spelled version appears for the WHOLE game!!!), "paralized" (instead of "paralysed"), etc etc. Very often, the words are spelled like how the game author thinks they are pronounced, instead of what they actually are. He could probably write his own dictionary with the sheer number of words he's re-spelled.\n\nAnd then there's the dialogue - in the beginning of the game it's still quite ok, then suddenly, you start seeing "f***" appear everywhere.\n\n*shakes head*\n\nForget it. Just forget it.","May 2","false","23.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","12"

After some research I found the “creator” of this pile of insults  LINK [www.rpgmakervxace.net]\n\nThere are several things stated which made me in furious about the game:\nGreat and Unique Story\nWhile at the bottom it says:\nIf you see your or someones work that I have left out of the game please let me know so I can give them credit as well.\nPlease report any errors, grammar issues and etc. for update fixes.\nFeed back is appreciated!!\n\nHow about giving Masashi Kishimoto credits for the original story? To claim someone else's work as your own because you made some minor changes/ like names/ does NOT make it yours. Beside of that, even if you don’t know Naruto there isn’t anything enjoyable about the game at all.\n\nThe text seems to be written by a 12 year-old who just learnt the word “♥♥♥♥”.\nAn example from the >in-game instructions< you get after receiving the world map:\nyou can now use the world map freely. this allows you to go to different villages [...] or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want to do.\nThere are several typos and grammar mistakes too and you might notice a limited vocabulary in all dialogues.\n\nThe game is utterly unbalanced. You start OP with around 1000 HP and enemies deal 1-20 dmg (status ailment deal 200-450 dmg which makes no sense at all) and at one point you barely deal any dmg to them anymore but enemies will inflict status ailments and a lot of dmg.\nIt’s a turn based combat system but the “abilities” are rather unsatisfying. Those who attack two or three random enemies usually hit dead enemies and they all use to look the same.\n\nOf course there were several annoying bugs too. I had to do the first mission you get in the game twice to proceed. I had to do quests or get items more than once to finally get the game in noticing in that I obtained the certain object to go on with this torment. The character that is supposed to be Sasuke is permanently stuck on lvl 15. Just like the game I will spare you the others due to laziness.\n\nWalking around in town gets frustrating since NPCs keep blocking the entrances or exits almost everywhere you go. When you are able to buy equipment for you and the party, the main character is usually alone, so you might guess which character can wear which equipment or just buy the whole shop.\n\nThis game was actually gifted to me but I honestly wouldn’t recommend this to anyone, neither for free nor for 0,99$. I personally wish that this game is going to be removed from steam because it is a mere insult to the original story of Naruto.

I’m beginning to feel like that tool was one of the worst things to happen to the marketplace since anime visual novels. With that said, what is good about Destiny Warrior?\n\nWell the art style is actually quite charming; it keeps the appeal of simple pixel art with just enough polish to keep it from looking like garbage on a 1080p monitor at fullscreen. The combat has very pretty effects and in my opinion are decently animated. The music is certainly generic but far from the obnoxious noise I’ve had to mute in some other RPG Maker titles I’ve experienced recently. You also receive a rating post-combat that can give you bonus gold and experience which I thought was actually really cool. The interface, however, is difficult to read due to an over use of pastel colors and this also makes figuring out who the active character in combat is.\n\nIt works, but it’s one of a million of these RPG Maker excretions.

Three characters are pretty similar to that of naruto im my opinon which isn't bad its just not unique. The story is ok, but again also similar to that of naruto in some respects. Ok so as far as the gameplay goes, its actually pretty fun for the most part. This reminds me of yu-yu hakusho on gameboy advance (minus the movement during the fight). And that game to me was one of the best rpg's I've ever played.\n\nA few things to note that soured the experience for me though. First, the buffs (or effects whatever you wanna call them). Oh my god these buffs are the most overpowered things ever. So there are a few parts of the game where you have to split your party up into groups of two (which already annoys me), but some of these enemies can stun, paralyze, freeze, burn, ect... My first time going through this with my two characters, both of them got stunned at the same time. Not only is that an annoyingly common thing that happens but it lasts for (I ♥♥♥♥ you not) a minimum of three rounds. So about 25% of this game for me was just sitting there waiting so that I can actually do something. Like holy hell I understand a need for challenge but immobilizing the player to make it harder for them is not the way to do it.\n\nFinally, this game looks like half of it was written by a clever professional writer, but the other half looks like it was written by a 15 year old that forgot to proofread his work. I understand this isn't a triple a title or anything but cmon guys. You gotta be better than this.\n\nAll in all its a fun game, its worth the $3, but it has its drawbacks and if these flaws bother you then don't get it.","September 14, 2015","true","25.0"," 38 of 69 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","38","69","2","0"

It's bug ridden. I encountered several bugs, the worst and lastly gamebreaking bug is a bug that I encountered during the "Tournament". I have savegames and the fights went well, till the second day. I had reduced the opponent to zero hitpoints, normally knocking her out, but somehow the NPC kept kicking and lastly I ran out of health - Epic fights? Indeed I felt reminded of Le Morte d'Artus and the epics fights where the knights fought for days on, without any sign of weakness and fatigue - sadly in the game also unrealistic and utterly frustrating. Lastly the game closed with a bug, and needed to be shut down by either task manager or... closing the window externally... This actually is a sign of unresolved function calls, that can cause the RPG Maker machine to get quirky.\n\nGenre type values:\n\nStory: -- I've heard and read a lot about the story, and I've done my own researches about some of the given terms and historic topics. Yes, it is a fantasy story! Yes, it is also a story that is taking a lot out of "Anime"-Stuff, some of this, too unrealistic, totally Mary Sue (or Gary Sue) and thus destroying it's own basis. To call the story "cheesy" can actually be an insult to cheese. But I am actually lacking a better word for it at the moment.\n\nLeveling/Character Developement: -- Unbalanced to a very annoying point. You rise fast in levels and will actually have no trouble fighting down the foes the game throws in your face. The skills and different kinds of "Magic" will become overwhelming. The developement of the characters is like some prepotent, bragging and utterly overdone kids playground.\n\nImmersion: Ø One of the better parts, because the game actually is able to draw you in at first. You will find quite soon very unsympathetic (in the sense of unlikeable) characters which you actually would love to skip down the... errr, drain.\n\nOverall: 8 - Alone on the given points this game is a waste of time, and money. Don't buy it, in it's current state it's just a burden. I am actually wondering if I am the only person to encounter the gamebreaking bug, or if others also had the same troubles.\n\nValue for Money: Fair at 99 Cents The game is actually cheap, and thus the playing time here is a good measure of the value.\n\nNot Recommended\nThe game is not recommendable, not even to RPG Fans, not even to fans of trash...","April 29","false","10.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

That isn't welcomed here.\n- Troll game. The game will send two fire users (forcefully) to a fire themed area, thus your attacks will be resisted (do a lot less/half damage). At this point you're better off just running from every battle you can just so you can get to the boss while avoiding 4-6 minute random encounters. That's insane and troll-ish.\n- Useless treasure chests.

The enemies don't scale with you, and by the time you hit some of the dungeons, you can't run away any more and since it's impossible to go to the shop in a mission you can't restock on supplies that you use in between the battles that take five to ten minutes a piece.\nHow are you expected to handle 16 damage sponge enemies in a row, with two characters that get no healer, and neither of them have weapons that are properly up to the task?  The moment you want to advance the story, all the enemies turn into bosses, every single one of them.","May 1","false","3.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's a horrible idea that makes no sense, and makes you want to either:\n\n1. AVOID battles at all costs to keep the enemies low level or\n2. Fight in the same area leveling up to 99.\n\nHowever, WHY would you want to skip battles in an RPG? Why would you want to repeat the same areas if you don't gain an advantage from grinding?\nWhy do the enemies level up between battles? My team hit level 10 in the first area and the same slimes and flowers were level 10 as well. It's not like they were fighting battles, and this doesn't make sense because in the first area of the game you should not have to be fighting such high level creatures.\n\nI'm not saying this is difficult, I'm saying this is not fun and that's the most important thing.\n\nThis game is garbage for this reason, and I would suggest avoiding it no matter how cheap it goes on sale.\n\nEdit: I've learned that it's possible things change later in the game, but based on this being the introduction to the game, I didn't want to continue.

Those are some big names. So how heavy is this game influenced be the aforementioned titles? Not much. I - being a lover especially of Chrono Trigger - didn't even see a hint about it except that both games are basically in a classic RPG-Style.\n\nWhat did I like?\n-The beginning wasn't exceptional but ok.\n-The game itself works - most of the time.\n-I really did want to see how the story progresses and it all ends. But it seems I can't drag myself through the end. It's just too painful.\n-I liked the idea of implementing quizzes regarding the games setting for getting some additional items and one part of the storyline.\n-Some thought and work has been invested into it.\n\nWhat did I dislike? Oh boy, actually a ton...\n-All the assets are as far as I can tell stock assets, which does not need to be a huge downside. But be warned: you might've seen these faces and animations in a lot of games, you've heard the songs thousands of times, the sounds are old friends (which might be a plus if you're very into it)...\n-At the beginning, it plays pretty smooth, your characters learn new abilities, they progress through levels and get stronger. However, soon leveling is almost obsolete. Enemies will then always take lower damage and dish out more than your characters can. The only attacks which work good are so Chi-expensive you need to carry ludicrous amounts of Chi-pills with you; and healing kits or "tents" (which revive all of your crew). "Elemental attacks" aren't really that powerful even against the correct "contra-element". Gear does more for winning a battle than leveling. Luck DECIDES MOST OF YOUR BATTLES. Even if your "gang" has the highest possible levels (it is 50 for some chars, less for others) you'll get your ♥♥♥ handed to you in later battles.  Even with the most pricey armour and weaponry. Tactical options are limited to finding the attacks which work best; and still you have to press Enter all the way through battle for a long time. Your only chance of taking some influence on the battles is using gear which might give extra protection against certain "elemental" enemies or... trying to escape. Which most often will not work near the end, even if your chars are maxxed. I don't know if it is even possible to win this game without cheating. I guess by poor chance it might be possible.\nI've played lots of RPG-Maker games and underdogs (I like to give many games a chance), but seldomly have I met something so frustrating. It is a frustration that sets in too late for you to notice to pull the plug. I know how many games require a good deal of grinding but here you do it just to see that IT DOESN'T HELP AT ALL. After you've done it.\n-The storyline. I don't want to put too many spoilers in here, but a good deal of it is pretty blunt. There's things never hinted or talked about by any (N)PC, it's just "BOOM - THERE IT IS - IT ALWAYS WAS LIKE THAT - TAKE THAT, SHUT UP, DO YOUR MISSION". It is extremely linear (well, many (RPG-Maker) games are to a certain degree, but here you are accompanied with this feeling right from the start. Minor Spoiler for one example: You get a world map at a certain point in the game which allows you to travel around. But you can only visit places you've already been to. Yes, sometimes there are little changes, but nothing too much.\n-Sidequests. They are not really quests. You can - yes, spoiler - trade in some (sometimes extremely rare) loot items for cash or experience. One by one. Always going through the same dialogue. Or you can fight some monsters which most likely will "rip you a new one" for some experience. Wow.\n-The Battles (again): Everything is drawn out, tons of battles are there to slow you down. Regardless of your difficulty setting you'll lose hours of your life just trying to escape or fight through the sheer number of encounters you will face. You'll spent much time restarting the game completely if you try to avoid some seemingly unnecessary fights by just reloading your game. Why? You can't flee many battles because the enemies are faster/better skilled than you. You can't just quickly restart the game with F12 because this crashes it in most instances.\n-Loot. How can loot be bad? Well because there often is none, instead you get additional fights which draw out the game even longer. You might have to fight even the hardest baddies to just get an empty chest or another soul-rending encounter. And often you get mediocre stuff you'd already have discarded because you need better gear to even get to the area where this stuff is located. Only money seems to help a bit.\n-Crashes when trying to restart with F12 (which might be a compatibility problem with Steam, I can't tell for sure), Crashes when you're trying to use some in-game items (like the great series of the "Kitt"-Books)\n-This is a minor complaint, but the writing and grammar... well there are noticeable errors all throughout the game.\n-Somebody charged money for this.\n\nI didn't even finish it yet which I wanted to accomplish before writing this review - sometimes a good ending may make up for a lot of trouble - but it is just getting slower, sluggish even, unfair to non-working, more boring and repetitive towards the end. I guess sometime I might get to it but as for now... no. Just no.\n\nThere might be more to say but I feel like I've already invested too much time into this game altogether. If you ask me this is not a recommendable game. Even if you get it heavily discounted.\n\nAs it is with reviews, this conclusiion might contain some subjective impressions.","May 24","false","17.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its developers lameness that does. OK, typos do happen, but with frequency like that, I stopped paying careful attention to plot. Lack of commas makes text hard to read and there are dots missing between many sentences making it impossible to understand what is written here and there. Note that english is not my native language but even with my little skill I can spot countless errors.\nBattle balance is even worse: both enemies and characters have very big HP and very low attack. This makes killing enemies unnecessary long and dying nearly impossible. However, 25% of battles work differently: you have even worse damage, but one spell that does big damage, but enemy - it either does genocidal damage or stunlock 3/4 of your party on first move. I am writing this review as I struggle through last battle where you have ONE character at max level, which does not have any attacks that would do significant damage (except super attack which first requires drinking skill potion - to get 100 skill points for that attack, and then actually attacking, which will not happen as you will get stunned) while enemies have elemental attacks, that end your first turn by either stunning you or paralyzing. Of course, you will be dead before you can move as you can get both paralyze and stun at the same time, but they wear out not at the same time, so you get at least one of those debuffs most of your turns.\nIf the battle is an easy one, it will be boring. The big HP and low dmg extend battles to very long times. There is nothing else about them except that enemy lvl scales as you level up, but enemies characteristics - and that is AT LEAST agility which determines turn order and is most noticeable to this as after level up you frequently no longer attack first - grow faster. Thankfully, boss battles are of a fixed levels.\nFor graphics and sound - PURELY default RPG maker assets. I was unable to see anything unique in this game. The only thing that was quite good is that developer used different character faces for different emotions. Not every rpg maker game does this, so it is nice too see this small feature, especially that facial expressions go very well with a plot. But the game fails in many places, so its not really helping.\nPlot is so-so. People say that its a Naruto ripoff, but I haven't watched that cartoon so can't say. But what I can say is that its too much absurd at times.\n\nI would not recommend buying this even with 90% discount, too much bad development choices make this game true mess. But if you like CRAZY plots - you might want to check it out, but make sure that you play on easy difficulty, as last boss is still hard as hell. People say that on hard, its unbearable right from the start of the game.","November 7, 2015","false","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This was one of them. Unfortunately, even as a game that cost me about ten cents, even if it was free, I can't recommend it. There are simply much better ways to spend my time.\n\nI have about fifteen minutes invested into the game, but during that time, I started a new game, winced at about half a dozen obvious grammar and spelling mistakes in three minutes, then began the combat tutorial ("Come at me bro!!!", really?), and tried to take a screenshot of a particularly funny error with F12, which instead immediately took me back to the "New game" screen without saving my progress.

The game came in a bundle with a few other games for practically pennies to the dollar, so I didn't read into the reviews before purchasing it.\n\nThat was a mistake on my part. Always read the reviews.\n\nAt first, I didn't know what to think of this game. For the first 10-20 minutes or so, I thought it might be a parody game, something meant to be silly. This is because although the description called the game "heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, and the Dragon Quest series," the only series that it is remotely similar to is Naruto. Actually, the game reads like a confusing Naruto fanfiction: it mashes together Eastern-ish and Western themes to the point where its almost funny (your Village's Leader in the about? His name was Kage Alex) and there are a few rediculous moments in the dialouge (CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-), and I think the game could have been hilarious.\n\nThe battle mechanics are unbalanced and weird, and though I leveled up at an absurd rate, battles still dragged on to the point of being tedious. To be honest, I only got about 2 hours into this "12 hour RPG" and I had to put it down. The problem was that it just got so repetitive that I completely lost interest, and any investment I might have had in the plot went out the window.\n\nHowever, I think this game should have been what it feels like it is: A Naruto fan game. I would have enjoyed playing a Naruto RPG, even just for the novelty of it. But they dropped some really big, heavy names in the description, where the only things they have in common in this game are being pixelated turn-based RPGs.\n\nI know this game must have taken a lot of time and effort, and I would hate to see something I spent so much time and effort on be torn apart in the reviews. But my biggest problem with it is that the game's description and About were... misleading. I felt a little tricked, and no matter how little I spend on something I do not want to feel like I'd been fooled into doing it.\n\nI may pick it up later after getting a chance to digest it more, but as of right now I doubt it.\n\n\nTL;DR\nBased on Naruto, not inspired by Chrono Trigger/Final Fantasy/Dragon Warrior.\nIt's okay, just know what you're getting into.\n\n3/10\nWould Not Recommend","January 4","false","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Desteny Warriors is normal turn-based rpg with both random and defined battles. The story, which is actually quite surprisingly decent is based on the group of teenager ninja students and their adventures - sounds familiar? Well it's a Naruto inspired game alright.\n\nDesteny Warriors has potential and the devs have done their job ok. The game is easy to learn and there is many well animated battle features to choose from and the plot moves smoothly with various cutscenes. I also digged the consistent, linear design of story - the linearness might divide opinion but I dig that I always know what to do next.\n\nThe thing which fails in the game is disturbing dialogue. I really did find the story partly great, but it is clashed with clumsy comedy, which may make you sneer awkwardly rahter than smile. I also noted how F-word is richly used, which might be ok if it's timed correctly but when you begin to hear this in every conversation like ♥♥♥♥ it, ♥♥♥♥ that, you are free to ♥♥♥♥ around if you like, I had to bury my face in hands for shared sense of shame. If this is meant to be satire or joke I don't get it.\n\nI don't rate this down only for trashy dialogue. The fighting gets dull after while because the fights last seriously longer time than other jrpg games I've played. The hostiles can simply take too much of damage before falling and  animations won't save the day no matter how fine they are.\n\nIn conclusion Desteny Warriors is ok rpg for its light price and I know worse ways to spent money. And if the game should get a sequel I'd love it being ripped off from all this tasteless gab and replaced with quality which actually is harmony with the rest of the game.","September 30, 2015","false","4.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","0"

It wouldn't be so bad if it was inspired by or have a similar setting, but no, they clearly stealed a lot of creative material from Naruto (character personalities, storyline, locations) and adapted it for the game, mainly (I believe) as an easy pandering to the fans to get to sell the game.\n-A lot of bugs, a lot grammar errors, a lot of "edgy" teenager dialog (cursing regularly to try and get some cheap laughts).\n-Unbalanced as all hell, this was not game tested, sometimes you are too powered up for the enemies, sometimes too underpowered.\n\n\nRecommendation?

Also I will say that I've played way more than what it says I have since I played this mainly offline and steam does not track offline play time.  I'm currently on Chap 9 in game\n\nPros:\n-Naruto storyline\n-pretty good humor when the grammar isn't atrocious\n\nCons\n-Naruto based storyline\n-Every character you can tell relatively early on is a Naruto reference and some chapters if you can't tell by then will quite literally toss that fact in your face\n- There is an arbitrary level cap which you WILL hit well before the end of the game\n- The enemies lv with you making relatively easy fights becoming incredibly long and tedious by the end game\n- Nearly every skill is improperly coded so instead of doing realistic damage they do 1 dmg, every, time.\n- There are not only random encounters when walking through a map, but roaming ones you actually see on the map, and if one of those touch you, you can't flee and when you get later on those fights can take upwards of 15 mins to complete especially on chap 8 I believe\n- The cast of playable characters you can use is relatively small and out of all of them at end game you will only be using one of them (this game's version of Sakura), and one is completely useless for nearly the whole game (this game's version of Rock Lee)\n- Out of all the late game skills you get only one does any consistent or notable damage which is deadly bubbles, which you will spam in EVERY FIGHT\n- The music is repetitive to the extreme, This game as well as cubicle quest use the same base sound files, but there it actually sounds nice to me, here it is dull and clashes, the only song that has stuck out to me is the one where you fight all the music ninjas (the games version of the sound 5 from the Sasuke's departure arc) and that song doesn't show up till the end of chap 6 I beleive.\n-  the complete and utter lack of real stable pace in game, this is mainly due to how awful nearly everyone is and you have no real control over your party due to plot reasons.  So you can go from having everything falling before you from having bubbles attack, to needing to run from everything knowing that it'll take too long fighting them\n- Having both human and enemy units know the same skills but the code is different meaning they work differently, this is a really weird nitpick but some enemies later on down the line know late game skills your party can learn, but unlike for you they actually work for them!  This is especially bad during one of the phantom fights because it uses tsunami which for you does maybe 800 dmg, but when they use it it does nearly 2.5k making it one of the hardest fights in the game.\n\n\nSo yeah lots of problems, need I say more?","December 3, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I thought I'd spend more time in this game to find anything really redeeming about it. Well... the maps are made well? And by well I don't mean interesting or fun.

Infact, there's nothing redeeming to be said about this title.\nLet's start with the story. You fight rouges (who look a lot like rogues instead of mascara, but let's ignore that for the moment) for plot-critical documents... a shopping list for the Kings Wife. Well, there's your plot. The only thing more horrible than it are the dialogues. Even though the best part of a RPG is already ruined, maybe it's gameplay can salvage somewhat?\n\nWell, nope. You fight with 4 people. You can equip them in the city, except, you only get the player at that point so you pretty much need to guess/have identic memory or note down what the hell the other 3 can even wear in the first place. So far the good stuff, combat is pretty much mashing spacebar (using chi or tp has little use), sometimes using right to select another target. Do take care not to press too much while mindlessly battling, as right can also start the combat. And if no action is taken you don't auto-attack or defend or anything, nope you're just have your turn wasted. Great mechanic!\nIn the starting areas you battle lvl 5-8 enemies, in the following areas too. Well, you are level 15 now, but hey, here are some level 3 rats for this high-level area. Enemies can come randomly (oh noes), out of crates (well, that just sucks) and if you're stupid enough to wander into the random enemies.\nTalking about random enemies, they can't actually initiate combat with them, you need to run into them. Leading to many accounts of moonwalking enemies just humping you hoping for you to foolishly walk in their direction. Silly random mobs, who would torment themselves to even more of this combat system?\n\nWell, those underleveled foes become a blessing when the bosses end up, who ARE at your level. 1000HP+ with your attacks doing 10 damage per hit. Have a fun 20 minutes slashing into it. Sure gets that 12 hours there. And once you FINALLY defeat the darn thing (make it end!) ANOTHER boss turns up right after it without chance to save. Sure you can use potions to heal but overall you start with what you got (like no magic). Not that it matters anyway since this second boss is so magic resistant you need to rely on melee attacks. Have another 20 minutes of... "fun"...\n\nYeah, me? I went for the uninstall button instead. Bad gameplay, bad plot, bad dialogue... Bad game.","December 29, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I also know however that this worthless game is deserving of neither praise nor hate because it's un-finished and broken! You neglected all forms of story arc, editing was a hotter mess than most reality tv shows and to top it all off you basically stole the entire lore of your world! Was there any Original content at all? Did you at the very least edit the scripts that you just copied and pasted? Did you simply use google Images to find pre made sprites and tile sets? I would complain about not giving credit where it was due, but I couldn’t make it to the credits due to multiple glitches.\n\nOver all I give this game Zero out of Zero; it’s not even done yet; so rating it is a complete waste! In the future at least put more than two hours effort into your development and at the very least run several play tests to edit the gramatical errors.\n\nA complete waste… Just like even the smallest amount of money paid for this debauchery…\n\n-Snake 2557\n","September 18, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However...\nThe dialogue drives me up the wall.\nSeveral words are misspelled, punctuation seems random, and the game can't decide between "X-tu" and "xtu".\nAlso, the obscene amount of exclamation points and question marks used is just obnoxious.\nAnd before I even get to move or look at anything, the game wants to tell me the controls, and that I can press F1 for options (including remapping the controls it just told me about) and F5 for fullscreen/window toggle.\nThe game immediately tells you about the ninja village you live in, the Kage that sacrificed himself, the sealing of beasts inside of children, the village in the leaves, and then you go to school to meet your friends, the emo kid, the healer, and the one nobody cares about, and your first mission is to retrieve some bells from your sensei.\nAfter that, it's revealed that Orochimaru, a ninja master long thought dead, is actually alive, and is...\n...Wait, no, sorry, I got lost there for a moment. I thought I was writing a review for a JRPG, not Naruto.\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking they're the same thing.\nAlso, before you see any real action, there is actually a battle tutorial.\nIt teaches you the complex art of battle, covering topics such as "how to attack", which tells you about the attack button, and how to press it; "hp and you", which teaches you the fundamentals of health points (or sometimes hit points); "skills for the skilled", which covers everything you need to know about selecting attacks that cost MP (I think it's MP anyway, I couldn't be bothered to commit any of this to memory).\nBut yeah, a battle tutorial. For a JRPG. Yep.\nAnd just in case you forgot, you can press F1 for options, and F5 to switch between fullscreen and windowed.\nThere are also save points, but those don't matter, because they forgot to disable saving anywhere you want.\nWhile this game has its flaws, it still did one good thing:\nit taught me that I can put very little effort into an RPG Maker game, and it will make a few bucks.\nYou too can be the next big JRPG star! ...or at least make a few bucks on some shovelware. :)","January 18","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While every character is able to use magic, every character has a special focus on either elemental magic or healing abilities.\n\nGameplaywise progress has been very linear so far with hardly any room for exploration. However, the combat mechanics are interesting to play around! Apart from your standard features (Attack, Guard and Items and magic, called X-TU) there are so called Skills/Moves which can be triggered after earning so called TP points while fighting. These include elemental buffs for weapons as well as a variety of special attacks. More spells and skills/moves are unlocked by leveling up.\nCombat itself hasn't been too much of a challenge so far, but this is what makes Destiny Warriors RPG accessible imho.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend Destiny Warriors RPG to newcomers to the 16-bit classic style JRPG genre, as it always keeps objectives clear and battles on the easier side, compared to other titles where you have to be your guard at all times!\n\nPS: There is even some swearing in the game....The evil F word!!","September 12, 2015","true","19.8"," 65 of 135 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","65","135","4","0"

Our Hero starts out in his hometown surrounded by friends and family. He is attending a Ninja School, to learn the art of the warrior ninja. After taking your final test you are sent to the forest to finish your training and learn the basics of combat. Destiny Warriors reminds me of Dragon Warrior or the original Final Fantasy. Visually, it looks like a retro RPG and has decent music and sound effects. I think this game has been much better developed than Secret of Magia, which was also put out by the same developers.

This doesn't bother me, as I've played some very entertaining RPG maker games. Also other reviews have mentioned that the game lifts concepts from Naruto. Having not seen many episodes, I can't weigh in on that.\n\nWhat I can say is the game is a decent JRPG game with ninja themes. The dialog has a touch of humor in places. There is a little swearing, so be aware if that bothers you.\n\nThe battle system is your basic JRPG setup, except using skills and "Xtu" instead of Magic and MP. The battles do take a little more planning as monsters, even low level ones, are tough and can't be defeated in a few hard blows. You have to whittle them down while keeping yourself and your team alive.\n\nIt may not be the next "Chrono Trigger" but for the price, it's a decent game if you're into classic JRPGs.","October 15, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The story isn't that bad. A bit generic but still not that bad. However. The battles. Oh my. It's like bashing a rock against another rock to see which one breaks first. The enemies do very little damage and unless you are good at guessing which attacks are more effective then you might be in theat battle a while. Eventually I got bored of the battling and kept trying to escape. I CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM THREE PLANTS! PLANTS! ARE YOU SERIOUS!? I got quite far. I mean I nearly sunk 14 hours into this game. And then there were the phatom battles. They actually offered some challenge. Oh Maddie and Kitt have got there super modes! Nice this will by fun. More phantoms. Phantom Maddie used Tsunami. 50% life gone. Phantom Kitt used Clone Storm. Dead. Before I could even make a move. Also I found that the Higher end abilties on Maddie did less? It seems like someone got lazy.\n\nIn summary, would I recommend this game? Ummm If you are really bored and have less then £1 in your bank and really need a new game then sure. All this game needs is an update and it actually could be good.\n\n\n\n------UPDATE-----\nI finally managed to get past the Phantoms. Took about 3 hours of just restarting the same battle. (I also leveled both Kitt and Maddie up to 50 which is max)\nNow I'm playing with Spark, his dad and Shinzuey. By god they are useless. Mike runs out of chi every turn (He's a chi based character) And Spark and Shinzuey do hardly any damage. This means it's taking 50+ turns to complete one battle. That's about thirty minutes.

Obviously there are some errors in the dialogue, and difficulty in some of the missions. Yes, the storyline is pretty similar to Naruto. This is the story from what I can tell: ninja kid named J.C. is given a group in his ninja village. The group, made up of main characters, does missions for the kage. They fight monsters and eventually Max, a grp member, meets a dark figure, who convinces him to join their evil organization. Yes, the story is similar.\n\nHOWEVER, don't mistake this for a lack of originality!!\nSo far, after playing this game for a while there have been many people saying that it's easy and extremely simple.\nNotice how the majority of them have played less than four hours. The combat becomes difficult, there is no question there... And the gameplay is fun, but repetitive sometimes.\n\nI like the games music personally, and the look and feel of the world is good imo.\nI THINK the characters are more awesome than people give them credit for. I mean it's not a crime for there to be some comedy in the script. Nobody honestly thought this game would be esoteric or deeply thought inducing.\n\nConclusion: way worth the price, if your having doubts I would try it. The end game takes a while to reach, obv. nobody here has finished it yet. There are some parts that seem impossible, for ex. the boss im fighting right now is a real mother. Seeing as how it just came out, I hope the devs update some of the bosses. If you want a good way to spend time for a few hours occasionally, then this game would be damn near perfect. If you got the money to shell out, I would say go ahead. I got way more than I payed for out of it, and im sure plenty of people probly feel the same way.

I was planning to play it for 30mins to maybe an hour even though I know this not the kind of game for me and I don't like it. But I was optimistic since I was asked to try it out and give it a review. So oh well since I got for free so I'll just return the favor for free too!\n\nSo I played it for about 14mins did some action and skip some long reading here and there more spacebar spacebar since the character cannot talk in full-audio and can only write their dialogs in-game lol. I don't wanna read all the long linesO.o of dialogs. Anyhow I've reached the action part and more spacebar, arrow key etc :) but I guess it's just the way it is like how FF games were(old FF games have similar style of graphics and gameplay.) Though I as I played through I already felt really boring in the first 10mins but continued more action then it suddenly crashed in the 14th min so I guess that's it I don't wanna proceed more. I know this game might get better in the middle part once you get hang of it, like 5hr more I guess but maybe next time as it's not really for me. I know others like this sort type of games so I just wanna respect that part.\n\nFor me I only recommend for the reason I've stated.

As a naruto fan i can see this a game based off the anime series naruto. I have been searching for a game like this for a while now, and happy i found one. To improve I think you should add a S Kyu jutsu that only J.C (Naruto) knows and his father (rasengan), and Max Sasuke) should learn a S kyu that only he knows (chidori). All together I think this game has some bad bits like too much spawning and normaly same kyu element which kinda sucks because if you face off alone againts the opposite element your srewed (ex. Max vs himself and phantom). Also the damage you casue also pisses me off, you do like 500 damage while they do like 1000 or when its a kyu that cost like 350 chakra and does 1 damage kinda sucks (includes beast mode). I can't wait for the second one, can't wait.\n\nP.S. If you are reading this game maker, please add something like the rasengan or chidori/or kyuubi/bijuu mode, Thanks. :-)","December 11, 2015","true","39.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I was definitely a Naruto rip off, but there were quirks and commentary that made it humorous. (Spark will forever be known as Dude Elf to me thanks to looking like an elf, and the first dialogue coming out of him including "dude") The different types of skills and weapons made for an interesting game play, and it was relatively easy to level up. I was confused when Max suddenly capped, but figured he was the Sasuke character and would be lost eventually. Overall though, not that bad.\n\nThen the ninja tournament came. Suddenly the battle system became a joke. The status effects and speed of the opponents was so ridiculous that I had to redo the first battle at least 20 times. Things only went downhill from there. The enemies, especially boss fights, were ridiculous. Enemy defense was so high that attacks that used to do hundreds or even thousands of damage were now doing 1. When the beast modes finally showed up...wow that was a let down. Rather than power up during beast modes, character skills were limited and the bosses in particular seemed to be exceptionally strong and fast.\n\nI will give an example: in the first temple, you are forced to fight clones of your current party plus the phantom summoning them. Round one was pretty balanced. They had my attacks, I had theirs, so just working out how to attack them so that I came out on top was both easy and straight forward. Then round 2 happened. The characters are forced into beast mode while more clones pop up. Suddenly my characters were down to less techniques than I could count on a hand. That's nice and all, except they are dishing out attacks that both freeze and take out half the hp of the characters (keep in mind my characters are both capped, wearing their strongest armors, and have items equipped to add to their power and defense.). What happens when I dish out the same technique which my character happened to keep? 1hp damage. Compared to thousands on their part. I'm sorry, but what? Add on the fact that these guys have status effects, are insanely fast, and have both a healer and a phantom which can resummon clones in a turn, and it was something worth rage quitting over.\n\nNow I am at the second temple, and already there are lizardmen who are showing the same ridiculous effect spam and healing techniques. Let's also include here that they are pretty high in level, which would put them on par with the main guy on the team, but the game has forcefully pair him up with his ten levels lower father (which the game says can equip armor and a weapon...which he cannot), and a character who is lvl literally 28 levels lower.\n\nI haven't even finished the game yet, but this is one that I'm seriously considering just letting sit unfinished.","May 15","false","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I picked up this game expecting it to be a parody of Naruto. It is to an extent. My real only problems with it are the combat system.\n\n1.Enemies level up with you completely defeating the purpose of leveling up.\n2. At least 3 bosses through the game can stun lock you incredibly easily including the I believe second to last boss who has 5 people who can stun you who attack every turn.\n3.The occasional move is mislabeled. In the same fight the enemy used the same move twice. One for fire and one for ice. If I remember correctly it was blaze kick or something like that.\n4. Oh and lots and lots of cursing\n\nWill it give you those 12 hours promised? Yes ,but mostly from random things like the stun lock.\nIn the end if you like Naruto, are willing to see a parody of it,and can ignore the above problems this is for you. If not then I recommend you move along.","May 31","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
