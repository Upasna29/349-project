However, not only Gemcraft does it superbly but it also offers depth and complexity you won't find in most TD games.\n\nThe most unique and fun feature of the game, in my opinion, is the wave angering. Player can spend some mana to make monster waves stronger (by increasing monster numbers and stats), which allows you to gain more mana and experience from killing the monsters... IF you can kill them that is. This one feature changes the gameplay from simple defense to the "how far can I push it" competition.\n\nAnother feature, which adds extra replayability value, is the ability to customize levels. It's pretty fun to return to some of early levels later in the game to see how much stronger you have become by beating the level with some extra difficulty settings. You can add more waves, make monsters stronger, faster, tougher or tweak some game rules to get a harder map with higher experience multiplayer.\n\nAh, the experience - player character can gain levels and unlock various skills and spells which will increase his efficiency in killing monster filth. There is no level cap, however some skills (not all) have a limit to which they can be improved. Add to it a wizard's talisman which can be socketed with talisman fragments gathered along your journey and you get quite a few ways of progressing, improving and specialising your character.\n\nHowever, Gemcraft originally being a flash game, has some shortcomings. To many people graphics would be the biggest one. Despite it being pretty "clean", readable and fitting the game's darker theme, it's still 2D graphics in low resolution without all those fireworks that other games have nowadays. Personally I prefer it that way, but to each his own.\n\nI have spent dozens of hours (flash version on ArmorGames, so obviously Steam won't show this time) with this game and can safely recommend it to other Tower Defense games fans. If you are unsure then you may try the free version of the game on ArmorGames to see if you like it. In any case be advised that GemCraft is not a game you can finish in a few hours. There are dozens of levels and some of the later ones can take as much as an hour to finish.","April 30, 2015","true","74.9"," 152 of 155 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","152","155","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoce/recommended/296490/","genoce","Genoce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoce/","1335 products in account","Disclaimer: I've played the free versions of this series for more than 300 hours, probably near 400. (about half of it spent with Gemcraft Labyrinth).\n\nGemcraft has always been my favourite tower defense game by far, the difference between this series and any other TD is just ridiculous. Main reasons why I love this series as a whole:\n\nPause button and ability to act during pause. I hate TD's where I need to act quickly. This allows me to think about what to do at any time I want to.\n\nPretty much everything has a hotkey, which makes the gameplay a bit smoother compared to clicking everything.\n\nYou're always doing something. It's really rare that you get through a wave without building or doing some micromanagement with your towers.\n\nThe math in the game. Everything is told with calculatable numbers. I hate TD's that only tell something like "A high damage, low speed missile tower" with no numbers to tell me what it really does.\n\n148 levels. This is not some basic "get high score in these 10 levels" tower defense, but it has a story/lore, hidden stuff, multiple ways of progression/upgrades, etc.\n\nThe insanely good difficulty scaling. It's not an automatic scaling, but I can choose how difficult I want the game to be. At easiest, it's pretty easy (and boring) to be honest. But you can adjust stuff that changes the gameplay a lot like "next wave comes faster", "you gain mana in waves instead of a constant stream", "faster scaling", "reduced effect of Slow", and of course, endurance mode in any level. You can enable multiple different things at once, and harder settings means more exp = more skills = you can go for even higher difficulty.\n\nDifficulty scaling from "easier than breathing" to "failed in first wave" also means that this game has a difficulty for anyone. Want casual click-and-watch-explosions? You got it. Want to see how long you can survive against impossible odds? You got it.\n\nEvery fail is caused by you and you only. The problem I see with most TD's is the situation where you think "I have no idea which order I should build these towers to complete this level". But because of the difficulty scaling and the complexity of the game in general, I've never had that feeling in Gemcraft. The difficulty scaling causes me to always try harder settings before hitting a wall of "oh sh*t I went too high" like that damn Icarus. But because it was my own choice to begin with, it's just a facepalm moment and retry, instead of feeling that the game is peeing in my cereals.\n\nContinuing with difficulty scaling: even in mid-fight, you can make any wave of monsters harder by spending mana on it. Killing these waves rewards you with even more mana, but doing this requires you to really know your limits: anger them too much and they'll eat you alive. Using this mechanic is pretty much required to beat the hardest levels and difficulties, and it turns the game to a constant balancing of "how much can I take?". This mechanic is unique among the TD's that I've played, and it's also one of the many reasons I love this game.\nThe usual "get a bonus by sending in the next wave earlier" is there aswell.\n\nThe whole series is pretty much like Dark Souls of the tower defense genre. If you get into it, you'll say that it's the best one. The caveat is that it isn't the easiest game to get into, and it isn't for everyone.\n\nThe free version of this game can be found at http://armorgames.com/play/15760/gemcraft-chasing-shadows. I'm not even sure what's the difference because I bought this edition instantly after noticing it's on Steam. But I'd say go try the free one, and if you notice that you run out of content before getting bored with the game, come back here.\n\nTL;DR: In the end it's still a tower defense game, but it's filled with loads of unique ideas/mechanics and everything is polished to the limit and above. For me it's the game that made every other TD suck just because they aren't nearly as good as Gemcraft.","May 17, 2015","true","104.4"," 158 of 164 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","158","164","0","2"

Ridiculus amounts of content and depth for a "simple" tower defense game. I have absolutely nothing but warm recommendations for this game. But, in the interest of diversity, I will mention a fair few flaws or gripes.\n\nThe game runs on Flash via Air. This means there's no hope of running this natively on Linux as it stands. It also means it will lag like crazy when you get to wizard levels 1000 and above and you really start to abuse the enrage mechanic and get thousands of monsters on screen at once. For simple story mode or casual play, you'll never notice. But if you're hardcore, lag will become a factor eventually.\n\nIt also means that the entire client will bog down and not respond to inputs as the game lags, this can make controlling the game hard when there's a bajillion things going on at once. Remember to pause your game before issuing commands if you are going into those deep-enrage endurance games.\n\nOtherwise I have nothing but positives for the game. I freaking HATE the tower defense genre. Nothing but uncreative, pretty cow-clicky games with zero depth and no strategy EVERYWHERE. Gemcraft though? Totally breaks the mold and makes even a hater love it. That's the warmest recommendations I can ever give a game.","July 10, 2015","true","193.0"," 133 of 138 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","133","138","8","0"

And best of all, tons of achievments that actually give you in-game bonus points to use in upgrading your skills.  Finally, we achievment hunters can have a legitimate reason for getting achievements!\n\nNow I must warn you that I have not completed the game yet.  But 20 hours in and I haven't seen anything to change my mind that this game is highly reccommended.\n\nOk, so this is tower defense.  You build towers (traps, too!) and hope that they kill off the incoming line of enemies.  Only in this game the towers are powered by gems.  Each color does something different.  The green poison gem is my current favorite.  The red chain hit one is good too.  There's gems that steal mana from the enemy, deplete enemy armor, prevent enemies from regenerating their health, and more.\n\nGems are created with mana.  You start with some mana but also gain mana slowly and by killing enemies.  Use the mana to create more gems or upgrade your existing gems to higher levels.  You can have gems from levels 1-12, but so far I have only been able to afford up to level 8.  Each level costs more than the previous level to create a gem.  You can also move gems around, but there is a short wait time for the gem to socket before it can start attacking.   Gems can also be used to bomb enemies with wasp stings, but I haven't found that very effective.\n\nEach time  you complete a level it unlocks one or more new levels.  Map sections are hexogonal and eventually it opens up two pathway options.  So the game is not completely linear, which I love.  You gain experience and also get shadow cores to use to upgrade your abilities.\n\nThere is so much customization in this game, so you can play it in your own style.  You can redistribute your ability points any time you want, so you're not stuck with your upgrades.  Or you can spend the shadow cores to increase your chance of getting better loot and rare items.  The maps have quite a variety of pathways.   And you can build little walls to make a maze to slow the monsters down.\n\nGraphics are seen from a top down angle, and the most realistic looking graphics that I've seen in a tower defense game, though I haven't seen them all.  Most of the games in this genre seem to be cartoon-like, but this game has lush forests, stone pathways, and dark insect-looking monsters!\n\nMusic is more of a kind of ethereal chorus or extended chords.  Not a tune.  But it's perfect for this game.  It really adds to the monstrous ambiance.\n\nReplay value is huge.  As far as I know you can replay levels as much as you want, to grind for experience and to get the hard achievements.    But like I said, I haven't finished it yet so I dont' know if there might be a reason not to take too much time.\n\nControls are done with the mouse and there are keyboard shortcuts.\n\nStory-wise, there are sometimes pages that tell the story but mostly it's just killing monsters.  Maybe there's more story later on, I dont' know.  This game won't appeal to someone who just wants to play once through a game.  It's for people who like to do the same thing over and over again.  I like to challenge myself to use the least amount of mana and still make it through the level, and stuff like that.  So, if that sounds like you, then buy this game without waiting!  It is well worth the price.  No need to wait for a sale.\n\nThe only bad thing is I'm neglecting my other games to play this one.  My poor backlog!\n\nUpdate:  I forgot to mention that there is blood but no gore.  And there's a setting where you can turn off the blood if you want.","December 15, 2015","true","199.6"," 117 of 121 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","117","121","6","13"

In comparation with the web free version, you'll get more content on the Steam version. Since the very first GemCraft, I was amazed of how a tower defense game could be so wonderful. I've played a lot, then have focused on playing 'Chasing Shadows', which comes after 'Labyrinth'.\n\nFirst Sight (TL;DR)\nYou might think that it's some simple, boring, sketchy tower defense games like those on Armor Games, Kongregate and so forth. Not so! This is a tower defense game made properly, with love and basically revolutionizes the genre itself!\n\nGameplay\nYou're presented with a field composed out of roads which lead the monsters to your orb. What exactly is the orb? The orb is the point you have to defend from the monsters that swarm all over, that rush towards your orb to vanquish it. If a monster touches the orb, don't fret! Yet, if you let way too many monsters at it, it will get crippled. Once your mana pool is depleted and one last monster touches the orb, it's game over. The mana acts like a shield, protecting the orb from destruction. Dropping a gem bomb (Done by pressing B (default assigned key) and dragging a gem over a spot) on the orb will decrease the banishment cost and will furthermore decrease the damage received by the monsters.\nMana is your single resource in the whole game, used in conjuring gems, towers, traps, amplifiers, combining gems as well as in gem bombs. How is mana acquired? It is acquired by slaying monsters and mining from mana shards with a tower which has a gem equipped.\nDefense of the orb is done by creating gems of a respective trait (colour) and grade. The gems can be combined altogether, the traits being distributed by half if the gem has two traits (colours), you can figure the rest out. These gems can be socketed in towers traps and amplifiers or thrown as bombs. In most fields, you will encounter shrines which can be activated by dropping a gem on them. Depending on the grade of the gem dropped on it the damage will be increased, the shrine will inflict the properties on the monsters. Walls can be used to create new paths for the monsters to follow. Traps are built on the road to inflict damage especially on the swarmlings which are quite fast, while amplifiers are built next to towers to amplify damage and properties of the gem it is amplifying. The gems can also be assigned on what to target, a building or a monster. Slowly you'll gain three area-of-effect spells and three gem enchantments, with a specific cooldown. Throughout the game you'll get talisman fragments to randomly drop which you can socket into their respective slot in the panel displayed in the 'Talisman' tab.\nThe level of difficulty can be easily customized, by adding traits at the beginning of the level, dropping gems on the wave tablets to enrage the monsters which will yield more mana and you can also call waves in earlier which will give you mana as well.\nThis game also has an experience system which rewards the player with skill points at every level gained and also with every achievement, said skill points can be spent on wizard traits that enhance your playthrough. The skill points can be stashed for a starting mana pool bonus.\n\nGraphics\nNot much can be said about the graphics but that everything is detailed quite nicely, the effects being absolutely wonderful and the way the vivid colours combine when mixing a gem with another of a different colour is overly pleasing.\n\nOST & SFX\nThe soundtrack gives an eerie feeling when playing, driving you to think of how deeply horrifying the story is, fitting  exactly  to the theme.\n\nPros 'n' Cons\nPros\n\n+More than 150 fields to battle on\n+Eerie, atmospheric music\n+Variety of gems each with its own trait\n+Different modes to play\n+Personalization of the challenge\n+Rewarding XP system\n+Lots of achievements\n+Infinite replayability\n+Addicting\n\nCons\n\n-Might witness lag on certain occasions\n\nShould you buy it? Totally! Highly recommended!\n\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow  Lot's O Giveaway's  group curations  here!","January 5","true","18.2"," 93 of 99 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","93","99","4","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/296490/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nGemCraft is a series that has been around since 2008, but this is my first experience with it. The tower defence genre is possibly me favourite genre beside RPG, so I was excited to see that the series is classed as one of the best in the genre. It works exactly like any other tower defence, the enemies have a set path to follow and you build your defense around said path. What I found to be very interested with GemCraft is, that your resource supply that you use to build your defences, is also actually your health pool of the crystal you are defending. As you kill the enemies, you gain mana, and in turn this increases your crystal's health, I found that to be an excellent feature and one that I had not seen before.\n\nNo, the graphics aren't anything to rave about, but you don't need anything fancy for this type of game, all of the enemy sprites are nicely drawn as well as the environments you play in.  Each stage has a different path layout, along with different features on each map, such as gate locks, which have to be destroyed by your towers in so many turns before they automatically wipe your crystal out, this along with plenty other different scenarios (not all negative ones, some actually help you) make it that little bit more interesting to play.\n\nI found the difficulty/learning curve to be quite high here, the first two or three levels are really quite easy, but as soon as you start hitting level 4+, bearing in mind that there is 190 levels in this game, the difficulty really starts to pick up. I'm on about level 30 and each stage takes me a good four or five attempt before I manage to work out the best way to complete it.\n\nGiven the amount of levels, achievements and replayability in GemCraft, I can easily say that there is well over a hundred hours of content if you want to put the effort in. That is an amazing amount of gameplay for a game like this.\n\nTower defence lovers will almost certainly love GemCraft, and if this is a genre you always wanted to try, GemCraft is one of the classics that will keep you entertained for hours on end.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The RPG mechanics and lore give it life and purpose. Highly recommended.\n======================================\nPros:+ Graphics: I like the variety between bleak and vivid colors.\n+ Audio: Not amazing, but the hit & death sounds are quite satisfying.\n+ Concept: Gem-enhanced towers? Gem bombs? Gem traps? Gem amplifiers? Yes.\n+ Difficulty: Slightly easy after a spike. You can then increase the difficulty for more reward.\n+ Replayability: I enjoy replaying levels with extra challenge to see what I can pull off.\n+ RPG Mechanics: Unlockables, upgrades, levels, skills & spells, and story.\n+ Lore: Well written, simple, given in scraps, great for those that do or don't want it.\n+ UI: Simply put, the UI is extremely well done. Simple, appealing, aesthetically pleasing.\n+ Variety: There's a gem for every playstyle, and many levels offering various gems.\n\nCons:- Brevity: Eventually, going through all the basic levels to get to unlocks can get monotonous. I would prefer fewer levels, offering more tight design and unique challenges.\n- Rewards: I'm nitpicking here, but I dislike how getting really far in endurance offers much less experience than getting through the normal map on a higher difficulty or with trials on.\n\nNeutral:+/- Graphics and audio are well designed, but could be better looking/sounding.\n\n======================================\nIntroduction:Welcome to Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows, the tower defense game where you use various gems and combinations thereof to make your towers methodically destroy your opposition. Gemcraft brings so much to the table with its lore, mechanics, and fitting design aesthetics. There are many options to suit your playstyle, and a lovely coming together of genres to make your experience fresh and exciting. Let's take a deeper look:\n\nGameplay:You have 9 gems at your disposal: Red, yellow, orange, green, blue, cyan, purple, white, black; or chain hit, critical hit, mana leeching, poison, slowing, suppressing, armor tearing, poolbound, and bloodbound respectively. You are given select gems to beat every field with. You can use bombs, traps, towers, and amplifiers. A gem-enhanced entity that has a single or 'pure' gem will always be the strongest form of that gem. If you are to fuse gems, the individual components will be weaker, but the overall effect could be much stronger; an easy example of this would be combining almost any of them with the red gem, chain hit. I also should point out that you can fuse two pure gems of the same level to get them to the next level. (This works with hybrids, as well.) Some gems work better as traps than towers, green (or poison) being a good example of this, however, you are generally free to make things work however you wish, utilizing many or few of the tools at your disposal. On a final note on gems and their killing mechanics, I should mention that amplifiers don't seem to benefit from having their gems upgraded, they simply need any ol' gem present to provide a flat bonus.\n\nMoving away from gems, you have 25 skills that can be unlocked. Examples include cheaper construction, more effective gem bombs, and spell enhancement. Some of these are crucial, while others come down to preference. You can reset them at any time. You also have six spells. Examples are an AOE freeze and a special beam or barrage for your towers. There are two ways of unlocking skills and spells, tomes and wizard towers. Tomes require you to kill certain enemies such as 50 giants that have been frozen in their presence. Wizard towers require you to break locks, usually by hitting them directly in different ways. You recieve talismans from beating maps, rarity based on difficulty, which do things like increase damage or experience and make gems heavier. You have a limited amount of slots for talismans. You can upgrade talismans with shadow cores or scrap them to get more. Most shadow cores will come from killing spectres. Later on, you can spend shadow cores to increase the rarity of drops.\n\nInitially the game's difficulty will spike but once you get the mechanics down it becomes much easier. Then you have 9 trials and 3 difficulty modes to utilize. Trials are modifiers that impact the gameplay, but greatly boost your rewards. An early one adds waves and makes them arrive earlier. I recommend using this when you become familiar with a level so you can get a lot of experience. Be careful, however, because there is a mechanic where XP rewarded = current exp - previous highest exp.\n\nYou can use these mechanics to unlock field tokens, which add levels and hexes to the map. Clearing a level could unlock one or more field tokens, (and perhaps a scrap of lore) allowing you the option to prioritize certain paths through the game's fields which enables you to get to unlocks faster, or put off a tough stage. The flexibility and depth presented in Gemcraft makes for a very compelling experience not found even in most AAA TD games.\n\nGraphics:The graphics in Gemcraft are serviceable. They are great on some points, but mainly the UI. The UI has everything just the right size. It is thematic but not overly fancy or convoluted. Things are properly highlighted or out of the way. Some aspects may be large and visual as opposed to other aspects being smaller and text-based, tucked away for those that desire more information. Everything is very well laid out, easy to get to, and navigation is quick and simple. With the amount of options present, this is a great boon for Gemcraft. The map is quite beautiful, the field level icons and gem graphics are nice, and the enemies look alright. I wish the enemies had a bit more variety though, being mostly variations of bugs. The textures could also use improvement in resolution, and perhaps some in their design. Many of the stages end up looking bland because of said design flaws of the textures.\n\nAudio:The music is good, not too obtrusive. The hit and death sounds are satisfying. Everything that needs a sound, has one, and usually they are nice. Like the graphics, however, I can't help but feel like there is a certain level of polish missing, that slight flair that can take something from amateur to professional. Noting, however, that Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows is also a free browser based tower defense game, this is all actually quite impressive.\n\nConclusion:So, in conclusion, Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows is an excellent tower defense game with fun, depth, and style in spades. The concept is  beautiful. There are numerous options available, offering satisfying levels of control, and the excellent UI makes it exceptionally easy to play and navigate. The game can be as casual or hardcore as you'd like, and would be great for kids, adults, newbies and veterans alike. I recommend Gemcraft at full price. On sale is fine, too. On a deep sale, is also fine, however, you should definitely purchase this title, one way or the other. The dev deserves support, and the game is easily worth the money even at double the full price.\n\n======================================No drama, Just Reviews.\n\nIf you like my reviews, you can easily keep up with them here.\n======================================","January 21","true","24.9"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","36","38","2","3"

It has the most amazing well thought through concept. Same as others I have played the series for hundreds of hours and bought this game to support the developer. I also want to note I am satisfied with this version just as well altough there is one thing which bugs me a lot (see con). Technically, this game is for someone who loves Tower Defenses and especially different ways to solve them. Early on everything is super easy but in the very late you will have to rethink concepts, try different strategies, think how to counter difficult monsters and the more difficult it becomes the more you will have to watch for your timings. The game contains tons of achievements and levels which are really different to play.\n\nCON\nThe author did not bother to make this version an HD version so its the same old graphics - which are beautiful - BUT for low resolution. In 1920p this game simply looks horribly upscaled and I do recommend everyon to switch to window mode and play it there - no one was bothered by this when it was a browser game, so why now? Because now the game is 8.99€ and I really think, this should have been the one important thing for a steam release. The game was already amazing and I would have bought the old version here on steam as well, as long as they were fit to a modern screen.\n\nThe original resolution seems to be at least half the size of current screens.\n\nStill: If i play a tower defense for whatever reason, it is this series and no other. I grown up with the first tower defenses in starcraft and played them a lot through all of the blizz game titles and many of the popular flash games back then. I also tried some of the new mobile TDs but even if they look much more beautiful (new graphics vs old graphics upscaled) they all lack the creativity and possibilities of this one. This is simply the best!","May 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","37","41","0","0"

It's the most recent installment in a series of great games, and it's very well done, especially for having been created by a small studio like GiaB.\n\nThe scope of this game is massive; each of the 191 fields can take you anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours, depending on if you just want to get it over with, or farm the hell out of it for experience and achievements.\n\nThe combat system is the best feature of this game, making it what is, Gemcraft. The ability to combine gems in any manner you choose gives you an insane amount of possibilities for how to build your defences, as well as having traps, towers, and amplifiers to place those gems in.\n\nEvery field is a different challenge that requires different strategies to beat, and with 191 of them, that's a lot of strategies you can use. (Ok, really there's about a dozen different strategies, but you can implement them in a lot of different ways).\n\nThis is by far the best 2D tower defence game I have ever played (or seen, for that matter) and I would personally rank it in the top 3 of all TD games. I doubt anyone else would fail to list it in the top 5, depending on their personal preferences.","June 22, 2015","true","280.3"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","30","31","2","0"

Here goes:\n\nIf you haven't played the Armor Games version, then this is definitely worth getting here.  Especially with the early Special Promotion offer.  If you've got the AG version, then it's totally up to you, as to whether you want to support the developer or not.  Either way, it is guranteed to give anyone who likes Tower Defense games many, many hours of gameplay.  Each level alone can give you 2 or 3 hours or more in a single Endurance run, and there are over a hundred different levels, starting with the 'F' hex, where 'F1' has 3 waves of a few monsters each, and they go up in difficulty from there.\n\nSome changes I've noticed-- there is an extra save slot here on Steam.  Also, you don't start off with Orblets or with a Red gem.  It's odd playing the first few maps without 'battle traits,' but here you don't pick up your first one until F4.  Also, it's nice being able to play in full-screen mode.  And it's alway fun racking up Steam Achievements-- this game has 419 of them.  And in 'Chasing Shadows,' it's not pointless to rack up these achievements-- each one that you get gives you a free skill point to improve your abilities with.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, the way Gemcraft Labyrinth was, as Shrines aren't fun anymore: now they show up randomly, at random times and in random locations.  And I don't agree with the decision to tie the amount of times you anger a wave to the amount of beacons that appear-- in both cases I wish that I, the player, had more control over such decisions.  So some casual fans might find the game overly difficult at the start.\n\nBut for the fans, be it of Gemcraft or of Tower Defense games in general, these sort of decisions will only improve your gameplay as many of you now have a year of gameplay experience and already know when to use a white gem or when to use a black one, where to farm for mana and which maps are the best for early endurance runs.  I don't need to tell you guys anything as you already know and love the game.\n\nSo I'll add this one last point just for new players: don't be afraid to experiment.  There are plenty of guides out there if you get stuck, but sometimes it's fun to figure it out on your own.  Once you've played a few hours and want to optimize your gem ratios (and this can be as easy as deciding to make it out of two yellows, one red and one orange and four whites, or as hard as following the various high-level gem speccing guides which read like this: 2o+o+o+o+o+o+o+0(2o+b) + (2o+(o+r)+b+2b)+(2b+b+b+b+b+2b+(2o+b+2b) where r, b, and o stand for red,blue and orange gems. But you lose nothing by screwing around: even losing a level gives you shadow core, so if you want to try some prismatic gem to see what it does, go for it.  If you want to just keep playing F1 a dozen times before doing anything else, then do that.  It's your game, so have fun with it!","May 1, 2015","true","049.7"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","28","30","3","4"

Offers a lot of flexibility in how you want to tailor the challenge - make it easy as pie, or brutally difficult, with a set of unique constraints to pick and choose from (similar to Bastion's idols). And you have plenty of tools at your disposal - different types of spells, structures and skills so you can customize your defense to suit the situation best, as well as an upgrade system that rewards careful utilization. Later levels really make you think through your strategy and approach, and will punish careless players.\n\nI've played dozens of hours of GemCraft chapters One and Zero, and feel that Chasing Shadows is an improvement on both games, so if you enjoyed the older titles and were considering this one, go for it.\n\nSide note: I'm a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive addict, and this is one of the only games to tear me away from it.","May 24, 2015","true","200.7"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

(you also have floor traps but that is a bit later)\n\nInstead of having say the typical gatling gun, cannon, missle, etc you have one type of Tower, this tower just kind of shoots stuff within range. But the tower is actually useless until you put a gem within it! The gem you place within it then shoots and has special abilities.\n\nChain: can hit multiple enemies\n\nSlow\n\nPoison\n\ndrain mana (low damage but fills your mana some each time it attacks)\n\narmor destorying\n\nand two buff types\n\nblood (boosts off of its own attacking, after 30-50 etc it gets a bit stronger)\n\nMana: The mana gem is more so a booster gem, your mana works in a pretty cool way, you have mana limits, but when you reach the mana limit you upgrade your limit, the Mana Gem works off your ManaPool level, so the more mana you store the stronger they get! Upgrading your mana pool also offers passives like more EXP, faster auto mana regen and such!\n\nThe complexity of the game is not in making towers, instead it is all about crafting, with the 9 gem types you have you can upgrade and mingle their powers!\n\nGems can go through levels 1-12 FREAKING TWELVE levels! You can level gems up by comboing them\n1-1=2\n2-2=3 and so on! Or if you have enough mana you can just buy a Pure Gem of that type which is upgraded, but has only that type of gem in it.\n\nComboing gems is cheaper though, and if done right faster leveling up your gear!\n\nAlong side all the crafting you have other skills too!\n\nBomb, you don't need that gem? Too many baddies in an area? Make a gem and select Bomb and you can just drop that sucker right on all those jerks heads! Using a bomb also makes Mana Wasps which linger and cause a stunning affect!\n\nFloor traps. A gem type trap, mostly great for posion as far as I have played, but they are special since you can only play them on the monster path, but hey its more damage!\n\nSpells, eventually you get spells, allowing you to do things like freeze a group of enemies! Frozen enemies even EXLPODE on death dealing damage to more baddies!\n\nYou also get Binding powers, much like a spell, but they are passive buffs you can give your traps. Floor ones get it forever, towers get a nice big buff for a few shots.\n\nThis game is brilliant! There are even challenge missions where you have no passive skills and have to figure it out more puzzle style than most challenges.\n\nBest part of this game though for me? NO RATINGS! Always mad when you have to do the entire challenge again cause ONE guy got through some how? Don't care! All that sucker does is eat through a bit of your mana and you keep trucking!\n\nAnother great thing is Endless mode being there right from the start! When you complete a stage you can do Endless on it with all the gear you already laid out, and just test yourself against ever growing enemies! Mind you, in Endless you can not get anything aside from EXP and accessories! But you get everything from the challenge you already gained even if you go for the Endless mode, so try it and get extra EXP! :D","May 3, 2015","true","154.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","2"

It distinguishes itself from other games in that you don't really have different towers to build, but you can mix different types of gems together in order to build/customize exactly the gem you want.\n\nSome pro's:\n- Tons of content (lots of levels, multiple modes of play, multiple difficulties)\n- Tons of customization (skills, talismans, battle traits, difficulty, crafting your own gems)\n- Lots of depth, the game has many interesting mechanics, such as banishment, amplifiers, enraging.\n- Fairly good tutorial\n- Quite some secrets\n\nSo basically it has everything you could ever want from a tower defence game. Here's some cons:\n- The optimization is terrible. When you do endurance runs, be prepared for about 1fps. My computer was top of the crop about a year ago, and it dies playing this simple flash game.\n- It can be very grindy. This depends on what you do though. If your goal is to beat endurance run, be prepared for a very long grind.\n- Making the perfect gem combinations is extremely tedious and full of weird math. Some people like this, I personally don't. Tower defence should be about skill of placement etc., not about being able to combine 500 gems in exactly the right order.\n\nI think this game is really one of the better tower defence games around. Lot's of depth and replay value, what else could you want?

No matter who is playing, if he is doing the same things as you do, you both gonna end with the same results. And this the major flaw in the resent gemcraft games, they are more and more random, which mean you can play multiple times exactly the same way, sometimes you are going to win and sometimes you won't.\n\nFor example, sometimes a shadow apears and destroys your orb, does it mean that my plan was bad? NO! I just had a bad luck. So I try the same plan again and this time the shadow doesn't appear and I win. This is not how tower defense should behave.\n\nThe game now has an insane amount of boring grinding (talisman, and repeating old levels for more exp), I can't even say it's a tower defense anymore, it's an RPG. So if a level is too hard, instead of thinking why is your strategy bad, you just go grind the easy levels until you can brute force the hard ones.\n\nLuckly there are vision levels which are actually a tower defense levels, no exp grinding, no random events.\nThere is also an iron wizard mode, to which I got really excited at first, until I realized it's still has RPG elements, much less then the main game but still there is the option of completing more easy levels to have it easier at the hard ones.\n\n\nTL:DR\nIt's mostly a grinding RPG now, not a TD.\nIt's not bad but misleading if you are looking for the old gemcraft TD.","June 5, 2015","false","77.6"," 133 of 237 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","133","237","3","20"

They are all free to play on various sites (Kongregate/Armorgames).  While this game may seem like a rather normal tower defense game, it's much more complex than others.\n\nYou build a tower which has nothing in it.  For the tower to do anything, you must place gems.  These gems start off weak, but can be combined with other similar gems or different gems to create very complex gems with a ton of various stats.  There's no "build bomb tower" or "build barracks tower".  You instead have gems like "Slow the enemy by x" and "Chain in X range".  They start off weak, but get much stronger as you invest into them.  You have to figure out which gems and gem combinations work best.   You can also place your specialized gems in other towers by just swapping them around, as well as traps and support towers(gives buffs depending on gem).  The player even has the ability to create a gem and THROW it at the enemies, doing damage/effects equal to the gem you used.\n\nThere are over 190 levels and each level can be customized (as you unlock the features by playing) to increase the difficulty, the wave amount, the amount of monsters, etc.  Each level feels different from the last, and it doesn't seem to ever get tiresome.  The game offers over 400 achievements, which while may not appealing to some, gives you skill points to spend on the various skills.   The skillpoints can be allocated in 25 various skills, all being able to be reset and toyed with at any time.  There is also an interesting "talisman" system which allows you to boost various things, sort of like rarer skill points.\n\nWhy buy it on steam and not play it for free?\nThe steam version comes with new levels, better graphics, full screen, steam cloud, and achievements.  While not much of a reason to buy it to some people, the game is easily one of the best tower defense games  and I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of genre.","May 4, 2015","true","24.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Furthermore the enemy level and number is also adjustable, making the whole game suitable for any type of player, casual or hardcore.

You try to kill all of them before they reach your orb.\n\nAlong the way, you accrue experience points in order to gain skill points that make you more effective.  As you progress through the game, you come across "traits" that you can use to make a battle harder in exchange for more xp.\n\nPros:\n- Super addictive gameplay.\n- There are a lot (a /lot/) of maps to play and things to do.\n- Over four hundred achievements\n- User-defined difficulty.  I like this.  Overall, each battle is pretty easy, but you're given many, many tools to make them harder (in exchange for more xp)...but it's all at your own discretion.\n- The game progresses at a nice pace.  You can go back to a map that gave you trouble ten levels later and walk all over it, or try it again with more difficulty.\n\nCons:\n- Can feel very grindy.  As stated, there are /a lot/ of levels.\n- Enemy scaling (in terms of health or armor) isn't visually apparent -- if your towers are one-shotting monsters now, it is not apparent when that will stop until it happens.\n- Optimizing the angering of waves still involves annoying mathematical calculations\n\nShould you get this game?

While it might be a bit much for the casual gamer, especially the grind, Tower Defence enthusiasts should not miss this gem (ha!).\n\nSince Gemcraft originated as a Flashgame the resolution is not that high. The textures are beautiful, though, as are the animations. The eerie soundtrack is great and the sounds of your gems firing and monsters dying are top notch. The gameplay is intuitive and many hotkeys help keep your wrist intact.\n\nAs others have mentioned in their reviews, Armorgames (and soon-ish Kongregate, too) offer the option to try Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows out for free, albeit with a reduced amount of features.

Hailing from humble roots as a flash game, Gemcraft 2 is actually the 4th entry in the series, and every entry has been vastly better than the previous.\n\nGemcraft is a tower defense game. But it's not your average tower defense game. Sure, you build towers, but the towers themselves don't defend you. That's what the gems do, which you put in said towers. Unlike traditional towers, gems can be moved around, modified, and even thrown as bombs. It makes for a refreshing experience in an otherwise quite stagnant genre.\n\nOn top of that, Gemcraft is one of the only tower defense games I've seen with RPG elements, and this one has them in spades. From your humble beginnings as a level 1 wizard, you'll have trouble making gems that can deal more than 50 damage per hit. But, if you know what you're doing, you can easily reach 4-digit, and even 5-digit wizard levels, whereby you practically sneeze out million damage gems. It doesn't take too much effort -- if you know how -- to create gems that require scientific notation to express their damage. My current record -- which won't take long for me to beat -- is a gem which deals between 9.61e19 and 2.30e21 damage per hit, with an 80% chance to crit for x4.16e15 damage, and whose shot bounces around until it hits somewhere around a thousand enemies. Also, it can reach the entire map and fires 30 shots per second. Sound godly? It is, until roughly wave 500, where enemies start coming in with 1e40 HP, give or take.\n\nGemcraft does have one problem, however; framerate lag. Once you have several gems with incredible chain-hit elements, thousands of monsters on screen, and the works, the game will slow down to single-digit framerates. This will happen regardless of your graphics settings, and even regardless of your computer. My computer is a beast that can run pretty much any modern game at max settings at 60 FPS, so it's definitely not just me. If you plan on doing insane endurance runs, be prepared for the slowdown.","July 5, 2015","true","512.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

While a classic tower defense game requires you to build and upgrade static towers, in Gemcraft the only static part you will place, are sockets for gems (two entirely different socket types are available). And costs for sockets will become neglectable in the later game. The gem placed in a socket again does all the shooting and killing monsters. This gives the incredible advantage to combine and relocate shooting power at will.\n\nGemcraft - Chasing Shadows is part of the Gemcraft series, which can be found on Armor Games. I spent nights over nights and countless hours playing Gemcraft Labyrinth. I also dislike in-game purchases, so the Steam release, which delivers the full game (and more) for a one time purchase, is really awesome.\n\nOne interesting thing about Gemcraft is, that everything works exponentially. If you have a thing for numbers, you'll probably love this. For example a grade 2 gem features roughly twice the power of a grade 1 gem and a grade 3 gem twice the power of a grade 2 gem and so on. Costs also increase at the same rate and enemy strength does as well. So in lategame you will find yourself surrounded by very interesting looking numbers. :)\n\nBesides the main tower defense action, Gemcraft features a variety to improve yourself like skill points, which will provide most advantage when precisely balanced between skills and unspent points, or talisman fragments, which feature a random loot and enhancing system. It's also possible to make the game harder. Alot harder. Just add your favourite battle traits to the battle.\n\nFurther than that there are also countless other features, like gem bombing, dwellings, monster nests, mana pool management, shrines, apparations, and more.\n\nAll together there is little I can not recommend in this game.\nGo, play this game now, it's awesome!","May 6, 2015","true","118.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There are 9 types of gem in total: Mana Leech, Critical Hit, Chain Hit, Armor Tearing, Supressing, Poison, Slow, Poolbound and Bloodbound, each plays a different role in the defence. Combine gems with different components to have more than one special power, . Place your gems in a tower or a trap which defends in different ways, or might as well place them in a amplifier to strengthen other gems; they can also be used as bombs to kill monsters, enrage waves, heat a spark or strengthen your orb.\n\nRPG mechanics\nReveal an epic story as you process. Unlock skills by opening tome chambers, unlock battle traits by unlocking wizard towers and gain talisman fragments to permanantly improve your play. Beat a level to gain XP, level up and spend skill points deliberately (although can be reset for free) Boost your gems using enhancement spells ---- Bolt, Beam and Barrage; weaken monsters by strike spells ---- Freeze, Curse and Wake of Eternity.\n\nDifficulty scales variously\nThere are 3 difficulties and 9 battle traits. One can easily beat the game on lowest difficulty with no battle traits. However, with "Hatred" trait set to level 10, monsters have +1,000,000% more hit points and +7% wave hit point increment, it can be quite challanging. You can also enrage to have more and stronger monsters, in result more mana and XP. Frankly, it's a "choose your own difficulty" tower defence -- great for both casual and hardcore players.\n\nHuge replay value\nReplay previous levels on higher difficulty with some battle traits for more XP. Move on to endurance and see how far you can go. You can even finish endurance with flawless skilz and patience, but it's far from easy ---- 999 waves and hit points grow exponentially (as far as I know, there's no one who can beat a Haunting Hatred 10 endurance :P) When you become skillful and confident, there's Iron Wizard mode waiting for you ---- No XP or level, finishing a field grants you 5 skill points. A pure skill test without grinding, which I found really challenging and time consuming.\n\nEpic story\nThere are 4 games in Gemcraft series ---- "Chapter 1: The Forgotten", "Chapter 0: Gem of Eternity", "Labyrinth" and "Chapter 2: Chasing Shadows". Chapter 1 focuses on a young wizard sent to fight an evil wizard in the East, at the end he was astonished that the evil wizard was possessed by a creature known as "The Forgotten". Chapter 0 is a prequel about the release of The Forgotten by the evil wizard. Labyrinth tells a story about a gembearer crafting "Gem of Eternity", elaborating the only way to fight The Forgotten ---- "We fight her desperately to no end... We do not know any way to kill her, only seal her away temporarily with the Gem of Eternity. But she always gets free after a few decades... After being forgotten..." And in Chapter 2, we follow the young wizard racing to the Spiritforge to seal The Forgotten, but ends in a very dramatical way. We encountered a shadow in the Labyrinth as a boss, but soon figured out there are lots of them wandering outside, killing them directly weakens The Forgotten ---- and this is why it's called "Chasing Shadows".\n\nAchievements\n419 achievements in total and finishing them actually gives you skill points in the game\nLast but not least, it's faily cheap even not on a sale\nBuy and you won't regret it","April 8","true","87.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

No, this game is quite on the contrary. The gameplay mechanics offer sheer endless possibilites.\n\nThere are 9 distinct gems, each one having a different special. These gems can be put in towers (mostly damage), traps (mostly special effect), and amplifiers (buff adjacent towers or traps). You can also combine gems of different types and upgrade them. Instead of placing gems in towers or traps you can also throw them directly on the monsters for massive damage or buff the next minion, receiving even more mana and experience when killing them. You can call waves early, decide to save your mana for some seconds to gain increased mana regeneration, build walls to control the movement path of the monsters. There are different spells to cast and objects on the map to interact with.\n\nAm I done yet? No, I've hardly listed half of the gameplay elements. The rest is for you to discover in the game!\n\nPro:\n- Gameplay mechanics\n- Replayability\n- Different play styles and tactics for levels\n- Customize the level difficulty in different ways\n- Hours and hours of fun (there is no real ending in this game, you can always level and improve some more)\n- Dark, moody atmosphere and story.

There are a lot of options to improve performance in the menu though, including a setting to automatically reduce graphic settings temporarily when the framerate drops.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is a must-buy for all tower defense fans, and even if you're new to the genre or don't like it in general, you should give it a try.

Nothing special here. :D\n\nIt is maybe comparable in quality with Kingdom Rush, but (much) more complex, and way darker in style. I know no other relevant tower defense game to compare with.\n\nYou defend yourself on many stages (levels, maps) against waves of bug-like monsters coming through predefined (but not limited) path to your wizard core. Your defense consist of firing towers along the path you can equip with different types of gems. These gems define what kind of attack shot will tower use (for example slowing, poison, chain, mana steal), and gem types can be combined together. You buy towers and gems for mana that is slowly replenishing by itself, but mostly you gain it from killing monsters. Funny twist is that your wizard core can "banish" monsters reaching it in exchange for some of your mana burning up, if you have enough of it (and there are ways to decrease banishment cost). You usually lose a stage when your core is reached by a monster and you have no mana left for banishment at the same time. And this is just core mechanics.\nBut did you know, that on stages you can also: use gems as one shot bombs alone or to activate powerful shrines, build power amplifiers for gem towers, use several special skills and spells to curse monsters or enhance gem tower damage, collect special rewards from destructible buildings, boost your mana pool from harvesting mana shards, kill mysterious apparitions for more rewards?\nAnd if it is not too much for you yet, there is campaign map, where you progress through stages and explore new areas, there are exp and levels that contribute to your skill points, and there are talismans you can equip for various bonuses ingame.\nAnd surprisingly it is not complicated game to play. If you wish to play brutally simply you can. And if you feel like you are up for challenge, you can try to use all of your options at the same time.\n\nTo sum it up:\n+ Solid but original and complex tower defense\n+ Control over many aspects of game difficulty, before starting and during battle, so you can push your limits\n+ Nine gem types to combine, several meaningful skills and spells, talisman system bonuses, over 400 achievements\n+ Background storyline about wizards, forgotten evil and lost rituals\n+ "Dark-themed" visual style and storyline are nice contrast to some "lightly" taken TD games\n+- There are many, many stages to beat\n+- You can reach ridiculous wizard levels if you are dedicated enough\n- Lets face it, it gets repetitive after some time\n- No gamma correction means less visible details, unless you brighten your display settings\n- There are some disbalancing, yet not game breaking mechanics, especially on higher levels\n\nFinal conclusion:\nStrongly recommend this game!","May 6, 2015","true","154.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gems can have their power increased from leveling them, and gems of different types can be mixed together (if they are the same level it will increase the level as well). The main difference I noticed about this game is that you can use the gems you craft to "enrage" upcoming waves to increase the number of enemies that come in it and increase the toughness of each unit in the wave. For the higher difficulties you need to balance the amount of gems you enrage upcoming waves with, and the amount of mana you spent to upgrade the gems to help kill the incoming enemies. The game allows you even more customization by giving you skill points that can be used to provide a global buff to your gems, or otherwise help you to defend yourself.

Sure, some of its graphics aren't HD and look a little bit shoddy, but I don't mind at all as the actual mechanics are excellent. The use of traps, various spells, gem bombs, gem specialization and the different ways you can approach a certain map/level (e.g. by the use of traits) make the game so much more than just regular ol' Tower Defense where you build a maze for monsters to walk through and occasionally cast a fireball or something.\n\nWhile you are expected to replay maps in order to level up, I don't feel like it's too "grindy" because different difficulty levels and traits keep each map playthrough interesting and fresh.\n\nMy minor annoyances with the game are interface/accessibility based (i.e. no ability to rebind hotkeys).\n\nI'm almost at 40 hours and I don't even think I'm half-way through the game yet. I can't stress enough how cost-efficient Gemcraft is for $10. Overall, I'm just super happy with my purchase. I would recommend Gemcraft to any Strategy fan who doesn't mind pixelated graphics, even if they're new to Tower Defense games. Although the game is complex, I don't believe that it's too complex for those new to Tower Defense (the tutorial book inside the game is excellent).\n\nThere's a free web-based version of Gemcraft also available on http://www.armorgames.com. To view the differences between the Steam version and the free web-based version, read this: http://steamcommunity.com/games/296490/announcements/detail/218766097301703024\n\nOn a final note, you might have heard of Kingdom Rush and/or Plants Vs. Zombies, two other popular tower defense games also on Steam. Both games are high-quality and extremely polished in the sound and audio department, but I personally think Gemcraft's actual gameplay is far more robust, challenging, and engaging.","June 12, 2015","true","53.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Well, then you are at the right spot! GemCraft - Chasing Shadows is one of the most brilliant TDG!\nThe story never fails to amaze me even though i have already played it as browser version.\nI am still frightened when the shadows shoo over the map whispering creepy noises. And yes you will get startled at some point.\nThe storyline is narrated by book pages you find on your adventure telling you what is happening. Also an overview about the former series of Gemcraft is given by summing the whole plot up.\nAs a beginner one gets used to the mechanics really fast. During the first levels many hints are given bit by bit so you dont get overwhelmed by the information. Anyway the lategame is still challenging due to the "Endurance Mode" which causes monster to spawn endlessly giving you a hard time but also lots of XP!\nEach wizard level grants several skill points which can be distributed into many different skills improving for example your  gem damage or reducing the charge time of your spells.\nMoreover during the stages talisman fragments are dropped which award even more bonus stats!\nGemcraft has a distinctive achievment system with up to 419 achievments! They can also grant up to 3skill points giving you another goal to achieve!\nThe stages are beautiful and challenging designed. On every map you have to think of a strategy before starting the first wave. Will you use traps or towers? Maybe both? Is there a way to stretch the monsters way by building mazes? Which one the 9 different gems will you use?\nIf you get stuck just replay some stages at higher difficulty to get even bettter rewards!\nOverall i highly recommend GemCraft - Chasing Shadows! It sums up an amazing story, difficult stages and awesome mechanics!\nGreetings, Tevias","April 30, 2015","true","57.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

If you "kind of" like tower defense, you should probably just play the flash version, and you'll get bored before you hit the point where you would need to pay. If the prospect of >100 slightly varying tower defense maps appeals to you, and more so when I tell you you can go past 100 waves of monsters on each, and then more when I tell you about all the difficulty dials you can fine tune, then this is a good tower defense game to spend 100+ hours on.\n\nI particularly recommend GemCraft for the highly customizable difficulty. Over the course of the game, you unlock nine different difficulty dials, like "more and stronger giants" or "send mana every minute instead of as I accummulate it", and three difficulty settings; plus you can increase the difficulty of a wave by calling it sooner or "enraging" it by dropping gems on it, spending your mana to make the waves tougher and increasing the number of monsters; plus achievements for level-specific handicaps like "only use slowing gems"; plus an "Iron Wizard" mode that takes away your ability to out-level the difficulty curve. Just beating the levels is not all that difficult, apart from scattered puzzle levels. GemCraft excels in letting you make the game as hard as you want it to be, and it rewards you for pushing yourself to the bleeding edge of how difficult you can make it. And with those rewards, you can play the level again, with difficulty turned up just a little higher...

I have spent a lot of hours on it on armorgames.com (in case you were wondering: dude, already a review with barely any hours on it?), and I'm absolutely sold. What makes it so special compared with the enormous amount of other games available in the genre? Here are some key words (tl;dr: read only key words):\n\n1.) Experimentation:\nMost TD games are quite simple: you have a limited amount of towers types that can be upgraded, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Strategy is mainly finding the right combos and placement.\nIn gemcraft however, you build up defenses by forging gems and building defensive buildings separately, to then combine them. With 9 different gem types (all with their own colour) that have each a specific power and 3 different tower designs, you have a lot of freedom when creating your defenses against the demon hordes. Gems of different colours can be fused together to form powerfull combogems and can even be converted to gem bombs to rain death and destruction from above on a specific target.\n\n2.) Create your own dungeon:\nIn most TD games you have 2 areas: the path that enemies follow to reach your base, and areas suitable to build your defenses. Sometimes it's a grid area that makes you puzzle for ideal placement, sometimes it is restricted to a few spots limiting the amount of towers you can build. Gemcraft has only one rule: There must be at least one route that enemies can follow to reach your base. As long as there is a path of one square wide with horizontal or vertical connections, you can build your towers on any surface that allows building. Aside from your towers, you also have the ability to build walls. Wide path? Make it narrow and windy by adding a lot of walls forcing enemies to follow a zigzag pattern! Multiple routes to your base? Block them untill there is one left! Create choke points with deadly traps waiting to turn unaware enemies into dust! Be carefull though, buildings and gems are build from the same recource pool (mana), so you are forced to be efficient.\n\n3. From sandbox to nightmare with one click\nEver had that feeling during a mission when you were like: man, my defense is impenetrable, this is no longer a challenge, this is boring. Gemcraft allows you to suddenly turn the mission from an evil minion's deathwall to a tense fight for your live.  You can make the mission harder in various ways. First, like a lot of TD games, you have the option to early call waves. Only now you can decide to early call multiple waves at a time (if you are brave enough). All waves are displayed as 'wave stones' on the left of your screen, and they are all visible from the beginning. If you really want it, you can scroll down to the bottom, click the final round stone, and watch the fireworks (or your ultimate doom).Early calling a wave gives bonus mana and xp, so it's not just for fun. Another way is using gems. As I said earlier, gems can be turned into gem bombs to lay waste on the battlefield. However, when used on a wave stone, the targeted wave will be enraged: enemies become stronger, faster, more resistant, and more numerous. The stronger the gem bomb or the more gem bombs dropped, the stronger the wave becomes, and the higher the exp reward. Last but not least, you have the option to activate mission handicaps before starting the mission, such as less time between different waves, monsters receiving damage resistance on a direct hit, and much more. This can be very helpfull when you want to replay lower levels to rise enough in level to beat the harder fields.\n\nMy verdict: Gemcraft is a landmark in the TD genre: it is challenging, tactical, allows a lot of experimentation, and is not short at all (you WILL require a lot of hours of gameplay to even reach the hardest fields).","May 1, 2015","true","58.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

(which i highly reccomend you play the game to learn about, im spoiling this for myself unfortunately because im a gametheory gamefreak like matpat I MUST KNOW EVERYTHING)\n\ngemcraft chapter 2 (game 4) follows the first wizard you played in the first game (meaning the 2nd and 3rd games were really just exposition at this point).\n\non your way to the spirit forge, as previously mentioned at the end of chapter 1, however on your way you pass through an old trap "the sycthe gate" which separates you from the forgotten. after regaining conciousness you find yourself at your old wizard tower where you build a new trap to attempt to seal the forgotten before she reaches the spiritforge.\n\nalong the way you find new structures and enemies which i believe were not in the previous games. as you continue twards the spiritforge, your character does the unthinkable in the games, actually thinks about the games own plot. who is the forgotten (ponders the "summoning of") as well as if the summoning was "really an accident". you also ponder about what the forgotten is actually doing as well as why.\n\neventually you find the gembearer, the wizard from game 3 chapter 0 (boy this is confusing isent it?) dead, you also find the gem of eternity that he crafted next to him. you take the gem and decide to take it to the spirit forge for him while using its amazing powers to kill hordes of monsters attacking the spiritforge, which is when we finally get into some detailed information.\n\nthe gem of eternity, after absorbing the essence of the monsters, begins glowing with a blinding light. the gem replica (assuming the replica is the one made by the gembearer and the origional is still there) begins transferring its energy to the OG gem. it then fires a powerful burst of magic at the spiritforge shield, destroying it.\n\nit is then revealed that the gem replica you found next to the gembearer, was corrupted. in all the previous instances where the forgotten was sealed, she would slowly corrupt the gem, twisting its power to her own needs and binding all the fake gems to one another (apparently the OG gem at the spirit forge AND the one you are using are both corrupt replica's, read on young one). so when you used the fake you used the corrupt power of all the gems and destroyed the shield of the spirit forge. the forgotten even let the player live after their initial separation at the scythe gate for this purpose.\n\nin the end you were a pawn to the forgotten in order to break into the one place she could not enter nor corrupt. she probably never meant to let you live and the game alludes to a sequel in which you enter the spirit forge after finding the REAL real gem (apparently the OG gem at the entrance to the spirit forge was ALSO a replica/fake gem which is why it mentions that she binded all the fake gems to one another)\n\n\nvery clearly these games are extremely detailed for free flash games (even more so after becoming pay games) for those who were smart enough to not read the blotted out there is most likely another game coming in the series and i am now giddy with anticipation to find out what lies in store for it.","January 2","true","44.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And that is kinda the important part: Even though I highly consider myself a person that doesn't like change, I was familiarizing really quick with the new elements and wouldn't want to go back. The new additions make the game more customizable as ever before, so you can play your own style of game and still succeed more than likely.\n\nI already put above 30 hours into the game and it still doesn't look like I have come close anywhere near the end. Up until the point where I am, maps also don't seem repetitive to me and coming back for them, when you acquired new gear or skills can make them feel totally different again.\n\nMy only con to the game is the performance which sometimes (even on waves around 100) can go down, especially after casting certain spells. I feel like it's a limitation of the engine they used, I don't think it's my system :]\n\nIn conclusion: If you like crafty games, where you can choose your own methods and if you enjoyed any of the predecessors or similiar games from the tower/lane defense genres (like "Orcs Must Die!" or "Plants vs. Zombies"), then do yourself a favor and pick this gem up.","December 7, 2015","true","351.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A few others let you build your Towers almost anywhere, allowing you to Maze your enemies, but are still limited by the types of Towers you can build.\n\nGemcraft is different.  Towers are generic.  There are only two types of Tower in Gemcraft : basic Towers, and Amplifiers.  Its how they're used that is absolutely brilliant, and different from every other TD game I've ever heard of.\n\nYou see, a Tower does noting in this game, on its own.  Its not until you put a Gem into that Tower that you have something capable of defeating the creeps.  And not only are there various gem types (orange gems leech mana, yellow gems can crit, and so on) but the gems have their own levels, as well.  A Grade 2 orange gem is more powerful than a Grade 1 orange gem.  Leveling the gems up is as simple as combining two of them.  If their levels are the same, the resulting gem is one level (or Grade) higher.  If their levels were not the same, then the higher level one gains a little of the lower level one's powers, without an increase in level.\n\nThis means that you can make for some really interesting Towers.  A Tower that has a gem combining Chain Hit and Critical can be capable of putting out an incredible amount of damage, with less regard for the number of creeps approaching.  A Tower that combines Slow and Mana Leech not only reduces the speed of the creeps it hits, but gets mana for you to use in doing other things.\n\nAmplifiers do what you would expect, they amplify damage, range, shot speed, and most of the special effects of gems.  However, their exact effects are based upon the gems inserted into them.  An amplifier that has a Red gem in it won't be boosting the Poison effect of the gem in the Tower next to it.\n\nNow, all of this flexibility is awesome.  That, however, brings me to the one BIG glaring drawback to the system : it is unbalanced.  There is really only four general types of gems that you will be using once you get far enough into the game and have done your homework.  Basically, once you are powerful enough, the only optimal means of playing a stage is through what is called a Manafarm.  That means you will need 4 gem types : a killing gem made of yellow, red, and black gems, pure yellow amplifier gems for that killing gem, a managem made of orange, red, and black gems, and pure orange amplifier gems for the managem.  The managem gets you additional mana to improve your gems, the killing gem kills the creeps that pass over it in its trap.  Continue to bomb the wavestones so that you get the most creeps, that won't be killed by your managem but will be killed by the killgem, and continue to upgrade everything with all the mana you get from the farm.\n\nPrior to reaching that point, the game is incredibly fun.  I've spent I don't know how many hours playing the game on armorgames.com.  The only reason I stopped playing the game there was I got bored with the manafarming after reaching a Wizard Level of 5611 and helping with the Gemcraft CS Extreme end game guide found on armorgames.com and ported here.","May 3, 2015","true","953.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Played the original and the prequel extensively as well.\n\nIf you love tower defense games, this one is a no-brainer.  It's one of the most, if not THE most expansive TD game I've ever played.  It also features tons of options.  You can skip several stages, pushing for the end.  You can do them all repetitively, always trying to squeeze a bit more XP out.  You can use that XP to buff your abilities, or leave it be in order to buff your starting resources.\n\nUse random drops to once again buff your abilities,  Farm for better drops, or ignore that entirely and push on.  Use your XP to create custom builds that suit your play style.  Like traps?  Invest in trap buffs.  Towers?  Get tower buffs.  Like the effects of a specific gem?  Spend XP on that gem type, and it is now available in every map.\n\nLike a challenge?  Unlockable modes allow you to buff enemies or handicap yourself.  Finishing stages with these conditions can significantly boost your XP gain.  But, as said before, you can completely ignore those modifiers and simply play the stages.\n\nCasual to hardcore, Gemcraft has broad appeal.  You can burn through most stages in a few minutes, or aim for endurance mode and spend an hour or more trying to amass a ridiculous XP score.  Once again, if you like tower defense games at all, give this one a look.","May 3, 2015","true","48.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Tower-Defense genre is very well defined, it's been fleshed out too many times to count. Yet this game, and the series as a whole, GemCraft, has innovated it beyond what I think anybody would believe possible. The game is challenging, it takes a lot of actual tactics and thought. It's fun, a seemingly endless amount of content in-game for you to play through and the replayability is high with the difficulty modifiers. The skills in game really make a difference during play-time, and the overall length of the game is stunning for a tower defense game. Not to mention, it actually has a storyline to go with it.\n\nAnd to think, it was a flash game for the longest time.\n\nI've been waiting forever for it to come out of Steam Greenlight, and now that it has, I'd recommend it to anybody looking for something new and fun to pass time with.","May 4, 2015","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are plenty of stages you can go, every stage has its traits which are modifier to strenght of your enemies or simply difficulty of that stage. You get XP from battles to lvl up your skills. You can (and you will have to) try different strategies with 9 different gems (not mentioning traps, amplifiers, skills and talismans which you will get through the game).

And that is kinda the important part: Even though I highly consider myself a person that doesn't like change, I was familiarizing really quick with the new elements and wouldn't want to go back. The new additions make the game more customizable as ever before, so you can play your own style of game and still succeed more than likely.\n\nI already put above 30 hours into the game and it still doesn't look like I have come close anywhere near the end. Up until the point where I am, maps also don't seem repetitive to me and coming back for them, when you acquired new gear or skills can make them feel totally different again.\n\nMy only con to the game is the performance which sometimes (even on waves around 100) can go down, especially after casting certain spells. I feel like it's a limitation of the engine they used, I don't think it's my system :]\n\nIn conclusion: If you like crafty games, where you can choose your own methods and if you enjoyed any of the predecessors or similiar games from the tower/lane defense genres (like "Orcs Must Die!" or "Plants vs. Zombies"), then do yourself a favor and pick this gem up.","December 7, 2015","true","351.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(which i highly reccomend you play the game to learn about, im spoiling this for myself unfortunately because im a gametheory gamefreak like matpat I MUST KNOW EVERYTHING)\n\ngemcraft chapter 2 (game 4) follows the first wizard you played in the first game (meaning the 2nd and 3rd games were really just exposition at this point).\n\non your way to the spirit forge, as previously mentioned at the end of chapter 1, however on your way you pass through an old trap "the sycthe gate" which separates you from the forgotten. after regaining conciousness you find yourself at your old wizard tower where you build a new trap to attempt to seal the forgotten before she reaches the spiritforge.\n\nalong the way you find new structures and enemies which i believe were not in the previous games. as you continue twards the spiritforge, your character does the unthinkable in the games, actually thinks about the games own plot. who is the forgotten (ponders the "summoning of") as well as if the summoning was "really an accident". you also ponder about what the forgotten is actually doing as well as why.\n\neventually you find the gembearer, the wizard from game 3 chapter 0 (boy this is confusing isent it?) dead, you also find the gem of eternity that he crafted next to him. you take the gem and decide to take it to the spirit forge for him while using its amazing powers to kill hordes of monsters attacking the spiritforge, which is when we finally get into some detailed information.\n\nthe gem of eternity, after absorbing the essence of the monsters, begins glowing with a blinding light. the gem replica (assuming the replica is the one made by the gembearer and the origional is still there) begins transferring its energy to the OG gem. it then fires a powerful burst of magic at the spiritforge shield, destroying it.\n\nit is then revealed that the gem replica you found next to the gembearer, was corrupted. in all the previous instances where the forgotten was sealed, she would slowly corrupt the gem, twisting its power to her own needs and binding all the fake gems to one another (apparently the OG gem at the spirit forge AND the one you are using are both corrupt replica's, read on young one). so when you used the fake you used the corrupt power of all the gems and destroyed the shield of the spirit forge. the forgotten even let the player live after their initial separation at the scythe gate for this purpose.\n\nin the end you were a pawn to the forgotten in order to break into the one place she could not enter nor corrupt. she probably never meant to let you live and the game alludes to a sequel in which you enter the spirit forge after finding the REAL real gem (apparently the OG gem at the entrance to the spirit forge was ALSO a replica/fake gem which is why it mentions that she binded all the fake gems to one another)\n\n\nvery clearly these games are extremely detailed for free flash games (even more so after becoming pay games) for those who were smart enough to not read the blotted out there is most likely another game coming in the series and i am now giddy with anticipation to find out what lies in store for it.","January 2","true","44.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like solving tasks and shooting evil monsters for kicks. This game is great fun to play and I really enjoy playing through the levels at will and while the levels are quite easy at first. This is deliberate, so that you are settled into the game before moving onto the much more tougher levels.\n\nThe Objectives:\nThis can vary from level to level. But in order to successfully pass the level. It is imperitive that you keep your orb intact and to protect from banishment from the monsters because if the mana pool reaches zero or a lower number than the banishment cost from the monster and the monster touches the orb in this state. Its Game Over and you would need to start the level again. While this is not going to be an issue in the early levels as these levels have a lower waves of monsters, you will find this more challenging in the later levels that have tougher enemies and more waves of monsters that you must defeat in order to complete the level. Its doesn't stop there however because some levels have tome chambers that will have to opened by meeting certain criterias to unlock vital skills and also you will still need to survive all enemy waves to complete the level AND to gain the skill from the tome chamber.\n\nMana:\nThe Mana bar is your lifeline as it used to buy gems, build buildings and traps as well as to sustain banishment charges from those monsters that are successful in banishing your orb. Careful planning and conservative use of the mana in levels will gain you extra mana to use at the start of other levels. So its wise to conserve as much mana as you can muster in early levels. This is a method that I learned the hard way when I was playing the light version of this game online.\n\nMy thoughts:\nIf you are into tactical games like I am and want to challenge yourself. Give this game a try as you will need to use your tactical skills to conquer the more harder levels and you may need to replay some levels to give you more mana for the later levels so that you can buy more powerful gems at the start. Even things like the placement of a tower on the level to the strength of a gem can mean the difference of success or failure.\n\nVerdict:\nThe key thing to have with this tactical game is PATIENCE and planning. If you rush through the early levels without giving much thought to points that I have mentioned. Then the later levels could be frustrating to some players if they do not plan their motives carefully. Patience and tactics are the road to completion of this game.\n\nOverall Rating: 10/10.","September 14, 2015","true","66.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(which i highly reccomend you play the game to learn about, im spoiling this for myself unfortunately because im a gametheory gamefreak like matpat I MUST KNOW EVERYTHING)\n\ngemcraft chapter 2 (game 4) follows the first wizard you played in the first game (meaning the 2nd and 3rd games were really just exposition at this point).\n\non your way to the spirit forge, as previously mentioned at the end of chapter 1, however on your way you pass through an old trap "the sycthe gate" which separates you from the forgotten. after regaining conciousness you find yourself at your old wizard tower where you build a new trap to attempt to seal the forgotten before she reaches the spiritforge.\n\nalong the way you find new structures and enemies which i believe were not in the previous games. as you continue twards the spiritforge, your character does the unthinkable in the games, actually thinks about the games own plot. who is the forgotten (ponders the "summoning of") as well as if the summoning was "really an accident". you also ponder about what the forgotten is actually doing as well as why.\n\neventually you find the gembearer, the wizard from game 3 chapter 0 (boy this is confusing isent it?) dead, you also find the gem of eternity that he crafted next to him. you take the gem and decide to take it to the spirit forge for him while using its amazing powers to kill hordes of monsters attacking the spiritforge, which is when we finally get into some detailed information.\n\nthe gem of eternity, after absorbing the essence of the monsters, begins glowing with a blinding light. the gem replica (assuming the replica is the one made by the gembearer and the origional is still there) begins transferring its energy to the OG gem. it then fires a powerful burst of magic at the spiritforge shield, destroying it.\n\nit is then revealed that the gem replica you found next to the gembearer, was corrupted. in all the previous instances where the forgotten was sealed, she would slowly corrupt the gem, twisting its power to her own needs and binding all the fake gems to one another (apparently the OG gem at the spirit forge AND the one you are using are both corrupt replica's, read on young one). so when you used the fake you used the corrupt power of all the gems and destroyed the shield of the spirit forge. the forgotten even let the player live after their initial separation at the scythe gate for this purpose.\n\nin the end you were a pawn to the forgotten in order to break into the one place she could not enter nor corrupt. she probably never meant to let you live and the game alludes to a sequel in which you enter the spirit forge after finding the REAL real gem (apparently the OG gem at the entrance to the spirit forge was ALSO a replica/fake gem which is why it mentions that she binded all the fake gems to one another)\n\n\nvery clearly these games are extremely detailed for free flash games (even more so after becoming pay games) for those who were smart enough to not read the blotted out there is most likely another game coming in the series and i am now giddy with anticipation to find out what lies in store for it.","January 2","true","44.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like solving tasks and shooting evil monsters for kicks. This game is great fun to play and I really enjoy playing through the levels at will and while the levels are quite easy at first. This is deliberate, so that you are settled into the game before moving onto the much more tougher levels.\n\nThe Objectives:\nThis can vary from level to level. But in order to successfully pass the level. It is imperitive that you keep your orb intact and to protect from banishment from the monsters because if the mana pool reaches zero or a lower number than the banishment cost from the monster and the monster touches the orb in this state. Its Game Over and you would need to start the level again. While this is not going to be an issue in the early levels as these levels have a lower waves of monsters, you will find this more challenging in the later levels that have tougher enemies and more waves of monsters that you must defeat in order to complete the level. Its doesn't stop there however because some levels have tome chambers that will have to opened by meeting certain criterias to unlock vital skills and also you will still need to survive all enemy waves to complete the level AND to gain the skill from the tome chamber.\n\nMana:\nThe Mana bar is your lifeline as it used to buy gems, build buildings and traps as well as to sustain banishment charges from those monsters that are successful in banishing your orb. Careful planning and conservative use of the mana in levels will gain you extra mana to use at the start of other levels. So its wise to conserve as much mana as you can muster in early levels. This is a method that I learned the hard way when I was playing the light version of this game online.\n\nMy thoughts:\nIf you are into tactical games like I am and want to challenge yourself. Give this game a try as you will need to use your tactical skills to conquer the more harder levels and you may need to replay some levels to give you more mana for the later levels so that you can buy more powerful gems at the start. Even things like the placement of a tower on the level to the strength of a gem can mean the difference of success or failure.\n\nVerdict:\nThe key thing to have with this tactical game is PATIENCE and planning. If you rush through the early levels without giving much thought to points that I have mentioned. Then the later levels could be frustrating to some players if they do not plan their motives carefully. Patience and tactics are the road to completion of this game.\n\nOverall Rating: 10/10.","September 14, 2015","true","66.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While this is a tower defense game, there are some RPG alements mixed in, and as you clear fields you gain levels and skill points, which form a satisfying progression that can be felt heavily in the game. Playing the game itself is also a breeze, thatnks to the fact that practically everything is keybound and you can pause the game to take action.\n\nThird, the difficulty. The difficulty in this game is heavily scalable. In addition to the 3 difficulty modes, you can set battle traits to increase things like enemy health and get more xp out of it. It's a high-risk, high-reward system that works very well.\n\nAlso, the game has a nice story, even if you haven't played the previous games on the series.","October 27, 2015","true","73.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

One reviewer says they purchsaed the game for $2.50 during one of the big sales, this absolutely blows my mind. If the graphics and UI were less 'Flash-gamey' this could easily be a $60 tower defence game. With the graphics it has now, I'd say its a $55 tower defence game ;)\n\n[EDIT]\nI almost forgot that people might actually be interested in what make sthis game so good aside from some weird price speculation haha.\n\nYou can control the range of a tower by hovering over it and using the mouse wheel.\n\nAs far as I can tell there are 9 gems that do different types of damage/have different modifiers.\n\nYou can buff the level itself makingit more difficult and granting you more xp when you defeat it.\n\nAfter beating each level, you can choose to continue it on "Endurance Mode".\n\nYou have a talisman that you can put fragments in that give you bonuses against certain monster types. Fragments are randomly found when killing monsters.\n\nThere is a skill window where you can put skill points into various skills. (Note that the more unspent skill points you have, the more starting mana you begin each level with!)\n\nLook, just buy this game. If you've actually read this far, you are either bored you will like this game. Either way, you should get it :)","March 18","true","46.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It nearly went to my top 1 of TD games, but now sits on a very close 2nd place, with a huuuge buffer until the 3rd. So what does make this game so amazing?\n\nWell, i´m always glad to see when a developer knows what he´s doing. And that is most defenitly the case with this game: The mechanics work great, there is a decent monster/tower variety and the levels are very well balanced.\nIt´s not that expensive, and what you get are serious hours of playtime and content. The most upvoted reviews for this game have a playtime of 150+ hours for a reason.\nTake all the above and throw in some decent RPG mechanics and you have a game that deserves your attention.\n\nAll that with the sheer variety of levels makes it one of the best TDs there are and easily recommendable...","May 12","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Seriously\n+ Replayability value over the roof.\n+ Lots of performance and eyecandy option (as the original flash game)\n+ Resizable window !\n+ Satisfying "pop" "pop" sounds when you kill creeps\n+ Toggle Option to pause if clicked offgame.\n+ "compass maps" are now marked in the minimap! (this is quite a nice touch for the late late game!)\n\n\n= I guess it includes all the "premium" content you need to pay for in the flash version ( gem, some exclusive maps). For people who don't know, there were some small little bits (a gem and some maps) in the armorgames dot com version you needed to pay some € to unlock (i recall 3 or 5 euros).\nConsidering the game was free, and that this guy made 4 of these games i bought it, no regrets.\nThis game is 10~ euros, and includes that. There's no IAPS in sight :)\n\n= Assets look pixelated at full screen at 1080p. Still an improvement over the small original flash game size.\n= Found no way to transfer savegames from ArmorGame or such into this.  You can breeze through the levels if you are familiarized with it :)\n\n- same soundtrack as the usual game.\n\nThe Gemcraft saga is a tower defense series with a twist : You craft gems (duh, the name!) and socket them into towers or traps. The plot revolves around the mysterious figure of the "queen" or the "shadow", which the gemcrafting mages accidentally summoned long time ago (or so tells the legend) . Soon after that they tried to seal again and again, even with the power of the ultimate gem ... but she broke free.\n\nThis game (the 4th one) picks up after the events of a previous one, where a young mage (you) tried to stop her from reaching the world's most powerful place ...\n\nIf you want to check the gameplay first (or even read the story as it unfolds) I strongly recoment going to Armorgames and play them.\n\nBeware, this game is addictive. It has huge replayability value, and the gameplay is solid.\n\n","May 1, 2015","true","47.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Russian review: http://igrotop.com/games/gemcraft_chapter_2_chasing_shadows/posts/obzor_gemcraft_2_chasing_shadows\n\n'King's Bounty' series is the best tower defense game for pc in my oppinion, yet Gemcraft Chapter 2 is right next to it and will definetly take much more time from me. This is well polished and super content-wide game. The problem with most tower defense games is their short campaign, but here we have a hundreds of levels X 3 difficulties, so its always enaught things to do. The amulet is really good idea for a game, which makes it feel more like RPG (Diablo-style). Not that many games feature such a nice randomisation of monsters and items (talisman fragments).\n\nThe other good side is very wide options, so every player can work around visuals a lot. Resolution looks good on my 1920x1080 and FPS is high at max settings with quite an old PC. Also its rare to find a good atmosphere for towers-game — thanks to those graphics, visuals and weather it feels deep and satisfying. But the most significant is the traits system, which makes this game super unique even among RPG-s and H&S genres.\n\nThe only problem is: to play it at full power, i will have to find and deliver a whole day just for Gemcraft 2. And thats good, since Terraria and Titan Quest was the only games being able to cause such interest for me. And this game is pretty much cheap for its wide content.\n\n-----\n\nAnd a negatice article... I really dont like an idea of getting 2-7 or even more wizard levels at once after beating a single map at the early-game. The leveling system would feel much better if you could gain those levels slowly. Also for me its pretty hard to figure out which map was first beaten and which was the second and so on. After you upgrade and gain more strenght you are coming to replay old levels, but, unfortunatly, there is no good guide or assistence on understanding which map you should re-clear right now to get benefits. That causing a confusion, since i am forsed to note every single level after beating it. Moreover, its hard to find levels placements, since they all look the same from World Map view and there is no even explanation which letter is first / second / etc. But hey, thats just my own problems with game, it dosnt mean everyone will suffer from similar feelings.","May 6, 2015","true","45.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can still play it there for free with a majority of the content there. I am not exactly sure what exactly is missing because I purchased this oon steam as soon as I saw it but if it is anything like the other games in the series you can get agreat taste for the game for free. I played the other gemcraft games for hundreds of hours before I donated to the developer. I just hope that the older games will get moved to steam as well, I would love to play them through again just for the story.\n\nFor some cons, at the end of the day its still a flash tower defense game, if $10 feels like it is a bit steep for something you can play online for free then thats perfectly ok. I purchased it because I love this dev and want to see more. After a while it can feel repetative, but I feel that that only happens to me when I don't bother to increase the difficulty of the levels and in this version it gives you even more options to do so. But if you don't want to have to manage your own difficulty level to suit your needs then maybe look elsewhere. The game is long and if you play each level on the easiest difficulty then you probably will get bored eventually. If this is your first foray into the series you will be lost in the story. It picks up where the last gemcraft ended and provides you with some backstory but not nearly as much as I would have liked. However, the other games are all free so there is no reason not to go back and play them if you want. The graphics are not spectacular, but they have their unique style and it helps when you have something like 400 units coming on the screen at one time and being attacked by 20 different towers.\n\nOverall this is a great game in a great series and I cant wait to see more from this dev. There is no reason to not at least go to armorgames and give it a try and see if its your thing or not. Just make sure you throw the dev some thanks if you enjoy it.","June 15, 2015","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Gameplay: 7/10\n\nYou get "tower base" which can be built on the allowed terrain; including the path of the monsters, but mostly the path is too narrow to build without blocking their path. You can then craft gems, combine gems, upgrade gems and socket them into these tower base.\n\nCompleting levels give you exp. You can make the levels/waves tougher and add exp modifiers. This exp is used to level up your character. Each level gives you 7 skill points, which can be spent on unlocked skills. Skills are unlocked by completing objectives in certain levels.\n\n2. Level Design: 5/10\n\nThe levels are rather quite restrictive. Most of the times it's quite obvious as to where to build the towers. There are very few levels which encourage heavy mazing.\n\nIn the 8 hours I played this game, I found the gameplay to be rather repititive, specially because of the level design.\n\n3. Soundtrack: 2/10\n4. Story: Irrelevant/can be ignored.\n5. Aesthetics: 4/10\n6. 1080p, fullscreen/borderless window: YES.\n\n7.

Mana = money, with it you craft gem types to place in towers for different effects (chain damage, slowing, armor break, and a lot of effects not normally seen in tower defense actually). You can also make 'gem bombs' any time for aoe damage or to destroy one of your own structures (the base structures cannot be sold). I like the sort of old-school feel of the maps, and minor path-building is available, except on the few maps I've tried the paths are too thin to lengthen much yet.\n\nTons of skill points to spend (unspent goes to initial money/mana, I think that's a cool mechanic), talismans, and other goodies. Hundreds of achievements. Lots of menu options too, all with mouseover explanations.\n\nOther notes:\nThey seem to still be releasing updates like bug fixes and such\nHas 2 window size modes, full screen and drag to any size. I love drag to resize, but for some reason this disables Steam overlay/ screenshots for this particular game.\nIt has some story too, which I never care about, but the good thing is they dont bother you with it. It's just there in notes if you want to read them. Nicely done!\n\n\nOverall:\nThis game won't put you in awe, but it seems to be a very good quality game; it feels solid.  Definitely worth a few bucks on sale (66% or better) for TD fans, otherwise, I probably wouldn't go for full price. But any quality game can be worth full price, and this so far looks really good.","June 18, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well, not that much. I mean, it's not a TD game for everyone, that I will admit. With 190 levels, a gazillion ways to tweak skills and difficulty settings, and the way to combine gems to create just what you want, it does have a higher treshold of entry than most such games. But if it does get its hooks in you, then wave goodbye to the next 100+ hours or so of your gaming schedule. And so this review should pretty much end.\n\nHowever, I'd like to also respond to some of the negative criticisms in the game, which is going to take up a lot more space:\n\n"It's too random, what with the specters and shadows."\nWhile it's technically true that these add an element of uncertainty, it's not that random (for one thing, you get warnings beforehand that it's about to happen), and it's therefore most certainly possible to plan for it. In fact, once you know how to deal with those things, then even if a shadow show up on wave 5, they'll never be a problem. And personally, the levels I've felt where randomness was more of an issue are the special Vision levels, because they're meant to be tight fights at all times. Sometimes they're so tight, that if your gems in the first wave tends to end up doing minimum damage shots, you've already lost. Then the next time you try said gems shoot maximum damage, and you survive and move on to clear the whole damn level.\n\nAside from that, I've hardly ever played any TD game that is -less- random than this game (maybe the previous games in the series, but they too had it, if in different forms)! For one thing, like I said, the difficulty setting is completely and utterly under your control, and never feels arbitrary. Take Kingdom Rush in comparison; the game's later mission levels on that game requires a lot of planning -and- early wave luck (i.e. good damage on the first few hits)... And that was on casual difficulty. Normal and Difficult requires nothing less than utter perfection in every single detail there. And Cursed Treasure 2 has levels entirely depending on early mana flask drops if you want three stars. This game, mana flow is forever something you can do something about, and you have a lot more freedom in placing your towers. There's nothing happening in this game that you cannot react to (except the aforementioned low-damage early shots in the vision fields).\n\nOh, and it seems like the amount of Shadows appearing has been severely downgraded compared to earlier versions of the game. I'm currently\n\n"It is too grindy, especially if you want a complete game."\nWell... Yes. It's true. I mean, if you know what you're doing, you can sweep through the main levels doing them all only one time each, and the Vision levels are completely set in terms of what gems and spells you have, so obviously any amount of grinding won't help you beat them. But if you want a complete game, you'll have to replay levels, yes. And yes, the levels are pretty long too, because this game is about making a set-up.\n\n...Which is something you do in every TD game that's worth a damn anyway. And at least if you want to grind here, you have to be clever about it, since it will always only be the highest score you get in any given level that counts. Also, don't forget Gemcraft Chapter 0. If you wanted a complete game there (i.e. each level completely shining), you had to replay every level 8 times. 8. Frickin'. Times. Here, you can get away with twice each (once on Looming and once on Haunting difficulty, ignoring Glaring), and if you unlock Haunting early, a fair few can be beaten with only one attempt.\n\n"There's barely any mazing."\nAgain, pretty much true. You don't spend that much time setting up walls to lead the monsters exactly where you want... And that is a bloody good thing too, because every TD I've played that's required excessive mazing on every level are immensely boring; with the fields usually being mainly empty except for a few ocstables that prevents you from optimal mazing every time. Who needs that crap? I sure don't.\n\n"Once you find the optimal strategy, it's nothing else to do."\nAgain true (I sense a pattern here)... And I'm not going to defend this per se, except saying that in the Gemcraft series as a whole, much of the point is about figuring out how to exploit everything. And I personally -like- games that gives you the option of doing that, provided they make sure that (barring going online and looking up other people's work) it's a challenge to find out how to exploit it. And this game's got that challenge. Way back when I first played this on AG, I thought I had a pretty good deal going on with the things I'd made up... and then I read about how other people had found stuff that put my strategies to utter shame (though they had the Magician's Pouch; I hadn't. I still wouldn't have figured out that other stuff in a million years, though).\n\nStill, my non-Magician Pouch based strategy was good enough for me to then beat field O6 at Wizard Level 56. Others had problems with that field 30 or more wizard levels above mine, so that was nice. :D\n\nAnyway, as you can see, I'm not always disagreeing with these criticisms, and you as a buyer should take them into consideration, as that this is a very, very specialised Tower Defense game. But I certainly like it, and since it is available to try out for free on several flash game websites, you'll have the opportunity to try it out for yourself. And I think you should. ;)","September 11, 2015","true","206.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Masses and masses of content and well thought out mechanics in an ever escalating cascade of insanity. It is NOT an easy game by any means, but it all feels quite well-balanced, and rewards you for challenging yourself. My only real gripe is that the primary way the game handles escalating difficulty is by throwing monsters with higher and higher health and armor values at you; which seems like a natural progression, but the armor values quickly escalate to the point where any defenses that aren't absolutely top-level for the part of the stage that you're at, won't even put a scratch on the enemies. This means that the optimal strategy for almost any stage is to have one, maybe two towers that you pump all your upgrades into (along with a few traps and amplifiers), because if you spread out your resources you'll be utterly ♥♥♥♥ed when the armored giants roll in. It's still tense as hell and requires constant management, but it seems like it could be more of a spectacle with encouragement to install a bigger spread of towers.\n\nThat being said, it is addictive as hell, well worth the asking price, and easily one of the most impressive TD games ever made.","May 6, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I miss the xp/scoring system of Gemcraft Labyrinth... I know it wasn't perfect and ended up being boxes to tick but it did structure each level around earning those mulltipliers and put a nice limit on xp earned. It was also nice to know which levels you had a low score on by mousing over that orb (and to need to go back to those levels because the difficulty was higher).\n\nOther than that, a great game by a singular talent.

You've likely logged dozens/hundreds of hours on its flash-based counterparts. You've likely done so on company time. You're a monster.\n\nThe Good:\nTried-and-tested Tower Defense Formula. One of the better/more creative systems out there.\nGood difficulty scalars (once you unlock them) for extra challenge.\nAs usual, a campaign mode that's ridiculously long. You'll definitely get value for money here.\nThe Bad:\nThere's really not a whole lot new here, as compared with the Flash counterparts.\nFor experienced players, the starting difficulty is far, far too easy. It can be a tedious grind to unlock additional challenge scalars/levels to bring the game up to your level.\nThe story tie-in is a bit boring, in my opinion. But again, storytelling has never been a very strong point for TD's.\nThe Ugly:\nGraphically, there's no notable upgrade from GemCraft's Flash days. It's looking pretty dated - nice sprite art as usual, but texture quality is far too low for this day and age.\nThe Verdict: GemCraft still remains one of the most fun TD titles across any platform. Allows for a passive play-style, but offers reward for players who take a more active interest in game sessions. Its old age lends to some cobwebs around the edges; but with such a unique/trademarked gameplay style, it's difficult to fault GemCraft for not further expanding on its elements.\n\nDefinitely worth the asking price - just don't go in expecting a total rebirth of the genre.","May 2, 2015","true","31.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I played this, only to realise why I had stopped playing the previous games in the series. It gets repetitive. Sure, there's some strategy with combining gems together to create more powerful, customised gems, to shoot down those enemies, but that's all you'll be doing. For 100+ levels. All the different monster types, level layouts, talisman fragments, wizard skills, aim to provide some variety, but their effects are fairly subtle, most of the time you will be waiting for your gems to shoot down the enemies.\n\nIf I were to continue playing this, I would be doing it in short bursts, I probably wouldn't be able to sit down and play this for hours like other strategy games I like to play. I'd only recommend it if you love Tower Defense games, or are a fan of the GemCraft series.","January 11","false","3.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","2"

But there's a point in the game where you go from having nothing to having everything (and beyond) and the challenge fades away.\n\nOnce you "get" how to really play this game, it becomes very repetitive and unchallenging. Certain gem combinations mean easy access to literally billions of EXP. I played this game from level 1 to 130 without using these especially deadly/plentiful gem combos, but as soon as I found them, I went from level 130 to 2200 in a matter of days playing pretty casually (I left the game open, so my hours plays doesn't really mean anything).\n\nAlso, because this game is built on Flash, it runs very poorly on even the best of setups – the problem being thousands and thousands of monsters on-screen at the same time. When every wave has 999 monsters coming and you're sending them in advance at the highest of speeds (which you'll have to do, since you'll be pretty bored watching everything die), the frames hover around 10 fps for me. It doesn't matter that much because I'm not doing anything besides upgrading gems (to 45+) and enraging waves (which includes repeatedly clicking everything... also boring).\n\nIt's almost as if people figured out how to exploit this game and then the developers sort of went along with it. If this is actually what happened, good for them for adapting how their players "game" the game, but in reality, it just doesn't work that well.","February 2","false","163.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

At first it seemed like a fun game with lots of mechanics. Past 30 hours and a few unlocks it reveals itself as a really poorly made TD game...\n-So it's all about gems - there are 9 types of gems, 6 of them are barely have any use, other 4 are a must have if you want to beat a difficult map (and unless you unlock them you're limited to what developers give you on that map)\n-Gems have different effects on monsters but every tower is the same single target cannon (exception is a chain gem with which your shots deal damage to several monsters in a chain)\n-What seemed to be a lot of mechanics is actually a pretty shallow set of similar things, half of which arent even viable like combination of more than 4 types of gems, cause you will LOSE a lot of damage because of a skill that buffs only up to 4 gem combination... or traps... traps are essentially useless cause they can't get even close to what a buffed tower will do... or gem bombing which is only "useful" to make waves stronger to get more exp/mana... or barrage spell which travel so slowly it lands when tower shots already killed everything and if your barage is actually killing something then you probably buffed waves too hard and might just die anyway\n-WAY too many waves... WAY. 1 map can take an hour to beat on high difficulty and you use lots of traits and also enraging waves...\n-It lags like any other game won't ever lag, cause to match your power you need to buff waves more and more resulting in thousands of monsters on the map\n-It's insanely unforgiving... you can sit for an hour on a map with like 150-200 waves, enraging them, then you accidentally (cause of lags or losing patience) enrage them for a bit more than you can actually hanlde and there it is - youre ♥♥♥♥ed, start the map over again\n-Limited demolitions... WHY THE ♥♥♥♥? You are carefully building a labyrinth and bam you placed something wrong a couple of times, well you better be precise next time cause you can't remove it anymore...\n-Annoying ♥♥♥♥ coming out of nowhere without any warning ranging from a harmless ghost flying by to a huge fat ♥♥♥♥ness requiring lots of dps or it will oneshot you or how about losing control for 20 seconds? Sounds fun right?\n\nIf it was developers first project then these flaws might be actually somewhat forgivable (is it even a word?), but looks like it's already a game series (it might be just an updated version, i'm not sure).\nWhat i liked is the style and maybe some challenges. I wish developers use their acquired experience and improve the game or make their next project better.","January 23","false","92.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

You build a couple (1-3) towers, upgrade it and, nothing else. The rest of the game is spreadsheet work. Tower types are boring - tower types only differ in how they do damage. There's barely any mazing (you have to build walls, like, 2-3 of them every few maps, but that's it) because most paths are still narrow. There's barely any need to think about coverage/good positioning, because as mentioned earlier you build only a few of them (sometimes even 1) and towers shoot so fast you don't need to think about mobs of weak enemies vs single strong enemy.\n\nThe main depth of the game is in the numerical works, if you're into it. There are only 3 different type of mobs - small medium and large. They differ in armor, regen, may be some extra wacky special but can be summarized as "tanky stats". Your tower is pretty much the same, hit armor, hit regen, crit, etc just different way to deal damage. Then there are talismans, which are small bonuses to your damage, mana etc and skills, which allow you to build tower cheapers, deal more damage etc So basically A LOT of numbers and your goal is to balance them until you win.\n\nSo I suppose it's probably fun for people who enjoy a lot of spreadsheet works. But it's not tower defense.","July 11, 2015","false","8.8"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","0"

Many reviewers call this their favourite TD game.\n\nI wish I felt the same way, but this game doesn't work for me. After playing it for about three hours, I can tell this game isn't for me. Problems I have with the game include:\n\n- I played about 15 levels, none had an interesting level design, they all seemed very "samey". On a good TD game, I can remember the details of a level long after I finished it.\n\n- I only encountered two different monster types. I know there are more, but two types after 15 levels? Look at the gameplay video, almost all the levels shown in the video have the same few monster types.\n\n- You end up setting the difficulty of each level yourself. I don't mean that you chose, for example, normal or hard difficulty. There are no difficulty levels like that, at least not for quite a while. By default, the early levels are trivial to finish. You are suppose to hit waves of monsters with gem bombs before they launch to increase the difficulty. I expect the designer to adjust the difficulty levels during testing, I don't expect to do this myself.","March 9","false","2.8"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

Weapon strikes and dying enemies have forgettable animations.  There is very little strategy and gem type availability seems to be random for each level. I quickly became bored of the gameplay.\n\nThe gem-crafting aspects seem tedious and overly complicated.  The best evidence of this comes from the wordy tips.  These may be helpful but the design is dated.  Unless you come back to the game a few times in the one day it is easy to forget the details.\n\nThe various aspects of the game don't seem to mesh at all.

Yes, this game has more features, but really the gameplay is very similar between every game in this series. They don't really introduce anything that reinvents Gemcraft.\n\nHowever, with that said, the thumbs up or down isn't helpful with this one, because if you like Gemcraft (or you end up liking the earlier games) you should go ahead and buy this game. While the story is, well, it isn't awe inspiring, it is fairly good for a Tower Defense game. Additionally, for those who love tower defense, this series has pushed the envelope in a scene where the envelope just sort of sits there, in the corner . . . Twiddling its thumbs. So, in essence, if you like the Gemcraft series you should support the developers and this is a way to do it (and it is the only reason I bought the game). Hopefully the next game in the series will not only  push the tower defense envelope but the Gemcraft one as well.","May 7, 2015","false","38.1"," 27 of 78 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","27","78","0","0"

There are tons of ways to customize the level and difficulty, both before and during the level. It's kind of like an old arcade game, where you're trying to reach the high score and there is no defined ending.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does suffer a bit because of it. There's never a need to stop and reconsider your strategy, you can always just go around grinding for exp until you can brute force through the game. The monsters are just walking numbers with hardly any relevant features. The bosses are nice, but you usually don't need any special strategies to beat them, just keep shooting with your strongest gem. The gem types aren't well balanced at all, you always need to go for highest damage output and ignore utility because monsters will get exponentially more healthy as the time goes, but they will not get significantly faster or regen more health or anything that would make you want to use utility gems.\n\nThis is very unlike games like Kingdom Rush where you have only 4 tower types (can be upgraded into some specialist towers later), huge variety of opponents and only few places to place your towers. In that game, you need build specific things to counter specific enemies. In Gemcraft? Nope, just combine yellow with red and upgrade whenever you can.\n\nThere are probably some techniques needed to beat endurance (1337 waves I think) or get grade 100 gems, but even then it's mostly about grinding enough experience to be able to do it.\n\nThe strong point of Gemcraft is all the customization. There's really a ton of ways you can play. But why would you? If you go too far with the difficulty buffs, you're not gonna beat it no matter what. If you go too low, you'll be bored to death. It's hard to find the sweet spot. It never feels like there's a challenge that needs strategy and wit because you can beat everything if you grind for more experience.\n\nIt's a good time waster when you're tired and just want to get instant gratification by doing nothing. But 10 bucks... Nah.  Don't. There are more entertaining games you can buy for that price.","May 7, 2015","false","64.8"," 14 of 58 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","14","58","0","3"

The mechanics that use them aren't vital, nor do they really subtract from the game, but it's a minor background frustration for me.\n\nFor the record, my 'time played' stat on Steam in incredibly misleading, because I bought a copy of this game on Armor Games when it was released purely on the strength of a prequel game (which I'd also purchased) and between the two I've easily played 600 hours, probably more.\n\n8/10 overall, 10/10 for value in the hours of entertainment vs. dollars spent sense.","May 8, 2015","true","126.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Been addicted to the series for a while and Steam selling it is pretty awesome.\n\nOne complaint:\nI max out the trait to add 7 shadows to each map. 100+ waves. So...why in the hell do I consistently get 2-3 shadows within the first 2-6 waves? Honestly, that's ludicrous. It's like an RNG for an instant lose. (Cue the "Lrn 2 Play" people) It should be random, and not structured, because that's part of the challenge. But there really should be some sort of control. Minimum wave before the first shadow, or minimum wave between shadows, or maximum number of shadows per number of waves. Something to make 107/7 not equal 3 more often than not.\n\nThis is a pretty minor complaint in the grand scheme of things though. You are not obligated to activate that trait. But it's still something that irks me. Definitely not a dealbreaker though. If you like TDs, this game is solid.","May 9, 2015","true","367.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Credit the highly episodic structure of the game.  Each of the many dozens of levels feels fast paced, and many can be completed in half an hour or so.\n\nI have currently finished fewer than a third of the levels, have discovered fewer than a third of the Skill enhancements, and have acquired only 2 of 6 Spell enhancements.  Yet I feel a sense of accomplishment already, thanks to the amount of variation in the maps (levels) provided, the progressive difficulty of the challenges presented (which the developer has superbly balanced with progressive player ability enhancements), and the rich use that the game makes of Achievements.   Some of the levels are straightforward, while many are tricky and call for some lateral thinking to solve.  Occasionally a return visit after additional Spells or Skills have been collected is required.\n\nDeveloper Game in a Bottle deserves a fistful of high level gems and a gold plated Giant monster for a job very well done.","May 15, 2015","true","150.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gemcraft Labyrinth was perhaps equal to this one. I played the limited free flash versions. So I picked this up on a bargain and played with access to all the elements of the game, and it is nearly poorer than the limited version. And I am sad to give it a negative review. For these reasons:\nIt's strong suit is that you can scale the difficulty quite well by cranking up the challenge. However if you get good at it you end up with getting to big of a reward for this and with the added bonus you get from things the pay version it soon becomes to easy. You advance way too fast and nothing becomes more of a challenge than you make it and even that becomes hard after a while. By playing skilled through maybe a third of the stages you can easily just click "send all" on the rest of them and finish them in seconds, if you like.\nThe above would be fine if you could actually scale the challenge up, but can't because it lags really bad after a certain point. My rig isn't the best of rigs, but it plays worse than the web browser flash version. So at some point you start not play the best you can, but rather at how you can avoid lag. Which only works so far before that also more or less breaks down because even that becomes easy.\nThen it is the graphics itself, I kind of expected this to be scaleable so that it would render to any screen resolution. It doesn't, so if you go full screen (which increase lags) it is gets grainy and blurred.\n\nIf you have never played it and it is a bargain I can recommend it for the time you spend to learn it, which is enjoyable and less laggy. Also if you have played previous free versions and wanna throw Game in a Bottle a few coins. And maybe the iron wizard mode is enjoyable which cranks up the challenge by removing some of the things that made the series great.","March 14","false","136.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are TONS of achievements, which can be off-putting for completionists, but achievements are handed out fairly regularly so it always feels like you're progressing. The gem combination system also means that regardless of your defense style there's a way to play to your strengths.

The game combines almost every core feature a TD game should have, but rarely does one single game offer that many.\nThe amount of mazing to do is excellent and not too excessive, ingame options to speed up are super helpfull and make the game more challenging.

It is the most extensive and in depth Tower Defense game.\n\nIt is at the same size as the 3rd part GC:Labyrinth or maybe even a bit larger, hard to say. It is mostly about the endgame and the path you take to it. While in GCL you were 95% of the endgame afk and waited for the remaining ~1100 waves (of 1337) to destroy, in GCCS you have to stay vigilant till the last of the 999 waves. Even with a good Wizard Level you will have a hard time destroying the last 10 waves on harder dificulty. This is because the HP and armor isn't capped compared to GCL. At some point of the game you have all data presented you in exponential style.\nSome here say that you need to grind older levels to progress, that is definitly not true. In my current game I've redone only about 10 lvls so far. To get more exp out the levels I cramp up the difficulty for new levels too, that way I don't need to redo them over and over again to get to the end.\n\nThe gem crafting is more indepth as it looks on the first glance. When you reach a certain point in the game, gems combined in a special way are stronger than just normal 'u'pped gems. There are several guides and even a gem combining tool to help out with the crafting.\n\nWhile there is a free version in the Internet, it is limited in some aspects (less skills, no endless mode, etc). The Steam version is fully unlocked, has higher resoultion textures, a few additional levels and it doesn't need the Flashplayer to work.\n\nother features:\n* Story\n* Skills and upgrades for skills\n* Talisman (like upgrades for armor and weapons in RPG)\n* countless maps to beat\n* 3 difficulties that you can adjust in different ways to make it even harder and get more exp (adjustable per map) + Iron Wizard mode (like a NewGame+)","June 19, 2015","true","104.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basic idea is the same: there are paths that the monsters take to your orb and you have to build defenses to stop them. However, GemCraft has by far the most unique features of any TD game. Let's go through a few of them.\n\n-Rather than having a few types of towers with different abilities, you have one tower. Which, upon placing it, does nothing. You need to socket gems in it. There are 9 types of gems, each with their own effects. I hear you think, 'how is this different from 9 types of towers?'. The answer to that is that you can combine each of these gems with other types to your liking. For example, you could have a pure poison gem, that does a lot of poison damage, but mediocre attack damage. You could also make a dual slowing/armor shredding gem, which would both slow enemies and decrease their armor, although both effects will be weaker than if they were in an pure gem. However, the dual gems damage would be higher.\n\n-In addition to towers there are also traps, which will enhance a gems specials, but decrease its damage. The final building you can place are amplifiers, which will boost adjacent gems stats and (if the same type) specials.\n\n-Your currency, mana, is also your health. When a monster reaches your orb you automatically spend a small amount of mana to banish the monster so it reappears at the start of the path. This makes the player be more considerate about upgrading gems, since too little mana reserve means that a few monsters could destroy your orb.\n\n-The ability to anger waves. You can drop a gem bomb on a wavestone, using mana, which will make that wave have more and stronger monsters. However, they will also give more xp and mana! Try to see how much you can anger without getting overwhelmed.\n\n-Every one of the ~190 maps can be beaten on 3 difficulties, and with 9 battle traits to increase both the difficulty and xp gain. If certain new maps become too difficult, try going back and beating some older maps with more traits to gain more xp.\n\n-There are many ways to play. Grinding is never needed to beat the game, but if you want to grind, the option is there, although it would probably make the rest of the game more boring. Maybe you want to use a bunch of gems that are lower grades, or stick to a single gem that is more powerful You could just play through the story and be done with it, or you could push the game to its limits, seeing how far you can get on endurance.\n\n-There are 25 skills that can make you stronger. However, the cost increases with the level of your skills, and skill points also give you some more mana to start maps with, so it is wise not to spend them all.\n\nThe one and only complaint I have about this game is its horrible preformance. Since it runs on flash it will drop to 1 fps or even less when there are thousands upon thousands of enemies on the screen. However, these situations will only be encountered if you want to push the game's limits. If you are a casual player you will not have any problems with this.\n\nGemCraft is one of the best games I've ever played and I would definitely recommend it, especially for tower defense fans: prepare for a game that will change the way you view the tower defense genre! If you're still not convinced you can always try out the free version on ArmorGames, where also the previous 3 games in the series can be found. They're not needed for the story, and the gameplay is far inferior, but you might still want to try them out.","July 7, 2015","true","334.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am a big tower defense fan, but waited for a sale to buy this.  I love it!  Its a very classic style tower defense.  It doesn't include a FPS or other type of hybrid experiance other games offer.  Instead your busy managing buffs and debuffs while the enemy's walk through the level.  There are allot of maps, and there is almost always a new experience to enjoy.  Even after 100 hours I haven't played all the maps or reached max level.  The problem with it is that its sometimes hard to know what map you should play next.  It also has no top scores, which limits the ability to compete with friends.  Lots of achievements, and earning achievements is a major aspect of the game.

If you look up things like "GemCraft gem weaving" you'll see the  depth. It's a numbers game for the hardcore, and it rewards anyone willing to invest that much effort by utterly breaking down at high level play, which ultimately, isn't that what you kind of want if you're into that kind of stuff?\n\nThe only thing that was kind of disappointing was how little strategy is actually involved in placement--you don't want more than 1 or 2 gems on the whole field, and the game got much, much easier for me when I finally cottoned on to stop trying to carefully place and upgrade gems with effects and just funnel all the mana into one beastly mixed super gem and then march everything past it. Not that that's bad, just not what I was expecting from Tower Defense--this game is about crafting, wave management and spells.\n\nIt's also a huge game. 25 hours in and I still don't know how big the map is.\n\nIn short, fun wave defense for the casual, with a bit of a wall for those in the wrong mindset, and lots and lots to do for the hardcore.","April 1","true","29.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How da heck to hit things with bolts.\n2. How to play the other mods of the maps. (You know you light up one orange dot in ? what about the empty holes)\n3. How to maximize your earnings per level? (it was pretty clear before, summon that much, call this much early, do a chain of that many. etc etc.\n\nBasically navigation and explination at least to me is a downgrade from previous games.\nThe color of some gems has changed for whatever absurd reason.\n\nI like the series - but the beggining of this one is getting on my nerv constantly. Maybe it gets better when i unlock more stuff. I feel like punching someone in the face because of it.\n\nOVERALL:\nIf you were ok with the previous ones there is enough to go around with this one. Perhaps they were rushing a release and needed to cut corners - who knows. If you haven't played em - as I said go play em - they are free.\n\nOthwerise - it is another gemcraft. There are some improvements to controlls but you'll likely be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off to appreciate it too much.\n\nHonestly even with the annoyances these people have deilvered good content plenty of times to earn my money regardless.

Well-balanced with fair challenges.\n\nGemCraft is my favorite Tower Defense series because of how involved the player must get to succeed in progressing through the games. GC-CS is particularly involved, adding more content to test the player's ability to devise level strategy. The story is well-integrated into game mechanics. The skill tree is balanced. The level difficulty scales well.\n\nSome characteristics worth noting:\n-GC naturally discourages grinding because only the best performance on each level is counted towards XP. About midway through the game it becomes possible to farm XP, but a lot of strategizing has to be done before that.\n-Unlike many other TDs, structures are not limited to set positions on the level, leaving more options for the player.\n-The concept of combining gems (defenders) for combinations of abilities gives even more options for strategy.\n\nTo developer: Please release the rest of GC on Steam eventually.

This is really a pretty engaging and fun game with more options and more involved gameplay than even the trailer makes it seem (unfortunately not a very great endorsement for the game there.) You have six types of structure, nine types of gem, and every gem types can be mixed together to produce different types beyond the basic ones across several levels of gem strength which all adds onto map positioning, bombings (just throwing gems at things instead of socketing them), enraging waves, early calls, and other mechanics. I expected a pretty dull time waster but Gemcraft put a lot of tools on the table here and made every new map feel different than the last and a fun challenge to find out how to make sure you survive past the last wave...\n\nAnd then you can even hit a button when you finish for a no risk continuation of infinite waves to see how well your setup actually would fare past what it needed to which usually results in a horrible failure 15 minutes into but awards you with extra experience for the effort. Oh and did I mention the skills, spells, and talisman systems? Those are nifty too. The game even rewards you for NOT spending experience so just about everything is a choice you're making between one of several options, even deciding to spend experience.\n\nThis isn't a perfect game but it's a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good one. The graphics are really poor, Flash is still Flash, and you'll have heard your fill of sound effects and music in the first few hours easily but what it does do it does it too well to dock it too much for that.

It is the most extensive and in depth Tower Defense game.\n\nIt is at the same size as the 3rd part GC:Labyrinth or maybe even a bit larger, hard to say. It is mostly about the endgame and the path you take to it. While in GCL you were 95% of the endgame afk and waited for the remaining ~1100 waves (of 1337) to destroy, in GCCS you have to stay vigilant till the last of the 999 waves. Even with a good Wizard Level you will have a hard time destroying the last 10 waves on harder dificulty. This is because the HP and armor isn't capped compared to GCL. At some point of the game you have all data presented you in exponential style.\nSome here say that you need to grind older levels to progress, that is definitly not true. In my current game I've redone only about 10 lvls so far. To get more exp out the levels I cramp up the difficulty for new levels too, that way I don't need to redo them over and over again to get to the end.\n\nThe gem crafting is more indepth as it looks on the first glance. When you reach a certain point in the game, gems combined in a special way are stronger than just normal 'u'pped gems. There are several guides and even a gem combining tool to help out with the crafting.\n\nWhile there is a free version in the Internet, it is limited in some aspects (less skills, no endless mode, etc). The Steam version is fully unlocked, has higher resoultion textures, a few additional levels and it doesn't need the Flashplayer to work.\n\nother features:\n* Story\n* Skills and upgrades for skills\n* Talisman (like upgrades for armor and weapons in RPG)\n* countless maps to beat\n* 3 difficulties that you can adjust in different ways to make it even harder and get more exp (adjustable per map) + Iron Wizard mode (like a NewGame+)","June 19, 2015","true","104.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game benefits from it's gem system, allowing you to combine your tower properties and upgrade your towers to have multiple abilities. The learning curve for this game is smooth, with only a few spikes that grab your attention to the hints on the maps that help tower noobies to learn how to take advantage of your starting materials and the environment.\n\nGemcraft also features RPG elements such as a leveling system along with skills and equipable fragments for the tailsman, allowing you to gain an advantage in levels that were previously too difficult to complete (this means that you can grind to help you progress through the game if you'd like). If you think that grinding might make the game too easy, there are additional handicaps that the player can set on themselves to give more EXP and shadow cores for upgrading fragments. Achievements in the game are plenty and serve as milestones, giving the player skill points as a reward and keeping the difficult of the game from becoming to troublesome at later points in the game.\n\nGemcraft is a huge game for a tower defense game, which is incredible since the entire game can be played on the web for free at ArmorGames.

Spending resources to make incoming waves more difficult, which in turn, end up dropping even more resources. This ensures that GemCraft will be able to *always* challenge you at any phase of the game, on any map, because you will always have incentive to make each individual wave as difficult as you possibly can.\n\nNow, what I'd say the GemCraft series does very poorly is balancing its gem(tower) types and encouraging variety. Instead, there are very super optimal setups that are very homogenous (ie, not diverse). I will not give these away in the review, since discovery is one of the few fun parts available due to this.\n\nCheck the hours played of myself and others - there is clearly a lot of content here to properly hook somebody.","March 15","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gemcraft you have become an Executable, and a £4.99 executable at that, which for many of the series followers is a giant betrayal, i am a game designer with a degree in Games Design so i can understand why they made it a pay only game unlike all 4 or 5 previous gemcraft games which By the way if im doing a review im going to be brutally honest.\n\nGameplay - well rest assured this game lives up to the previous Gemcraft games being the next in the series with the story following the same format as the previous games, the evil darkness is trying to get hold of your spirit forge and you need to stop her (i say her, because it clearly states the "Evil shadows" are female [possible spoiler]).\n\ngame play is very similar to the other games however the biggest difference is there are now 2 new gems, the Black and the White, although the previous games didnt have these gem colours their effects were in the games, if i can remember correctly the Black gem is what the Red gem used to be it will get more powerfull the more it hits an enemy, and the white Gem gets more powerfull the more you upgrade your manapool. i will say that the previous gemcraft game gemcraft the labrinth was amazing, and if "game in a bottle" make a new game similar and make it cost £4.99 then it should damn well succeed where the others didnt, the map should be  2 or 3 times bigger with more to do on each level.\nalthough there is alot to do in each level theres not as many levels or at least it doesnt feel as if there is. The world map is a grid sytem each tile on the grid is a letter of the alphabet with probably 4 maybe 5 levels in each tile, so there are a lot of levels which is good :) but... for a game that used to be a flash game on the internet i was expecting alot more from an executable that now costs £4.99.\n\nAll in all Still the best Tower Deffence Game out there im just dissapointed that there wasnt more new content that the other free games already did.\n\nVerdict -  The game is still very good and i still play it even though ive completed all levels, if you cant bring yourself to pay for the game my advice is go online and play gemcraft: Labrinth for free then if you like that one finish it and buy this new one. it is still worth it, and you never know they might rectify the price sometime down the line :)","September 24, 2015","true","135.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Previous games in the series were free flash games -- one of which has an option to register your copy for $5, to get some XP and unlock a few skills.  Which I did twice, on different websites, without hesitation.  To see if you'll like this game, google Gemcraft Labyrinth and try five or eight levels.\n\nCons; this installment has a short but noticeable loading screen before every level.  Also, if it's anything like the others, it will also have an exponential difficulty curve, making the later levels hard as hell.\n\nPros, games in this series have tons and tons of levels, and can take weeks to months to beat into submission.  It has all of the user interface improvements that the series has gradually been accumulating (keyboard shortcuts particularly), plus a few new little tweaks here and there.  There are also enough tiny little tricks to learn, that skill and practice do seem to help, though not as much as strategy.  There is also an endless version of each level, letting you hypothetically keep leveling up forever.\n\n[edit] Fifty-some gameplay hours later, the above holds true.  Previous entries in the series had a difficulty curve that periodically jerked upwards, providing these little areas where you could get stuck if you hadn't leveled up enough (especially near bosses).  This game has those moments too, but they're much less steep and much further apart -- meaning you can go back, replay the first 5 levels with your new skills and powers, and come out of it with enough levels and XP to get past the part you were struggling with.  A+.\n\n[edit 2] Two hundred hours in.  There are achievements for gaining levels, the highest one is for level 200.  I'm in the mid 800's now.  I think I overleveled.  Some levels are still hard.  I accidentally won yesterday, but I'm not done collecting all of the things.  Going for 100%, only 50-some achievements left to go.  At no point during this game have I felt stuck anywhere, I've always had things to do to prepare for the challenges ahead.

If you look up things like "GemCraft gem weaving" you'll see the  depth. It's a numbers game for the hardcore, and it rewards anyone willing to invest that much effort by utterly breaking down at high level play, which ultimately, isn't that what you kind of want if you're into that kind of stuff?\n\nThe only thing that was kind of disappointing was how little strategy is actually involved in placement--you don't want more than 1 or 2 gems on the whole field, and the game got much, much easier for me when I finally cottoned on to stop trying to carefully place and upgrade gems with effects and just funnel all the mana into one beastly mixed super gem and then march everything past it. Not that that's bad, just not what I was expecting from Tower Defense--this game is about crafting, wave management and spells.\n\nIt's also a huge game. 25 hours in and I still don't know how big the map is.\n\nIn short, fun wave defense for the casual, with a bit of a wall for those in the wrong mindset, and lots and lots to do for the hardcore.","April 1","true","29.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a lot of fun to get accustomed to new abilities or structures, and the game is only punishing if you want it to be.\nAside from common features such as custom targeting, fast-forward (up to 9x), mazing and calling waves early, there's many unique concepts, lots of different structures to keep things diverse, and the ideas from previous GemCraft games have been vastly improved.\nSlightly annoying: demolitions are costly and limited even in the preparation phase, so if you make a mistake with wall building you may have to restart and build everything again.\nChasing Shadows' main problem is that it runs on Flash, so there's no linux support. For a flash game it runs well though, lag is only an issue at extremely high levels.\nThere's a lot of content. The large amount of maps is supplemented by custom difficulty modifiers and the option to continue each level in endless mode.

The game benefits from it's gem system, allowing you to combine your tower properties and upgrade your towers to have multiple abilities. The learning curve for this game is smooth, with only a few spikes that grab your attention to the hints on the maps that help tower noobies to learn how to take advantage of your starting materials and the environment.\n\nGemcraft also features RPG elements such as a leveling system along with skills and equipable fragments for the tailsman, allowing you to gain an advantage in levels that were previously too difficult to complete (this means that you can grind to help you progress through the game if you'd like). If you think that grinding might make the game too easy, there are additional handicaps that the player can set on themselves to give more EXP and shadow cores for upgrading fragments. Achievements in the game are plenty and serve as milestones, giving the player skill points as a reward and keeping the difficult of the game from becoming to troublesome at later points in the game.\n\nGemcraft is a huge game for a tower defense game, which is incredible since the entire game can be played on the web for free at ArmorGames.

Flexible placement of towers, traps, amplifiers, and walls. Skills, player level system, drops (talismans, shadow cores), battle traits (difficulty/reward enhancement), enraging waves, and 3 difficulty per map gives this game plenty of playtime. The flexibility in difficulty and the risk/reward of harder traits make the chance for better talismans a thrill.\nBadI did find the main storyboard to increase toward the end and requiring playing through old maps on the harder difficulties (xp + flat skill addiiton for completion) to complete the later maps. I did not enjoy the one time maps labeled "V", they are not required but the lack of the bonus skills/talismans made them too hard. The low fedlity did make some of the assests hard to spot and it did have some poor optimisations (low cpu/gpu use) for the large enemy counts. The tower damage and enemy health did not seem to line up, eg 2M enemy health and a tower doing only 19k and the number of hits displayed are not enough.","February 20","true","127.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gemcraft you have become an Executable, and a £4.99 executable at that, which for many of the series followers is a giant betrayal, i am a game designer with a degree in Games Design so i can understand why they made it a pay only game unlike all 4 or 5 previous gemcraft games which By the way if im doing a review im going to be brutally honest.\n\nGameplay - well rest assured this game lives up to the previous Gemcraft games being the next in the series with the story following the same format as the previous games, the evil darkness is trying to get hold of your spirit forge and you need to stop her (i say her, because it clearly states the "Evil shadows" are female [possible spoiler]).\n\ngame play is very similar to the other games however the biggest difference is there are now 2 new gems, the Black and the White, although the previous games didnt have these gem colours their effects were in the games, if i can remember correctly the Black gem is what the Red gem used to be it will get more powerfull the more it hits an enemy, and the white Gem gets more powerfull the more you upgrade your manapool. i will say that the previous gemcraft game gemcraft the labrinth was amazing, and if "game in a bottle" make a new game similar and make it cost £4.99 then it should damn well succeed where the others didnt, the map should be  2 or 3 times bigger with more to do on each level.\nalthough there is alot to do in each level theres not as many levels or at least it doesnt feel as if there is. The world map is a grid sytem each tile on the grid is a letter of the alphabet with probably 4 maybe 5 levels in each tile, so there are a lot of levels which is good :) but... for a game that used to be a flash game on the internet i was expecting alot more from an executable that now costs £4.99.\n\nAll in all Still the best Tower Deffence Game out there im just dissapointed that there wasnt more new content that the other free games already did.\n\nVerdict -  The game is still very good and i still play it even though ive completed all levels, if you cant bring yourself to pay for the game my advice is go online and play gemcraft: Labrinth for free then if you like that one finish it and buy this new one. it is still worth it, and you never know they might rectify the price sometime down the line :)","September 24, 2015","true","135.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Flexible placement of towers, traps, amplifiers, and walls. Skills, player level system, drops (talismans, shadow cores), battle traits (difficulty/reward enhancement), enraging waves, and 3 difficulty per map gives this game plenty of playtime. The flexibility in difficulty and the risk/reward of harder traits make the chance for better talismans a thrill.\nBadI did find the main storyboard to increase toward the end and requiring playing through old maps on the harder difficulties (xp + flat skill addiiton for completion) to complete the later maps. I did not enjoy the one time maps labeled "V", they are not required but the lack of the bonus skills/talismans made them too hard. The low fedlity did make some of the assests hard to spot and it did have some poor optimisations (low cpu/gpu use) for the large enemy counts. The tower damage and enemy health did not seem to line up, eg 2M enemy health and a tower doing only 19k and the number of hits displayed are not enough.","February 20","true","127.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spending resources to make incoming waves more difficult, which in turn, end up dropping even more resources. This ensures that GemCraft will be able to *always* challenge you at any phase of the game, on any map, because you will always have incentive to make each individual wave as difficult as you possibly can.\n\nNow, what I'd say the GemCraft series does very poorly is balancing its gem(tower) types and encouraging variety. Instead, there are very super optimal setups that are very homogenous (ie, not diverse). I will not give these away in the review, since discovery is one of the few fun parts available due to this.\n\nCheck the hours played of myself and others - there is clearly a lot of content here to properly hook somebody.","March 15","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gemcraft Labyrinth was perhaps equal to this one. I played the limited free flash versions. So I picked this up on a bargain and played with access to all the elements of the game, and it is nearly poorer than the limited version. And I am sad to give it a negative review. For these reasons:\nIt's strong suit is that you can scale the difficulty quite well by cranking up the challenge. However if you get good at it you end up with getting to big of a reward for this and with the added bonus you get from things the pay version it soon becomes to easy. You advance way too fast and nothing becomes more of a challenge than you make it and even that becomes hard after a while. By playing skilled through maybe a third of the stages you can easily just click "send all" on the rest of them and finish them in seconds, if you like.\nThe above would be fine if you could actually scale the challenge up, but can't because it lags really bad after a certain point. My rig isn't the best of rigs, but it plays worse than the web browser flash version. So at some point you start not play the best you can, but rather at how you can avoid lag. Which only works so far before that also more or less breaks down because even that becomes easy.\nThen it is the graphics itself, I kind of expected this to be scaleable so that it would render to any screen resolution. It doesn't, so if you go full screen (which increase lags) it is gets grainy and blurred.\n\nIf you have never played it and it is a bargain I can recommend it for the time you spend to learn it, which is enjoyable and less laggy. Also if you have played previous free versions and wanna throw Game in a Bottle a few coins. And maybe the iron wizard mode is enjoyable which cranks up the challenge by removing some of the things that made the series great.","March 14","false","136.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easily one of the best tower defense games for a number of reasons: variety, difficulty scaling, progression and depth of mechanics. The earlier levels even seemed to be set up in a way to make certain emerging "low effort strats" unusable after a while, such as giving a level layout that made chaining poison traps too difficult.\n\nMy biggest issue is regarding mana-pool gems, as their special property essentially nullifies the shortcomings of having a dual-colour gem, and then some. This is extremely pronounced when stacking difficulty to the point where I found all I needed to finish every level on 50x+ difficulty was a mana-farming trap, crit tower gem and zero-to-any number of slowing traps. Mana-pool gems changed the game too much for me.","June 9, 2015","true","77.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/a21shibbo/recommended/296490/","a21shibbo","lspc.BaeB","http://steamcommunity.com/id/a21shibbo/","184 products in account","It's six months into 2015 and this is undoubtably my favorite game of the year. As an avid GemTD, Wintermaul, and ElementTD player, I can say that GemCraft is the BEST TD I've played yet. Here's why:\n\nMazing in a Map\nOne of the problems with games like ElementTD was that you were never able to maze. At the mercy of the map players are forced into placing their powerful towers in obvious places. Oh look, there's a bend where my tower is able to get as much exposure as possible, guess I'd be foolish to not put it there.\n\nIn GemCraft players are allowed, and encouraged, to manipulate the creeps' pathing. On multiple -- and frequent --  occasions the player is presented with a variety of choices as to how they want the creeps to move throughout the map. Not only that but, after you destroy spawning huts (located on certain levels) you're able to dynamically reorient your choke points [the game will warn you if you're trying to 'block' the creeps from getting to your orb] making you pay attention at all times.\n\nGems and Their Mechanics\nGems come in 9 different types all with effects ranging from slowing enemies to breaking their armor and can be upgraded, combined, and even  spent on making waves harder (more on this later). Unlike towers in most TD games gems can be repositioned without any cost to the player's resource, the only downside is that the gem needs to resocket itself which takes a few seconds.\n\nWhat sets GemCraft outside of traditional TDs is how gems interact with traps, bombs, tower pedestals, wave enhancements, and amplifiers. Unlike most TDs players can place trap slots throughout their mazes. These slots do not block movement and the gems inside trigger when enemies pass over them -- they are not consumed and can be moved to tower pedestals at the player's will. What's interesting is that the damage of the gem is greatly reduced (%80) however its effect is multiplied by an enormous amount. In some maps I never used a tower what so ever, just a lot of traps and some powerful synergy between the game's progression and RPG elements.\n\nTower pedestals are slots for gems that allow them to function like towers. Gems will attack monsters that pass by and inflict their special effects if they can. Pedestals can be placed all over the map so long as they don't block the creeps from the orb (though they can redirect them).\n\nAmplifies are placed adjacent to pedestals and increase the damage, attack speed, range, and special effect modifiers of the gems inside the towers. The cost: the gems can't attack. A balance between leveling the primary gem and the gems in the amplifiers is needed for best results.\n\nBombs are essentially consumed gems which a player can drop anywhere on the battlefield. Their damage and effects are increased and help players mop up monsters that pass through their defences. Though I haven't focused on bombing or specializing into it I certainly like the idea of making a skill build that supports their use.\n\nBombs can also be used to enhance incoming monster waves by increasing their stats (HP/Armor) and by spawning more monsters\n\nMechanic: both high and low level gems will increase the incoming wave's stats by a fixed amount that rises the more gem bombs you use to enhance the wave. Higher level gems will increase the monster spawn count by a larger amount depending on level. Confused? Allow me to elaborate.\n\n\nYou have a wave that consists of 10 reavers, each with 100 hp and 5 armor. If you drop a low ranked gem bomb (rank 1) the wave will have an additional 2 reavers, instead of 100 hp and 5 armor they will now all have 110hp and 7 armor. However, if you use a high gem rank (let's say 10+) the wave will gain an additional 20 reavers all of which will have 110 hp and 7 armor. If you wanted to you could get the wave to spawn an additional 20 reavers with rank 1 gems however the stats of the reavers in that wave would be ridiculous -- probably 500 hp and 100 armor.\n\nSo why the hell would you want to fight and kill more reavers?! The trick is that it helps you later on. The added reavers all grant experience and mana (the game's currency and life support) and, if you're demolishing the early waves, can help you stock pile experience and mana for the later parts of the game. In essence the game's difficulty is dynamic and influenced by the player, every wave is as hard or as easy as the player wants it to be.\n\nRPG Elements Hooooo!\nAs a player accumulates more experience and ventures through the hexgrid they will gain skill points, skills, spells, enhancements, talisman fragments, and battle traits.\n\nSkills are more like talents in that they are all passive. Some of the skills in the game include effects like: gems placed into traps have their special modifiers increased, poison from poison gems is more effective, monsters reward more mana per kill, decreased cost of building and combining gems .... the list goes on and on. The best part: most skills have no maximum level! This seems OP right? Well it isn't. Each time a skill is leveled it requires 1 more skill point to level up:\n\nRank 0 to 1 [1 skill point]\nRank 1 to 2 [2 skill points]\nRank 2 to 3 [3 skill points]\n\nSee the trend?\n\nThere's a catch. For every skill point you don't spend on skills you gain 7 initial mana. So if you had 100 skill points you'd start with 700 more mana. Allocate too many points and you might find that the early waves demolish you. Balance is the key.\n\nThe only spell I have right now is the freeze spell. Usable anywhere and instantaneously deployable the freeze spell .... freezes monsters. Not much else to say but hey, you can spec into reducing the cooldown of freeze if you like it a lot. I'm sure there are more but I've yet to come across them.\n\nEnhancements are temporary, or when used on a trap permanent, buffs that recharge over time and can be bestowed upon any tower or trap on the map. My favorite by far is the beam enhancement which, you guessed it, makes the gem shoot a beam of armor ignoring blazing light to enemies who are within the tower's range. This lasts 12 seconds and can be increased to 16 with enough points (probably more if I spent more points on the skill).\n\nTalisman Fragments is the game's equivalent to gear, although much less interesting and impactful. Fragments can be slotted, upgraded, and their effects span from increased damage to reavers (screw reavers ... man) to increasing the player's starting mana. The fragments drop randomly from monsters and have a rarity system. I'm hoping to find some fragments that increase length of my beam enhancement...\n\nBattle traits are map modifiers that increase the level's experience multiplier. Often times they make the game harder however, stack enough of them in a single map and you could be pulling in 8 times the experience for each monster slain! Off the top of my hard is a trait that makes waves come faster while another makes giants more resilient (+HP/+Armor) and slightly more mobile. Traits have 7 levels of effectiveness and multiply experience gain by +0.3 (or 30% MORE exp).\n\nClosing\nSeriously, the game is $9.99 and it's worth every virtual penny. There's a lot I didn't mention about the game including skill synergy, particular gem combinations, and endurance mode. If you're looking for a cross between a TD and an RPG, along with a metric crap-ton of replay value then I urge you to purchase this game.\n\nThere are very few games that are challenging these days and GemCraft is one that will make you think, pause frequently, and hate yourself for being overzealous -- 300 swarmlings at wave level 10? Yup, shouldn't have dropped that many bombs.","June 11, 2015","true","103.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is unless you like having your hand held through the process. This is a game that commands your understanding before you can succeed, and unless you're planning out your skills and utilising your talismans, it can quickly get the best of you.\nAs far as I have seen, this game offers a wealth of replayability, with the ability to go back to any map you've completed and play it with difficulty-increasing modifiers, and also just harder difficulty levels, not to mention an "Endurance" mode. Ultimately you could spend a tons of hours just work through the levels, and it's a greatly soothing game to play when you just want to chill.","January 15","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything you'd expect to see is here: building towers, walling-off enemies' paths into serpentine mazes, upgrading your defenses. GemCraft has an simple and intuitive take on tower design.  Gems provide the stats for each tower. You can swap them in and out of towers, upgrade them, and combine them for increased effects. All of this takes place while managing your mana pool. Mana is gained passively and from destroying monsters, then used to create gems, towers, walls, traps, etc. The economy of this system is rewarding for those who like to micromanage but no so punishing as to discourage experimentation.\n\nOutside of each level, you can unlock new skills to improve various aspects of your experience or hold onto those skill points for more mana at the beginning of levels. This trade-off is a nice change of pace from blindly allocating points as soon as they become available. In addition to skills, enemies may drop glyphs which can be socketed in to a grid and upgraded, providing further customization and buffs. Additionally, traits can also be found that are used to increase and customize the dificulty of  any level. Did I mention the levels? There are so many. A great deal of content is packed into this game.\n\nThe only area where GemCraft is lacking is in the graphics and presentation. The entire game has a semi-gothic, old-school vibe similar to Diablo or any other notable RPG to come out the 90s. This style may appeal to some, but overall, the look of the game isn't very memorable.","January 16","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is probably the deepest / most complex Tower Defense game available and has 100s of hours of play available should you want to explore its modes fully.\nWith a HUGE variety of towers, skills, maps and a couple of fascinating and rewarding additional gameplay mehcanics this provides you with almost endless variety.\nThe particular benefit this game offers is the ability to upgrade. You upgrade your skills, the towers available, the gameplay modifiers you can use (which each have numerous levels), your talisman (which features 100s of "perk" combinations on more than 20 fragments which randomly drop during games, all of which can be, themselves, upgraded, and have a significant impact on gameplay). Additionally there are well over 100 levels which can be played at 3 difficulties and indeed a whole alternate game mode which significantly alters the challenge / experience.\nThis game represents rare quality and value for money.

It is a hidden little gem i picked up for $0.21. This is a puzzle platformer that is so fun because the puzzles are very satisfying to solve. At the beginning of the game i was a confused but I quickly picked up the game mechanics due to the games perfect learning curve. In other words when the game teaches a new mechanic, it starts off easy until you are familar with the mechanic, then harder till it becomes secondhand knowledge, and THEN thats when the game shows you the next new mechanic. Of course this is not to say that you will never be stumped at some parts, after all it is what makes a puzzle game a puzzle game and takes some creative thinking BUT is never anything ridiculous to solve. The main part about this game that is kept me so hooked were all the puzzles. The harder puzzles are extreamly satisfying to solve (plenty of "OHHH!!" moments) and secrets are very rewarding to find. The puzzles in this game will never become stale, thats because even though the puzzles are essentially the same, the variations and new mechanics keep it very fun, enjoyable, and interesting to play. One more thing is that great soundtrack, props to them!\n\nPROS\n-Great learning curve\n-Puzzles never get boring\n-New Mechanics add depth\n-Puzzles are very satisfying to solve\n-Puzzles are so clever (I know i've said it a bunch but I really love the puzzles!!!)\n-Great price\n-Secrets keep the game interesting\n-Never too easy or too hard\n-Awesome music to play to\n\nCONS\n-None (I can't complain as the game has everything advertised plus much more and FAR exceded my expectations)\n\nThe game is short and can not really be a con for being so, as it cost me a mere $0.21.

This might last for a while, but eventually you will start developing mana farms and killing areas and turn the game into a grind fest (harvesting experience and items can lead to a field taking over a few hours). Not so cool.\n\nHOWEVER, during this process, you will unlock the Iron Wizard mode. Here, your skill progression is limited, you will need to make trade off regarding the skills you use, and the game does not suffer from this grinding fest (as much anyhow). Basically, because the benefits you get from unlocking each field is a one time boost. Of course, as you progress, each field will take more time, but this increase is somehow limited.\n\nThis last mode is excellent.

Everything you'd expect to see is here: building towers, walling-off enemies' paths into serpentine mazes, upgrading your defenses. GemCraft has an simple and intuitive take on tower design.  Gems provide the stats for each tower. You can swap them in and out of towers, upgrade them, and combine them for increased effects. All of this takes place while managing your mana pool. Mana is gained passively and from destroying monsters, then used to create gems, towers, walls, traps, etc. The economy of this system is rewarding for those who like to micromanage but no so punishing as to discourage experimentation.\n\nOutside of each level, you can unlock new skills to improve various aspects of your experience or hold onto those skill points for more mana at the beginning of levels. This trade-off is a nice change of pace from blindly allocating points as soon as they become available. In addition to skills, enemies may drop glyphs which can be socketed in to a grid and upgraded, providing further customization and buffs. Additionally, traits can also be found that are used to increase and customize the dificulty of  any level. Did I mention the levels? There are so many. A great deal of content is packed into this game.\n\nThe only area where GemCraft is lacking is in the graphics and presentation. The entire game has a semi-gothic, old-school vibe similar to Diablo or any other notable RPG to come out the 90s. This style may appeal to some, but overall, the look of the game isn't very memorable.","January 16","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than make a real PC port that would perform immensely better the developers pretty much just threw their already coded flash game into adobe air and called it a steam release.  While this method works for the most part, especially in a game like this where you can end up with multiple thousands of monsters on the screen being fired at by towers and gems firing in the hundreds of times a second and chaining each of those hits to thousands of individual mobs each time, lets just say it isn't pretty.\n\nThe endgame is plagued by unavoidable lag, and the more skilled you are the worse the lag will be.

I get that there is so much going on that it will lag eventually, but that bar would be much higher if this wasn't a flash game running through the adobe air wrapper.  When the game gets bad enough I'm barely getting an onscreen update per second (and it does get worse than this) I can have the game windowed and a cpu monitor in the background and see my usage never passes 30%.

Spending resources to make incoming waves more difficult, which in turn, end up dropping even more resources. This ensures that GemCraft will be able to *always* challenge you at any phase of the game, on any map, because you will always have incentive to make each individual wave as difficult as you possibly can.\n\nNow, what I'd say the GemCraft series does very poorly is balancing its gem(tower) types and encouraging variety. Instead, there are very super optimal setups that are very homogenous (ie, not diverse). I will not give these away in the review, since discovery is one of the few fun parts available due to this.\n\nCheck the hours played of myself and others - there is clearly a lot of content here to properly hook somebody.","March 15","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This might last for a while, but eventually you will start developing mana farms and killing areas and turn the game into a grind fest (harvesting experience and items can lead to a field taking over a few hours). Not so cool.\n\nHOWEVER, during this process, you will unlock the Iron Wizard mode. Here, your skill progression is limited, you will need to make trade off regarding the skills you use, and the game does not suffer from this grinding fest (as much anyhow). Basically, because the benefits you get from unlocking each field is a one time boost. Of course, as you progress, each field will take more time, but this increase is somehow limited.\n\nThis last mode is excellent.

Nothing compares to the level of complexity in Chasing Shadows.  As a wizard I imagine my storyline as a sort of 3rd person Omnipotent with my consciousness hovering above the world, enchanting gems and warping the battlefield to my varied whims.  Gemcraft does get difficult, but with an skill system and equipment you can always find another way to win.  The strategy of maze building adds the element of nearly infinite replay for alternate pathing and tower placement.  This is the direction TD should be going.","June 5","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game now feels very polished and complete. However, I do wish to be able to make my own fields with custom skills, starting mana, and layouts in a similar manner to how we can make our own maps in creeper world 3.","June 4","true","456.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

High quality and very challenging. Needs some rebalancing and maybe some of the mechanics could be more interesting. Especially gem combining - could it be less focused on calculating the best possible combination sequence? Sometimes it feels like a Maths degree is needed to properly beat the game, since combining the same gems in different order may give different results, which felt surprising.\n\nAnyway, very recommended game, which can give hours of enjoyment. Can't wait to see what mysteries the next part of the campaign will reveal.","June 6","true","54.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
