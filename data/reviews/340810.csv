"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0icke0/recommended/340810/","0icke0","icke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0icke0/","175 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo the game starts with a tutorial, so far so good, although I still have no idea what to do after the tutorial is over. After this things are going down hill. In order to find out what to do next I decided to open the crafting menu, only to discover that almost all items have a placeholder text and the few that don't also don't show any stats or useful info.\n\nNext you enter a world and start encountering enemies. Considering the bullets are almost invisible and there is no real feedback when you get damaged, you properly already lost half your health by the time you notice one is shooting at you. You decide to shoot back with invisible bullets, wondering if you hit the enemy, because they also don't show any feedback of being damaged. Not only that, but it also doesn't show how much health they have remaining or even how much damage you do. Eventually they disappear in thin air, because a death animation was too much work apparently.\n\nContinuing with the mining aspect you notice that you are not the first person to enter the world. It seems the world was around already for a long time and all treasures have already been looted. Continuing to dig down or jumping down holes other dug for you, you notice that at some point you are unable to continue mining. As this is a 'crafting adventure game' it seems logical to craft a better pickaxe, but instead you have to level up your mining level. By mining a lot you ask? No, by killing monster, so you get a skill point once you level up.\n\nThis is the next problem in the game. You want to craft something with the ores you mined? A pickaxe? Level up tool making first. A weapon? Level up weapon making first. A bomb? Level up bomb making first. A healing potion? Even decoration? Yes, you get it, this is not a crafting game, but a leveling up game. Don't bother mining resources or hunting for treasure, just keep grinding monsters in this crappy combat system.\n\nI stopped playing at this point, so I don't know how the building system is, but from what I heard you need to pay to make anything worthwhile. Which is the next problem: micro-transactions. But I guess you already realized that, considering this game is 'free to play'.","April 23, 2015","false","1.5"," 128 of 172 people (74%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","74","128","172","11","4"

It really is not fun at all (for me at least). You have to pay to protect your own land from other players. I was building my own house and i put down a protector tht i got with my free crowns, 2 minutes later some guy comes over and destroys the place and takes my stuff. You need to buy worlds so that you can play solo or with a friend. The mobs are glitchy af and you will get hit randomly then just die out of nowhere.  If you ask me, I say waste of time and money (if you are still wanting to PAY for this crap).

That's because the game was originally on Mac and iOS and is currently in the process of being ported to Windows. (I usually play on V2 Mac.) But if you check the updates, the V3 Steam version is slowly but constantly getting better, catching up to its v2 counterpart. Additionally, some of the microtransactions mentioned in negative reviews are on the way out. There's no more skill cap and now everyone gets unrestricted access to all biomes.\n\nAnyway, I should tell a bit about what Deepworld is.\nDeepworld is an online multiplayer sandbox game. A notable aspect is the fact that every single server/world is linked together via world teleporters. This makes it easy to travel between worlds, to go mining, exploring, questing, building, and so on. You can build something cool and show it to your friends or the public, or you can visit other people's creations. There's a place for everything.\nThe sandbox aspect means you can build whatever you can think of. Building materials are easy to aquire.\n\nRemember: Deepworld is always in development. It will improve over time as more content is added to the game.","June 22, 2015","true","0.4"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

If you're willing to put aside that it's Early Access and has microtransactions, you should give this game a try. It has a wide assortment of craftable items, as well as many worlds and materials that you can explore. If you're a fan of these games, I doubt Deepworld will get boring before the developers release updates.\n\nAs for the community, it can be a bit sketchy at times. As a crossplatform game, many of the mobile users of Deepworld don't use the chat. This lack of communication means that people ignore the fact that you're telling them to stop when they're mining the damn chair you just placed. If they're not ignoring you, they're probably speaking a different language, which is always bad when there are no dedicated servers for different locations.\n\nOther than that, the tutorial doesn't give you much of an idea on what you should be doing, how to do things, or what materials are. I chalked it up to be trial-and-error and self-learning, but they could always use with a more descriptive tutorial for newer players. If this all sounds fine to you and you're willing to give it a chance, go ahead and give it a download.\n\nReview is subject to change after Early Access and/or after more gameplay.","April 23, 2015","true","1.4"," 44 of 70 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","44","70","9","0"

No one does that...EVER! Wait, i dont even have Terr- Never mind...\n\nFREE TO PLAY MMO:\nOne of the things I try to avoid on Steam, If i can, is MMO's and Free to Play games. And when it comes to Survival, Building, Adventure games, there are a bunch. But this....this was special, For one the developers have allowed players to buy their own private world which removes the tedium of griefing on public worlds. Also you may invite friends to your private world, so you know the people you are working with arent going to ruin anything of yours. This feature is what saves this game, In my opinion.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nI run a basic Toshiba laptop, Windows 8.1. It's about 3 years old, and that's not a good PC at all! But it runs this game at 60 FPS with no real drops apart from when it autosaves the session. The Game itself is a side scroller so it uses the WASD controls, you also use the mouse to mine...Much like Terraria.\n\nCONTROLS:\nStandard PC Game Controls.\nWASD, Mouse, SEE SETTINGS FOR DETAILS\n\nAFTERTHOUGHTS:\nIt's fun!

There needs to be more to the game than go out in the world and dig for things.\n\n- Microtransaction heavy. Many biomes are locked behind premium and if you want to build something large and notable in a world or even get your own world chances are you are going to be buying them with "crowns" eventually.\n\n\nDeepworld is free on Steam now, so any returning or prospective players should give it a look.","April 22, 2015","true","3.1"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","17","32","3","4"

There are many possibilities, once you leave the H.M.S Challenge. You can mine, looking for basic materials or rare items. You can build great structures, just remember to protect them first (You get 25 free crowns when you register. That's enough for a small protector). You can craft weapons, and use them in PvP worlds. You can trade with other players, and attempt to be the richest in whatever currency you desire. You could start a guild, and attempt to take over Deepworld. There's so much to do, you just have to decide what you will do. I have played Deepworld for over a year now, and it doesn't bore me at all.\n(I just felt that I needed to add this. Deepworld isn't a pay-to-win game. Buying items from the crown shop can give you an advantage, but you can still have a great experience without spending crowns.

It's quirky artstyle and unique gameplay make it one of a kind in the sandbox genre\n\nWhilst it may not have some of the features that other sandboxes have, Deepworld has its own unique gameplay, and has come a huge distance since I first started playing in early 2013. The game is still evolving, and its development heavily influenced by player suggestions.\n\nRemember also before criticising the game too harshly, that this is an early access release, and there will be bugs.\nAlso, Premium is an extension of the game, and for only $3 is more than worth the cost given how much effort and time has been put into the game. I for one definitely prefer to pay a small amount of money, then be plagued by Game of War adds. Many people complain about pay to win games - almost every functional item in Deepworld can be looted, crafted, or traded for without spending a single cent.\n\nBack to gameplay however...\nIf you like creating gigantic structures, and proudly displaying them, then Deepworld is a game for you.\nAs someone who has played the game for quite a long time, the engineering mechanics of Deepworld are limited solely by your imagination.\nWant to build a massive password protected vault? You can (with enough creativity - although its a lot easier now than it was 2 years ago :P)\nWant to build an epic parkour course? Do it!\nWant to construct a PvE combat arena? You can!\n\nAlso addictive about the game is the looting system and the constant generation of new worlds, each full of new resources. Super rare items exist for all you collectors, and there is an ever expanding collection of craftable items.\n\nThe levelling mechanic reinforces Deepworld's RPG experience, with stat point allocations that makes every character unique. On top of this is the growing number of player customisation items.\n\nFinally, there is a sense of immense satisfaction about looking around a world (Deepworld Server) at the end of the day, taking in that newly purified air and looking at the town that you rebuilt from ruins. That feeling, at least is why I play Deepworld. To create, restore, and exceed what has been previously done.\n\nTL;DR:\nGreat mechanics and Unique art style\nOnly limited by imagination\nLots of items + super rare items\nEndless sandbox\nLevelling system makes character unique\nStill in early release, so yes, bugs are a thing.\n\nYou might beg to differ, but Deepworld is my favourite game ever, and it's the one I keep coming back to.\nGive it a go. Whilst you might find it takes time to get used to, keep at it, and it'll be an incredibly rewarding gaming experience.","April 24, 2015","true","129.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

The game is still in the works and has enormous potential, if you give it the chance. Those who think that all 2D, block-based sandbox games are terraria clones will be disappointed. This game is not Terraria and it's not minecraft. This game is Deepworld and nothing else. That being said, it's an amazing game with a rich history and many things to do.\n\nI would like to add, the game is an early-access beta, and, of course, has bugs. The best way to help improve the game is to report to the devs on the game's forums. The developers thrive off of community and peer reviews, and are always keen to address issues and find solutions to problems. I can tell you this from experience. When the game first released to the iPod touch, I was stuck in a special area. The developers helped me in a matter of hours with my problem, and has been one of my favorite games for two years, now.\n\nJump out of your comfort zone. Give it a chance,.

Since it's been updated it really is free to play so you may want to ignore older reviews as I understand most of the game was locked in a previous version.\n\nIn this game you mine for resources and raid dungeons while fighting off various denizens of the Deepworld.   There is both melee and ranged (gun) combat.  It's design is basically steampunk which I'm usually not a fan of but it certainly works for this game.\n\nYou play the game in worlds which seem to spawn unexplored every hour or so, with different climates (biomes) to choose from.  Once you've chosen the world you want to explore, they give you a percentage of unexplored area before you choose, you are placed on the surface of the world which is fairly large.  I'd say it could take between five and ten minutes to run from one side of the world to the other.  If the world you chose is new and fairly unexplored you can expect there to be between twenty and thirty other players exploring and even then it's not hard to avoid everyone if that's what you want.\n\nThe other players may not be on steam as everyone, whatever device they're playing on all play together.   So they might have access to a game feature you don't have yet, since the game is new to steam.  For example bookmarking a world wasn't available on PC but today they released an update that added it.  So they are aware and seem to be actively improving the game.\n\nPaying for features is an option still but just about everything you can pay for can be obtained by trading players who bought the items.  Like if you want to build a house, anyone can just come along and destroy it.  For a couple of dollars you can buy protectors that prevent anyone from destroying your stuff in a certain radius of the protector.\n\nI'm level 18 right now and am still having fun, it's free and worth a try.","May 19, 2015","true","407.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

What can I say? this game has a ton of potential, but it landed on the wrong foot. If the devs are reading this, I have a recommendation that can change your game. Please, if it is a free to play game, keep it like that. The MMO ideas are great, but really? you need to pay to make your buildings safe? I mean, at least make blocks not breakable by other players unless those players are like in your party or da da da... I mean like this game could have been paid, yet everything was accesible from the start. No need to pay extra for the fun.

Personally I don't like it, but it's all a matter of taste.\nMore pressing issue is that everything else is also bad. Combat is janky. Exploring and crafting are arbitrarily locked behind paywalls (unless you want to grind levels for a long time,) and there is nothing to explore anyway. You'll be lucky if you find an area that was not already scrapped by other players (even though there are barely any players to begin with... or maybe I just log in at bad times? Who knows.) There are also premium areas, but obviously they are also locked behind paywall, so I have no idea what they look like.\nAnd if you want to build something of your own, you better fork some money over for protection, otherwise if other players find your stuff, they'll break it apart and take it.\nNo matter how you look at it, you'll be much better off spending couple of bucks on Terraria, if you didn't already.

Reminds me alot of Terraria and Minecraft, on so many levels. First off, the tutorial is way too grindy, so much "obvious" steps you have to do.  Overall just annoying graphics and looks more like a game a 10 year old would play. Maybe insert some learning into it, mathematics and stuff and it might be a suitable game for people in lower classes at school?

Crafting is limited to levels rather than resources, and even though it's an MMORPG there seems to be minimal player interaction. The enemies are all boring, easily-killed monsters and the excitement of digging through rock like in Minecraft is tarnished by the player's ability to see exactly where resources are. As such, it becomes more a chore to dig rather than a rewarding enterprise, for part of the appeal of digging is that hope that you'll find some more resources after the next block.\n\nThere's really no incentive to build things as far as I could tell, since your inventory pretty much holds whatever you find with no problems, and anything you build could just as easily be wrecked by another player unless you pay for a device that protects your blocks. Crafting is boring since every recipe is available for you to look at and, again, it becomes more a chore to create things than a rewarding enterprise.\n\nAs it stands, I really didn't enjoy this game. I didn't hate it, but after playing it for an hour I really didn't see any reason to go back to it.","April 26, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

The microtransactions turn an otherwise great game into something unplayable. I would have paid $15 or even $20 for a full game. Instead if you actually want to enjoy the building part of the game you better be ready to drop a lot of money or constantly rebuild on your small plot never saving any of your favorite buildings. If you've ever played minecraft you know how rare diamonds are there but at least you were guaranteed to find some if you dug deep and explored the bottom of the game. In this game you could dig up the entire map and not find one onyx or diamond. I'm willing to bet there's a way to spend money to get them though.\n\nTL;DR - Unless you're got tons of cash and nothing to spend it on microtransactions strike again.","May 25, 2015","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can go underground and find minerals while your friend is aboveground searching for tons of trees and scrap stuff. Then you can use your materials to craft something, then use that to craft something else! Or you can go to a dungeon, kill brains (Brains floating in a jar w/ tentacles) and get loot!! Then, after all that, you can go Times Square to trade your items with other players! (Beware of spawnkillers placing bombs all over the place)\n\nAfter all this you will probably have realized two things though:\n- Premium Currency? Crowns?\n- Premium!!?!?11!?!!!/1!??11\n\nYes, this game is freemium, and everybody that gets this game probably doesn't like that.\n\nWell Premium is awesome, just read all these pros:\n- It's only like 3 bucks - and it's permanent!\n- You get access to way more items! This includes the awesome energy cannon.\n- You can raise your skills higher! Want crafting lvl 4? Then this skill limit will be taken away when you upgrade!\n- Plus more cool stuff!!\n\nAnd here are the benifits to Crowns, the premium currency:\n- Buy your own private worlds \(O_O)/\n- Get packs to upgrade your abilities\n- Exosuits!! Become over powered with the abilites of a FRIKIN CYBORG!!\n- And even more cool crap to buy!\n\nAll in all, Deepworld is a fun game but you are limited without premium! (Which I highly recommend getting before they eventually raise the price)\nI recommend that you try Deepworld for at least an hour or two.\nThanks for reading this very long review!\nHope you enjoy Deepworld as much as I do.\n\nBTW, It says 22 hours on record, but I have 100+ hours since I've been playing before the game came out on Steam.

Sounds lame, but I love steampunk, and terraria was fun. Anyways, It's KINDA like terraria, sort of how an ice-cream sandwich is kind of like a Klondike bar. Its fun, it seems to have a fairly steep learning curve, has there isn't much of a wiki or guide yet (disappointing really, considering the game has been on IOS since 2012, it really should have a better guide) A lot of the ingame stuff is there but not polished (example, Metal pipe description is: Not a lot is known about this item. and that's pretty much what it says for every item in the game.) It IS free to play, and a lot of the stuff you have to pay for can be obtained free ingame through much grinding / farming / hopelessly searching for the one onyx that happened to spawn.\n\nCons: Although there are LOTS of free worlds to explore and enjoy, They are all explored / looted for the most part. I have not noticed any sort of loot respawning, or item respawning, but then again I havn't been playing that long so perhaps it's there. I payed for a "private world" to explore and build on, and that's probably the easiest cheapest way to get a good feel to the game. Another gripe I have though, is your private world is only one biome. So if you want to get diamonds for example, you need to go to an arctic world, (which is probably depleted of all natural resources) Which leaves you to either trade for it (again, most free worlds are depleted, besides the chests hidden around some of the developed worlds that give every player loot the first time they open it) or to pay for an arctic world (250 crowns is the cheapest, which works out to about 2/3 bucks)\n\nThey are working on their business model, trying to move more and more stuff outside the "paywall" which is really pretty non existent as it is, How they have stuff set up at the moment is more suited to a tablet or Ipad then a PC, Hopefully they start trying to bring in some "mixed biome" worlds. Kind of like terraria, but then again, I'm content to play the game as it is. Crafting in the game is fairly well done, besides the aforementioned lack of tool tips on the items, I'd say the crafting is more diverse than terraria, but not as diverse as Minecraft.\n\nPros: You could easily get 30-40 hours of enjoyment without having to pay a dime. You can play with your friends, you don't have to know how to set up port forwarding, or how to run a listen server or use the dreaded hamachi, as the company host's all the worlds on their servers, to help cut down on hacking / cheating. No wiki, (the sense of wtf do I do next, and trying to figure stuff out is fun for some people you know.) and it's steam punky!\n\noh and it has basic RPG elements. I think they need to refine the level system a bit however, to many stats to pick and choose from. I think it could be cut down to 5 or six. As an example Building / engineering levels are both needed to build / craft certain items. Why not combine them into one skill? who knows. These games are all about the grind, so they probably won't do that\n\n\nanyways sorry for rambling. Play the game, its small, will download in 10 mins <, and it has an uninstall button, just incase you don't like it.","May 20, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't listen to the poor reviews, this game is pretty damn good for a free, still in development game. True you have to spend 5 bucks for your own personal world, but thats a very little money drop for a game that can entertain you for quite a long time. I prefer this game over starbound. However terraria is better, but has been out longer. I highly recommend this game if your a terraria or starbound fan.","May 18, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sounds lame, but I love steampunk, and terraria was fun. Anyways, It's KINDA like terraria, sort of how an ice-cream sandwich is kind of like a Klondike bar. Its fun, it seems to have a fairly steep learning curve, has there isn't much of a wiki or guide yet (disappointing really, considering the game has been on IOS since 2012, it really should have a better guide) A lot of the ingame stuff is there but not polished (example, Metal pipe description is: Not a lot is known about this item. and that's pretty much what it says for every item in the game.) It IS free to play, and a lot of the stuff you have to pay for can be obtained free ingame through much grinding / farming / hopelessly searching for the one onyx that happened to spawn.\n\nCons: Although there are LOTS of free worlds to explore and enjoy, They are all explored / looted for the most part. I have not noticed any sort of loot respawning, or item respawning, but then again I havn't been playing that long so perhaps it's there. I payed for a "private world" to explore and build on, and that's probably the easiest cheapest way to get a good feel to the game. Another gripe I have though, is your private world is only one biome. So if you want to get diamonds for example, you need to go to an arctic world, (which is probably depleted of all natural resources) Which leaves you to either trade for it (again, most free worlds are depleted, besides the chests hidden around some of the developed worlds that give every player loot the first time they open it) or to pay for an arctic world (250 crowns is the cheapest, which works out to about 2/3 bucks)\n\nThey are working on their business model, trying to move more and more stuff outside the "paywall" which is really pretty non existent as it is, How they have stuff set up at the moment is more suited to a tablet or Ipad then a PC, Hopefully they start trying to bring in some "mixed biome" worlds. Kind of like terraria, but then again, I'm content to play the game as it is. Crafting in the game is fairly well done, besides the aforementioned lack of tool tips on the items, I'd say the crafting is more diverse than terraria, but not as diverse as Minecraft.\n\nPros: You could easily get 30-40 hours of enjoyment without having to pay a dime. You can play with your friends, you don't have to know how to set up port forwarding, or how to run a listen server or use the dreaded hamachi, as the company host's all the worlds on their servers, to help cut down on hacking / cheating. No wiki, (the sense of wtf do I do next, and trying to figure stuff out is fun for some people you know.) and it's steam punky!\n\noh and it has basic RPG elements. I think they need to refine the level system a bit however, to many stats to pick and choose from. I think it could be cut down to 5 or six. As an example Building / engineering levels are both needed to build / craft certain items. Why not combine them into one skill? who knows. These games are all about the grind, so they probably won't do that\n\n\nanyways sorry for rambling. Play the game, its small, will download in 10 mins <, and it has an uninstall button, just incase you don't like it.","May 20, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nevetsyelsom/recommended/340810/","nevetsyelsom","Rhambus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nevetsyelsom/","93 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo, a couple things to keep in mind with this game. Number one is it is a free game, and number two it is a free game. These are two things you need to keep in mind when you go into this game, so your expectations should not be very high. Barring that in mind, I initially played this on mobile on my iPhone and seen there was a desktop version of this game. The game is the same on mobile and desktop. In fact, I think you possibly might even have some cross platform play going on. When I loaded the game on my PC and typed in the same name that I used on my iPhone it told me that name is already in use, so I had to create a second character (I didn't register it on my iPhone to my e-mail and create a password... doh).\n\nNow actually playing the game. It's kind of like Terraria in a sense that it is a 2d side scrolling type of game. You start at level one, and collect lots of cool stuff and each time you mine something new you get bonus experience for that, so starting out the ultimate goal is to mine and collect as many unique items as possible and I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nMind you, I haven't gotten very far, but in the 20 minutes or so I spent playing the game I managed to do the following:\n\n-Collect a pick axe.\n-Collect a pistol.\n-Meet up with real people and had conversation.\n-Killed these metal flying things.\n-Killed other cool monsters.\n-Earned experience.\n-Leveled up.\n-Got killed by acid rain.\n-Got killed by hunks of flying metal.\n\nAll in all, a pretty desirable first few minutes. I definitely plan to delve deeper into this game to see what it really offers. Like I said, it's a free game. It's not like we're spending extra money to play this game other than things and services we're already paid for (a working computer wit a keyboard and mouse and working internet connection), so if it turns out not being for you then at least you're not out of any money.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what they add in this game in the future.","January 11","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This makes me Sad. If they fix it, I bet I'll love it.\n\nEdit: For a game in early beta, it is surprisingly unfriendly to new players. I am hoping they find a way to make quests more clear cut with quest beacons and a more detailed skill tree.","July 10, 2015","false","5.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a bad game itself, but gets boring really fast\n\nPros:\n- this game consists out of 1 server which has private instances (private zones, lands), your items can be used and placed cross instances, also instances can be set to PvP or PvE\n- you can trade items with other players (im not sure if there is acctualy interface for this, but i saw players doing trades in chat)\n- developers still care about the game\n- graphics are decent\n- alot of different items, decorative "blocks" and clothes\n\nCons:\n- game gets boring very quickly\n- if you dont want someone else to destroy and take the items/blocks you placed on the instance, you need to buy special item that protects it, oh and also you need to pay with real money in order to get your own instance\n- game could use better quest guiding, it would be really helpful if you had an button on quest that teleports you to the instance where quest objective is located","June 1","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
