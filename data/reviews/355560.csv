An experience so simple (because it's meant to be played in movile devises) that really doesn't make an efford to stand out. Bland narrative, mediocre graphics, tedious bullet-sponge bosses. There isn't even a scoreboard implemented and the game dificulty levels feel the same, it really doesn't have replay value. In the other hand, the price tag is fair.","April 14","false","2.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

There's a controls menu, but instead of telling you to press spacebar to jump and the left mouse button to shoot (which is everything you do in this game) it only tells you to touch.\n\nThe game was fun in the beginning but it got repetetive really quickly. You aim, shoot, sometimes jump over a gap and that's it. Most enemies don't do anything besides flying towards the left-hand side of the screen and often you don't even have to shoot because they wouldn't hit you anyway, but of course you want some points. I never died because of the enemies, I only died because I fell down a gap while shooting at things for points.\n\nThere are some really nice-looking bosses. But seriously, what's the point of them? They sometimes spawn a small enemy or shoot a cannonball at you - you can destory the cannonball with a single hit - and that's it. You can even disable the weapons by shooting at them. The bosses are easier than the rest of the game because they don't throw gaps and enemy swarms at you.\n\nI stopped during stage 4-2 because it was exactly the same thing as in 1-1, except for the multitude of gaps that made my keep dying. Oh, did I mention that minutes of shooting at small enemies isn't challenging or fun and that there are no checkpoints?\n\nSeriously, Trigger Runners has some great ideas and it can be fun for 30 minutes, but that's it.","May 10","false","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story is simple, but driving. The artwork is detailed and colorful. And the music is Megaman X all the way. Let me just say that the soundtrack is excellent and fits the action to a T. The Bosses of the game are fun, well-designed, and look great, another standout part of this humble, little shooter. The controls are simple and intuitive, though they aren't explained well (a note to the dev: you might want to change some of the tutorial's language and explain the controls better). Basically, Space to Jump and Mouse to Shoot. You're character is on auto-run, but this game should keep you on your toes nonetheless, especially later where jumping, shooting, and thinking ahead are paramount. Though it's short in length (not many SNES games are longer than an hour anyways) it has multiple difficulties to keep you starting again and challenging yourself. Thumbs up!","March 6","true","2.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSpookyTruth/recommended/355560/","TheSpookyTruth","HonestGhost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSpookyTruth/","291 products in account","In Trigger Runners you are some sort of cowboy who feels like constantly running (or magically flying) to the right. You can shoot incoming enemies and mines that are in the way and you call also jump over obstacles and holes. You will almost always be on the left side of the screen (no moving on x-axis) except for one chapter of the games. Most bosses are interesting and fun that requires different strategies to defeat. The only complaint i can make for the game is the second to last level which has some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t platforms in the end. It's beatable but really hard.","March 18","true","2.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crushmaster/recommended/355560/","crushmaster","Crushmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crushmaster/","23 products in account","Short, simple, sweet, sentimental. These are the words I would use to sum up Trigger Runners. Done in a retro style, its music and graphics hearkening back to the games of yesteryear, it's a pleasant throwback compared to what we usually see.\n\nGameplay is brief, only about thirty minutes, but it does strike me as reasonably replayable, obviously needed in this format. The story, told via cutscenes, is basic but endearing.\n\nThe biggest flaw I see is that the jumps should take a heart away rather than automatically kill you, as they really seem to be the hardest opponents in the game. Besides that, the gun needs to have a broader angle - you should be able to shoot all around you. Shooting stuff just under you is impossible at present. The only other issue is a part where, with the "barrier" shooting on one level, the little bombs you couldn't blow up blocked your shots, making it nigh impossible to not get hit. It also needs a volume control on the options menu, as well as the ability to pause when a boss is loading.\n\nDoes this have particularly engaging gameplay? No. Most bosses are very easy and lack defining traits. But it is a fun, quaint little game to just kick back with and enjoy. Retro, cheap, and has trading cards? I'll take it. Especially recommended if on sale.","May 13","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
