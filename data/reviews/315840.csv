This a simply fantastic roguelike platformer. To me, it feels like a combination of Spelunky and Super Smash Bros in a fantasy environment.There are four big selling points I'll discuss below. TL;DR: Very fun, fluid movement, challenging skill based combat, incredible variety of organic environmental interactions, and all play styles are equally supported\n\nThe thing that initially drew me to this game is the way the player moves throughout the environment. It's the smoothest system I've ever played with, and traversing the environment is not just a means to an end, it's a pleasure. The only gripe I have with it is there are occasionally environmental hazards you can't protect against, but they're few and far between.\n\nThis game is extremely difficult, make no mistake. In my opinion, not all of the stats are as balanced as they should be; it's very difficult to survive hits from Grumbuls (humanoid enemy, think orc) early on, and getting good will definitely take practice. That said, the combat is very fun. Killing the enemies is always satisfying, and your deaths feel horribly brutal, but never unfair. The magic system is very intuitive and is useful both in and out of combat.\n\nThe third and perhaps biggest selling point for me is the interactions that happen organically in the world. For instance, within the game there are poisonous mushrooms, boulders, pools of water, and fire magic. Let's look at the interactions possible between these four objects. If there are fish in the water, a mushroom can be thrown in to leak poison into the water and weaken the fish. Using fire magic, you can burn up the mushroom and it's poison cloud to safely pass. Using the same magic, you can super heat the boulder, and hit it into an enemy to deal extra damage and potentially set them alight. If you need food in a pinch, you can heat the rock, push it into a pool to boil the water, and then throw in the mushroom, which will cook and become edible.\n\nThe final aspect is that this game supports playing essentially however you want. In many roguelikes, leveling up is based on getting experience from fighting enemies, completing objectives, and so on. In Catacomb Kids, each floor has a leveling orb, which, once picked up, allows the player to level up once. Nothing else matters, as long as you get the orb, you can level up. That means if you want to play by dodging dangerous situations with teleportation magic, no problem. Want to slaughter everyone you come across? Cool. Tackle the levels however you want, because you won't be punished for skipping rooms and opponents like you would be with an EXP system.\n\n\nOverall, it's a very fun and unique experience that I think is absolutely worth $16 in the current state. The developer is very communicative as well, and does weekly Dev streams on Twitch.\n\nEdit: I forgot a HUGE aspect (equal playstyle representation), so I've updated the TL;DR and added the section.","February 20, 2015","true","47.6"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","37","40","0","0"

A foe could find a flask of poison you dropped, try it and die. A monkey could steal a bomb from your backpack, run away and explode around the corner, taking an enemy with him. That kind of thing. The game that REALLY popularized this concept was SPELUNKY and, I'm sorry to say, it has also soured games for me since. Many games following SPELUNKY'S example misunderstood this concept and bludgeoned the player with sheer randomness: BROFORCE is the pinnacle of this sorry development. Not a fan.\n\nAnyways, CATACOMB KIDS gets it right. It gets it 100% right. Here's what happened today. I found a flask and ran into three Grumbuls. Even one of these dudes is a challenge - they fight smartly and chug potions to boost their skills - but three were a death sentence. I panicked and threw the potion at them - and I was really lucky because it turned out to be a potion of flames. One of the Grumbuls went down, another jumped into a lake to douse the flames and was eaten by pirahnas. The third attacked and I threw a ball of slimy goo in his face. He couldn't see me, so I charged, tripped a trap and killed us both while screaming BANZAIII.\n\nCATACOMB KIDS. Never change.

If you mess up just a little bit in this game, it punches you in the gut and kicks you in the teeth. Randomly generated catacombs and randomly made characters make the game infinitely fun. Right now Catacomb Kids is in Early Access, but there is tons on different variants in the game. (Weapons, shields, armor, potions, catacombs layouts, and different types of magic.) Right now there is only two classes with more on the way in future updates. Along with all the single player features, there is a verses mode with eight different arenas, but there is only local co-op and verses an AI. The only bad thing that I can say about this game is that there is no setting for changing the difficulty.\nPros\nVersus mode\nRandomized catacombs\nRandomized playable character\nNo game breaking glitches\nGreat controller support\nNo performance issues\n\n\nCons\nCan be too hard for some\nVery unforgiving\nBarely any display options\n\n\nConclusion\nCatacomb Kids is a brutally fun roguelike game, but it could be too hard for some people. It really needs a difficulty setting.  Catacomb Kids has almost unlimited replay value because it has randomly generated playable characters and catacombs. In the end, Catacomb Kids is 100% worth a buy even in Early Access, and there is more content on its way to make this game worth it even more.\n\nVideo Review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohZhqOxoIm0\n-HiPFiRED\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Completing the tutorial alone saw my death toll rise into high double digits. With over three hours under my belt, I'd say I passed the 100 milestone some time ago.\n\nCatacomb Kids is malicious. I'm not a skilled gamer, but I'm experienced enough to pick up a few universal tricks. This game cares nothing for that; if you go in overconfident, you're going to be humbled. Any bravado will be wiped clean as you're forced to learn the ropes from the very basics. It's difficult not to reference the Souls series, though I'm loathe to as it resembles it in spirit only, but it's still an apt comparison. The game may be a seething, malevolent entity but it's not at all unfair.\n\nYou have every means possible to succeed, even from the very beginning. The variety of classes possess myriad skills and equipment, while leveling offers increased stats and perks. Your melee swings must be timed but they're reliable and spells provide valuable effects from a safe range. Your repertoire is further boosted by agile rolls, boost jumps, throws and Mario-style head-stomps. On top of this, you can find loot all over the dungeon to increase stats, quaff or hurl at unfortunate enemies.\n\nThe danger you face is all-pervasive. You have your usual mobs which so far have been pretty standard aesthetically but their behaviour helps mix the action up. Slimes cling to surfaces and charge when they spot you, bats will pester you from the sky and bands of goblins will gang up but flee when over-powered. Empty rooms are no reason to let your guard down though; there are minute details revealing traps all over the level. Tiny, pixel-thin tripwires will trigger a flood of gas once broken leaving you a couple of seconds to flee before it ignites, setting the room aflame. Pressure plates will send massive weights crashing to the floor and hidden spikes will pierce you if you get close enough. The sheer variety of ways you'll be dispatched is enough to ease the blow when you're once more incinerated, devoured, flattened, stabbed, poisoned, decapitated etc.\n\nThe controls are a little wonky to begin with, at least with keyboard (no mouse necessary). I can see it improving greatly with a gamepad but there are currently some issues the developer plans to address so I've not tried it myself. Of course, I'll update the review once I've had a chance to test it out. There are three main buttons alongside the directional keys but apart from some initial confusion, it works well enough. Later skills, magic and items have appropriate hotkeys; it's all very standard and can be reassigned easily. Once you've adapted to both the control scheme and the mechanics themselves, all the initial issues have resolved.\n\nIt's one of those lovely Early Access experiences that could easily function as a finished product but that's not to say that it wouldn't benefit from the months of work ahead. I've had one instance of graphical glitching but nothing game-breaking, so far at least. There are clear plans to include extra content, with entire menus exhibiting future items and the class system promising more than the inital two types. It certainly could do with a little more of everything but what's here already is a solid product. It's hugely playable in its current version, which at least helps ease the worries that comes with all my EA titles.\n\nI'm a roguelite/roguelike fanatic and the recent resurgence of the genre has been my personal "Golden Age" but I'm not blind to the flaws inherent in the formula. Catacomb Kids might not sidestep all those pitfalls but it works with what it has to be both unique and exciting. As such, this is easily one of my highlights even in its current iteration. It's one of those games I'll be genuinely enthusiastic to see updated so I can find what's been added.\n\nIt's an absolute delight to discover and explore both the environment and the mechanics. After all, a game where you can beat a goblin to death with its own severed arm can only be so bad, right?","February 22, 2015","true","5.4"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","25","27","0","2"

I missed the kickstarter so I have been twiddling my thumbs and biting my nails in anticitpation since the day I first saw gameplay. This game hits all the sweets spots when it comes to my criteria for rouge-likes. Lot's of random/procedural goodness, stats, classes, weapons, enemies, clever traps, etc. There is even a brilliant implimentation of some basic physics built into the game which you must strategize with and use to your advantage. The aspect that really makes Catacomb Kids stand out are the small details that add comlexity to such a simple platformer, for example, I discovered that when you are weilding a magic dagger of electricity, jumping into a pool of water will (for now obvious reasons) f***k you up. Another neat mechanic is your food pallet. Eating certain combinations of enemy corpses will have varrying effects. There's tons of small details like these that just gives the game charm and character.\n\nOverall I'm super excited to see how things will progress and just how active the devs will be. The price is a bit steep but I don't regret buying the game. In it's current state it is 100% playable and the most fun I've had with a game this year.

The controls are excellent IF you use a controller (I'll get into that later), the enemies are really fun to fight, the combat feels pretty nice, and mechanics are what makes this game stand out.\n\nAbout the controls, I say it's excellent with a controller because the keyboard is a little weird, however that's just my opinion. It's not unmanagable though, and if you prefer keyboard, go for it!\n\nThe enemies are really interesting, since the grumbles, which are the main enemies, tend to have a lot of health, however are easily predictable. The slimes, goos, and byats are all easy meals, which is great. When you descend deeper, more types of enemies start to appear, making the game a little more difficult each floor.\n\nThe combat is something that made this game really great. With blocking, rolling, parrying, and dismemberment, you have tons of options. There are a variety of melee weapons, aswell as tomes for those who prefer the mage class. Speaking of tomes, the spells in this game are each unique, and are all good in their own way.\n\nThe mechanics, however, are what makes this game what it is. For example, you can heat up a boulder using a fire spell, then push it into water, pick up a poison mushroom and cook it, ridding the poison and making it safe to eat. You can beat enemies to death, create distractions, or activate traps or switches with JUST a rock! You can melt balls of slime or goo, and consume them for health, or use them as weapons against grumbles by blinding them. You can knock over torches and create a fire, burning enemies in the vicinity. Plus how each kid is randomized with different traits just adds more variety to this game!\n\nThat's the end of this review. Keep in mind, this is my first one, and it may not be clear. If you're interested in difficult, but fun rogue-likes, you'll definitely want to pick this game up. 9/10.","February 21, 2015","true","52.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","0"

It's not uncommon to roll away from an enemy and straight onto some spikes within seconds of starting the game.\n\nBut it's *fun*. It's like Spelunky (you HAVE played Spelunky, haven't you?) except with some traditional action RPG elements like classes, equipment, skills and attributes, and it makes for lots of intriguing possibilities.\n\nMaybe you play as a Wanderer, and you pick up the first Grumbul corpse you find, hold down V to track the Grumbuls. You find the leveling orb and level up Intelligence and choose Trajectory. You aim the first mystery potion you have at a pair of Grumbuls, but it's a potion of might! Fortunately, you also knocked over a sconce and set the floor on fire. One of them makes a beeline for you, so you run like mad. Fortunately, you chose Boots of Gossamer and you don't trip the pressure plate, but the Grumbul does... but not slow enough to get caught by it. It hits you for two health out of your four and sets you on fire. You roll into water to put the fire out and then jump out of the water, but not before a ♥♥♥♥♥♥-off fishana jumps out of the water and takes your final health point.\n\nMaybe you play as a poet, and you chance it with three health. You learn the Double Jump spell (it's a spell in this game!) and find another Magic In Motion spellbook. You hold C to learn that one, too, but click on the middle, which gives you the floating book skill "Otherblink". You get the leveling orb and choose Strength with the skill Heavy Lifting, which lets you lift boulders around, one of the more satisfying ways of killing enemies. You accidentally come across three Grumbuls and hightail it out of there, only to end up in a chamber with lava on the bottom and little room to maneuver. You hit V a few times as your pursuers get closer and it Otherblinks two of them into the lava. You deliberately click a trap and a weight comes smashing down, and you jump up and ride up, but make sure to jump out before you're flattened. You hunt and consume five green goos and overheal for three points but get poisoned by mushroom gas. You hightail it to the exit door, snapping a line which fills the area with flammable gas and lights it. You barely avoid it, but out of curiosity, hang around in the gas caused by another potion that got too got and evaporated. Ugh! Getting zapped! But since it's from a gas, it doesn't last as long. Wow, there's the door. I actually made it to level 2 this time?\n\nPart of the fun is that it's *really* hard to tank this game. You can often win against the occasional Grumbul, but you have to be really strategic if you want to survive. The Grumbuls in later levels are often special - fire-resistant, poison-spewing or extra strong and you might want to really plan out your attack.\n\nEven in the character creation, you have to compromise a great deal. If you're willing to take on negative traits such as clumsiness, bad swimmer, loud, messy eater or hates <weapon type>, you can get more health and magic, but the negatives can really trip you up. Choosing a character with a damaged weapon can do the same, but you had better find a good weapon soon - some damaged starter weapons have difficulty even hurting goos.\n\nSome elements of the game are just a joy. There's something satisfying about shaking a chest open instead of the usual game mechanic of opening the lid. Throwing dead Grumbuls into the water will totally distract the fish. Throwing a dead slime at a Grumbul will splat and cover its eyes for a couple of [precious] seconds. Some lifeforms in the dungeon ♥♥♥♥ each other off and you can use this to your advantage, especially later in the game.\n\nReally looking forward to more development. It takes quite a while between releases, it seems, but they are jam-packed with stuff.\n\nI hope they make a class that's better with traps, even if there are other compromises, because sometimes, I need a break from dying on spikes :)\n\n(Though note: if you choose Defense twice, you can choose a trait that prevents one-shot kills if your health is >75%. Thoughtful :) )","September 6, 2015","true","146.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

I am new and have been killed by a slime 6 times and by falling into darkness that lead to spikes 4 times. Despite the deaths I still want to play, it is that kind of game, the kind that keeps pushing you down but regardless you keep getting back up. The developer Fourbitfriday truely has put his love in this game. So if you like platformers that have RPG elements and are very difficult going in, then this game is for you.

Catacombs Kids expects you to become a real MacGyver, to make the most out of what you got to get through each level. This is where the game truly shines. You can't just steamroll through everything. Sometimes your ingenuity will get you further into the game than pure strenght. Knowing the strenghts and weaknesses of your character, you must assess the situation and sometimes act quick to get through certain areas.  When you do kill enemies or get through the level by using your head, it feels extremely rewarding.I am so glad i bought this and Vagante as both provide a kind of different experience but ultimately both are very fun.","April 5","true","26.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The game gives you a few ways to puss out by "Finding another way" to do things but if you cant handle it, its not the games fault for being hard. That being said the 1 % of my deaths that was BS was when i got teleported into a room with a locked door and i had no key.....actually the key was 1 step behind the teleport trap so yea that was a forced restart death...\n\nThe best thing about this game is that unlike most games like spelunky or vagante, this game is different from each start. Each kid you play as has different weapons, stats, and spells and they'll feel and look different,as an example, there isnt just one axe style or look, each weapon has a variation and each variation still has more randomized stats. This dev knows what a rouglike/lite is supposed to be, BRUTAL. not some game that you get a casual godlike run everytime, but a game that "IF" you do get there, the top...or the bottom in this case, you will feel so damn good, then realise you will never get that far again...

I've been slimed, decapitated, torn to shreds, burnt, poisoned, drowned, poisoned and drowned at the same time, burned to death with my own spells, burned to death after knocking over a torch, burned to death after incenerating a goblin, only to have him start me on fire, and many more.\n\nFastest death so far? 3 seconds after spawning (yep, my fault). Longest lived character? Probably 40 minutes and I was DAMN PROUD!!\n\nHard as it is, it's totally fair. Each of my deaths was due to inexperience, rushing in without looking, panicking and mashing the attack button instead of timing it, mis-timing a jump, or (most frequently) losing a fight due to poor strategy or timing. The battles can be pretty epic, especially once your skill level rises and you can be more creative with your combat choices. Early on you'll be happy you lived at all.\n\nThere's something about the way permadeath is done in this game that makes it fun and very compelling. Part of this might be due to the fact it's only in Alpha 0.0.9 and is extraordinarily fast & responsive, and impressively bug-free for such an early version.\n\nThere are a couple issues I'd like to see fixed. The jump mechanic can be a little wonky. If you jump into a wall with a ladder on it, you'll stick to wherever you hit on the wall as long as (a) there's a ladder there, and (b) you're still pushing left or right on your controller. However, if you roll the controller UP as you reach the wall (a natural movement, since you'll be wanting to go up the moment you get there), then you will not stick to the wall and instead fall back to the ground.\n\nLastly, a wired XBOX controller makes a HUGE difference -- it's much easier than the keyboard for this game -- but the controller bindings don't work for OSX. I ended up buying ControllerMate for OSX and then programming it to match the KBD1 key bindings.  The game doesn't seem to actually recognize the controller; it works because ControllerMate converts each button press to an equivalent key binding.\n\nOverall, if you like dungeon crawlers of any type, this may end up being your favorite.","May 7, 2015","true","28.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Even in the game's current incarnation, the Bully and Poet classes offer an entirely different gameplay experience from the start, and even then, a vividly different experience depending on whether your chosen victi-er, "hero" is, say a clumsy, hammer-wielding powerhouse, a sneaky spear specialist, or a notorously messy eater who apparently realy likes daggers.\n\nIt only gets deeper from there, as progressing through each dungeon will yield such familiar roguelike experiences like identifying randomized potions, looting and eating fallen foes (for health and stat bonuses- there is no "hunger" stat), and learning your choice of spells from whichever magical tomes happen to be lying about. There is no "experience," either, at least in the traditonal sense, and level-ups are gained through locating a special orb that appears once per floor, meaning exploration takes the place of grinding, and combat is largely optional if you can navigate around it (unless you're interested in pilfering your fallen foes' gear and potions). Mind you, certain kids may possess a stat that enables them to gain experience in the use of specific weapons, but this is a circumstancial occurrence.\n\nEach gained level nets you a point in a stat of your choice, followed by a character perk in that stat's as-of-yet invisible tree of skills, confering special abilities like charging your attacks, aiming your throws, and trampling your foes as you sprint through them, so by and large each of your runs will yield a very different character indeed.\n\nIt's almost sad, then, that for all this depth, each individual run is painfully short- and I use the term "painfully" on purpose. Like Spelunky, Catacomb Kids' levels have a single-minded interest in making your hapless dungeonman perish in whatever brutal way it can, sparing no expense in its "hidden deathtraps" budget, as well as pitting you against some fairly ruthless foes. Even mundane accidents like bringing electric-enchanted gear into the water, knocking over a torch and lighting the room ablaze, and choking on a bone while dining on your last meal will bring you down swiftly and mercilessly.\n\nThis is at once Catacomb Kids' primary appeal and its weakness- with no time limit for traversing each floor, players are free to take full advantage of the game's depth in fine-tuning their character's stats, equipment and spells to take their best shot at each obstacle as it arises, but ultimately, all that work can be undone in an instant, and more often than not, it will, over and over again, with individual runs rarely lasting more than a scant few minutes until players have built up some considerable skills (at which point, runs will -occasionally- last more than a scant few minutes).\n\nFor those who prefer a quick and visceral experience that doesn't feel like they're losing too much progress with each death, Catacomb Kids is an outstanding coffee-break game, and for those who want to feel like death is lurking around every corner and every moment of continued existence is a victory in itself, Catacomb Kids is a blissful challenge. However, for those who'd prefer to sit for an hour or two delving as deep into the dungeon as they can, Catacomb Kids' death-after-death-after-death gameplay grows stale rather quickly in its current two-class, one-environment state.\n\nStill, to say this game has potential is an understatement- with an original and genuinely fun character progression system that's simple to comprehend and deep enough to play with at length, combat mechanics that are at once bluntly simple to learn yet intricately challenging to master, and a decidedly different character emerging with every run, Catacomb Kids has the makings of everything we love about Spelunky, The Binding of Isaac, FTL, and other genre-defining romps through random peril into the loving arms of near-certain demise.\n\nIf you've got a short attention span and a death wish, this game's definitely worth a play, and likely only getting better from here.","March 1, 2015","true","17.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

There are NO awful bugs and the game runs pretty well. Furthermore the developers are constantly working on the game and they are very close to the\ncommunity( https://www.reddit.com/r/CatacombKids/new/  ) as you can see here.\n\nThere is enough content to play hundreds of hours or even more and not only because it is a rouge-like. Catacomb Kids has so many possible ways to play. On every new run you can try someting new and so its never get boring. For example there are five different weapon classes(Hammers, Swords, Daggers, Spears, Axes) and each weapon class splits into six differnt typs. And those are just the weapons, there are also magic, armor, skills for each weapon class and so on. This game can be incomprehensibly complex, but this is the point why Catacomb Kids makes so much fun! Though you have to invest some time to understand everything and get into. And yes the game is really hard and you will fail at the beginning however its a part of the game and you will love it.\nThe graphics are functional that is clear.

I don't even know where to begin, so I guess I'll start off with the background. I originally torrented an earlier version of this game. Yes, I'm a terrible person, but keep in mind how hard it can be to judge a game from a trailer and some gameplay footage. (Hint: It's bloody difficult.) I did end up purchasing the game though, because I think that the content that they placed for early access was spot-on.\n\nWhat piqued my curiosity from this game is the depth of this game. There's just so many interactions in this game that you simply would not expect a Triple A developing team would do. While I am comparing apples to oranges here, let's say you're in an Open-world RPG and you kill a goblin. Would you have been able to eat the goblin down to the bone? Would you have been able to eat the bones of the goblin and possibly choke on some while losing health? Simply put, you can in Catacomb Kids. For anyone playing, if you kill the purple slime and throw the ball toward the kombold, then it blinds the enemy allowing you to kill it or let it fall into the traps.\n\nIf you are able to, you can bottle a ball of slime and cook it in an open camp fire and drink the slime. Luckily for me, it was sweet. After going through some floors, you can meet a merchant, which sells a number of different equipment. Of course, on the off-chance that you don't have any money from killing the goblins, you can try and kill the merchant him/herself to acquire some loot. It's just these little things, like throwing a goblin into a lake of piranhas to get across without being gnawed to death, that is really fun.\n\nEach time I enter a new floor, ♥♥♥♥ goes down. Quite literally; there are traps being activated with spikes from a pressure plate, flammable gases dispersed to blow up, mushrooms that extrude nauseous gases, and potions that can either freeze, zap, or burn you to death. Simply put, each floor is pretty unforgiving in its current state of the game, and on the off chance you step on a trap and it teleports you to the bottom of the stage, you better hope that you don't get stepped on like a goomba. Personal experience from that.\n\nGameplay aside, Controls in the game are top-notch, but a bit atypical from what I expected. If you have some experience using a Super Nintendo Emulator like snes9x, then you will get into this game a little bit smoother than others. I wish that the interaction between the ladder and wooden platform would be a little bit smoother, but that's something to wait for later I suppose.\n\nAs for graphics, the game seems to be currently set to a 4:3 aspect ratio resolution, but won't be a huge deal as most of the area will be covered in the shadows. There's no options for AA whatsoever or quality settings, but let me be honest here. You won't need to worry about having 800x600 screen to play this.\n\nMy main gripe at the moment is probably the music. It's not bad in that it doesn't fit, nor is it just poorly composed. I just wish I had an option to turn it off, even moreso it would be nice if the music would be muted when I'm on a different program. Other than that, it's quite soothing.\n\n**\n\nOverall, a lot of people have been saying to wait until the final product comes out. I don't disagree with this statement. I'd hate to be hyped up for a game only to be disappointed and regret investing my money into this team, but this game deserves my money. While I have not been able to get to the end of the game, the content they currently have out right now feels like enough content to be a full-fledged game. Just not for the same price value.\n\nIf anything though, I wish that there would be some more random interactions between heading to the next floor. So far, I've been able to see two different merchants, a kombold encampment, and a narrow dungeon. There would be times between each floor where I get a wad of cash, not knowing when or where I'll spend it. Perhaps a clergyman can heal players, a wizard that can imbue weapons, or a tailor can disguise you as a kombold. They're probably coming in the updates, but here's to hoping that this game will be worth the investment!","March 1, 2015","true","139.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You'd think this would come after finally defeating him -- but I still haven't. I just had my best chance and blew it, and it was truly awesome. I'm not great at platformers at all, but this game is difficult. Yet, unlike, say, Dark Souls (not really a platformer -- I know, shhhh), it always feels fair. Not at first, no. At first it's going to feel like you're bouncing down a flight of stairs, and once he adds stairs you probably will. But eventually you'll understand the various complexities of what makes a good build and how to navigate the world without dying. How to navigate quickly, eventually. And how to find, after hours and hours, the thing that's truly exciting about this game. That shot of adrenaline.\n\nI might play a 20 minute session or two hours. For instance, I spent more time writing this than I did on the run that inspired me to write this. But it's not a casual game in the slightest. It's unforgiving.\n\nI can't wait to see what classes he adds next and what other weird systems he'll introduce. I haven't felt that way about an EA game in a while. Most of the time I just sit tight and hope for the best. In this case, I check daily to see if the new build is out, because I know there's a new class in it (Wanderer).\n\nUse a controller.\n\nI hope it gets optimized as it goes, since it starts to chug a bit on my Mac around Floor 3.

Mix of Spelunky and Darks Souls kind of fits but with even infinitely more weird stuff that happens. It's always the bunch of things that interact in ways you had never thought of making something awesome, just so you can abuse the hell out of it next afterwards.\n\nYou can  and really should experiment. If only your life probably will end quickly otherwhise. And with time you learn tricks that help you tremendously - or kill you because you make some incredibly dumb mistake. Maybe lay a  stone on the pressure plate to trigger the giant weight and go through before it is back up? Maybe stop it by freezing the whole thing in place? Or just use some slime to stick it to the ground? Or maybe you should cut of the rope and throw it around with that one strength boon? Or just let enemies run into it and laugh? Or use it to craft items? Or put bouncy paste under it to throw enemies into the air just before they become pancakes with no chance of escape?

A trait like “Likes Swords” will give your kid a skill bonus, while a trait like “clumsy” will make them particularly loud when landing. You level up by picking up glowing orbs, or gain magical spells by finding books in the dungeon. It’s fairly easy to get into the rhythm of bounding around and fighting off the denizens of the catacombs.\n\nYou should expect to DIE without warning. This game is incredibly difficult, and it doesn’t care how or when you die. You will enter a level and suddenly you’ve been slain by an orc, or by drinking a potion that happens to burn you alive. Once that occurs, it’s back to square one with a new kid and on to penetrating a new dungeon.\n\nCatacomb kids is definitely not for the squeamish or the impatient. You have to take your take to assure yourself safe passage through the catacombs, and keep your guard up against the terrifying A.I. of the monsters. I’m not going to say the game gets easier when you get higher levels, or gear, because I’ve never had the pleasure of becoming a powerhouse. Catacomb Kids takes pleasure in destroying your hopes and dreams, and more than likely it was your own damn fault.\n\nThis game uses objects in a way that not many others have. You can eat the corpses of the fallen, or throw their goo against a wall to create a sticky trap. You can combine meals to increase your stats, use potions as bombs, and so much more. There is a lot to the system if you live long enough to bask in its glory.\n\nChanges we want/Additions\n\nAttribute deficiencies – I don’t mind the random skills that give the player some negative factors, but the negatives in stat points is unnecessary. The game is already brutally hard to the point that it seems like an annoyance to lose stat points. Especially when you can enter a catacomb and instantly die from the swipe of an enemy after finding a perfect stat combination for your character.\n\nScenery - Level design is fine for a Rogue Lite, but the levels become a cluster of cobbled rock too quickly. I’d like to see more of a varied look to the areas. If for nothing more than adding a bit more ambience to my continuous deaths.\nPlatforming – Platforming is a bit too floaty and will lead to tons of accidental deaths. I wish it was more traditional to the 2D spirit of Super Mario and other platformers.\n\nEnemy Difficulty – When you’re starting out the enemies are much too powerful. You’ll face off against monsters who can take 5 stabs from your weapon, and instantly kill you in one hit. It’s a little too frustrating after dying multiple times in a session, and finally gaining victory and receiving terrible drops.\n\nGearing up – Since Orcs don’t mess around and can kill you in one hit at the start of the game. The reward for defeating them is usually an awful piece of gear. Since these hard nose battles can end with them simply winning through a battle of attrition, defeating them should feel more rewarding to the player. Mostly because they are pretty adept at breaking through your attacks, and ignoring any top of roll moves you attempt.\n\nCooperative play – This title features a competitive mode which is cool and all, but I’d love to tackle the dangerous catacombs with a pal. Make it happen!\n\nEarly Access Verdict\n\nAs of Early Access release Catacomb Kids is a brutally hard game that often focuses too hard on frustrating the player. It has a lot going for it in the way of a great item system and interesting combat. The A.I. is murderously powerful and unrelenting, the jumps are a little imprecise, and slaying the enemies isn’t as rewarding as it could be.\nAs of now the game is loads of fun, but feels as if determination isn’t enough to progress through the catacombs. I’d prefer better rewards and investment for tackling death at every corner. It needs a little less Dark Souls and slightly more Dungeon of the Endless at the moment. Let’s see how it shapes up in the next couple of patches!\n","February 25, 2015","true","16.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

As you explore, your map will slowly flesh itself out with an almost intense fog-of-war shrouding your playing field which managed to kill me good with traps just out of sight.  Even though I know they are randomly generated levels, they feel designed with cruel intentions.  Which is to say, this game is HARD.  Unmercifully hard.  And it's permadeath.\n\nBut the game is about experimenting.  Not only do you have to pick a class with specfic attributes, you're given a random roster of characters to choose from (within that class) that have a random assortment of starting equipment and attributes.\n\nAnd even though it's only version 0.0.6 game is really tight.  Animations are excellent (in my Let's Play, I land on a ledge and my character had to catch his balance which felt perfect for the situation because there were a set of spikes right below me) as well as cause and effect.  Find a potion and drink it? Now you have an empty glass bottle.  You could throw it at an enemy or drop it on a trap.\n\nYou can carefully open doors so that you may re-close them, or you could bust them open and then destroy them.\n\nThere are only two classes to choose from right now with another four to be released at a later date.\n\nI think my only real complaint is that it's local co-op and not online co-op.","February 20, 2015","true","0.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The animations are excellent, the combat is great and the difficulty will make you wanna stab yourself.\n\nI particularly enjoy the interactions between objects and enemies. It is reminiscent of games like Spelunky (which I love). There is also a nice amount of detail like Grumbuls hunting smaller creatures and being able to knock over torches in the background to set things on fire.\n\nThe mechanics are fantastic and things like climbing and jumping feel responsive and fluid. Combat is nice and entertaining with things like shield blocking, grappling and using the environment to your advantage. Everything "feels" just right and it's a joy to jump and run and stab and so on and so forth.\n\nSo far it is a bit lacking in content though. Only one "area", 3 classes and a handful of enemies are present. So if you buy this game, know that this is but a little piece of the final product. While I look forward to more stuff in future updates this game is very neat and a great little experience to be had.\n\n","February 20","true","25.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Hard as hell. Permadeath dungeon crawler platforming game with many ways to approach situations and tons of ways to die. You will die a lot, but it makes succeeding that much more rewarding.\n\nYou begin by selecting one of three (at the moment, only three) classes and then you pick a character from a randomly selected group of individuals, each with their own unique abilites, items and weaknesses. Once you enter the catacombs you are free to do whatever you like. You can go back through the door you just entered right from the start or you can rush the door to the next floor. However the smart way to play would be to explore the area and grab the "orb of leveling" which can be found on each floor as that is the only way to level your character.\n\nYou can interact with just about everything in the environment, for example: you can pick up a rock and sneak up on an orc standing near a torch, throw the rock at the torch, knocking it over and setting the orc up in flames. You can throw a potion at an enemy or even in a fire near an enemy causing the potion to break and fill the area with whatever effect it holds. In one particular game I alerted an orc enemy by making too much noise. He ran over to me and severed one of my arms. I defeated him and then was able to pick up my severed arm and eat it. I soon after walked into a trap which triggered a burst of flames that killed me.\n\nThe game takes a great deal of patience and a decent amount of skill, or maybe rather familiarity with the game itself in order to progress through the catacombs. After 4 hours of playing I have yet to see the 3rd floor, although I can't play for more than an hour at a time without taking a break, but that's just me. If there was any reason not to play this game it would be because it is too hard.

Yet despite it's ruthlessness I feel an odd mix of total satasifaction and soul-crushing depression every time I play it. CK is increadibly in depth and leaves much to be discovered on your own.

It's something that sets them apart from games like Rogue Legacy, that have the kind of difficulty roguelike fans look for, and an affectation of 'nintendo hard' platformers that hit people right in the nostalgia, but have no real substance behind them.\n\nI could tell right away that the developers of Catacomb Kids were not only familiar with more venerable roguelikes, but that they had a keen insight into what makes them so captivating. I often find myself thinking my way around a problem much like I would in Nethack or DCSS, where I'd tally my resources and make calculated decisions that would often fail spectacularly. My poor catacomb kid would die, but with every death I learn a little more about the game's logic.\n\nThis level of complex entity interaction is something I expect from any game calling itself a roguelike (much more so than, say, the overzealous expectation of an ASCII interface), even to an extent that I believe it's a cornerstone of the genre.\n\nCatacomb Kids does not claim an indulgence of weapon types, monsters, or classes for the player. Instead, they have created a meaningful and treacherous arena for players who want a game that demands that they think tactically and, most importantly, learn from their mistakes.","August 26, 2015","true","24.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

This type of game has a lot more focus of RPG things like leveling up, finding equipment and spells ect.\n\nIts good so far, playable and fun.

The procedurally generated dungeons and the statistically random generated characters add endless variety and unique situations.\n\nBrutal and unforgiving. Expect quick deaths if you do not have appropriate reaction speeds; the random generator can create incredibly difficult to traverse trap rooms. One nice touch right from the beginning is the ability to “re-roll” by entering the exit from the previous floor.\n\nThere are too many gameplay elements to explain, but the attention to detail in the weapon-type combat, spell-type combat, and ailments is very refined and filled with variety, even at an Alpha stage. The level up upgrades (Rainbow Orb); if you survive long enough to make it to these coveted items, they will allow you to use attribute upgrades like parrying, free-running, reduced damaged from traps, plus many more expanded as you obtain more orbs.\n\nI am very excited to see the game develop further, to see more classes, and see how refined the gameplay between them comes. To be honest, the two class system works for me currently, but having more, it would be interesting to see. I for one, would love to see a miner-like character.","March 19, 2015","true","65.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Whether it's pure action or tactical gameplay, Catacomb Kids is here to deliver it well. As you venture forth through multiple procedurally generated levels, you'll find yourself facing the brutal challenges of traps, relentless enemies, poisonous mushrooms, and.. fire ( surprisingly my worst enemy in this game ). You will spend your time exploring and scavenging for better equipment to make your character stronger. And... if you choose to.. you can eat stuff to gain beneficial stats for your character. See that annoying bat fluttering about above your head? You can eat that. See that weird gooey slime making its way across the ceiling? You can eat that. See that ugly goblin that tried to kill you a few seconds ago that's also lying on the ground right now because you decapitated his head? You can eat that. Oh, what's that? You lost your leg? Well, you can ♥♥♥♥in eat it OR you can smolder it with a torch and attach it back on as sort of a peg leg. You're a monster in this game if you choose to be, and I love it.\n\nThe enjoyment I get from playing this game is the interactive elements of the environment around you. This means that there are multiple ways of dealing with certain situations. In example, if you see an angry goblin rushing at you with a weapon at hand, what would be your first instinct? You have options. Fight him head-on. Run away and lure him into a trap. Pounce him and continously bash his head in with a rock or any other small, portable object. Pick him up, throw him into a pool of piranhas and watch him get shred to pieces. Goomba stomp him. Cast a spell that can either manipulate the situation to give you a higher advantage or completely obliterate him. Dip your weapon in a fire potion and burn him to death with your mighty weapon blows of destruction. Throw a slimeball in his face to blind him, then stand back as he swings his weapon around at nothing like an idiot ( Then kill him, of course ). This is just ONE of many situations that can occur. There are endless possiblities.\n\nI can't even imagine what this game has to offer at full release. It already shows so much promise in its current state as an early access game.\n\nIs it worth the $16? For me, personally, YES. I'm having a blast with this game. If you're unsure about the early access content, by all means, wait for a sale.\n\nWho am I kidding... just buy the game.

At this stage in the game's development the quality of the platforming alone is enough to warrant the $15 for me, but should you need more convincing, read on by all means!\n\nThe movement is tight and responsive, such that very few things feel unfair once you've mastered the controls (one exception is the "ledge-grab" mechanic which is a tad unpredictable at times, causing you to stick between two "climbable" edges--say a ladder on one side and a ledge on the other--when trying to make a speedy escape from a gas trap or otherwise, but prior knowledge makes this avoidable, if still a bit trying). This transparency and responsiveness is paramount to (at least my) enjoyment of the game given the its punishing nature. At this point in development there are two "finished" classes (still subject to change, of course) and a third is scheduled to be released with an update in the near future.\n\nDespite the protracted development schedule it becomes increasingly clear with each "monthly" update that the game is either a labor of love--or an obsession (but hey, what's the difference, amirite?!)--for the developers. This comes through in spades when you've played enough to consistently get beyond the first floor or so. Another nice thing is the community and the ways that the developers chose to allow access and input therein. Between reddit, irc, and weekly development streams, the team has done a great job meting out content without giving too much away or over promising. Overall I'm as excited now as I was when I supported the Kickstarter a year ago and that in itself is an achievement for the dev team. There is great momentum and it feels as if the nice things about this game are only improving throughout the cycle.\n\nI will add more to this as features and content are added, but I would like to say publicly that the thing I am MOST looking forward to is couch co-op. The amount of strategy, thought, and awareness required for success in a single player run is high, but the reward is commensurate in my estimation. I can only imagine and I fully expect that co-op play will similarly increase the stakes as well as the payoff.","June 17, 2015","true","450.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

That being said, I have yet to hear the devs say anything thus far about being a Dark Souls-esque game, I see this as being the closest thing though.\n\nAfter selecting a class (there are only three out of the six so far) you select a randomized child with different traits and loadouts much like Rouge Legacy. You then journey downward into the depths of the Catacombs below murdering creatures, disarming enemies and severing their limbs, roll jumping to ledges, and finding the level orb on each floor (which is optional but gives amazing new skills) then finding the next door downward.\n\nIn my opinon, this game is incredibly fun and it reminds me of when I was a kid and went exploring with my firends around the neighborhood with sticks. I highly recommend this game to Rouge-Like fans nd I'm very excited to see what else these devs have in store in the future!","January 11","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The later scenario happens far, FAR more often.\n\nThe game itself still contains a lot of errors - occarional crashes, rooms you can't escape from, one time I even fell off the map. Still, Alpha. Regardless of any masochistic fears I may have of the game getting easier, I am VERY interested in seeing how the game progresses, and would definately recommend it even in it's present state.","March 10, 2015","true","83.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You would be suprised at the things you discover by accident after only many hours of gameplay. That said, the randomly generated platforming element of this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awful. I can say, beyond a doubt, that its intended difficulty (high) is made impossible in some areas by poor scripting. You will occasionaly find yourself entering a level, walled in and unable to progress without leaving through the door you came through. Moreoften, you will complete some exceptional bit of platforming only to land in a group of enemies.

The ability to start and play the game different every run through makes it get old incredibly slowly, and the high difficulty means that its always challenging. Text really isn't a great way to describe all the nuances and mechanics in the game, and it's actually more fun to figure them out for yourself. With all these great things in mind there are two major complaints I have:\n1. It's Early Access\nEarly Access games are always risky, and are often buggy. In this case there are a great many parts of the game that just straight up aren't implemented yet. It's still incredibly fun, but once you level your stats to a certain point, the unique bonuses that are supposed to come with them just aren't implemented yet. In addition to this I've run across massive frame drops on lower floors(6+), as well as random crashes.  If you are interested in getting involced in the dev process though, this is the only time to buy. If you think you can wait however, by all means wait for the full release.\n\n2. The Controls\nThis isnt actually a problem I have with the game, but lots of people are going to hate the controls. They are actually very responsive, but particularly starting out they feel very odd, and making tricky platforming jumps can be nigh on impossible until you figure it out.\n\nOverall, I would definitely reccomend the game, although I might suggest waiting until release, or until some more patches come out.","March 22, 2015","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controls aren't fluid, they feel unnatural, as if the buttons were assigned at random. Changing them doesn't help. The Game punishes you for expirimentation, killing you for EVERYTHING you do. If there weren't so many instant death traps it I'd be more willing to explore (never drink a potion, you'll burst into flames and die half of the time). You're better off just running for the exit and ignoring everything on the level. Certain enemies like bats have an absurdly large amount of health. There's no quickrestart option, so you're stuck returning to the main menu and rechoosing your character. If you could replay the last dead character through a quick restart the game would be way less annoying. Killing enemies is like trying to thread a needle with a twizler while drunk. The autograb function makes it near impossible to go where you want in the heat of the terrible fighting mechanics, you'll be stuck levitating slowly while your character tries to move (can't even tell you how often I've been crushed between the cieling and a ball and chain trap because the game thought I was trying to climb it). The whole thing just feels like an unfinished mess.

Now in the world of Steam indie gaming, $20 for a pixel art early access game is quite a bit; considering most things are around the $15 mark. Before you come ♥♥♥♥♥ing how it’s $16, maybe your dumb American ♥♥♥ should consider that there are more currencies in the world than just USD, in my case, CAD. So being $20 says right off the bat that you’re better than the others, and there is some superiority with your product. Let’s just say I didn’t get my return. I could have bought like four copies of Sakura Spirit, but I got this.\n\nEarly access rantI ♥♥♥♥ing hate early access in 90% of cases and I think it’s a huge cop out. This game is a prime example. When a game is early access, there is usually three ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t things the devs pull.\n“It’s early access so you can’t judge it.” ♥♥♥♥ off. I paid $20 for the game, I expect $20 worth of quality and content; regardless of what it it.\nUpdates are far in between/long dev cycle. Updates come once a month in this game, and every 4 months it takes longer. Just look at the pinned threads.\nUsing early access as an excuse for incompetence. I get that there will be some bugs, in fact, minor bugs are the only thing early access games get leeway for in my books, but it’s not an excuse for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bugs and horribly imbalanced ♥♥♥♥.Let’s go over that in a little more detail. The game is currently version 0.0.13. Assuming the order is major minor  then patch, that means Catacomb Kids is 1.3% done. Yes, after a year in development, we’re looking at version 0.0.13. By my calculations and assuming the current pace is kept up, that means that the devs will be dead before they finish the game. What the ♥♥♥♥. At 1.3% done, I want updates daily -- not monthly. But, I also believe that 1.3% is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Yes, there is only 6 levels (which is ♥♥♥♥ing ludicrous for a $20 game), but there isn’t enough room to add 100 times more content. One thing that also pisses me off is the debug options. There is a class who’s special ability is that they can instantly identify all the walls around them without seeing them. Kind of cool, but worth null considering that you can hit F2 and instantly have a complete debug map showing all enemies, traps, walls, and collisions. Hit F3 if you want the whole level’s map.\n\nReally, unless the game has a one-two man team with no access to testers there is no reason for early access. That’s why I say 90% of the time, because games like Project Explore and Boring Man earned the rights to early access -- this game is using it as a cop out.\n\nWhat is decent?You probably had a nerdgasm looking at the game if you are a fan of roguelikes. The graphics are better than watching Kim Kardashian get ♥♥♥♥ all over in the media, or Tom Morello ♥♥♥♥ all over the media. The graphics are top notch, no doubt about it. The sound is alright too, nothing to write home about though. You can play the pacifist way and run the levels with nothing on pretending you Alzheimer’s is acting up and hope no one decides they want to play hop scotch on your ribs, but that never really ends well. You could also decide to just level up the strength things and play bowling with slimes and use monsters as pins, but you also die from that. I guess you could try to sword fight, but the enemies usually outnumber and outgun you like Germany to Italy in WWII. So how do you win? I clearly have a bad case of trash, but I got like Bill Gates amounts of money in Spelunky and that game is hard as ♥♥♥♥. Anyway, other than that, you can be Bill Nye, as in find random ♥♥♥ potions and chuck them at innocent bats in which case they either spontaneously combust, freeze to death, or live -- because the game refuses to tell you what potions do. They give hints, and there is always -- no matter what, a 50/50 chance you’ll get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by science or lengthen your road to the grave.Weather or not that is cool depends on who you talk to, I say niet. For you uncultured American swine, that is “no” in Russian.\n\nMagic is kinda cool\n\nWhat is trash?First and foremost, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths. I’ll be minding my own business in a pacifist run waltzing down a corridor, only to have my stroll interrupted by a surprise lobotomy. This game’s levels are squishier than a a hospital elevator with two beds in it and a six-person family. This isn’t inherently a bad thing, I never had a problem with that ♥♥♥♥ in Splinter Cell, but this game makes design decisions thinking it has more space than the resolution of a Ti-82. There has been more than one occasion where I pulled a Wile E. Coyote and fell into a pit of spikes. I’m not saying you can’t have parkour-esque situations in platformers -- that’s perfectly okay; what I am saying is that you can’t have parkour where if you fail, you instantly die. While we’re on the subject, the enemies seem to be wearing Nokias or something because they seem to often not die from landing on spikes, I am yet to receive this blessing.\n\nThere are three classes in Catacomb Kids: Wanderer, Bully, and Poet. There will apparently be three more. (At version 0.0.13, I expect 30 more.) They are all kind of unique, I wouldn’t label any of them but bully “generic.” They each of one special skill. Bully can taunt enemies (Which is basically say something that only fuccboi freshman would.), Poet can apparently use spellbooks as weapons (Which I am yet to figure out how it works.), and Wanderer can get an outline of the surrounding area. If you have more braincells than chromosomes, you probably thought that Wanderer is the coolest one -- and you’re right. But the whole point of Wanderer, to see ♥♥♥♥, is completely nullified by the fact that you can hit F2 and turn on the debug room map. It shows you everything around you, better than the ability, and it works with all classes. I pointed this out to the developer, and he basically said “We won’t remove it.” That means bully is the only class worth playing since Poet’s ability doesn’t work, and Wanderers ability is pointless considering you can just hit F2 instead.\n\nShould you buy the game?Well, you being the arrogant ♥♥♥ you are (I know you.), will definitely buy the game regardless of my review. I want to like this game, but when we take into the account that this game will never crawl out of early acc--\n\nwait\n\nno\n\nI came up with quite the idea. Valve, take note. There should be a rule that every early access game has two years tops, and if the game isn’t done after two years, then it gets pulled off Steam and can’t be put back up until it has been QA tested by a Valve employee and is complete. There would be ways to apply for longer, for the games and devs that aren’t a total joke. Let’s go over quickly what type of game deserves to be in Early Access.\nHas weekly/every other week updates\nOR, as an alternative, updates are major updates every month. (Like 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 kind of thing.)\nDeveloper is very active on the community and responds to feedback\nDoesn’t make death threats to Gabe NLet’s compare Catacomb Kids. Each update in Catacomb Kids (Recently) has gone up by 0.0.01 each time; save for maybe a quick hotpatch for major issues. Catacomb Kids went from 0.0.1 to 0.0.11 from August 2 to September 18. That took about a month and a half. Then the next set of patches were 18 Sep to 22 Nov. Then 22 Nov to 3 of January. So it doesn’t qualify for the first or second one, arguably the third, and does qualify the fourth.\n\nThis game hasn’t earned the rights to early access, regardless your money.","January 18","false","7.8"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","2","13","0","0"

Yes, I realize it's in alpha. That's probably why - it has some rough edges it needs polishing. The devs also realize that by making it early access they are making it available for review. This game does a lot of things really well, and a few things poorly, mostly in design choices of game rules. Let's start with the general discription:\n\nIf you liked Spelunky, and like traditional roguelikes, you'll love this game, even for how frustratingly hard it is. I could almost describe Spelunky as easier than Catacomb Kids (CK). CK takes traditional fantasy elements and a fun yet dark aesthetic and imerses you in a really compelling world where gear, character stats and unidentified potions control the way you play the game. At it's current price, it's a great value. I've already dumped hours into this game.\n\nPROS:\n-Tight, mostly responsive controls make this game a joy to play on a gamepad.\n-Fantastic sound and good music.\n-Megapixel GFX do not seem trite, and are rather well done for a aesthetic that's easy to love.\n-Combat is varied, strategy is deep, builds are different enough to make it interesting.\n-Monsters have fairly solid AI and will force different approaches to each one.\n-Unique character generation means you can continually roll bunches of 6 Kids with different gear and builds until you pick your favorite or try something new.\n-The environment plays a lot into your strategy. Why take on a Grumbel face to face, when you can throw a rock and knock over the torch right next to him?\n\nCONS:\n-Completely useless characters are rolled fairly often. No one is ever going to play a Kid with 2 HP.\n-Humanoid monsters are faster, tougher, more accurate and better at climbing than you are. It's almost like fighting the Spelunky shopkeeper five times on every floor.\n-Once in a while you'll find yourself in places in the dungeon you can't get out of. Probably just an alpha issue.\n-As far as I can tell, there's only one tileset.\n\nThat being said, it's a good game and will probably keep getting better with each update.\n\n","February 27, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll be running, fighting, jumping, gathering, and ultimately, dieing. Every hit you take brings you closer to death, hell sometimes you may only get hit once. You must be cautious, and use the enviroment to your advantage.\n\nThe catacombs are riddled with traps, everywhere. You'll die from those, lakes of fire, bats, blobs, goblins, mummys, a boulder...thing. Youll get spells that are awesome visually, then you use them and realize the spells themselves have actual physics and set yourself onfire, which will make you run around, into the spike pit below, dead. You will see a switch to an anchor trap, and try to make an enemy get crushed by it, only to have the enemy laugh and roll behind you, hit you, knock you back into the landing area, and get crushed.\n\nThe best part? You wont get angry, you'll just kind of laugh. Atleast I do, my deaths are either from innattentiveness (spellcheck?), or from my plans going horribly wrong because of poor execution.\n\nIf I could record from my crappy pc Id show you some awesome stuff, but i cant, because of my crappy pc. Speaking of which, if you own a crappy pc, you should pick up this game, its one of the few that runs awesome, is fast paced, and has you on edge the whole time. Its only draw back? Not multiplayer, which to me, i'd love to see, but I can also understand why it isnt, it would be a race to find the level orb.\n\n10/10, and there's even more to come.

Blocking, rolling, charging, and slashing at the legs are all mechanics you WILL need to make use of if you want to survive. The combat, however, is not where the game shines. The mechanics in this game are amazing and support multiple playstyles.

The combat keeps the game fresh and constantly presents new decisions and oppurtunities for the player. The mix of strategy and skill needed to desend to the dungeons depths successfully feels almost perfect to me, especially for the style of the game. It is very interesting, even with only two available classes at the moment, how each character you play as feels unique. There are many fun playstyles and the growth and progresion of your character is truly rewarding.  Even as an early acess game, it is something that you can get hours of enjoyment from.

It's easily one of the best early access games I've ever played. It has this level of polish (even with all the seemingly random deaths and explosions) that I've never really seen before in these types of roguelike games. Instinctively, I threw a potato that I'd found on a campfire and waited for a moment. It cooked and became a hot potato, so I picked it up and put it in my pocket to let it cool. Later on I realized I was losing health. My first death was due to me holding on to a red hot tater. To me, that is beautiful.\n\nYou are going to die, a lot. And it's going to be frustrating. I haven't really gotten past the first boss, and every time I think I'm having such a good run, it ends with me getting ganked by a bunch of Grumbuls or falling into a pool of water and being eaten by those stupid piranhas, or being forced to try and jump my way through those rooms filled with spikes and drop-down crushing traps. I get so mad... And then I start over. And then I die again, so I start over. Even with how frustrating it is, I keep coming back to see how far I can get. I really like that sort of replayability in games like this.\n\nI'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys torturing themselves, or anyone who played Spelunky or any of those other roguelike platformers.

(1 in-wall spawn, 1 missing leveling orb, and 1 instance of being able to leave the map)\n-Takes a LONG time to get stale, despite the fairly low number of variables implemented so far.\n-Incentive to experiment and explore. There's nothing physically preventing you from running to the next door, but you're going to want to get the leveling orb, and in the latter levels sometimes even re-generate a map to potentially get better equipment, because CK's bosses are merciless.\n\n-Cons-\n-Aside from the few issues with procedural generation, the only cons I can think of are a product of it being accessable early. The retro graphics and rogue-like platformer gameplay may not be everyone's cup of tea, but those are subjective.\n\n\nIf this were the complete package I'd give this a 7/10.

Though development has been understandably slow, it has been a fun, rewarding, engrossing game every step of the way, each new build.\n\nCatacomb Kids occupies an area in the platforming roguelike spectrum somewhere between the immediacy of Spelunky and the resource-management-heavy Vagante. You have class skills, ability points, affinities and faults. You can carry only what you can wear, plus two exta handheld items. You can learn spells and new skills as you progress, and there are quite a few interesting builds. Any time I force myself to use a skill or spell I'd previously written off as useless I find a way to make it work, opening up an interesting new playstyle potential.\n\nClose combat is quite deep, and the AI devious. You have to manage action warmups and cooldowns for a variety of weapons, dodge rolls with invulnerable frames, and weapon clashes. That's before magic, thrown items, or extra abilities that let you parry, disarm, grapple, or even pick up and throw enemies.\n\nCatacomb Kids also boasts incredible emergent gameplay, featuring some fascinating and sometimes unexpected interactions. Most items, enemies, and materials can be heated, frozen, wet, crushed, gooped, crushed, dismembered, and who knows what else. Enemy groups also don't get along with each other, leading you to stumble into an existing squabble between Byats and Grumbuls, or losing the aggro of a Skeleton when you knock a few otherwise complacent green slimes at it.\n\nThis game is worth it. It's deep, engrossing, and you'll learn more every time you play it. But it's HARD. These kind of games are my bread and butter and I rarely see the fourth or fifth floors.","March 27","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a 'Kid' who can jump, climb, slash, smash and stomp their way towards the end of each level, among other things. Through the use of new skills and equipment, your 'Kid' progresses through each run.\n\nEven in early access this game is smooth and is chock full of features, with many more to come and I've come across very few bugs with currently 13 hours of playtime (with many more guarenteed).\n\nSo far I would very easily recommend this to anyone who is interested in other games in the rogue-lite genre (and even if you aren't you'd probably love it).","March 25","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And even then I end up dying within the first few seconds anyways, so back to the main menu it is for me! I reaaaaally hope you guys update this so i can have the full experience of a rougue like 2d platformer like this one. So if you are looking at this comment and you are thinking catacomb kids looks like an amazing game, IT IS. It's just that there is no character customization option, and you gotta keep picking from randomized characters and that is my one and ONLY problem. plzz fix this soooon","June 4, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(1 in-wall spawn, 1 missing leveling orb, and 1 instance of being able to leave the map)\n-Takes a LONG time to get stale, despite the fairly low number of variables implemented so far.\n-Incentive to experiment and explore. There's nothing physically preventing you from running to the next door, but you're going to want to get the leveling orb, and in the latter levels sometimes even re-generate a map to potentially get better equipment, because CK's bosses are merciless.\n\n-Cons-\n-Aside from the few issues with procedural generation, the only cons I can think of are a product of it being accessable early. The retro graphics and rogue-like platformer gameplay may not be everyone's cup of tea, but those are subjective.\n\n\nIf this were the complete package I'd give this a 7/10. I already got my money's worth in time killed, but the thing is it's still a work in progress at this point, and by golly if that doesn't speak volumes I don't know what does. I feel like when it's a complete package, It might honestly be my favorite indie game ever.

It's easily one of the best early access games I've ever played. It has this level of polish (even with all the seemingly random deaths and explosions) that I've never really seen before in these types of roguelike games. Instinctively, I threw a potato that I'd found on a campfire and waited for a moment. It cooked and became a hot potato, so I picked it up and put it in my pocket to let it cool. Later on I realized I was losing health. My first death was due to me holding on to a red hot tater. To me, that is beautiful.\n\nYou are going to die, a lot. And it's going to be frustrating. I haven't really gotten past the first boss, and every time I think I'm having such a good run, it ends with me getting ganked by a bunch of Grumbuls or falling into a pool of water and being eaten by those stupid piranhas, or being forced to try and jump my way through those rooms filled with spikes and drop-down crushing traps. I get so mad... And then I start over. And then I die again, so I start over. Even with how frustrating it is, I keep coming back to see how far I can get. I really like that sort of replayability in games like this.\n\nI'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys torturing themselves, or anyone who played Spelunky or any of those other roguelike platformers. In the meantime, I'm gonna go die some more.","July 4, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has taken me over 20 hours simply to reach the current "boss" and I have enjoyed the entire process. Stats impact the game heavily and decision making is crucial. It takes some time to get used to the different effects of food, potions,  and weapons, but the fluid controls and movement make the game easy to get into.\n\nThe developer is publicly active and wants to help fix any issues/bugs. They promote content creation and are always able to answer any questions about the game and its production. Even with less than half of the content currently out, the game is easily worth the money and I would recommend it to all my friends.","August 10, 2015","true","28.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
