This game builds on the same premise, with the building of cities in Rome while raising armies to attack and defend.  Like Pharoah, it is a blend of city-building simulation and RTS except there is a stronger implementation of the RTS elements here.\n\nVisually, the game looks pretty good.  Not the best graphics by modern standards, but bounds above the old Impressions games.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is that it's a lot to learn and take in very quickly.  There are some tutorials for that, though.  It's not the steepest learning curve, it's nothing compared to some of the Paradox games, but it is a game that requires you take the time to learn it.","December 16, 2013","true","7.8"," 69 of 74 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","69","74","2","2"

This is a city building,not RTS.\nThe game is hard for beginner,it has strategy element,but it doesn't have much to do with military aspect of this game.The strategy I'm talking about here is city planning.Beginner who has their trouble with building large city might need to consider this,its not a base building game,so they can't just place block of building all they want and expect the city itself can adjust to what they want.And they end up having building being burned down by high criminal rate because of poor management.\nIt takes city planning to makes the best city out of the base resources you have,the game is all about management,so anyone who gave a bad review about this game because of themselves failing to take a city challenge and start blaming it on the developer,they need to learn how to play.\nMultiplayer is pretty much dead,so I can't argue with bad reviewer about this one,I myself also has issue with Multiplayer.First off,city building game is a time consuming game,but there is no multiplayer save feature,everyone end up having to play over just because their connection is unstable or the game might somehow crashed during the match.Secondly,the base server of this game seem unstable,I can't keep a match long enough that can decide the winner just because of network issue.\nOther than that,this is a pretty good game.","June 9, 2015","true","10.8"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","31","37","0","0"

Previously I had only used the Free Build mode.\n\nThe Good	Campaign System\nThe campaign is simple. It has a simple reward system which gives you money and talents at the end of each task, which you can then use to buy estates or upgrade your city building skills, giving you resource advantges before you move on to the next task. Quite a simple mechanic, but one which adds just enough interest to make the game long lasting fun, and which fits in well with the overall gamepaly.\n\nGameplay\nGrand Ages Rome has a nice balance between complexity and easy of play. It is in some ways similar to Anno 1404, the main difference being the campaign system and the fact that production buildings in Grand Ages can only be placed where there is an appropriate natural resource. This latter difference makes it a bit more challenging than the Anno series, in my opinion.\n\nThere is an overlay system that allows you to see the state of the city's satisification with regard to food, entertainment and religion, so you can see at once the effect of placing a building in a particular area. The buildings have a simple upgrade system that depends on your level of research.  There is also a simple trade system allows trading with a choice of towns trading at different prices. The simplicty of this system fits the gameplay perfectly.\n\nWhile it is quite easy to create a small settlements in a peaceful area, creating and maintaining one that is periodically attacked by barbarians offers a greater challenge. Fighting is simple, but again, I think it has the right balance in the overall gameplay. You can recruit units from certain segments of the population, and build training and upgrade centres for them. Oh, and it has walls too. The upcoming Grand Ages: Medieval, doesn't. In fact this is one of the things that has prompted me to write this review. Walls are good! We need walls in games like these. Rome also has towers with slits in them that automatically fire arrows at attackers. I love this feature although it is easy to abuse if you need to repel an attacking army.\n\nGraphics\nOne thing I really like about Grand Ages: Rome are the stunning graphics. Even in 2015, the graphics still look good when the settings are cranked up. The Roman architecture is accurately done and looks beautiful close up, with astonishing attention to detail. The camera has this nice feature that allows you to zoom in to street level and get an impression of what the city looks like if you are actually a citizen living in it, allowing full movement through the city.  This is another difference to Anno 1404's postcard view. The way the city comes alive with perfectly animated little figures is also very well done.  From a distance, your city really does look like a Roman city, and you can't help but take screenshots of it.\n\nThe Not so Good...I'm very positive to this game but there are a few areas that could have been done better...\n\nCamera Controls\nAs I already mentioned, I love the fact that you can zoom into to street level and see things from a citizen's point of view, but the camera controls are clunky. Also, zooming right out switches to a static 3D map view which gives an overview of the area you are building in. However, it is not possible to do anything when in this zoomed out mode. I think the game could have benefitted from having camera controls that are similar to the classic Total War series.\n\nResearch\nOne thing I think was too easy was carrying out research. All it requires is a school and a simple house for teachers to live in, both of which you can build early on in a game. Libraries and Philosophers Academies aren't necessary, as they offer only the same research possibilities as schools. Why not have the more advanced buildings that offer new and different research possibilities, as in the C&C games?\n\nConclusion: Grand Ages: Rome is a good solid city building game that looks stunning, and I'm sure you will enjoy it all the more if you have an interest in Ancient Rome. In fact I'd say that it's the best Roman city building game there is.","September 4, 2015","true","91.6"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

Those games had much, much different mechanics! In those games, your strategy revolves around road and building placement, but you'll find zero roads here. Grand Ages: Rome reminds me of the game Children of the Nile, which I'm sure almost no one remembers. You'll find yourself free to build as you like, and where you like, but if you build too hastily or don't pay close enough attention to your resources your city will, quite literally, go down in flames. Angry plebs are pyromaniac plebs!\n\nSome things about the game bother me and are incredibly frustrating, like the tight material constraints. It's very easy to overbuild and find yourself in a hole you can't escape. I also made the mistake of leaving ONE house without a job for a whole four minutes and the angry residents decided to burn down my outpost, which was an immediate game over. It is incredibly frustrating when there's no countermeasure to messing up. If you mess up, you lose, which sucks. Because games like this, no matter how 'simple' they may seem, definitely have a learning curve.\n\nI feel like the game tries to channel parts of Caesar, especially with the overworld map and campaign... but doesn't quite hit the mark. On its own, it is an enjoyable game... just beware angry citizens and their stupid torches. Seriously.

Has quite a few missions and side objectives (especially with addons) which are replayable. You can level up your personal profile for perks to aid you in said missions. City layout is completely customiseable and if you're not a big fan of fighting it won't weigh you down either.\n\nBig Cons:\nLack of micromanagement and resource allocation might put off players looking for complicated game to play.

Every building consumes and produces resources and they work off of each other. Houses require certain services to be near them depending on the class of the citizens. There is also trading and crime and popularity and all that stuff to manage.\nIf you are patient the combat is easy because you can build up your military and then just crush all the barbarians on the map. You can also draw the enemies to your towers and watch them die to hails of arrows. The only stressful missions are when the enemies assault your town, but it's easy enough to deal with it with good defenses. Overall the military part of the game is very simple as there aren't a lot of commands you can give your men and positioning hardly matters. The real fun is city designing.\n\nOn a technical level the game is very nicely designed. Graphics look nice, and once your town gets going you can zoom down into the city and watch your little citizens walking to work or the store, fights happening at the arena, people preaching at the temple, etc. The downside is I have had the game crash and even freeze my computer sometimes (it is an old PC though).\n\nI'd like to point something out if you buy this: I have come across a lot of people on the internet complaining that their buildings constantly catch fire and they can't do anything. This happens because of crime or buildings being left unattended.\nTo stop general deterioration make sure every workplace has employees.\nTo stop crime you just need to keep all of your citizens satisfied by planning your town correctly. The classes have different needs and you need to lay everything out for them before making houses.\n\n-Plebians need water, food, and jobs.\n-Equites need water, food, entertainment, and jobs.\n-Patricians need water, food, entertainment, religion, olive oil, clothes, and jobs. (olive oil and cloth is taken from your resource store; you dont need the production nearby)\n\nSome of these needs require of chain of production, so just plan ahead of time.\nDo this right and you will have zero fires.","February 4","true","34.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each building produces a certain amount of goods or products and some can be upgraded via research. Most buildings will also require maintenance in the form of resources like wood, stone, marble, etc.\n\nBuildings have a certain influence radius and if houses are placed outside that radius it doesn't get that building's benefits. Buildings that provide entertainment are really crucial and houses must have access to these more than anything. Providing labor will also mean buildings must be withing the radius of houses.\n\nThe downside is that Influence Radius will take importance over aesthetics and often you'll start building cities in the most efficient template.\n\nEfficieny over aesthetics pretty much sums up the game. Build only what you need and use slave labor (mostly limited to resources buildings) as much as possible to reduce costs.\n\nMoney making seems easy enough once trade opens up later in the campaign. Even basic temples will provide a good sum of cash.\n\nYour character can level up and have skills which benefit your city or military.\n\nIt's a good game if you're looking for managerial or resource oriented city building game but not so much if you're looking to build grand and aesthetically impressive cities.\n","August 16, 2015","true","6.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

This game might have been released some time ago now (2009), but the level of detail is very satisfying. Zooming right down into your city center and watching the hustle and bustle of a Roman city feels -so- good. Very few city builders give you this feeling, with games like SimCity almost reaching the same feeling but falling a little bit short. I also appreciate the accuracy of Roman architecture and culture that this game has. GA:R is designed in such a way that cities the player builds don't look like a player-built city; putting a few hours into a level can make it look like a dev-designed city! As someone who values immersion and depth of detail more than anything in strategy games, GR:A has a special place in my heart for the visual appeal.\n\nOne thing I gripe about, though; the size of levels/plots are somewhat small. Upon purchasing and booting the game up, I was expecting something pseudo-open world, or even something where cities are connected in some way (I.E SimCity 2014, where city plots are pretty close together and connected via highways, trade, airports etc.), but unfortunately every plot is an individual gamestate. The military side of the game is also very limited - I feel that the advertisement point of "build massive armies" is a large overstatement. On some plots/levels, there is no actual point to building military structures and units. I'd love it if there were factions in this game that you partook in actual diplomacy with, but this game doesn't use these systems at all. It's entirely about loading up a city plot and building - a sandbox with objectives, if you will.\n\nPros:\n\n-Amazing visual dazzle and grandure\n\n-Respects and keeps to the Rome of classical times\n\n-Very liberating in terms of customisation and building\n\n-Decent military aspect, but limited\n\n-Good use of resource management/trade\n\nCons:\n\n-Closed off game world\n\n-Lack of open-world grandure\n\n8/10.

I have plenty of city builders under my belt and this one fell short.  Every mission is nearly identical in the early, mid, and late games.  The only variance between missions is the map.  Now, fundamentaly that is true of any city builder but this game takes it to a new level.\n\nThe map gave me far more difficulty than ANY objectives of the mission.  Placing buildings is just a pain.  If the land has even the smallest, slightest, most insignificant incline, forget about building a structure there.  But you may say, royalrush, there are platforms you can use to make the land flat.  Yes you can, but when I have to cover literally 1/2 the map in platforms in order to build anything, then we have a problem.\n\nThe camera is just terrible.  The absolute worst camera controls and angles of any non first person shooter I have played.\n\nCombat is lack luster.  If this game claimed to be a plain city builder than the combat would be acceptable but for a game that claims combat as the focus, it falls short.\n\n","October 28, 2015","false","14.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I have complicated feelings about this game. Let me start out by saying that I definitely recommend this one, but have some serious issues with it.\n\nSummary:\nCities you build will probably be not the most aesthetically pleasing due to the building influence system.\nCombat is very poor with little depth and is just boring, but tacked on to many missions.\nGame does the setting rather poorly, giving little depth to the various characters you encounter.\n\nOn the upside, these are the only serious problems I have with the game. It’s actually a very good city builder, that you don’t get many of these days. With 5 families, replay value is actually very high.\n\nDefinite recommend.\n\nEnd Summary\n\n\nFirst of all, the building mechanics and resource management are actually very good, and make building a city and planning for expansion a lot of fun. On the bad side, the influence mechanic (every building that provides some sort of satisfaction, be it religion, entertainment or food, has an area of influence with all residences in that area benefitting from it) makes it very had to build aesthetically pleasing cities. However, cities that look like a tangled mess with practically no space between buildings function just fine, and all your cities end up like it, once you discover that building for aesthetics can seriously handicap you for harder missions. Roads, introduced in Augustus expansion, are land waste and you end up building short stretches of it as dots all over the city to get the bonuses for some buildings.\n\nCombat system sucks and the weakest point in the game. Units can gain experience, which does not seem to do anything substantial as for their performance. Enemy units seem to be able to pass right through your front line infantry to attack your archers, and many battles devolve into comical mess. (Side note: why are there Hastati and Triarii in the game? It takes place post Marian reforms, which essentially abolished that system and replaced it with Legions...)\nIt is also unfortunate that many campaign missions are combat oriented.\n\nCampaign system is actually very good. You choose a family to play as, and level up as you go from mission to mission. The leveling up system is actually very good. There are 3 perk trees, 2 of which as same for every family and 3rd one being unique to each family. The bonuses you get from family tree may seem rather insignificant at first, but they may greatly change the way you play the game, adding great deal of replay value to it.\n\nSetting takes place at the time of the Fall of the Roman republic and you end up being introduced to various historical figures from that era. From Cicero to Caesar. Unfortunately all the characters end up feeling like some puppets (poor quality of voice acting in some instances...Pompey.... does not help). It feels like opportunity was missed here to make campaign very engaging.\n","June 20, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I must say that it wasn't for me.\n\nMuch debate in city-building circles about whether we should be allowed to pause to plan. I prefer this as it allows for a deeper, more complex game. 'Grand Ages Rome's designers didn't. The game mechanics have been streamlined with flow supply that strips out much micromanagement but makes little sense realistically speaking. Desireability has been confuted with popularity, so while the proximity of buildings to each other has some meaning, the resultant cities are typically lacking in strong structure or beauty. I was particularly irked by their handling of the forum, which unlocks most higher city functions but is otherwise pretty much a useless waste of space, adding nothing to governance and typically shunted to the obscure margins of the city rather than being at its heart, as it should be historically speaking.\n\nI'm not much interested in the military aspects and am pleased these are largely skippable, but aside from an often anachronistic broader range of units and formations, 'Grand Ages Rome' adds nothing to 'Caesar IV' either.\n\n'Grand Ages Rome' does have the merit of slightly deeper governer development--extra skills and resources as well as titles and income compared to 'Caesar IV'--but these come across as overpowerful (e.g. Vox Pop!) and detracting from player's skill to me. The tech tree stuff seemed highly unconvincing in the context of an ancient city builder too.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want a game with goals like 'complete this scenario in 20 minutes' and find detailed planning or resource management tiresome, 'Grand Ages Rome' might be worth $15, but there are better, older games out there that are actually cheaper.","April 11, 2015","false","5.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Just like these games, you'll have to build housing, aquaducts, entertainment, and other sorts of buildings to make the people happy. The only difference is that Grand Ages ditched the roads and replaced them with a radius. Instead of trying to fit a whole bunch of public and private structures on one long stretch of road, you'll be allocating all sorts of buildings in strategic areas to maximize their effects.

The detail in the graphics is just fantastic - zoom in on the houses and they have latin graffiti scrawled all over them, the monuments have what looks like photos of real relief carvings on them, and all the people wander round doing different things. It's also very pretty! I love getting the camera at a low angle and looking over the roofs of my town as the sun sets in the distance. But Grand Ages doesn't just look nice, it's a fun game to play too. It's easy to play but hard to win. There are many different conditions to fulfil to make your people happy and win each scenario. The DLC is well worth buying too, as it adds some useful new buildings and game aspects as well as a new campaign. My only real criticism is that the campaigns are too short - I'd love to see more campaigns or single mission maps. On the other hand, this is a game you can come back to time and time again. I like to make sure I complete all the optional bonus objectives on each map, or make my people as happy as I can get them.\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this game. If you are looking for a city sim that isn't too taxing, Grand Ages: Rome is the game for you.","April 29, 2015","true","86.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was really impressed by the low pc requirements required to run this game on highest settings and how nice it actually looks in game. The game runs very smoothly but the mechanics in-game such as the riots and buildings being burnt down is soooooooo annoying. You need to build prefectures to put fires out but in order to get them you need to research them and then build them plus the plebs to work in them plus the food to feed those plebs then they need entertainment as well otherwise they riot and your whole town ends up burning to the ground.\n\nThis is not a strategy game that you can kinda sit back every so often and just enjoy your accomplishments and the progress of your settlement - the rush is always on you if you sit back and relax for too long riots will begin, also trying to make your armies march in an orderly fashion is impossible and placement is even more confusing.\n\nI cannot recommend this game unfortunately as I really had high hopes for this one but I just don't like the gameplay - they should of aimed at making this game a little more like Tropico, brought edicts and things like that into the game.

Challenging gameplay! Yet you can build your own city\nand challenge nearby Barbaric villages. Gain resorces, gain money, and gain power. Custom cities. you can build forever\nDAYS AND DAYS OF ROMAN BUILDINGS AND POOLS. Godmode is an option also. I myslef do not use it because i like challenges. I only got the DLC for Multiplayer. BUYING MULTIPLAYER!!!!!! STUPID PEOPLE DONT BUY MULIPLAYER!!!!\nThey like enjoying  games not wasting money on it YOU MORONS! - not the people who play this game. you guys are nice and very smart most likely, i was speaking to the developers for being sellouts on there own game. They could have added THE AUGUSTUS DLC without the multiplayer. They should have put the multiplayer in the game itself not with a dlc who had that idea! a guy who wanted prophit. to be mean. goofy. nein, he did to add it to the game because they ment for the game to a solo game but it was to late, therefor they added it to the game because it was a popular game until medieval. so they added a DLC to add the muliplayer. for our enjoyment.They are nice guy i promise. *Cross my fingers*: So it is all in all a good game i love the developers for making it as it is a good experience. if you play with friends and family. solo is not that fun but, it will do so for now i will play but there is no-one to play it with sadly.\nGOOD GAME IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO IT WAS A CHEAP MOVE PUTTING THE MULTIPLAYER IN THE DLC THOUGH!","December 8, 2015","true","31.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The aesthetic (right down to the UI) and economics are very similar to Imperium Romanum, but Grand Ages has something of a story in its campaign mode.\n\nIf a building catches fire, nobody will come to put it out: you have to demolish it yourself, and then the lot is empty (you'll have to go into the building browser, select the replacement, and rebuild from scratch).\n\nBuilding placements are unnecessarily difficult compared to Tropico 3 or Imperium Romanum: farms must be placed on designated patches of fertile land, buildings - all buildings - can only be built in the vicinity of other buildings, so you'll have to build a chain of houses or other structures to that distant patch of fertile land if you want your people to eat.\n\nIn fact, so much of what Grand Ages does appears to be an imitation of Imperium Romanum, that anyone who choses the latter won't be missing much by choosing it instead. Imperium Romanum is the better game, so much so that I would recommend buying it and foregoing Grand Ages: Rome.\n\nGrand Ages: Rome is a flawed imitation of a better game.","April 4, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one focuses more on macro planning as there are no "walkers" and all resources flow into a central pool. Since placement in't quite as crucial (no workflows) you can make some rather lovely, yet functional, cities. Combat is simple yet diverse enough to be interesting.\n\nThe best aspect is the customization of your faction as you play the campaign. You have some RPG elements playing one of five houses with three skill trees. Two are shared, but each house has a unique tree which really does affect how you play. Each mission gives you one more skill point, and bonus objectives in missions often add to your house wealth or making estates available. Estates, after being unlocked, are bought and provide extra resources.\n\n","September 1, 2014","true","103.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are no walkers, no upgrading houses and very little in the way of resource production chains. Instead, the key component of GA: Rome is proximity - making sure the different circles of supply overlap correctly, similar in concept to the original SimCity.There isn't a great deal of depth, unlike the intricate production and transport chains of Anno 2070 or the careful walker management of Caesar 3, but it's an interesting method of distinguishing itself, and it plays quite well.\n\nUnfortunately, like many citybuilders, GA: Rome also has an RTS engine haphazardly stapled to it, and this is the chief weakness of the game. There are far too many missions where the citybuilding takes a back seat to watching little red figures march around the map, and the combat engine is slow, boring and extremely frustrating.\n\nOverall I can't recommend the game to a general audience, though if you're into city building games, it's worth a look for novelty value if nothing else.","March 4, 2015","false","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
