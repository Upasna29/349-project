( after the first couple of tutorial levels at least)\n\nRarely a more satisfying gaming moment beats seeing your enemies sprawling base in uncontrollable flames.\n\nThe only downside to this game is the annoying graphical glitching of the units, If anyone can solve that it would be much appreciated!\n\nDespite that, Its still very very playable.

One of my favorite aspects is that there is a set of 5 religeous paths (3 distinct paths and 2 hybrids) that shape the course of the campaign based on the decisions that you make in game. The path that you follow also determines which specialty units and buildings you can build and each path has various advantages over the others. The AI players each also belong to a particular religeous group, adding new dynamics to each encounter.\n\n\nGreat game, runs perfectly on Windows 7 x64, and supports 1920x1080 out of the box.","April 27, 2014","true","5.4"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

Great story, great gameplay with many new ideas for its time including your choices changed the story and adding upkeep in order to maintain an army just like you would have to in real life.\n\nIf your a fan of rts games this one is a must try just remember to fix the compatability issues before running the game and remember your troops will still glitch but if the compatability settings are right it will cause minimal problems.","December 25, 2014","true","0.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","4"

I'm so glad that it's on steam now, since my old disk has been getting fairly scratched up over the years and it's nice to have a reliable copy.\n\nWhile the game's graphics have probably not aged very well for those not viewing it through nostalgia-tinted lens, it actually stands up fairly well still (native 1080p, anyone?). The strategy side is still rock solid as well, and it's implementation of formations and terrain remain uniquely excellent in my opinion. I know the old version had some stability issues, but I believe those have been addressed as of now.\n\nThe single player story is definitely the selling point for this entry and I absolutely loved it's branching endings. No matter how many times I play it, every year or two I find myself putting it back in and booting it up to play through again! The multiplayer is kinda meh in this entry, but it's still serviceable if you'd only like to buy one out of the two. So for its excellent strategy, epic story and strong replayability, I couldn't recommend this game more highly!

The economy is great and somewhat unique.  The battles are tactical and reminiscent of total war series.  The econmy feeds into it well also giving good reasons to fight outside cities in the wide open maps.  The campaign is great.  The faction mechanics are really fun and stand out of the croud.  I'm not sure why this game didn't get better reviews (not that it was badly reviewed).\n\nI won't say its perfect.  Minimap and camera could be a bit better.

If you like RTS, pick up Age of Empires 2. If you like city builders, pick up Grand Ages: Rome. If you like dynasty builders, pick up Crusader Kings. Stronghold might satisfy you if you're looking for a similar strategic mix. I'd actually suggest Majesty if you're willing to roleplay a little more and strategize a little less.\n\nThe game doesn't even have a singleplayer skirmish mode either, and everyone who plays multiplayer seems to have WK:Battles which supposedly has this plus more content but requires a direct network connection. It reminds you of playing C&C from the old days where you could only choose among previously completed missions, or had to directly connect through a serial modem connection\n\nGames that use middle mouse buttons for rotating the camera and don't have custom controls are just asking for trouble. There's no windowed mode either. :-\","January 4","false","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
