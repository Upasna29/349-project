The game had trouble locating a file and crashed whenever a certain scene was trying to load. I tried re-installing the game and that didn't work. I tried to locate the file myself and that didn't work. I think the game has potential but I'll never know because of this glitch.\n\nEDIT: The developer of the game got in contact with me and told me he patched the error. The fact that the developer got in touch with me for this speaks volumes to me. I'm continuing the game from where I left off with no issues and I'm pretty excited about it. Thanks for helping me out!","January 16","true","8.6"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

I expected it to be a mediocre rpg maker game, but I actually didn't have any bones to pick at this one. Enjoyed, and about to start playing it through again after I find the last couple secrets in the game.","September 8, 2015","true","14.2"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","19","31","2","0"

Not really a hard game and it is more simplistic of a game than some but I did enjoy it. Nothing special about the story. The music was pretty good(except the store music..lol), and the hidden boss music has some funky tunes.","March 6","true","14.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The challenge level is a bit on the low side, but it is certainly enjoyable. Definitely recommend as an entry-level game for people who are just starting to play rpgs or for people who want a game that they can figure out without having to use a walkthru.  Story is your basic collect the crystals and save the world fare.  Most of the dialog is geared toward humor.  The music is excellent.  Game time is around 10 to 20 hours, depending upon how completionist you are.  There are some interesting optional sidequests.  Most of the secrets and Easter eggs are pretty easy to find if you do some exploring and search everywhere.  The random encounters come pretty frequently, but the success rate is pretty high when you run away.  Running away carries no penalty is lost gold (“hold” in this game) or xp.  So you can just keep running away when you’re in a hurry to get from point A to point B.\nSolid game. Fantastic value for its price.","May 4","true","22.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While not deviating too ambitiously from traditional RPG mechanics, Hoven the Sages Spinel remains a solid RPGMAKER game with definitely enough content worth the $4 price.","January 4","true","0.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","7","15","3","1"
