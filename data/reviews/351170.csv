Also, it appears that dying in-game often changes the physics of the key-mapping, like suddenly going right is the former down key. The change-ups help allay rote muscle memory, and you seem to frequently get the feeling of learning a new skill, even when replaying. The sound effects are pleasing. Definitely not one of those +1 backlog games for me.\n\nI bought the two pack of this Puzzle/Platformer/Shooter because I saw the emoticons. :D They are prohibitively expensive in the market, so I'm hoping to drop the :blackpix: for some Steam Profile art. The cards are fantastic! When I pulled up the background images, they look pretty cool too. But, I will be putting a lot of playtime into this, like with Lyne, as it does have achievies and a workshop, so there is nothing to lose here but hours of my life on another addictive game. :D","November 27, 2015","true","20.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

If you like platformers that are super challenging, but feel insanely rewarding, then you will love Pixel. It's not for everyone, so if you do not like games like Super Meat Boy then you should avoid this one. There's more to it than just platforming, and even the way it handles platforming is unique. It's a solid blend of tried-and-true mechanics while adding some unique features that really make it stand out.\n\n\nI got a preview of this game at PAX East last year and was super impressed with it, so I was happy to finally add it to my Steam Library where I hope to play it more in-depth because I loved the euphoric feeling I get from completing the levels.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenging platormer with some unique mechanics, then I strongly recommend Pixel.","May 8, 2015","true","2.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

I know some people are having issues with this demo, but I want to leave a review of the actual game itself! If you want to see some gameplay, I actually have a video of it on youtube: https://youtu.be/Z2Yt8kNvQZg\n\nPros:\n- It makes you think - it challenges your thinking process with the mechanics of the game like reversing gravity.\n- It's addicting - It's like playing Rayman Origins. If you like that masochism just to get to sweet victory and doing it all over again, this is the game for you my friend.\n- It's so colorful! - As a person with a rainbow-backlit keyboard, this game makes my day.\n\n\nCons:\n- It makes you think really hard - Really really hard if you've had a long day at school/work.\n- It's got some development issues - Not for me personally, but a lot of people say the game crashes or lags.\n- It's loud - I lowered the volume of the game, but it's still pretty loud for my tastes. Especially the shooting sounds.\n\nOverall, I am one of those people that can't give up playing until I've solved the masterful riddle, so I really like this game.  I'm really happy I have this game and I play it in my spare time, though my score on each level seems absolutely terrible. Still, would recommend it to a friend just to watch their brain work.","May 6, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

As a long-time gamer, very few games have made me sit on the edge of my seat as I've attempted to beat a highscore or outrun an unbeatable enemy as it barrels down on me. This isn't a casual puzzle game. This is a puzzle game that combines heart-pounding platforming action with mindbending problem solving, played to an intense sountrack. Look past your first impressions because this is an indie title with immense depth and replayability.","June 11, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stormsoflife/recommended/351170/","stormsoflife","Stormy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stormsoflife/","204 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nQuick pros\n-Fast-paced and skill-based\n-Intuitive controls and addicting gameplay\n-Great soundtrack\n-Very attentive devs; They release updates often (Usually every two weeks) and love feedback.\n\nI first encountered this game three years ago in a little booth with two of the main devs working on this game. I've watched it grow and develop a story and tested levels yearly to date. I haven't played much on Steam itself (yet) but I would say I have at the bare minimum twenty hours of gameplay with this game in various iterations. It's honestly one of the best experiences I've ever had with an indie game for years; I'd dare to say I haven't enjoy the unique nature and gameplay of an indie since Cave Story, though it's a rather brazzen comparison since I only mean in appeal and not in the style of the games at all.\n\nThe gist\nYou play as a single, intelligent pixel and manuever through puzzling platforms to align the pixels in the background to form a picture. You also shoot virus-infested pixels, and not in a silly way most platformers do, with weapons such as (At the time of writing) a single-shot gun, flamethrower (Yes, it lights pixels on fire which can light other pixels on fire), a laser, shotgun and a rocket launcher (Which you can rocket jump with). In addition to weapon type, there is also weapon color. Naturally, the virus-infested enemy pixels have a color, but in order to harm them, the opposite color weapon must be used against them. For example, a yellow pixel will be unharmed by red, but hurt by blue. If an enemy is shot by a color that is neither the same nor opposite of their color, their hue will shift and you will need a new color to defeat them than what was needed originally. This can, however, be used strategically, as multiple enemy pixels of varying colors but close proximity could be shifted to the same hue, then all three could be blasted into oblivion with a single rocket launcher shot of the opposite color. In this regard, combat is both a puzzle and skill-based ordeal.\n\nWhat sets Pixel apart from most games is the scoring system. Everything consumes or gives resources with the exception of basic movement. Your resources, from the start of ever level, begin at zero and decrease into the negatives. This is where speedrunning skills come into play. By quickly gathering resources in the form of color-changing squares or killing virus-infected pixels by shooting (Which requires points based on which weapon is in use), points are gained. By rapidly collecting resources and destroying rogue pixels, your negative score grows into the positives and shows how much time was spent, bullets were shot, enemies were killed, resources were collected and deaths you accumulated from start to the goal. But thanks to intuitive level design, there isn't one single "best" way of beating a level. So you can keep going back and trying to overtake a friend's score and eventually beat it by thousands of points all because you took a better route or did so more efficiently than the competition. The scores will never truly have a best only because skill, route selection and RNG elements influence your run to the millisecond.\n\nWhat strikes me most about this game is that it not only covers many genres (Such as platformer, puzzler, shooter and mostly speed runner) but it does each one justice. It's by no means a regular shooter, but it utilizes its own setting and movement to make a challenging, fast-paced system that shines in a light all its own. Rather than mimic the big boys in the gaming industry, they take tried and true ideas and make them work in a balanced and non-gamebreaking way.\n\nOverall, I think this has the potential to be an incredibly popular game if it gains a solid fan base and skilled player base. The puzzles require a lot of thought but also a lot of skill and most levels can be finished in multiple ways with differing scores. This combined with a workshop for level creation will prove a great many levels requiring unique skill sets that will test the limits of both skill and patience as the pros go at the same level for hours on end in search of a "perfect" run. Which could very well be debunked the following day.\n\nIt may not utilize the best graphics engine on the market or have the most detailed characters or levels, but the devs have really put together something incredible. To me, at the very least, this is a hidden jewel on the Steam market.","June 28, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well the description is pretty damn accurate. It's a platforming, puzzle, shooter. Well not really a shooter but you do shoot.\n\n\nYou must guide your sexy pixel self through a maze of deadly puzzles, by changing your color to pass through walls, changing your bullet colors or shooting type to kill your foes.\n\nPixel: ru² is such a great mix of Super Meat Boy and... I have no other comparison it's such a unique, fun, and challenging puzzle game.\n\nFor an early access game it's premise is strong, and there's a definite through line. The developers are doing a great job portraying their game and the path it's going to take, and if there's more of this in the future of Pixel: ru² then I'm excited for the future.\n\nI'd have to recommend picking this up, especially right now being discounted by 15% - you can't find a much better puzzle game experience for less then $10.\n\nYou can find the first look video on my website www.earlyaccesspodcast.com.","March 6, 2015","true","0.8"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","10","18","2","0"

You had your standard platforming elements where you move left and right, and space to jump and that was all well and good, and then it changes things a bit by allowing you to reverse the polarity, allowing you to stand on the ceiling.  Of course this opens up a whole new world of challenges, but they don't stop there.\n\nThen not only can you shift that polarity up or down, but with certain locations in-game, you can rotate your map (and the polarity) 90 degrees to the left or right, depending on the button pressed.  So now you've got four ceilings and four floors, in some levels virtually all at the same time but there's still more added on.\n\nThey allow you to add color to your cube with certain areas and when your cube matches the color of a wall, you're now allowed to traverse through it.  So now you've got all these things, all going at once and it's a puzzle platformer that really requires you to think on how you want to proceed.\n\nThe only negative problem I have with the game is that there are enemies...and not necessarily that they're there, but they feel a little tacked on.  You do get varying methods of attack, which is interesting itself, but it feels to me that the main draw is the puzzling itself, and the enemies don't really add or take away from that.  I would like to see them be more incorporated into the puzzles themselves, rather than as an obstacle given that once you get a few of the better attacking methods, you can one-shot most of them and there's no real challenge or point to them being there in the first place.\n\nHowever, all in all the puzzling is a high level of fun and thought-provoking in Pixel and I would reccomend that people give it a chance if they're looking for a puzzle game that requires you to think in multiple dimensions and laterally all at the same time.","June 3","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At the moment I'm writing this review: There are 10 levels.\nThere's a level editor.\nThere are no community created levels.\nThere is no story, unlike Thomas Was Alone.\nThere are no rage-platformer challenges, unlike Super Meatboy.\nThere are no difficult puzzles, unlike Braid.\nThere is nothing geeky in this game (random IT facts don't make this geeky).\nThere are interesting gameplay mechanics with almost no practical use in the levels (they exist, but you never need to use them).\nThe style is rather unique, but nothing special.\nThe soundtrack gives me a headache.\nThe price for this game is 10€.\nI understand that this game is in Early Access and still in development, but it's definitely not worth the price. It's overhyped and nothing like the description says. Currently this game looks, feels and sounds like a mediocre free-online-game from Newgrounds, Armor Games or a similar website.

I played this while at Momocon 2016 and managed to beat one of the dev's scores. The best way to describe this game is that it's a fast paced, puzzle, platformer, shooter. To get the best scores, you can't stop. To complete the levels, you need to know additive colors. Each level is a platforming level with points to collect and enemies to shoot.\n\nTo beat the levels, you have to change your color to pass through barriers and change your shot color to kill enemies. This makes the levels kind of hard to figure out at first, but with each completion you cna almost always find a faster or better scoring route or method. To get the best scores, however you can't take any damage, shoot as little as possible, collect everything, kill everything, and finish.\n\nI like the music in the game, though i don't remember hearing it at Momocon (but that was probably because of all of the arcade/rhythm games being played near by). Most puzzles are fairly straight forward, but some are very hard. Getting high scores will be fun if a leaderboard gets put into the game.\n\nOne thing i wasn't all too happy with was the aiming for controller input. You point in the direction you want to fire, but it immediately fires in that direction. Having something to see where you are aiming then another button to fire would help a lot. I haven't really tried the keyboard + mouse input, though i do see it being better for getting accurate shots.\n\nAll in all, I like the game. I will try to get the best scores per level.","June 4","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
