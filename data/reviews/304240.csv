The newer Titles RES 5 and RES 6 focus way too much on action, and you often end up with a small asenal at your disposal with a ridiculous amount of ammo.\n\nThis is not the case with this Remaster/Remake.  Ammo is limited, Inventory space is limited, and even your vision is limited depending on where the camera is situated. (this is a good thing)\n\nIt makes you use caution when moving somewhere, often you may want to rely on your senses... can you hear a zombie groaning in the other room? or was it just your imagination?\n\n\nI started out playing this game on hard mode, just to see what it was like.  I died from the 2nd or 3rd zombie I encountered.  It was a brutal experience, the zombies were tough as nails eating most of  clip from my hand gun before finally dying.\n\nI was stuck relying on my knife almost immediately due to not having enough ammo to take care of the zombies, and since I needed to get around the zombies to proceed, there was little choice.  Due to being in close melee range, it also meant they could grab and eat me.. which is what usually ended up happening.\n\nHard mode was INTENSE..  It was terrifyingly amazing how useless and weak I felt.  This made me actually FEAR the zombies.  Everytime I entered a new room I was a tense situation not knowing if there would be a zombie to greet me as soon as I stepped though the door..\n\nAfter a couple of deaths I decided to switch to Easy Mode and progressed through the game much better.\nWhile it was Easy Mode, I still thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  It wasn't a walk in the park, the game was still challenging but the player can take more hits before dying, and there are more healing herbs and ammo scattered around the mansion.  This was greatly benifital to me as I had no idea where I was going, or what I was to expect up ahead and it allowed some room for error.\n\nThere were still times where I died, but often it was due to being ill prepared.  There are multiple traps in this game, and while they look like they would probably be insta-death I managed to avoid all of them by being cautious or just seeing ahead.\n\nI finished the game after about 20 or so hours.. This was actually a pretty long play through and could have been done much shorter.  This was widely because of not knowing where I was going.  Not to say that you are wandering around aimlessly.. (although you kind of are in a sense)  There is a map, and its the key to progressing.  Some areas of the mansion are unaccessable until you find a certain objects.. like keys, or items used for puzzles that open way for new areas.\n\nThere is a lot of back tracking involved and the game doesn't direct you at all by giving you a marker to move towards or a mission objective to complete.  Its all up to you, and it feels great!\n\nAfter finishing the game and making sure I had 100% of the map and item progression I decided to check online to see if there was anything else I could unlock or do in the game.  In fact there was.. but I had to play on Hard Mode.\n\n\nI was still a bit in fear of the experience I had with Hard Mode the first time around, but I decided to come back and try it again a couple of weeks later.\n\n\nHaving learned a lot from playing and finishing the game on Easy Mode, I figured I had a better chance at survival than when I first attemped Hard Mode.\n\nWhile the zombies were MUCH harder to kill, you take brutal amounts of damage, and ammo was scarce.  I did indeed have a better grip on the game..  I was ready.\n\n\n\nUnlocking the Samurai Edge Pistol. (beat the game in under 5 hours)\nUnlocking the Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher. (beat the game in under 3 hours)\n\nGiven how it took me over 20 hours to beat the game on Easy Mode, I clearly had some work to do if I was going to even get close.\n\n\nThe first thing I did was find out if there were any safe places where the game clock did not tick.. like in a menu, or pausing.. during cut scenes.. etc.  There was not.\n\nThe moment you load the game, there is no pausing the timer.. PERIOD.  This means you really have to be careful when you save the game.  Thinking a head is critical, you have to know where you are going and where all the monsters are.\n\nI decided I would do some trial and error with some runs.. I'd take a path, get the items I found to be valuable in order to progress the quickest without having to back track too much.\n\nThe game needs to be done in segments, figure out a path that leads you to get some importent items and then gets you back to your safe house to save/deposit items to clear up your intentory.  Planning was integral to success, as I didn't want to go through the game and fail just short of the required time to get my unlocks.\n\nMy brother and I decided to digitally draw the mansion using mspaint by tracing an online map of the mansion.  I was then able to mark rooms that were locked with a certain key, or needed something special to progress.  Making a path to follow was also easier as you could now visualize the whole processes before going through with it.\n\nThrough a lot of trail and error, I completed the game in about 2 hours and 30 minutes.  This was a great success for me, and I unlocked both weapons in one run.  While I finished the game with an in game clock of under 3 hours, in reality it probably took me longer to complete than the first play through since I often was not happy with my segment times and would redo them.\n\n\nThis process turned me into a zombie dodging ninja, as often the fastest way through a room wasn't to clear it by gunning zombies down.. it was to simply step around them somehow.  Completing this time trial challange has essentially turned Hard Mode turned into Easy Mode.. and it was a lot of fun.\n\n\nThe games over now right?  Wrong.\n\nThere are 2 characters you can choose to play as.\n\nChris\nHigher max HP\nHigher damage output using a Knife\nStarts with the Lighter item\n\nJill\nLarger inventory capacity\nStarts with a lock pick\n\nThey have different story progressions and you explore the masion taking different paths.\n\nIf you finish the game with both Chris and Jill on at least Normal Mode, the next time you play, the game will throw a new zombie into the mix.. This zombie has a bomb straped to it's chest and killing it will result in an explosion that will always kill you.\n\nNot enough?\n\n\nInvisible Enemy Mode - Yeah.. its what it says, the enemies are invisible.  I haven't even attempted this yet as I am certain how it will turn out...  but one day..\n\nThere are also different costumes you can unlock per character.\n\n\nLastly.. there are also Steam Achivements to strive for.. like\n\nBeat the game without saving.\nBeat the game using only a knife. (no other weapons, not even counter/defensive ones)\n\n\nAmazing game, worth every penny.  I hope RES 7 will take a note from how well this game has sold and try to stay more true to it's roots.\n\nCan't wait for RES 2 Remake/Remaster.. will buy day one. (this one is actually being worked on!)\nCan't wait for RES 3 Remake/Remaster.. will buy day one. (I can hope they eventually make this)","October 2, 2015","true","55.6"," 224 of 235 people (95%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","95","224","235","15","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultrawired/recommended/304240/","ultrawired","://Ultrawired [+]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultrawired/","215 products in account","Old school horror has never looked better. This is THE perfectly polished and deeply atmospheric remake of the classic from 1996. Originally developed in 2002, you'll be shocked on how modern this game actually feels, not only for all the enhancements that Capcom incorporated to re-release this in 2015 but also on how beautiful this game really is and always has been.\n\n//PROS\n- 1080p-enhanced visuals with improved textures and backgrounds.\n- Perfectly remastered 5.1 sound.\n- This game is absolutely unforgiving, something which was very well established back then and nowadays we're definitely missing: ammunition is priceless, there's a limited amount to scavenge which forces you to utilize each and every shot wisely. A small inventory, which has you juggling items from your inventory to your warehouse constantly. Deadly-as-hell zombies, which rely mostly on level of threat and perfect design rather than numbers/hordes, and the return of the classic Ink Ribbons to save the game - all this makes you think twice before you cross each door for the first time. [If this is something you find annoying, Capcom introduced the new "Very Easy" mode as well]\n- The return of the iconic protagonists Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield available in different costumes; these include the classic S.T.A.R.S. uniform (1996/2002) and the B.S.A.A. uniform (2009+) which gives a higher modern touch for newcomers to this entry.\n- The overall design of the game is magnificent, combined with the fixed-camera angles which makes it a lot more artistic and cinematic.\n- What mostly differs this game from the modern RE entries is the requirement of patience: there is no one-way route and no in-game alerts/messages to help you out. You need to figure out where to go next (relying on the map is highly necessary) and where to place the keys/items you find. It's easy to get lost on first playthrough.\n\n//CONS\n- Few areas in the game were left with low quality backgrounds.\n- Widescreen mode is incorporated, looks better on nowadays monitors of course, but it crops the top and bottom while stretching the original image - Capcom could've avoided this.\n- Mouse cursor is visible in-game.\n- The same funny (not in a good way) voice acting as the original.\n\n//OVERALL\nThis game brings back the creepy enviornments, tense exploration, traps and clever puzzles in an excellent port, a demonstration that there's no need for an exagerated convultioned story to make a good game, as long as it's well done and eye-catching. Finishing this game led me to daydream that Capcom will someday release a remake of more games directed/produced by mastermind Shinji Mikami, such as Resident Evil 2 + 3: Nemesis and Dino Crisis.\n\n9.5/10","January 23, 2015","true","74.3"," 186 of 202 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","186","202","8","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/recommended/304240/","rust_decay","raZe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/","394 products in account","Any more in-depth introduction would defeat its purpose since most of you probably spent your time with the original the same way I did: in a darkened room, nose glued to the screen, on the brink of wetting yourself. That was almost 20 years ago and the series changed quite a bit since then - depending on who you ask, not necessarily for the better. Resident Evil left behind its survival horror roots a long time ago in favor of a more dynamic, action-oriented approach. Ever since you had fans yearning for survival horror to make a return while others embraced the new ways, stating that tank controls and fixed camera angles simply wouldn't hold up anymore. But do they hold up? Short answer: Yup, sure do.\n\nIt's funny to see developers jumping through hoops to make their game feel "cinematic" when Resident Evil achieved that feat almost 20 years ago without sacrificing the actual game: Fixed camera angles offer the perfect balance between tension and field of view while the pre-rendered backgrounds provide the eye candy as you creep through the mansion and perforate the undead. And due to the control scheme, forward always remains forward when you move out of the picture. The scarce resources along with your limited inventory keep you on your toes and make sure each encounter stays tense. Resident Evil is a slow-paced game that is supposed to be played with foresight and the controls only emphasize that. All of this can be applied to the REmaster.\n\nAs a result, the REmaster also inherits many of the original's problems: Some camera angles don't offer as much visibility as they should and at times you find yourself awkwardly jerking around between pictures. And due to the drastically limited inventory the backtracking is strong in this one. You end up visiting the same locations at least twice since you often enter a new area only to realize that the item you need to solve the next puzzle is resting in your locker at the other end of the mansion. You only get six item slots (or eight respectively) where a piece of paper takes up as much space as a mother♥♥♥♥ing shotgun. A more elegant item management system could have prevented many unnecessary trips to Mount Doom and back.\n\nEssentially, REmaster is a tarted up version of REmake for Nintendo's Gamecube. If you're like me and never owned one, the REmaster will make the game feel fresh all over again. But if you already own it for Gamecube, the effect will probably not be as strong. Especially considering that the quality of the remade backgrounds is all over the place. There are times when REmaster will flex its muscles and show off its amazing new lighting, but there are other times when you drag your character through low-res, grainy areas that look like they have been chased through a lanczos filter in Photoshop.\n\nIn a way, playing REmaster is like spending time with an old friend you haven't seen in ages. It's been so long that you're not sure whether or not he's still cool or if he ever was cool in the first place. When you finally meet again for a drink, you can tell that he tries to give the impression that nothing has changed, yet you can't help but notice some wrinkles along with the receding hairline. Still, you spend some quality time together and you can confirm that he is cool, even now.\n\nSome people would question whether or not it's worth paying for an HD remake that isn't that HD to begin with. Everyone else is already playing it. Like they should.\n\nAnd ♥♥♥♥ spiders.","January 21, 2015","true","25.4"," 153 of 166 people (92%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","92","153","166","20","7"

There are no issues.\n\nI made it up to the gaurdhouse as Jill and I think I can say with confidence that this is a quality port. It's a constant 60 at 1080p (You can set the fps to unlimited with higher resolution, of course) with little to no bugs whatsoever. The only things you have to worry about is a very rare occasion of music being sped up (Update: It would seem some tracks were sped up on purpose, which I don't agree with), mouse showing up during gameplay for some reason and crappy console main menu that doesn't let you use scroll wheel. Outside of these minor naggles, it should be a flawless experience.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, a lot of the backgrounds look fantastic (Especially outside environments) while others look like a muddy mess, notably the Richard hallway, piano room and the shark aqua ring being the absolute worst. 60fps does this game wonders, and honestly it's instantly preferable over the gamecube and console versions. The "Jiggly boobs" aren't as noticable as people had pointed out in past videos and in reality your eyeballs will probably be elsewhere when you're playing. Playing this game with a headset, the audio is night and day compared to Gamecube thanks to uncompressed sound, and same thing applies to visuals with a higher resolution as you'll notice things you couldn't before on a blurry TV. It appears that the game supports leaderboards but speedrunners of previous japenese last gen releases have confirmed that results are unfiltered regardless of difficulty or unlockables, meaning that guy who beats the game on very easy with a rocketlauncher will always be at the top of the leaderboard for "normal" game modes and invisible enemy. Real survival will probably be the main stay for little bit, at least until hackers mess that up like they always do with online leaderboards.\n\nAlso... You can't skip doors yet. If Capcom doesn't patch this, then the modding community will.\n\nNow, for the gameplay, I know that you know that you already have your mind made up on if you like it or not. If you do, buy this. If you had played previous RE's and disliked them, but haven't played REmake, then I strongly recommend this one, as it's the most refined of the bunch. It's also about 70% different (they weren't lying) than what you had played before in RE1, along with the addition of crimson heads who are zombies you have killed resurrecting with steroids. If you don't like RE at all, then I recommend Alien Isolation or Penumbra or something if you want to scratch your survival horror itch.\n\nBut yeah, Capcom didn't ♥♥♥♥ this one and that's all that should matter to you.","January 20, 2015","true","70.7"," 107 of 117 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","107","117","7","2"

A true "Suvival Horror" with Puzzles, a Resident Evil game where ammo and saves are limited and running is sometimes better than fighting, unlike the action games the series has become.\n\nThe enviroments are stunningly detailed thanks to the still camera veiws, you're essentially running around a gorgeous portrait. New lighting effects have been added and when combined with the new HD textures of the characters and enemies the game really shines.\n\nMusic is perfectly implemented (Saveroom relief) and the sounds of thunder in addition to the groans and moans of the dead (amongst other things) are as jumpy and disturbing as ever.\n\nThere is so much I want to mention here, the numerous monsters, weapons and scares but I really don't want to spoil any of the surprises but what I will say is expect the unexpected ..... anyone remember the hounds?\n\nAlso the map is incredibly handy, any rooms that still have items in it will be highlighted in red and cleared rooms are blue so this should save you a lot of trouble should you find yourself stuck and wondering where to investigate next.\n\nA choice of new or old style controls (I still prefer the tank method) with 60, varible or 30 FPS locks and runs maxed out easily on my laptop ( I7 4710MQ, GTX 860M, 8 RAM ) so I know my gaming rig will have no troubles what so ever.\n\nHopefully Resident Evil 0 receives the same treatment (rumoured) and a remake/port of Resident Evil 2 and 3 would be great so heres hoping.\n\nIf you've already played the Gamecube version then this Resident Evil is a 9/10 however ... if you're only played the PSX version or never even played Resident Evil ..... 10/10.\n\n\nIf you're after a genuine survival horror that involves more horror and thought rather than trigger action then this is game for you, easily the best Resident Evil within the series.\n\nPros\n\n• "True" survival horror.\n\n• Beautiful enviroments.\n\n• Tense, atmosphereic.. perfect\n\n\nCons\n\n• Too hard for some?\n\nFinally a top tip for everyone .... should you meet the wailing women in chains ..... run ....

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucky4leafclova/recommended/304240/","lucky4leafclova","-3xA'Lu©κy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucky4leafclova/","616 products in account","A little bit about the game: Resident Evil HD Remaster is a remastering of the 2002 remake of the original 1996 classic "Resident Evil". Resident Evil: Remake (sometimes known as Resident Evil: Rebirth) is a true survival horror game that ultimately gave Resident Evil a more serious tone and much needed-polish. Despite signficant changes to the title itself (70% according to a developer) much of the overall plot remains the same. The story starts with a particular police team locating a downed helicopter (Bravo team's last known location) that was similarly sent to investigate reports of cannibalism outside Racoon City. At the crash site they discover just a severed hand and the pilot's body amongst the wreckage. Suddenly vicious dogs ambush them and they are then forced to seek refuge in a nearby mansion. From this point you assume control of your chosen character: Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine. Both characters have differences between them and interestingly enough -- your character choice will determine who gets to be your partner and what endings you can get.\n\nThis game's got it all: creepy mansion oozing with atmosphere, tense music and great scares. Like every Resident Evil game it's very "B movie-like". The game will still make you nervous and scare you a few times at least however. As for the gameplay: it's not that of your typical third-person shooter due to 2 old Resident Evil staples - tank controls and a fixed camera - which players will either hate or love. I'll say it again, Resident Evil is a true survival horror game through-and-through, despite its adventure style gameplay that often involves you backtracking and looking for items as well as solving puzzles in the one big mansion. Survival horror presents itself through scarce ammo, the total lack of respawning items, limited typewriter ink ribbons (used to save) as well as zombie enemies resurrecting into a more powerful zombie if you don't choose to burn them early on. In a nutshell: item management is key to success in Resident Evil.\n\nPROS\n+ a 60 FPS mode exclusively for this PC release offers incredibly smooth movement and animations (there's also the Variable FPS mode, in addition to the regular 30 FPS mode, which allows your PC to run the game at whatever framerate it can handle)\n+ almost every resolution is supported and the game makes special use of widescreen resolutions by introducing a "panning mode" (the screen scrolls to show the cut parts of the screen) but you can always go back to the game's original 4:3 display\n+ character models are nicely enhanced\n+ some environments are re-created using animated 3D models\n+ new post-processing effects (mainly bloom filters which the store page identifies)\n+ audio is fully resampled and everything expectedly sounds decent\n+ full controller support (I never got to test this admittedly)\n+ an alternate control scheme to the tank controls allows for modern gamers to enjoy this title equally (directional buttons you press simply make your character walk in that particular direction)\n+ new difficulty mode that makes the game incredibly easy (weak enemies and tons of ammo)\n+ new BSAA outfits for Chris and Jill that were taken from the games they were in afterwards\n+ Steam cloud, Steam achievements and Steam leaderboard (it doesn't filter by difficulty sadly)\n\nNEUTRAL\n- the same voice acting from Resident Evil: Remake (for most fans it's entertaining but for others it may be the opposite)\n\nCONS\n- the game renders at 1440p regardless of resolution (WHY?!)\n- a lot of textures look like they have a filter slapped on (much like the recent remastering of Resident Evil 4)\n- performance issues on some PCs haven't been addressed to this day\n- the audio desyncs even if you're a couple of frames short (again, like the Resident Evil 4 remaster)\n- the OST sounds too quiet compared to the rest of the game and is noticeably sped up (this somewhat impacts the game's atmosphere)\n- some static backgrounds look downright awful\n- it's incredibly hard to maintain a constant 60 FPS on some rigs it seems\n- the camera bobbing up and down in panning mode may make some people sick\n- door-opening animations can't be skipped like previous iterations (the modding community has already fixed this with a Steam guide detailing a "Door Skip mod")\n- too many errors remain in the game's subtitles\n- the mouse cursor is visible on your screen at all times (it's a huge immersion-breaker but you can always just hide it in the corner of your screen; several unofficial fixes exist as well)\n\n$20 is the perfect price tag for a game of this sort. There's a serviceable amount of work here to satisfy any fan yet again and newcomers will most likely enjoy what is undoubtedly the definitive edition of Resident Evil 1. It should be known, however, that there a few users still experiencing framerate issues -- mainly laptop users. All this being said, the game does run well for the majority of users and if you're lucky enough to be able to run the game at 60 FPS flawlessly: it's a real treat. If you own this game in some form already, you may want to consider some of the things written here prior to purchasing. This remaster gets a 7/10 from me.","January 20, 2015","true","55.7"," 85 of 99 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","85","99","3","12"

I was especially taken by surprise with the Doberman Zombies. What a beautiful type of dog, they really put you at ease straight away. Then you arrive in a dark, intriguing mansion.\n\nAs you can tell, this game is a survival / horror type of game. What you have to do is find useful items to lead you to the next stage of the story. And yes, you do have a bit of fighting in it. My first encounter with a zombie was memorable for him as my so-called rubber knife (combat knife) was not the greatest weapon for me.  I settled for a KO in my first fight.  Evil resident all right! Anyway, you will find a gun really early in the game.\n\nWhen you find a typewriter, which is where you can save your progress, I would suggest you do so. But make sure you have ink in your inventory to be able to save.\n\nOne thing I had a bit of difficulty getting used to was the camera changing angles quiet a lot and you have to keep readjusting the direction your character is walking /running.  But I guess this game was originally release for console.

I found the best way on a keyboard was to play with the original "tanky" style since it had much more fluent animation and just better control. I also forgot to mention that before you start you have alternate character costumes. You can play as Chris from RE1 or Chris from RE5. For Jill, play her from RE1 or from Lost in Nightmares (Personally, the classic Jill is badass).\n\nTL;DR: The game is great and you should buy it, plain and simple.\n\nNow, through what I played so far this is an excellent HD REmake of the GameCube version which is a remake of the ps1 version. I am currently playing with a ds4 controller and will try out the keyboard + mouse soon in an updated review but for now, I'm going to tell you what I love and what I hate (which is almost none besides a few gripes). Firstly, they did and EXCELLENT job at making the graphics pretty and nice plus the option for the video. The key thing I personally love is the refresh rate and the frame rate options are two different settings. Why do I love it? It is because I can have my refresh rate be 59.0 and my frame rate at 60 and v-sync won't have any lag in my mouse or slow downs in general like other games I have. Another key feature I like is the option to have either the new or old control scheme. This is where one of my gripes are but mostly a personal problem. I choose the new control scheme and it works really well and the analog stick, no matter what direction, keeps the same movement your character goes while entering into a new camera. Although if you move it a little to turn it goes a whole new way but like I said before I probably need to get adjusted to it. I recently played re1 and re2 with an emulation program on my computer and I have absolutely no problem playing the so called "tanky" movement in those games so if i can't get used to it, I can go to the classic play-style.  All in all, this is a great game to buy if you want to a.) re-live the horror that is resident evil one or b.) never had the chance to play it in your lifetime. This is not a horrible purchase and I'm emphasizing that because you really need to buy it.","January 19, 2015","true","3.8"," 78 of 110 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","78","110","5","1"

For horror fans, this is a game you can't miss. Heck, RE1 and the RE1 Remake both changed my life, and it's even the reason I ended up learning how to play the piano, due to the part in the game where you play the Moonlight Sonata.\n\nEither way, the HD remake is amazing. It's what Resident Evil is supposed to play and feel like. This is ACTUAL SURVIVAL horror, not the crap they try to make now with "Resident Evil 6" which shouldn't even be a numbered RE game.\n\nThe atmosphere in the game is terrific, while the enemies and the creepy ambience and music will always make sure to keep you on your toes. You never know what's on the other side of a door or just around the corner, even if it's a room you've been to before. Not to mention, once you beat the game with one character, you can play it again with the second character which changes the game completely and adds new cutscenes, dynamics and so on so forth. There's definitely a lot of replayability here. Plus, there's more than one way to solve a lot of the areas, meaning if you playthrough one time, you may try a different route the second playthrough and you'll find new cutscenes and new ways to do things.\n\nFor those who hated the controls in the original game, or if you were scared because you heard of the "dreaded" tank controls, then don't worry! They've made it so you can play with an all new control scheme that makes it much easier to play the game with. Although I prefer the old style, this is definitely good thing for those who are big on their controls. :)\n\nSeriously, don't miss out on this game that helped define the true survival horror genre. And who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and they'll do an RE2 and RE2 Remake. :) Hopefully! (Plus it'd be great to see a Resident Evil 0 HD release too!)\n\n10/10.

Wide-screen support included of course.\nControls are fully customisable and intuitive (only played with mouse & keyboard so far, can't talk about controller, but m&kb work perfectly).\nSteamworks (achievements, trading cards etc) included and working fine.\n\nSo about the game:\nIf you haven't played it yet, well you've certainly missed one of the best - if not THE best - survival horror games.\nAmmo is scarce, saving is limited. That helps to increase an already scary atmosphere and will keep you on your toes throughout. This is one of the few games that actually manage to scare me, because the atmosphere is just brilliant.\n\nOnly thing I miss are the trashy videos of the original release (the ones with amateur actors, not the animated ones from the Gamecube remake which have been used here - look them up on YT if you don't know them!).\nThat and for some reason the creepy "RESIDENT EVIL" voice-over only appears when starting a new game, not when you load one. This last issue seriously needs to be fixed. Also it's not the same voice-over from the old version, which was creepier.\nSo as you can see, if I have time to criticize the game for those issues then there can't be much else to criticize.\n8.5/10, fully recommended!","February 4, 2015","true","13.7"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","32","37","3","7"

Both the character's model and the pre-render background has been redetail eyegasm-ing-ly, while keeping the errie atmosphere strong with its classic's fixed camera angle. What's cool. At the start of a new game (very easy, easy and normal), they do offer Jill's and Chris' alternate BSSA costume from RE5; and an optional -alternate control- for newcomers that don't want to bother with the classic's tank controls (TANK RULES).\n\nYou should get this game ONLY IF you have the patience learning from your trial & error. Expect to die a lot and learning how to evade enemies just to spare the necessary ammo/health items. This game also requires A LOT of backtracking for looking and examining through items to solve puzzles while progressing through the mansion and it's secrets. What makes this game so much fun is practically learning how to improve yourself by learning the mansion's layout and character's routes effectively while being cautiously mindful of your limited resources.\n\nI would give this game a hell YES.\n\nENTER THE SUVIVOR HORROR.","December 18, 2015","true","40.3"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

What you once were is now gone, and this REmaster is a very nice REminder of how great you were. It has been quite some time since I played a true survival horror game. Dropped into a maze without the game telling you where to go or how to solve puzzles, with a limited amount of resources and saves (that get even more limited with the increase in difficulty) is the best.\n\nThis remake is an example of how remakes should be done, with upgraded visuals and added content that was not in the original. However, this is essentially an HD version of the GameCube remake that I'm sure plenty of people did not get the chance to play, with a couple of extra options to make the game more welcoming.\n\nUnfortunately for those people who need/want the game to be more welcoming, the fixed camera is still in the game, and the optional control scheme can get a little wonky when the camera switches. It isn't terrible and it works fine, but I still recommend using the original tank controls, which I believe feel great using the keyboard. Keyboard and mouse controls are customizable, but the gamepad controls has 5 presets.\n\nThe atmosphere, oh man the atmosphere. This game put me on edge throughout my first playthrough of the game, and it still surprises me at times. Fixed camera angles help give the game tension by being placed in specific corners of the room where you know something is in there with you, but you don't know exactly where. You will want to listen for any sounds that the enemies make before progressing. And the sounds. Footsteps, zombie moans, gun fire that breaks the silence, the sounds are very well done and add to the atmosphere immensely.\n\nThere aren't a lot of games that really make me think, and even though I've played through the game countless times, I still think about what I'm doing and what items I want to bring with me to be as efficient as possible to escape the Spencer estate. This game has a very enjoyable experience, and I highly recommend buying it if you have the hardware for it.","February 6, 2015","true","19.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","23","25","2","0"

Resident Evil is one the brightest stars in the night sky of survival horror games and rightfully so - the original game released in 1996 caused quite a stir among gamers and journalist alike and now we get to play a heavily freshened up version of the eternal classic which graced Gamucube console back in 2002. Yes, it may be so that the current RE games have wandered way off its original roots, but I guess modern times dictatate requirements which are no longer what they used to be back at the beginning of 2000's. The remake has it all: eerie atmosphere and haunting music to fit it, scarce ammo, slowly walking zombies which are the mascots of the whole series just as much as Jill and Chris are. Controls may seem a bit cranky and outdated but that is why the game is a real blast from the past:)) I am pretty sure every survival horror fan or somebody who is just curious to taste the genre for him/herself will most definitely find it more then just interresting and immersive.

So to see that Capcom has re-released one of the best classics is truely amazing! I had given up hope after each year passed and another modern style Resident Evil was released. It felt like my favorite series was being butchered even more and more.\n\nTo get more to the point, Resident Evil HD Remaster is exactly what you would expect. It's a smoothly running port of the gamecube remade version of the original Resident Evil for PS1. The backgrounds look pretty well done and the controls are flawless. Not only can you use the standard tank movement as the classic Resident Evil titles used, but you can have an alternate control method wich allows you to move the analog stick in any direction to move that way.\n\nYou can either choose 4.3 or 16.9 screen settings as well. In wide screen, the top and bottom edges of the scenes are cut off but the camra scrolls up and down depending on the position of your character.\n\nIn edition to this great game, leaderboards with residentevil.net support have been added as well as a gallery for the cutscenes, two extra costumes (one for Chris and Jill each) are added to the player select menu.\n\nAny fan of the Resident Evil classics or ANYONE looking ofr a solid adventure survival horror experience should support this fantastic remaster and BUY THIS game.

If you enjoyed any other game in the series, and have yet to try this one out, definitely give it a shot. If you're new to the series, this REmaster of the 2002 REmake of the 1996 original is a great place to start. I always particularly enjoyed the art style and atmosphere of the REmake and RE0 (also getting an HD remaster), and now with the upgraded resolution, textures, and lighting effects, it's that much more immersive. Even after playing through as both characters, there are plenty of extra game modes that require you to change up your strategy in order to progress. The amount of content you receive for the price makes the purchase well worthwhile. A common criticism of the older RE games (although one that I personally don't find problematic) is that tank controls are difficult for beginning players to get a feel for. Fortunately, this version features an optional Silent Hill 2-esque alternative control scheme, in which the character moves in the direction pressed. So go on and grab your Samurai Edge and try not to smoke too many green herbs.\n","September 10, 2015","true","75.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","19","21","3","0"

If you're an old fan of the franchise then I probably don't need to convince you any further, because you know what to expect: the game is still as good as ever! In fact even better with the revamped visuals!\nBut if you never played any Resident Evil before, then it's a great one to start with, as this game defined the survival horror genre and set standards for years. With the additional new control mechanics fans of the newer Resident Evil games can feel comfortable, while the old-school tank controls still present to please the older fans.\n\nResident Evil Remaster is a must-have for anyone who likes the survival horror genre or appreciates great games in general!\n\nLong review:Two teams of heavily armed, trained cops sent into a forest to investigate a murder case. What could go wrong?\n\n1998, mysterious murders occur in the peaceful town of Raccoon City. Special Tactics and Rescue Service Bravo team has been sent to investigate the nearby Arklay mountain forest but gone missing. S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team is sent out to search for the missing Bravo, but is attacked by a pack of hellish dogs. After seeking refuge in a seemingly abandoned mansion nearby. You lose most of your equipments and the real fight for survival begins!\n\nThis is where you come in. There are two playable characters to choose from: Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, both with their distinctive gameplay, strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe game focuses on slowly building tension, atmosphere and well-timed jump scares that will induce panic reactions. Your resources will be limited, as well as your save opportunities so item management plays an important role in your survival. Puzzles are also present in this game. They are not too hard, but will certainly require your perceptual skills as well finding diaries containing vital informations for your progression.\n\nEnemies are well placed, and will often manage to catch you off-guard. Thanks to the narrow mansion corridors even one slow zombie can give you a hard time. Additionally to the classic Resident Evil zombies, the Remaster version (just like the Gamecube edition) features a new enemy type called Crimsonhead. When a zombie is incapacitated, it will enter a dormant state after which it will return with increased strenght and speed. To prevent this unfortunate event new mechanics have been introduced, so you will be able to dispose of the seemingly lifeless corpses by burning them. This will again provide you with an interesting challenge, since kerosene is also limited and can be found at certain points of the map. And trust me there will be more than enough zombies to make you think twice whether it's worth the risk trying to kill them!\nOverall the gameplay is challenging and maybe frustrating if you're not familiar with the genre, but extremely satisfying and rewarding at the same time!\n\nControl wise the tank controls are still present for old-school fans, but a new control option has been added as well to suit the players who are not too keen on the original control scheme.\n\nGraphically the remastered version improved a lot upon the Gamecube version. There's still some blurry textures here and there, due to age of the game this port is based on, but the overall result is very much amazing, especially with the improved lighting and small details added to this edition.\n\nResident Evil 1 HD Remaster is a real treat for any horror fans, and an excellent opportunity for old fans who have missed out on this title, due to its' Nintendo exclusivity until now!\nSo check your guns, the Spencer Mansion awaits as you enter the origin of survival horror!\n\n\nPROS- Excellent atmosphere\n- Challenging and the same time rewarding gameplay\n- Perfect pacing, the game can be hard but will never be unfair\n- Impressive, well thought up level design\n- Plenty of replayability thanks to additional game modes and several ending conditions\n\nCONS- Can't bind same button for different actions\n- Mouse icon won't disappear from screen. It can be hidden, but still...","January 20, 2015","true","37.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

I don't need to tell you this plays differently than the more recent Resident Evils, ammo is scarce, but you can get around that by learning to dodge enemies by luring them into lunging or hugging a wall as you run.  It's incredibly atmospheric, and a bit hard to learn, you have to examine a lot of areas fairly thoroughly, and even use the Examine function on certain items in order to proceed.  Don't let its initial difficulty scare you off, once you learn the basics it's all fun.  Plenty of unlockables and incentives to replay, an excellent remaster and a great addition to any horror fans' library, I firmly believe this game is an essential game to play for anyone who claimsto like scary games.

There's an issue with some Nvidia/AMD cards that runs cutscenes in slow-motion, but you can fix it by setting the framerate to variable, and turning off vsync should help as well. More fixes are addresses in discussion.\n\nFor those of you that played RE back in the PS days but never owned a Nintendo product: REmake is worth your time and effort, the differences aren't just cosmetic, Capcom tightened up gameplay and enemy types to make sure you're not having an easy time.\n\nAnd now for those of you who've never played Resident Evil: I'm not sure how best I can put this to you, but I think this gets the point across: This game is one of a kind.\n\nThere was nothing like Resident Evil before 1996, and despite the fact that was the first game to be classified as a 'survival horror', despite the fact that hundreds of horror games have come out since then, despite the fact that the market today is flooded with games of similar eerie atmosphere and setting, there hasn't been anything like RE since. Except of course for its sequels, until the remake came out in 2002.\n\nThis game will scare you and you will still want to play it. You'll figure out how to dodge zombies, drop attack dogs, kill giant plant monsters, fry spiteful fish, and you'll feel good about being in control for a few minutes, but then it's back to the mansion, back to running into something that could kill you unless you use your precious ammunition. There's something around the corner, you can hear its breathing. You don't have the advantage of moving the camera around so that you see it before it sees you, you're bound by the beautifully composed camera frame. The music is haunting and will put you on edge, but the alternative is no music at all, just the sound your footsteps in an empty room. Those *are* your footsteps, right?\n\nYou will learn not to shoot. You will learn that two guns mean two ammo types and maybe that crappy knife is better for your inventory. You will learn to look at a map and know instinctively which hall, room, balcony or yard that shape represents. You will learn not to pick up every item you see, even health and ammo. You will learn that never using the kerosene will cost you dearly. You will learn how to survive.\n\nOr you'll die, a lot, and you'll learn not to do what you did next time. The point I'm getting at here is, rotate your saves.\n\nEnter the Survival Horror c:<","January 23, 2015","true","12.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

There is hardly anything else to add. This is quite possibly the best remake of any classic PS1 title out there and that is saying a lot. It stays true to the original in many ways and only slightly adds in new stuff to improve the experience. This is a game only for the die hard nostalgia survivor lover, new generation might not like it since they don't have nostalgia goggles from the original.\n\nFor the price it's worth is since this game is only available on Wii for an insane amount since it's a collectible and the original Gamecube version probably is even more rare. It's true that great games come to the PC side not to sell insane amounts, but to last for generations to come. Pick this up if you're a fan or never got a chance to play this because our generation will soon phase out and games will no longer be made for us or catered to our classic tastes.\n\nIt's already happening. Soon we will be too old to care to criticise the new games for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they will become worse and worse, but there's a whole new generation who don't know better who will eat it up thinking it's the best ♥♥♥♥!\n\nBut is this a good port?\nIt is. It looks great, has some extra shading options and shadow options and you can remap all the keys well. It has some issues with VSYNC which will slow the game down on some graphic cards so I highly recommend disabling it completely to get a very smooth over 60 FPS experience. Capcom is known to know how to make some decent PC ports and this is one of them. It could've had more options in my opinion and it does come with some weird useless gimmick for leaderboards that most of us will ignore but overall it's a good PC port of a classic remake.

Fans of the series hated it though because it was focused on action and didnt have the same atmossphere as in the first 4 RE games. However in a vacuum I think RE5 is actually a really good game. Then I played Resident Evil 6, I really liked the Leon campaign, but hated the other two (stopped playing both after their first mission).\nThen when RE4 Ultimate HD version came to Steam I thought this is a perfect time to try that game, especially because most people say that RE4 is the best of the series. However I was very dissapointed, its a very good game, but there wasnt a single scary moment (RE5 is like RE4, why people ♥♥♥♥♥ at RE5 and not 4?) and the spanish setting was annoying. So for me RE5 is better even in context of the franchise (RE4 is still really good).\n\nFinally we got Resident Evil 1 in a very good remaster for PC and I thought now is the chance to see where this series is truly coming from and I have to say I´m blown away! I dont know how much they changed from the original, but this game is surprisingly good and playable even by todays standards. However if you are someone who started playing games at the X360/PS3 generation you might have problems getting into this, this game doesnt hold your hand AT ALL (which is great).\nRE1 reminds me a lot of Dark Souls, the level design, the save system, the difficulty, the exploration and even the storytelling to a degree. If you are looking for a similar experience as Dark Souls, a game where everything is a challenge and where it is very hard to make progress but every bit of progress is extremely rewarding and with extremely intense atmossphere then this might be the best game for you (the gameplay is completely different though for obvious reasons).\n\nThis is exactly the type of game I was looking for a long time and I wish the industry would go back to do more games like this (Dark Souls for example). Most of todays games dont keep me motivated to play for long sessions, most games I play maybe 1-3 hours per day, but RE1 kept me motivated for 4-6 hours per session which is crazy. I think this is especially true because of the very rewarding nature of the puzzles, rewarding exploration and variety in the game.\nYou can choose between 2 characters at the start, both have small differences here and there and play differently and Im very eager to finish this game and start a new game with the other character.\n\nThe port is really good, however I recommend using a gamepad. The keyboard controls are fine in theory, but since the game has fixed camera angles and very tight corridors its a little annoying to move around with keyboard, its not the worst thing ever just keep this in mind!","January 26, 2015","true","15.5"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","25","38","6","0"

Game runs perfect with no issue and constant 60fps @ 4k.  The character got a really nice touch up and looks very nice.  You can pick between the orginal costume of Jill and Chris or the more tactical of the newer games.\n\nIf you played revelation, Jill looks just as nice here.  The pre-rendered background can at times look nice in certain area and look pixelated in others.  Some area are hit or miss.  I didn't have any sounds or fps issue.\n\nThe scare factor is not there anymore since it is an old game but the feel and old school formula is great to play again and feels like a survival horror because every bullet does count.  Gone are the days of carry 50 lbs of ammo and unlimited guns.  You are going to have to think long and hard about what items to carry and what items to leave. The Tank control take some use to again but once you do its fine.  Overall a great game remake but I do believe its worth around $15.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/A_xkNvb1VAA Some 4K Gameplay from me.","January 20, 2015","true","59.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vasid/recommended/304240/","vasid","Vasid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vasid/","236 products in account","So I haven't played a ton of this port yet, but what I have played runs at 1080p 60FPS and looks lovely so there is that. Also worth note about the port is that the achivements, while few, include some of the more difficult achievments which formerly were self-imposed fan favorites like survive using only the knife or don't save. A nice touch.\n\nMain reason I'm recommending it though is the fact that over two different consoles I've beaten this game 8+ times, including a couple of times with friends. It's the best Resident Evil game we got and as good as the series is going to get by the looks of it. It is worthy of being beaten once, beaten again, speed run, and run through again with an alt costume; That's how good this game is. With a fun campy plot that perfectly plays in to a comfy B-grade movie style, gameplay that reminds you at every harsh turn that this is a challenge of survival, and stunning graphics and immersive sound design that will send shivers down your spine; it all mixes in to a potent combination worthy of your time and money.\n\nLet's talk a bit more about the port now that I've played a bit more. Character models have greater detail and feel more than just simply upscaled, and I believe the same is true of the environments, though occasionally it is still obvious that you're looking at a pre-rendered background, still the game always had a good looking art style and it only looks better now with the small touches made. The biggest change to the port is the ability to play the game in either it's native fullscreen or a new pan and scan widescreen. This new pan and scan widescreen is a logical way to force a game otherwise designed for fullscreen in many ways to fit the more demanded modern perspective, and the game looks nice in it, still the pan and scan is a little disorenting and occasonally feels a little slow to respond. I haven't had any problems with it yet, but it's not hard to imagine them. Still, I can't complain, it's an option, and a nice one at that, if you don't like it you can simply choose to view it in the orginal mode and enjoy it as it was designed. I wish more companies would offer optional upgrades like this on their remakes. Speaking of nice optional upgrades; it would have been nice to have the option to turn off the super shiny items, they're classic, but at the same time with the new larger screen it really feels unnecessary, it's nice to actually be able to make out what you're about to pick up before you do, we've come a long way.\n\nSo far from what I've played it's a perfect port of what has long been a must have for fans of Survival Horror. Unless I encounter any errors further down the line this is probably the ultimate version of this title, and I feel confident saying that as someone who has played every version.\n\nPro-tip: Use control Type E with a controller, it allows you to run and turn at the same time. This has been the best way to control the old-school Resident Evils since the Gamecube versions introduced it and I'm extremely happy to see it included.","January 19, 2015","true","5.6"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","30","48","0","0"

Plot is basically non-existant, but RE series was never known for good plot or story telling, if anything I prefer the setting where almost nothing is explained, you're not halted every few steps to talk to someone cliche or uninteresting. Dialog is for the most part atrocious, but as I sad with it being not the main point of the game, I can forgive the cheesy lines of voice over actors. It leaves the player to his/her own imagination, to find out what happened in this mansion and it's surrounding areas, It doesn't give you big pointy glowing arrows for objectives, so that might be discouraging to same players that have never tried playing the original games. The game just explains what it is through atmosphere and tense encounters with deadly monsters and the documents you find in the enviroment.. Only thing that will take more time than running around and cleaning B.O.W's, is puzzle solving. Really refreshing to finally see some interesting puzzle solving, that seemed to evaporate, the further the series went into B-Grade action crapfest. The game is not new, so I can't give too many points for crafting interesting puzzles, because this game is from 2002, back when cryptic gameplay wasn't frowned upon by reviewers, simply because it encouraged thinking and solving them, sometimes even under pressure. Graphics are nice, the enviroments look great, but they were supposed to, because it's all pre-rendered and the fixed camera angles make it easy to show that shine. Character textures could be slightly more high quality, but I'm not complaining, in due time modding can take care of that issue. Controls work well, there are options to satisfy both, the serie's purists (tanky clunky controls) and more modern spin of tanky controls, where it's slighly simplyfied to fit modern needs of common gamers. Sound design is amazing, though personally I think that it still lacks the certain eerie score that for ex: Resident Evil 2 had. Gun sound effects feel meaty and powerful. Zombies moan, groan, slither in the mansion halls, with equally terrifying shadow and lighting effects.\n\nI'm really hoping CAPCOM begins to understand, that to make something good, you need to comeback to it's roots. I definitely would like them to re-release more older Resident Evil games with HD textures and better visuals, while retaining the same charm of the series that gathered the massive fanbase, but I also want them to make new entries in the series, without losing what this series was known, and is known worldwide.","January 23, 2015","true","19.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","0"

It simply works, and works well: sure the game might not be "scary" but it has a strong atmosphere going for it and can still surprise you a few times.\n\nThe game is still as old school as ever though apart from the new coat of paint and improved controls. So expect to have to manage your inventory quite often and, when you fail to do so, be forced to trek back to an item box to free space or simply get a puzzle item you've forgotten behind. Also the titular "slow-unskippable-door-animation-for-every-room" can get dull after a bit, but if it gets on your nerves too much there seems to be a mod for it. Still, well, changing these mechanics would take away some of Resident Evil's charm itself or lower the sense of danger.\n\nWhether you're looking to experience the game for the first time or simply want to jump in it again this HD remaster is simply the place to be and is worth the purchase; it's pretty much faultless if you can go past its sometimes clunky mechanics.","March 1","true","15.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","2"

I am playing with Jill on easiest and 9 hours in still have a lot to explore and beat (based on achievements), although it is possible to complete the game within 3 hours!  I am enjoying it although am finding some game mechanics irratating like only being able to carry 8 items and having limited saves. This means I have to trapse around fiddiling with items and then get killed before realising I have to trapse around the same places again. This isn't that bad though as the environment changes throughout the game, so re-visiting places is actually useful, plus the next time you are more prepared for surprises. I had one major jumping incident due to smashed glass, and there are always a scare or two to throw at you. Ammo is limited, which is a pain when you waste a load on something that can't be killed. The graphics are really nice and the story is engaging.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/recommended/304240/","dfactor","Dfactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/","1000 products in account","After playing for 22 hours and finishing the game thrice I can say that...\nThis is easily the best version of Resident Evil Remake ever created. Sure, it currently has a couple of bugs for some people, but they were expected. Considering this is a remaster of 2002 game the plot / mechanics / gameplay reviews are around for 13 years. I'll be covering the technical details of this port.\n\nThe Visuals & Performance.\nThe remastered backgrounds are the same across all platforms. There are plenty of good looking areas, decent looking, heavily filtered lower resolution backgrounds and some are the same as in original. It's somewhat inconsistent, the devs told us that they wanted to make everything look authentic, same as in the original (only better, sharper) but it seems that some decisions weren't the best.\nMost of the moving video backgrounds were remade into 3D objects. They're affected by your screen's resolution and also blend in nicely. Easily the best looking backgrounds. Note: some entire rooms / angles were made completely in 3D.\nThe character models are improved, they look better (higher polygon count, better textures), they have improved facial animations, they move more naturally (improved animations) and they don't stick out as much as in the original (thanks to the new lighting). All the enemies are well detailed and, surprisingly, the nude zombies weren't censored.\nThe lighting makes the characters look really organic, there are improved light sources, shadows, some bloom effects and subtle film grain were added.\nThe port currently offers up to 1080p (up to 2160p though .ini edit, but it seems that it just upscales 1080p) and 120fps. For anti-aliasing there are different variations of FXAA, but it seems it's also possible to force other AA methods on the executable. Pre-rendered cutscenes run at 30fps. The PC version runs smooth, the screen transitions are almost instant and there are no framedrops.\nAny recent mid range (and higher) desktop graphics card can run this maxed out at 60fps+. People who do not read minimum system requirements and have low than minimum specs can end up with several results: a) the game runs at it should, b) the game launches but has really low framerates, c) the game doesn't launch at all or is in slow motion. Integrated and laptop cards are not officially supported, but may work.\nIt's another well optimized MT Framework game.\n\nAdvertised features, settings, options, controls and more.\nThe game now is playable in 16:9 (moving camera) and 4:3 (original), they're switchable on the go.\nThe sound is absolutely fantastic. It's clean sounding and is in 5.1.\nThere are new higher quality video files cutscenes (for both 4:3 and 16:9).\nThere are two control schemes: original tank and new, modern one. Both usable on a controller and a keyboard&mouse setup. The keyboard keys are completely rebindable and, surprisingly, K&M works quite well! It's really comfortable as long as you rebind the inventory (let's say to Tab) and map buttons. it's possible to switch control schemes on the go.\nThe game allows some minor stat tracking. Visit residentevil.net, link it to your Steam and you'll be able to see your global progress, unlocked weapons, defeated creatures and achievements.\nAll the previous unlockables and game modes from the GC version are still there.\nThere's a new "Very Easy" game mode now.\nNew BSAA outfits / character models.\nThere are most likely going to be character swap mods.\n\nThings I'd like to see.\nWhile MT framework allows almost any resolution it seems like it's locked to 1080p. Increasing it through .ini file edits will only upscale.\nMouse cursor should be hidden when outside of inventory screen.\nSkippable doors (there's already a mod for that)\n\nProblems caused by compatibility problems.\nPeople with underpowered systems, bad compatibility or that are simply unlucky may experience the following problems:\n-Extremely low framerates.\n-Slow motion.\n-Desynching audio.\n-Doesn't run at all.\n\nCommon problems.\n-Crashing when changing both resolution and window type (fullscreen, windowed).\n-Crashing when alt tabbing (+having steam overlay on) a lot.\n-The game is displayed incorrectly on 4:3 resolutions (cropped 16:9).\n\nHopefully most of these issues will be patched soon.\n\nI'll update the review when I get my hands on new info and / or play more.","January 20, 2015","true","80.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","3"

The original Resident Evil made its debut on the first Playstation console in early 1996, and since then the series of games have captivated audiences with the unique approach to zombies, complex story line, and array of well-rounded characters. Not to mention, the opening live action sequence to the primordial release is absolutely hilarious. The remake of this classic title made its first appearance on Gamecube back in 2002, and that is the version that qualified for this high-definition upgrade that was released in early 2015.\n\nThe game takes place within a giant mansion on the outskirts of Raccoon City. At the beginning of the game, you are allowed to pick between two main characters to play as; either former-US military pilot Chris Redfield, or explosives expert Jill Valentine. At this time in the series, both characters belong to Raccoon City's own special force, S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service). The player will experience a mildly different set of events depending on which character is chosen, and there is added replay value in going through the game at least a second time with the opposite person. The gamer will then explore the many corridors, rooms, and hallways of the massive mansion, all the while solving puzzles, fending off grotesque abominations, and managing a tight inventory space.\n\nSeeing as this is the first Resident Evil title, the story line is pretty bare bones in comparison to later games. You will find out about the T-Virus and the wretched enemies that have spawned from it, along with a small glimpse into who and what makes up Umbrella Corporation. Going into this game without the knowledge from prequel Resident Evil 0, some questions are left unanswered; which is expected, if a game is expecting a sequel. There are also only three major bosses and a handful of enemies, and this might seem lazy for a game made in 2002. However, we must remember that the remake was based off of the 1996 game, and the limitations of data storage on a disc were much more confined back then. Rather than having a large number of enemies, the main focus of the original Resident Evil is exploration and survival rather than fighting many battles.\n\nWith the basics out of the way, we can now discuss the actual Resident Evil HD Remaster. Capcom have done an amazing job with bringing the 2002 version of Resident Evil to life in brilliant high-definition. The character models are crisp and sharp, the spotless floors of the mansion gleam, water has outstanding reflection, the backgrounds are clear, and the monsters look great. The atmosphere in the game breeds death and decay, the fog in some areas is so thick and pronounced that you can almost feel it soaking your skin. Likewise, the audio is completely immersive and crystal clear, the 5.1 surround sound breathes incredible life into the title. To boot, the game itself does not suffer from any glitches, bugs, frame rate issues, or crashes; at least in my experience.\n\nI've never seen Resident Evil so deliciously alive as it is in this HD Remaster. From the aesthetic character model visuals, to new high resolution textures, atmospheric development, and completely immersive 5.1 surround sound audio, everything is overwhelmingly stunning. One thing that may put some people off is that Capcom decided to leave in the door animations; for those that are unfamiliar with early Resident Evil games, each time a door is opened a small cutscene plays showing the door opening. This also goes for some elevators and ladders. Originally, these were used in lieu of boring loading screens, and while it would be a nice option to be able to toggle this feature on and off, the inclusion keeps the dark, cult-classic vibe of the game within the HD Remaster. If you're a fan of Resident Evil, or even if you're new to the series or have been interested in playing it, I highly suggest picking up this HD Remaster; for $20 CAD, you really can't go wrong. I do also highly suggest picking up Resident Evil 0 and playing it prior to this game.\n\nRating: 5.0/5.0 - An amazing achievement, this game must be played.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 10","true","35.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It is an even better remaster, with a high range of resolutions up to 4k and enhanced lighting to top it off. The environments are a tad bit blurry though, playing at 1080p. Some additions are game changers, like the alternate movements scheme, allowing you to go in any direction on the fly, similar to games like Devil May Cry. This makes it incredibly easy to juke enemies. But the old tank controls are there too. However, I found it hard to go back to tank controls after playing the game with the alternate movement. It also manages to spice up the game when you revisit areas, like dogs jumping in through the windows, or this one time I was examining a toilet and a hunter burst into the room and sliced my head off. I wasn't even mad. There is also widescreen support, but it takes away a lot of the environments because it is just zoomed in 4:3. That's why I highly recommend playing it in 4:3, if you can stomach it. The PC version runs at 60 FPS. Even the next-gen consoles only support 30 FPS, so definately get this version if you are on the fence on whether to get the console or PC edition. Also this is the first game I ever played where you recover health from smoking herbs and getting high.

Guess what? We do!\n\nResident Evil HD remastered (REHD) Is a third person survival horror game based on the Game Cube version remaster of the 1996 PSone classic, So yes the remake of a remake.\n\nI didn't have the opportunity to play the Game Cube version so I was very excited to get my hands on it and I must say I wasn't dissapointed. The game has really impressive visuals, the work with the lighting here is very impressive. The fixed camera  can be a deal breaker for many, but in my opinion it just helps to build the most important aspects of these games, the atmosphere, and that is where the game shines, giving you a feeling of being constantly watched and that you are never truly alone, even when you dispatched all the monsters. the limited health items, ammo and saves combined with the lack of continues keeps you tense at all times, knowing that if you die you have to restart from your previous save and you can't be constantly saving.\n\nThe story and voice acting may not be the best out there but you don't really buy a RE game for those things anyway.\n\nI think this game is a really good value for the money as it will easily squeese at least 10 hours out of your time, all that for just $20. get it, enjoy it and join me as I wait for Capcom to remaster RE2 (my personal favorite)","March 1, 2015","true","13.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

Capcom managed to keep the original charm and horror that makes resident evil so memorable and improve on it without ruining or breaking the game. The features that are added to this classic are integrated so well that you would think it is a part of the original game and really gives the game new life. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan or has never played the original "survivor horror."

However Capcom did a horrible job to get this one on PC. The game was in slow motion and the sound and voices were desync (sorry if I didn't write this word correctly). This was a nightmare, a horror as it was unbearable and I thought I wasted 20 buck. Capcom didn't even fixed theses errors. Instead, RE fans had to. After a while, I managed to find a solution in the discussion page. After clicking a link that someone posted for downloading the patch and installing it, the game now runs smoothly. So far so good... but I am still mad about Capcom not doing anything.

It's probably the best Resident Evil game up to date, almost everything is how it should be. Great atmosphere, slow paced and well thought through gameplay including fixed camera angles and highly limited items.\nPuzzles play a main role in this game, with enemies being a constant threat to your survival while you wander through the great Spencer Mansion, probably one of the best game settings ever.\nA great soundtrack accompanies the player through the game, further increasing the immersion of the game.\nStory-wise this game is nothing new, and it dosen't have to be: We got Chris, Jill, Barry, Rebecca and of course Wesker all in one game, RE fans can't ask for more. The somewhat cheesy voice acting returns as well.\n\nThe only two negative points I would like to mention are, firstly, the "new" control scheme. It feels out of place for a RE game, as you have to readjust your thumbstick every time the camera angle switches. So my advice: Stick to tank controls!\n\nSecondly, some backgrounds do look blurry compared to others (Aqua Ring being the best example for this).\n\nSome people also reported slowdown problems during cutscenes and a few other bugs. Can't say much about that, since the game runs butter smooth for me.\n\nConclusion: One of the best games ever made, Resident Evil HD REMASTER takes the 2002 Gamecube REmake, polishes it and let's us relive the terror of Resident Evil in it's purest form.\n\n9.5/10 from my side.","November 5, 2015","true","108.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","5"

With the exception of a few touchups to some textures, controls and minimal additional content, it is pretty much the same version of the game that was released for the Nintendo Gamecube. Does the somewhat lazy approach to re-market a classic title take away some value from the title? I would say not in the least. I enjoyed the game because it allowed me to relive an old classic and in this case less is more.

Be aware that you will need to read documents that you collect and solve puzzles in order to proceed through the game or to make your life easier. I think that one of the best parts of the games is that you're not bombarded by a seemlessly infinite number of enemies. Use your resources (healing items and ammunition) wisely and choose your paths based on how they may affect your resources. There will be backtracking so pay attention to the environment so you know what you may need to bring along.\n\nI didn't have any technical problems with the game. No crashes and the audio and visual experience was good.\n\nDo know that the game's difficulty levels are basically Normal, Easy, and Very Easy; I didn't think about this, played through on Easy and ended up missing out on the final boss fight; I didn't know that would happen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insanelycool/recommended/304240/","Insanelycool","EschewObfuscation","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insanelycool/","105 products in account","It's a rare thing as a gamer to enjoy a game as much as RE. It manages to capture so many genres into a category of its own that we now call "survival-horror". It succeeds despite its flaws, and is a gem that begs you to replay it and explore every nook and cranny, even after all these years. I consider myself lucky that I never got to play the gamecube version, because I was able to experience the new twists, better dialog, and enjoy the "I don't remember it being like this" moments that come along (but perhaps not often enough) in a more modernized  graphical quality.\nLet me first explain that I love the original PSX title. I have many fond memories playing this game with my best friend when we were in middle school, the all-nighter sessions with the lights off, trying to be quiet to not wake up his mom, and sometimes failing because that hunter came out of nowhere and lopped off our head. The nostalgia alone makes this worth paying $50 for the remake, and to get it for $20 feels like a steal. I also bought and played the Directors Cut on the PSX, so I have truly played this game through and through. Having been over 15 years since my last play though felt like playing it for the first time in many ways, aside from still remembering most of the puzzles. It's amazing how engrained some things become in an avid gamers mind, even after a decade.\nThis game hits the mark on so many points, I can't begin to explain it and do justice to my experience. This is what survival horror is supposed to be. RE2 and 3 should be revisited and remastered as well (the same way or better than this one would be nice). The heart of this series is 1-3, and they deserve to be replayed after all these years. Capcom really screwed the pooch with everything after 3. I remember not liking 3 as much as the first 2 but that is a huge standard to meet after 2 improved on everything about the first game. I went back and played 3 again and realized how much I love that one as well, what I really hated about it was that it didn't advance the storyline from 2, only telling the other side of the 2 storyline in Racoon City. Capcom needs to finish the story line for real. Because waiting for the continuation from the RE2 cliffhanger feels like waiting for HL3... You just realize that the company is only interested in spitting in your face and making games they think you want. When You really want the next part of the story. Don't get me wrong, RE4 was fun, but it wasn't an RE game really, it was a fun departure that forgot about what made RE the true survival horror series. It might be too late for Capcom to turn back the past, but it's never to late for RE2-Part 2...\nAll that aside, RE HD is worth every cent and more, and if they give RE2 and 3 the same treatment, TAKE MY MONEY PLEASE!","February 7, 2015","true","25.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

There's no hand-holding here, it just throws you in the deep end and expects you to cope.\n\nAs for the port itself, the updates for this remastered version are largely welcome editions. Everything that is expected of modern-day ports is here: Widescreen support (which works flawlessly), 60fps (or uncapped framerate), V-Sync and Anti-Aliasing appear for the first time in the game. The original game from 2002 still looks beautiful even today but this remaster gets that little bit extra out of it, with new lighting, higher resolution textures and higher quality audio. The port is also very stable; I only had one crash to desktop in 26 hours (7 playthroughs). The only thing I can't comment on is the (optional) newly designed controls. I stuck with the original control layout as that's what I'm familiar with from the Gamecube version.\n\nThe achievements are also a nice little extra, especially if - like me - you have previously played the game on Gamecube/Wii. These achievements dare you to try new things, such as completing the game using only your knife, not using any ink ribbons (saves), or even playing the game with all the enemies invisible.\n\nIn short, one of the greatest horror games ever gets a fantastic port. There's plenty of unlockables and achievements to work towards, so there's loads of replay value here.","September 8, 2015","true","25.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Especially after driving the RE franchise name to the ground (my personal opinion, wont't mention it any more).\n\nSo, all in all - the game get's a 9.5/10!! Only issue for me were the controls (running only), because sometimes, when the camera angle changes, you get turned around and start running back from the direction you came from.

Resident Evil 1 is one of my favorite games of all time.  It holds a special place in my heart.  It got me into horror games when I was a child.  This is an excellent port (with some upgrades) of the Gamecube version.  First off, a controller is recommended for this.  If you're new to Resident Evil 1 be warned that this isn't like the newer games at all.  This is a true survival horror game and it can be quite a bit more diffcult than the newer games.  If you played the original Resient Evil and never played the Gamecube remake then this is a no brainer, buy it.

I'm so thankful to make this purchase.\n\nThe controls are a bit wanky at first especially on the new alternative control method since am not used to it. After spending 20hrs..i'd say that i didnt regret spending time and money on this. You will get hang of the controls after a while. Gamepad is recommended for fast play. If u wish to use the keyboard, the original control is the way.\n\nIn  terms of graphics, i'd say its quite a good looking game. Though some areas the background is a little bit blurry, but i wouldn't sweat it.\n\nGameplay is still a classic resident evil with multiple camera angles and limitation of saves and bullets. Which is pretty challenging. There are quite a few unlockables which is pretty interesting.\n\nThe sound is where it falls short. I've purchased this on PS4 as well and the 5.1 is amazing for PS4. But on the PC, its good but  not as great as the PS4 version. Voice acting and dialogues are still a little bit weak..good thing they don't talk much! LOL!\n\nOverall..i enjoyed  the game..and can't wait to try for the 5th time.

It's great to be able to play this  amazing "HD Remake" here again like those old days. The original Remake was released in 2002 for Nintendo GameCube and I remember the game looked awesome. I bet it was hard to redo a game that was considered one of the best PSX and SEGA Saturn games but they did a fantastic work, and as PS2 day-one user I was so envious of the GameCube back then :P\n\nRecently (in 2014) I was able to play this Remake on GC and I must say even though some parts looks slightly different I am very happy to play this gem!\n\nPros:- Of course the 1080p (scalable with a .ini modification) and the option to unlock the 60 FPS.\n- The 16:9 cropped aspect option.\n- Some little assets were re-done in 3D with the addition of some sprite details.\n- Some other details were also on the GameCube version and now we can appreciate this better. For instance, Jill dust behind her footsteps in some wooden floors.\n- The non-tank controls for newbies.\n- In general it looks great due to its original resolution. The new dynamic lighting and some other filters makes all integrate better.\n- Is good that they didn't change the original models and animations much (maybe Chris a bit).\n- Achievements. Yes, I support them for this kind of re-releases. You can approach new playthroughs to achieve something crazy like play the game in something I call "Asian Mode" haha (under 3 hours, without saving, only with the knife...well I'm exaggerating haha!...FYI they are separate achievements).\n\nCons:- The directional controls should have been a bit heavier and less responsible to make things fair and not that easy.\n- Tank controls with analog feels bad. The solution is to use the d-pad arrows (I recommend DualShock 4 because they have a better surface).\n- The High-pass filter / convolve sometimes makes.\n- Some 3D assets like statues and mechanisms don't have any improvement in textures, normals and models.\n- It's a shame they didn't have resources to re-render the backgrounds. In Resident Evil Archives books you can see some viewport of those XSI files. So it wasn't impossible. Just "not-affordable".\n- Some menus looks pixelated.\n\nMaybe it should have been named "RESIDENT EVIL / Biohazard HD Remake" but aside those cons I mentioned before, the game is 100% recommendable for horror fans and people who played games before the checkpoint and unlimited loot era haha! Now let's wait for the HD version of RE Zero and maybe a retail version of this amazing re-release.\n\nBTW I wish someday Steam and Capcom releases:\n- Resident Evil (1996)\n- Resident Evil 2\n- Resident Evil 3 Nemesis (and its funny Jill / Nemesis screen-savers haha!)\n- Resident Evil Code Veronica (the one who made me buy a Dreamcast back in 2001 and who was remastered for PS3 and Xbox 360 a few years ago)\n- And why not two in-viable ones RE Gun Survivor and RE Dead Aim :3 my guilty pleasures!","January 26, 2015","true","22.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This re-released remake combines tense exploration, satisfying creature blasting and some clever puzzles to form a uniquely exciting horror-mystery adventure. Unfortunately, beautifully touched up character models aside, not every asset was given the red carpet treatment in this version; most of the redone pre-rendered backdrops range from passable to stunning, but a handful look rather dreadful. Other issues including fonts and menu textures are also some sore spots. Though the difficulty and mechanics might feel decidedly 90s to newcomers, it's definitely more of a testament to the fact that some gaming quirks are simply timeless.\n\nThere's not much here to entice the once-and-done players who've perhaps played this a decade ago on their Gamecube, but anyone lacking experience with the older RE games, or those itching for a tasty new playthrough, should find the $20 price tag very reasonable.","January 19, 2015","true","9.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

While others doesn't look so good with this waterpaint effect they added in the 2D pre-rendered images. It still maintains the atmosphere of the game and it's pretty well done though. The addition of new areas outside of the mansion (compared to the original) is phenomenal. The addition of High Resolution Shadows and Anti Aliasing are very good too. There are some problems with Aspect ratio, but nothing major. You can set your own resolution in the config,ini file.\n\n\n\nGameplay 10/10\n\n-The same golden gameplay from the old Resident Evil titles. You'll be selecting from 2 characters (Jill or Chris) and go venture HELL through the Spencer Mansion with limited ammo, saves, health itens and inventory space. The gameplay is so much more smooth now in this version compared to the original (especially with the PC exclusive 60 fps feature) that it looks almost photorealistic.\n\nA few features were added like the new Defensive weapons and burning bodies. It adds very much to the already great original gameplay. If you're not familiar with the original RE gameplay, there is a modern control scheme just for you scrub.\n\nThe puzzles and progression resembles the ones from the Original, but they had been completely rearranged. It is a reimagination that will please both oldschool fans and newcomers. It is worth mentioning that Remake and the spencer mansion is way...WAY darker than the original.\n\n\n\nSound  9.0/10\n\n-All of the sound effects are great. Incluiding weapon's sound effects which are loud enough to satisfy you after a zombie head gets exploded. Menus, zombies moaning and creatures roar... theyr're all great. I'm giving this a 9 simply because of a problem affecting all of the versions of Resident Evil REmastered. Some of the music files are speeded up compared to the original, but thankfully to PC modding community you can find a fix for that.\n\nAlso, like the original...the music and mansion themes cuts out too much by going through new rooms. This can be a little bit annoying as sometimes you will only hear 3 seconds of the music because you will be entering the other rooms with no music at all.\n\nThe voice acting, while not as hilarious as the original, still gives you plenty of smiles. On the other side, it takes things more seriously this time and it adds to the horror atmosphere which is way darker in the Remake.\n\n\n\n\nPlot  10/10\n\n-Now the plot was the main surprise for me. This must be the very first Resident Evil game to push the "jump scare" horror a little bit further to the next level: Psychological horror. I will not spoil anything here, but you will find a particular family's story in this version to be very...very disturbing. Expect some sadness. All of the plot from the original is still present too.\n\n\nFinal Veredict: 9.2 / 10.\n\n+Surpassed my expectations. Better than the original. Sits now in my top 3 RE titles.\n\n- Some rooms looks mediocre and pixelated with the waterpaint filter.\n\n\nReplay value: 100% As not only there are 2 characters with different features and progression, but there are new modes which gets unlocked when you first beat the game too.","January 19, 2015","true","50.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kundahli/recommended/304240/","Kundahli","Kundahli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kundahli/","28 products in account","Resident Evil, the first title in the celebrated Resident Evil franchise, launched in 1996, was given its first HD update in 2002, and is now receiving a makeover yet again.  The fact that this game is still being cared for and modernized nearly 20 years after it’s release should stand as a testament to how truly marvelous it is.\n\nResident Evil opens with a team of S.T.A.R.S. special forces agents tasked with investigating a recent string of unusual deaths around Raccoon City.  The first squad tasked with the investigation loses radio contact and you and your team are sent in to find out what happened.  Soon after discovering the missing team’s downed helicopter you are attacked by feral dogs that are seemingly resistant to gunfire, forcing you to retreat to the nearby Spencer Mansion. Having barely escaped with your life, you enter the mansion only to be separated from your team.  Soon thereafter you encounter the flesh-eating creatures that the Resident Evil series is so well known for.  The rest of the game plays out with you unlocking the secrets of the mansion, learning exactly what these creatures are and where they came from, and reuniting with your team.\n\nArguably the most noteworthy aspects of Resident Evil are its environments. The Spencer Estate is beautiful, labyrinthian, and oozing with atmosphere.  It begs to be explored.  From the eerie crypts, brooding chambers, secret labs, and cramped corridors, the environment creates a sense of tension that grips the player from the moment a save is loaded straight through until the game is turned off.\n\nThe mansion itself is so intricately designed that it becomes a character within the game itself.   It unfolds slowly, revealing more of its secrets as you solve its puzzles and progress through the game.  The Spencer mansion is a masterpiece of game design from an age before open world games were the norm. Too often is the case now where “bigger” is often mistaken for “better” in world design.  The Spencer mansion is a reminder that great worlds are not measured by the quantity of their content, but rather by the quality of their character.\n\nYou navigate the illustrious locations of estate as one of two S.T.A.R.S. team members (selectable at the start of the campaign), collecting various artifact, clues, and weapons that will help you survive, solve puzzles (no hand-holding here) and find your team. You begin the game extremely vulnerable having only a knife for basic self-defense, little knowledge of the mansions layout, and next to no resources. At this stage you will run from threats, worrying about your ability to heal, trying to conserve ammunition, fearing if you will be prepared for what’s around the next corner.\n\nAs you grow more comfortable with the mansions layout you will grow more comfortable with combat, having amassed a small cache of ammunition, weapons and healing supplies. The slow moving flesh eaters will feel more like a nuisance than a threat at this point. However, the game’s difficulty will stride forward in tune with your emboldened character by throwing new, more vicious enemies your way. Thus, even as your character advances the sense of challenge and fear of death remains.  The timing of these progressions is expertly subtle, never feeling unfair or too easy.\n\nDespite Resident Evil’s wonderful exploration and pacing the game is not without its faults. Combat is without a doubt one of the most frustrating aspects of the Resident Evil series. This is largely due to a combination of camera angle and finicky third-person controls.  The camera angle in Resident Evil is dynamic, changing at each unique scene in the game.  Enter a long hallway and you can may find yourself viewing your on screen character from a vantage point on the opposite end. Walk into a tight room and you may be met with an over the shoulder view. Because the camera angles are locked in each discrete scene you will often find yourself aiming at enemies that are not fully visible on screen. Luckily, pulling up your aim will auto target the nearest a baddie. The camera in Resident Evil: HD is truly a “Hate It or  Get Used To It” thing.\n\nIn addition to the camera angles the inventory mechanics can be polarizing. To create tension and require that thought be put into every move, your carrying inventory is limited to six slots. Items cannot be added unless there is a free slot nor dropped unless you are near an item chest. This can be frustrating as you fill your inventory slots for a battle only to have the boss drop an item you can’t pick up until you back track to the closest item chest and unload your current inventory. Generally the item chests aren’t far (and they do hold unlimited items so you can keep everything you pick up), but the backtracking can become tedious. After a few encounters you will have a feel for what items are must-haves and inventory management will begin to feel natural. My advice, always keep one to two slots open unless absolutely necessary.\n\nFinally, some players, particularly those players accustomed to the save-as-you-go mentality of modern games, may be put off by the save system Resident Evil employs.  Not so long ago checkpoints in games were few and far between. During this time saving was not to be taken lightly. Resident Evil takes game saves very seriously, limiting them in fact, by tying them both to a consumable item, “Ink Ribbons” and to a location, the typewriter.  That’s right, if you don’t have an Ink Ribbon and are not near a typewriter you cannot save your game. Running out of Ink Ribbons is extremely unlikely as the game is generous with them on Normal difficulty.  However, you will not be able to save whenever you want.  You must plan your saves while planning your next move.  Should you save after unlocking only a relatively small chunk of new area or should you wait until that whole section is open?  Should you wait to save after you explore that creepy lab, or before?  What if there is a boss inside and you are killed?  These are the sorts of questions driven by the limited save resources. However frustrating it may be after being killed and losing progress, it is a refreshing method of adding tension to the game.\n\nOverall Resident Evil still packs a punch even after 20 years of age.  The environment and gameplay reflect the level of care the developers took to craft an experience that is deliberate and special.  You can feel the thought that went into creating this game while you play.  It’s a feeling that is becoming increasingly less frequent in the profit-driven, blockbuster AAA titles saturating the market today.  If you can look past the flaws of this game there is a wonderful experience waiting for you.\n\nHighly Recommended","November 4, 2015","true","21.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was never sure where to start with so many different entries;  so when I saw they  had remastered the original I decided to try it out, It was a great experience. The old gameplay is a little to get used to with the tank controls and claustraphobic camera angles, but after beating the game on the highest difficulty I can honestly say the alternate controls would feel wierd. The combats interesting with only 3 angles to aim middle high or low with a certain random chance of critical strike or headshots.When possible combat is to actually be avoided. It's very risky especially since it only take 2-3 hits to kill your character. Also something I wasn't expecting out of this game but got was a sort of metroidvania feel exploring the spooky mansion or other areas finding keys to unlock new areas to find new guns or parts to other puzzles. Speaking of puzzles they are both intelligent enough to challenge the player yet simple enough to be enjoyable. Throughout the game you will revisit parts of the mansion and discover new secrets. Possibly the most impressive thing in my opinion is how the developers continually up teh ante throughout the game; for example that route you cleared of zombies through the mansion? well now that you've progressed past a certain point in the game a twist happens which fills said route with new terrifying enemies. Truly Resident Evil has stood up to time I had no nostalgia glasses for this game having never played it before, yet enjoyed it imenesely nonetheless.  I can see why people complain about the new resident evils because they do truly pale in comparison from my experience. The sole feature of this game that has not stood up well is the characters/acting. To be honest they feel ridiculous and the voice acting is also very campy, but it has it's own apeal in a B-movie sort of way.","November 16, 2015","true","24.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And yes first it wasn't easy, but later on I got used to it.\n\n+Brilliant atmosphere, the almost full silence which only gets broken by the weather's or creature's noises\n+If you don't know the story than it can have some twists and even some really hard moral choices (at least one)\n+There are 2 campaigns (Jill and Chris). Both of them are different from each other both in gameplay and story\n+The game is not forcing you to kill every zombie, it does the exact opposite. If you kill a zombie without blowing its head up or incinerating it will result in a kinda OP mutated zombie.\n+/- Saves are limited in every possible way. You can only save at certain points (typewriters) in the mansion, but only if you have at least one Ink Ribbon with you, but there are about only 30-40 Ink Ribbons in the game.\n+Due to the limited number of Ink Ribbons and typewriters you'll have a constant fear of dying and starting from the last save point, but if you save like in every 15th minute you'll run out of Ink Ribbons.\n+/-The camera is fixed. This will add a lot more horror because sometimes you can't see to the other half of the room until you go there, but if you go there you may encounter a creature, so you have to listen to their sounds. But other times it can be really annoying.\n+Good graphics\n+You can choose to play with the old controls and screen ratio.\n-The controls can be ♥♥♥♥ing annoying.

Fortunately if you search over the internet you'll find a soultion for this\nBut still you can get used to all this and I can only recommend this game, but only if you are not looking for a Zombie Butcher Simulator (1996) REmake (2002) Remaster(2015), because it is nothing like RE4&5&6.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kundahli/recommended/304240/","Kundahli","Kundahli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kundahli/","28 products in account","Resident Evil, the first title in the celebrated Resident Evil franchise, launched in 1996, was given its first HD update in 2002, and is now receiving a makeover yet again.  The fact that this game is still being cared for and modernized nearly 20 years after it’s release should stand as a testament to how truly marvelous it is.\n\nResident Evil opens with a team of S.T.A.R.S. special forces agents tasked with investigating a recent string of unusual deaths around Raccoon City.  The first squad tasked with the investigation loses radio contact and you and your team are sent in to find out what happened.  Soon after discovering the missing team’s downed helicopter you are attacked by feral dogs that are seemingly resistant to gunfire, forcing you to retreat to the nearby Spencer Mansion. Having barely escaped with your life, you enter the mansion only to be separated from your team.  Soon thereafter you encounter the flesh-eating creatures that the Resident Evil series is so well known for.  The rest of the game plays out with you unlocking the secrets of the mansion, learning exactly what these creatures are and where they came from, and reuniting with your team.\n\nArguably the most noteworthy aspects of Resident Evil are its environments. The Spencer Estate is beautiful, labyrinthian, and oozing with atmosphere.  It begs to be explored.  From the eerie crypts, brooding chambers, secret labs, and cramped corridors, the environment creates a sense of tension that grips the player from the moment a save is loaded straight through until the game is turned off.\n\nThe mansion itself is so intricately designed that it becomes a character within the game itself.   It unfolds slowly, revealing more of its secrets as you solve its puzzles and progress through the game.  The Spencer mansion is a masterpiece of game design from an age before open world games were the norm. Too often is the case now where “bigger” is often mistaken for “better” in world design.  The Spencer mansion is a reminder that great worlds are not measured by the quantity of their content, but rather by the quality of their character.\n\nYou navigate the illustrious locations of estate as one of two S.T.A.R.S. team members (selectable at the start of the campaign), collecting various artifact, clues, and weapons that will help you survive, solve puzzles (no hand-holding here) and find your team. You begin the game extremely vulnerable having only a knife for basic self-defense, little knowledge of the mansions layout, and next to no resources. At this stage you will run from threats, worrying about your ability to heal, trying to conserve ammunition, fearing if you will be prepared for what’s around the next corner.\n\nAs you grow more comfortable with the mansions layout you will grow more comfortable with combat, having amassed a small cache of ammunition, weapons and healing supplies. The slow moving flesh eaters will feel more like a nuisance than a threat at this point. However, the game’s difficulty will stride forward in tune with your emboldened character by throwing new, more vicious enemies your way. Thus, even as your character advances the sense of challenge and fear of death remains.  The timing of these progressions is expertly subtle, never feeling unfair or too easy.\n\nDespite Resident Evil’s wonderful exploration and pacing the game is not without its faults. Combat is without a doubt one of the most frustrating aspects of the Resident Evil series. This is largely due to a combination of camera angle and finicky third-person controls.  The camera angle in Resident Evil is dynamic, changing at each unique scene in the game.  Enter a long hallway and you can may find yourself viewing your on screen character from a vantage point on the opposite end. Walk into a tight room and you may be met with an over the shoulder view. Because the camera angles are locked in each discrete scene you will often find yourself aiming at enemies that are not fully visible on screen. Luckily, pulling up your aim will auto target the nearest a baddie. The camera in Resident Evil: HD is truly a “Hate It or  Get Used To It” thing.\n\nIn addition to the camera angles the inventory mechanics can be polarizing. To create tension and require that thought be put into every move, your carrying inventory is limited to six slots. Items cannot be added unless there is a free slot nor dropped unless you are near an item chest. This can be frustrating as you fill your inventory slots for a battle only to have the boss drop an item you can’t pick up until you back track to the closest item chest and unload your current inventory. Generally the item chests aren’t far (and they do hold unlimited items so you can keep everything you pick up), but the backtracking can become tedious. After a few encounters you will have a feel for what items are must-haves and inventory management will begin to feel natural. My advice, always keep one to two slots open unless absolutely necessary.\n\nFinally, some players, particularly those players accustomed to the save-as-you-go mentality of modern games, may be put off by the save system Resident Evil employs.  Not so long ago checkpoints in games were few and far between. During this time saving was not to be taken lightly. Resident Evil takes game saves very seriously, limiting them in fact, by tying them both to a consumable item, “Ink Ribbons” and to a location, the typewriter.  That’s right, if you don’t have an Ink Ribbon and are not near a typewriter you cannot save your game. Running out of Ink Ribbons is extremely unlikely as the game is generous with them on Normal difficulty.  However, you will not be able to save whenever you want.  You must plan your saves while planning your next move.  Should you save after unlocking only a relatively small chunk of new area or should you wait until that whole section is open?  Should you wait to save after you explore that creepy lab, or before?  What if there is a boss inside and you are killed?  These are the sorts of questions driven by the limited save resources. However frustrating it may be after being killed and losing progress, it is a refreshing method of adding tension to the game.\n\nOverall Resident Evil still packs a punch even after 20 years of age.  The environment and gameplay reflect the level of care the developers took to craft an experience that is deliberate and special.  You can feel the thought that went into creating this game while you play.  It’s a feeling that is becoming increasingly less frequent in the profit-driven, blockbuster AAA titles saturating the market today.  If you can look past the flaws of this game there is a wonderful experience waiting for you.\n\nHighly Recommended","November 4, 2015","true","21.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was never sure where to start with so many different entries;  so when I saw they  had remastered the original I decided to try it out, It was a great experience. The old gameplay is a little to get used to with the tank controls and claustraphobic camera angles, but after beating the game on the highest difficulty I can honestly say the alternate controls would feel wierd. The combats interesting with only 3 angles to aim middle high or low with a certain random chance of critical strike or headshots.When possible combat is to actually be avoided. It's very risky especially since it only take 2-3 hits to kill your character. Also something I wasn't expecting out of this game but got was a sort of metroidvania feel exploring the spooky mansion or other areas finding keys to unlock new areas to find new guns or parts to other puzzles. Speaking of puzzles they are both intelligent enough to challenge the player yet simple enough to be enjoyable. Throughout the game you will revisit parts of the mansion and discover new secrets. Possibly the most impressive thing in my opinion is how the developers continually up teh ante throughout the game; for example that route you cleared of zombies through the mansion? well now that you've progressed past a certain point in the game a twist happens which fills said route with new terrifying enemies. Truly Resident Evil has stood up to time I had no nostalgia glasses for this game having never played it before, yet enjoyed it imenesely nonetheless.  I can see why people complain about the new resident evils because they do truly pale in comparison from my experience. The sole feature of this game that has not stood up well is the characters/acting. To be honest they feel ridiculous and the voice acting is also very campy, but it has it's own apeal in a B-movie sort of way.","November 16, 2015","true","24.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is an old school game with a new skin and it is great. Very challenging, lots of puzzles with no hand holding at all. When you find items you have to figure out what they are for. The camera angles add to suspense and aren't bad once you get used to them. Resources are limited in the game and so are saves. If you run out of ink ribbon, healing or ammo you are SOL. You may find your self loading in earlier saves or restarting altogether if you are playing without a guide.\n\nThis game is a great intro to the series with high replayability since there are 2 characters to choose from each with their own strengths and weaknesses. One has more health and fewer inventory slots and the other has less health and more inventory slots.\n\nBTW you can't drop items unless you are at an item box just as a warning. That may be frustrating to some but it adds to the challenge of the game as you will do a lot of backtracking as puzzles come together.\n\nGood Night.\n\nGood Luck.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n8/10","November 7, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As a Resident Evil fan (both those more survival horror and those action-y) I can only confirm that this is surely one of the best Resident Evil games out there. It's challenging, complicated and supplies are very limited. I played the game on Easy yet it was still pretty hard (atleast for me).\n\n~Short version at the bottom~\n\nGameplay\nCapcom said they will improve the controls for PC, I didn't play the older versions so I can't really say if the controls were improved, yet it was quite easy to handle. Movement can be quite different for those who are not familiar with these types of games, but you'll get into it over time. It's easy to understand and there aren't many controls to remember so I didn't have any trouble controlling the game and he overall gameplay was fine.\n\nGraphics\nThis is actually a remastered version of already remastered version (yeah) released couple years ago. But it wasn't for pc, this one is. There's definitely improvement in graphics and the static backgrounds over the remastered and the original version of course. However there's also a slight problem. You can experience horrible lagging since the optimalization isn't that great, but you can fix it with a patch (made a guide for it if you want to check it out).\n\nSound\nI don't know what to say, it's alright. Voice acting is still weird in places but that's just Resident Evil I guess.\n\nOthers\nReplayibility is pretty huge for a game like this. You can choose between two characters, Jill and Chris. And they actually change the story a bit, not the most important parts but they change a few puzzles and some scenes. Also they have different stats. Jill has more inventory space, yet less health and worse gun handling while Chris the opposite. So it's not just about personal preference but about how you want to play the game, which I like alot.\n\nSome of the puzzles are pretty challenging and the whole game (as expected) is alot about walking around, searching for places and stuff while trying to avoid zombies. Trust me RE5 and 6 players, you would want to avoid them rather than killing them, since it's not as rewarding. Dead zombies who weren't burned or headshotted can wake up as a Crimson, a much powerful form and you also don't want to waste your ammo.\n\nIf we're talking about difficulty, as I mentioned at the beginning, for me it was quite hard in places, also there are no checkpoints and LIMITED saves, so it's pretty challenging, you must really know when and where you want to save, even though it was really unusual, I liked it. It added to the survival part of the game.\n\nIN SHORT:\nResident Evil HD REMASTER is definitely worth buying unless your computer is crap. The game doesn't offer great performance and optimalization. So if you expect you can run it with your toaster, propably not.\nGameplay is simple and controls alright. Sound was improved. It's difficult and supplies are limited. It's the true survival horror game with epic camera angles and creepy atmosphere. If you are a RE fan and feel like you want to give this a try, go for it.\n\n9/10 - One point down for the performance.\n\n,,Enter the survival horror."","January 17","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","3"

I guess, it wasn't just me who had a soft spot for this gem.\n\nResident Evil is... a gem. Although 3D was created before RE and Playstation, most video games at its time were constructed for 2D, and many 3D games of its generation resulted in catastrophies.\nThe 3D was supposed to be the ''new gen'' at the time, supposed to render 2D obsolete, and new consoles like Playstation were supposed to bring this new generation of game to players.\nI think, many publishers or developpers, at the time, overlooked the quality of the game they produced, and were rushing into 3D.\nAnd probably also because supposely 3D would make their game cool.\n\nWe know where it led, of course 80% of those games, are forgotten, because hideous, they had nothing to offer other than their brand-new 3 dimensional pixels.\n\n\nFew games, you remember: James Bond Golden Eye, Zelda Ocarina Of Time, and mother ♥♥♥♥ing Resident Evil.\nThose.\nThose games (sorry if I forgot your fav. 3D game of that time), were thought to be awesome games, and not just 3D games.\nAll of them, brought something new to the table and could not have been the games they are without 3D.\n\n\nResident Evil is also the first attemtp at a video game which scenario, atmosphere and action could rival movie production.\nWhen playing RE, I always thought I was playing an awesome movie like Alien, Alien 2, Predator, etc.\nThe characters, the dialogues lines etc.\nYes, looking at the game now, you can say that there are some aspects of its scenario which are ''funy'' or ''kitch'', but at the time, I ate it all.

It plays beautifully just as it did on the gamecube, and for the most part is improved visually and technically.  While some of the backdrops do look like they were untouched, (and in the case of specifically the graveyard and aqua ring, worse than the original) overall, the parts that I wanted to see fleshed out in detail were sharp and clear.  Lisa Trevor, that guy that died from bee stings, even Barry's awesome Jill Sandwich eating face.  It's all there in HD for the first time, and I'm glad it's available for new players to experience and revisit.\n\nThe performance at 60fps was nice to see.  I did noticed however it tends to dip really low in specific areas, but I found this only affected me when I used the wide screen ratio.  Once I switched to classic 4:3, it only ever dipped once through an entire playthrough.  There are a couple of graphics options to look at, including texture quality and smaller things to tweak, but nothing super extensive.  I'd like to hear how it runs for other people on their machines and settings.\n\nAs far as the gameplay itself goes, I think I noticed a few tweaks in enemy behavior during one of my playthroughs, but I can't say for sure.  As far as I could tell, the item placement, enemy placement/behavior and everything else is true to the original gamecube version.  They added some new control schemes which should help newer players and will be interesting to mess around with. The only change being aiming requires L+R to shoot instead of R+A how it used to be (Unless you can remap specific buttons, which I haven't seen that option yet).  There are a few new unlockable extras snuck in, which I wouldn't dare spoil for you, but they are nice additions making it even more worth it to complete this game multiple times.  I'm particularly excited about the leaderboards feature to easily document playtime for speed running.\n\nUltimately, this a masterpiece, because it always was.  This remaster is a great service to the fans, and something I know a lot of us were wishing for over the years.  Buy it. Now.  Even if it's not likely to help, I'd like to think Capcom will give 2 and 3 the same treatment if this sells well enough.  After they release Resident Evil 0 HD Remaster, that is.\n\n","January 20, 2015","true","36.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The new charcter models - particularly those of main protagonists Jill and Chris - look great and the backdrops do a pretty solid job of standing the test of time, succeeding in replicating the creepy atmosphere from the original; especially when combined with some of the new particle effects that have been added for this version.\n\nI haven't tried the new control scheme - I grew up playing the original Resident Evil games so I am perfectly at home using the original controls. However, this doesn't apply to everyone and I'm sure the new control scheme will have plenty of fans.\n\nI have yet to encounter any bugs or issues of any kind at around 3 hours into the game. I have managed to die though - something I failed to do in the more recent games.\n\nTo put things bluntly, Capcom have knocked this one out of the park - a welcome relief to those of us who have had to watch one of our favorite franchises drift further and further away from what made it so great in recent years.\n\nResident Evil is one of those oh so rare games that are truely timeless; it is every bit as entertaining today as it was 20(!!!) years ago. There are scarier horror games, better looking horror games and better written horror games, but few can claim to be as great as Resident Evil.\n\n10/10\n\nNow lets all start praying for that RE2 HD Remaster.","January 20, 2015","true","4.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The 3D and 2D textures have been markedly improved, but only so much.  While some shots will delight fans of the original remake, others reveal its true age.  Still, a side-by-side shows extremely impressive improvements.\n\nFor veterans of the series, very little is new, and what is new is optional.  New fans who would struggle with tank controls can opt for the alternative free-moving setup, but it's only an alternative that has its own share of problems.  The visual update includes 16:9 widescreen, but one can opt for the original 4:3.  They also include the options for 30 frames per second or 60.  Though it seems like anathema to PC gamers, I opt for the 30 frames to recreate the cinematic feel to the game, as 60 felt wrong.\n\nWhile the game has aged, it's aged well.  Returning players will most likely remember the mansion they loved to fear and can hit the ground running.  I found myself breezing through puzzles and remembering tricks to get around certain areas.    The game no longer instills a fear in me like it did before, but this is the sign of a more experienced, older player, not an empty title.  Still, not 10 minutes into the old horror I found myself cautious about what lie around the next corner.  The din of moans around a corner, the shambling of footsteps, the sudden crack of a window, the sound of silence and wind, and even the sudden turn of a character's head when they saw something off-screen still made my heart beat faster and my hair stand up.\n\nFrom the eyes of someone who played and beat this many times before years ago, buying this left me seeing the title as a solid 8/10.  For new players, looking for a true survival horror experience, this lives up to the fantastic 9/10 that you've likely heard so much about.  Once you get by the control scheme which may seem awkward and novel, and realize that it's as much a part of the experience as the zombies themselves, you're in for quite a treat.","February 5, 2015","true","20.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Don't get me wrong I loved Resident Evil 4 and 5, but I would still prefer the style with set camera angles, puzzles in pretty much every room you go in, and only able to carry 6 items so the decision on what to take with you needs some thought.\n\nThe HD REMASTER in my opinion is nothing incredible as to where it's a whole new outlook of a game, but some things were added in the game as for instance:\n\n1.) You can change the aspect ratio to either widescreen, or the 4:3 original ratios.\n2.) Character detail has been improved, but nothing to drastic and changing Chris and Jill's outfit to the most recent Resident Evil game they were in.\n3.) Changing the FPS to either 30 or 60, but I prefer 60 because it is so smooth and I love it.\n\n\nAs for gameplay, I said before its back to the older style of Resident Evil which I love. For newcomers though who never played Resident Evil, this could be a little frustrating with awkward camera angles, constant running to the item box to swap items, or CRIMSON HEADS!!\n\nSome advice for newcomers who may be interested in this game:\n1.) Maybe use a controller?\n2.) Conserve ammo and use it when necessary.\n3.) Check the map frequently; if the room is highlighted red then there are still items there, if green then the room has no items left.\n4.) Save frequently but watch you ink ribbons because how many ribbons you have is how many times you can save the game.\n5.) Don't let the camera angles discourage you from this game, you'll get used to it.\n6.)

Having grown up with the NES and SNES, I am no stranger to old games. When I first started playing this one though, I thought the aiming and movement was clunky and I didn't understand why everyone loved it so much.  I stepped away from the game and came back the next day to give it another chance, and to my surprise, I began loving every minute of it!!\n\nLet me begin by saying that this game has a steep learning curve.  The first time you play it, you will hate it. But after you start to understand the mechanics, this will quickly become one of your favorite games ever!!  There is a reason it is on most "best games" lists,  So stick with it and you won't be sorry.\n\nThis game doesn't hold your hand.  You begin with very limited amounts of ammo, and you should beware that you shouldn't kill everything in sight. You have to search everything, and I mean everything.\n\nI wouldn't say this game is scary the way modern games scare you (with jump scares, greusome depictions of death, and other nonsense), but what this game gets right is the atmosphere.  I prefer more atmospheric horror titles and I am very pleased with the creepy setting of the old mansion that causes a slight jolt each time the loud thunder catches you off guard while tip-toeing through the seemingly abandoned corridors.\n\nLike most older games, something about it is addictive.  You will continue to come back to this game without knowing what is drawing you in.  Something about searching every inch of the mansion to find small tools that will help you along the way is extremely satisfying. It reminds me a lot of old Nintendo games that just feel good to play without any apparent rhyme or reason behind it.

The first game in the Resident Evil franchise has always been my favourite, and this has to be considered the best version. I never played the 2002 update, where many of the puzzles and area layouts were changed, new monsters and story details were added, so much of this felt like a fresh new experience for me.\n\nWhat pleased me?\n\n•	Classic survival horror gameplay. A smaller number of dangerous enemies compared to later games which have huge numbers of weak enemies. I actually got killed by the first zombie because I was overconfident! Limited ammo, health and save game items, so you need to be careful not to waste any.\n•	Some puzzles don't have to be solved to complete the game, but they determine which of the multiple endings you get, which rewards exploration.\n•	Playing as either Jill or Chris provides a significantly different experience, because they have access to different weapons, inventory size, damage resistance and story elements.\n•	You can choose between the original "tank" controls or a more modern control scheme.\n•	Updated graphics. The mansion and surrounding areas never looked so good.\n•	Mostly stable. I had a couple of crashes after I quit the game (had to kill it on task manager) but no problems during actual gameplay.\n\nWhat disappointed me?\n\n•	There is a widely known bug which causes the mouse pointer to stay visible during gameplay, which will destroy immersion if you play with mouse and keyboard. You basically have no choice but to play with a gamepad (and then push the mouse off screen). Not a problem for me because I own a gamepad, but in 2015 there is no excuse for this bug to exist.\n\n•	Fixed camera angles are a bit annoying. There were several occasions where Jill/Chris are looking at an enemy that is standing right in front of them but I can't see it because I'm looking at my character, which made me waste some ammo. Yes its part of the original experience, but I wonder if anything could have been tweaked to make this less of an issue.\n\nOverall recommendation\n\nFans of the franchise should find alot to enjoy in this remake, especially if like me, you only played the original. And if you've never played any Resident Evil game, this is the best place to start.\n\nI also just want to say that I've never had the opportunity to play either RE2 or RE3, so if Capcom would release a similar updated version of those games on Steam, I would buy them immediately.","March 26, 2015","true","20.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The classic controls are there fore the true fans who know how to play survival horror games while the noobs, casuals and garbage gamers get to use the new control scheme. I seriously have no respect for anyone who sucks so much at survival horror games that they are terrible using the classic controls. I mean, the series has been around nearly 20 years. How bad can you be to not adapt to the classic control scheme in nearly 20 years? It's just for people who suck. Besides that, the game is classic and amazing. This is true horror at it's finest. No cheesy terrorist plot or over the top Michael Bay action in this game. The story feels very plausible and realistic.

Same textures and everything (though Jill and Chris have alt-costumes from the modern games). Even so, they look gorgeous. Backgrounds are still pre-rendered (EDIT: Apparently they aren't? But hey, they still look like they are.), and while this has a very nice, organic feel, they are slightly blurred in what looks like some half-♥♥♥♥♥ DOF effect (though this is mostly only noticeable in large, open rooms). Enemies probably have the worst translation to HD. The dogs' animations are still a bit funky, and the zombies look noticeably lower-res than anything else in the game. Lighting is done well and gives a very moody feeling despite being quite bright. Overall, I'd give graphics a solid 7/10.\n\nControls: Controls are the best part of the game, honestly. It gives you a choice between classic (tank controls) and alternate (modern strafing), and keyboard and gamepad are equally viable (gamepad probably better for alternate mode, and keyboard probably better for classic). The only weird part is there's no dedicated inventory button. Instead it's under "Status." Newcomers may take a while to get used to the non-ots gunplay and no free-aim, though. For vets, easy 9/10. For newcomers, probably 6/10.\n\nMusic: Same as before. Subtle, eerie, and moody. Unlike any of the modern RE games, the music here definitely gives off a solid horror vibe. Not really something you'd listen to on your car stereo, but it matches the game perfectly. 10/10.\n\nOverall, you can tell that Capcom put some effort into this. They only upped the resolution and kept everything else as it was on the gamecube, and the occasional random low-res bits, like the zombies and the title screen, show that they rushed a bit. However, the game runs really well and looks and sounds great as a whole. It's definitely one of Capcom's better ports. Overall enjoyability: 8/10","January 19, 2015","true","13.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The new controls are a great addition (do make the game easier), that trying the old tank controls seems very odd but it there for the purists.\nAs a HD remaster it slightly mixed, some areas Capcom have really made the most of the original 480p assets. But other assets like the video clip of the water full being drained are not of great quality. Areas that you may on visit once have had less time of them but this does make sense.\nAt £16.99 it’s a tad expensive, so definitely shop around on licenced steam sellers for the best deals. Looking forward to the rumoured remaster of Zero, again from the gamecube. And remakes of 2 and 3, then a HD remaster of code veronica.

I only truly learned about it back in 2009 from a friend, when I said I'd never heard of "Crimson Heads" in the RE universe. Was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I didn't know how much of a remake it was! I loved the original RE, and grew up playing it on my old Windows 95 system.\n\nSo I've not played much of the game so far, this has been my experience:\n\n- Start game (Jill btw), recognise similarities of original game and notice subtle (welcomed) changes\n\n- Use what knowledge I have to not waste ammo on first zombie, get the map and encounter the new defense weapons. Waste defense weapon on first zombie, go to left side of the mansion and find killer statue key puzzle, leave well alone because I can see what's coming if I grab key without a plan. Retrieve the arrow from the small statue. Get killed when I get sandwiched between two zombies in that same area.\n\n- Restart game, get that arrow again, also I didn't waste first defense dagger! Save game to prevent all intro boring crap.\n\n- Explore outside of mansion and find arrow. Break arrow and use on puzzle outside. Get key, save game.\n\n- After a bit of exploration, I find a storage and save room. I then get to the part where you find....lets say, Mr Cider and Lager mix. Run back to safe room to get serum and save (thinking this was where you fight Mr Bitey). Head to Mr Cider 'n' Lager, and he's already K.I.A. Go through door next to him, get past zombie to left and into small dining room. Dark as balls in here. Move cabinet, BOO! Lure Mr zombie away from hidden area and CANT SEE OR PICK UP ♥♥♥♥ BECAUSE NO LIGHTER!\n\n- Load save, do same but with lighter. Music, woop! Explore mansion a bit, find music room HURRAH....but my piece is stored in the storage box as I like to save space when hunting....\n\n\nSummary: Make fair amount of "progress", forget one thing, try to get back to the thing and zombies are now in your path (they weren't ever there before), die just before you turn that thing in after retrieving it, revise path for efficiency, repeat.\n\nThis is a survival horror game as it should be. Puzzles, limited resources, and a good spanking for those who don't take it seriously. Like an exam in school, learning from your mistakes can go a long way.\n\n10/10 Better than original, and this out of shape nitwit is going back to his far superior routes of gaming skill!","November 4, 2015","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Now it's on PC and it's better than ever, 1080p with unlocked fps, that's a win-win if I ever saw one.  The new controls make it really easy, but as a 31 year old male with a wife and two kids, I don't have the free time to fail until I succeed anymore.  That chapter in my life is gone, and as much as I liked the old tank controls, the new control scheme is a pretty damn welcome change.\n\nWhat can I say about one of the grandfathers of the Survival Horror Genre that hasn't already been said by someone else before me?  I've owned this game on the PSX, GC/WII and now proudly on the PC.  You can pick it apart individually but taken as a whole, it's a masterpiece.  To think this is more or less 20 years old now shows how ground breaking and revolutionary it was at the time!","October 19, 2015","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And you know what? I will gladly keep throwing money at them to do it. I remember buying this game when I was in middle school, and the trouble I went through trying to buy a graphics card that could support it. (Shout out to the old Diamond Monster 3DII card, and what got me started on the path to tech repair). Absolutely horrible graphics by todays standards, but lightyears ahead if you grew up with an 8-bit Nintendo. And then came 2, 3, and about that time the Gamecube with 0 and the 1st remake of this game. And now we see the 2nd remake. Definitely great graphics here. And just as with the 1st remake, there team has created a few new turns, and some new elements to keep it fresh. I love the storyline of this series, and I truly hope they continue remastering them all. And please Capcom release a port of Code Veronica for PC! It will be interesting to see what 2 looks like remastered. And hopefully 3 as well!","February 27","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything expectation I had for this game was filled and more. I wasn't expecting to be scared by this game like I was when I originally played it.I figured it was just scarey back then because of how young I was. Kinda like when I watch Nightmare on Elm Street now. It's almost laughable, and its not scarey at all anymore. Thats did NOT happen with replaying Resident Evil. There are cetain moments in the game that still have me jumping out of my seat and screaming out loud because I was startled. Even walking around the mansion I find that I'm constantly on the edge of my seat wondering whats gonna pop out next.

Resident Evil on Playstation was the first horror game I ever played. At least the first game that had graphics good enough that felt like a horror movie, to me. Good enough to genuinely creep me out. (I was 11 when it came out and though I never owned a PS1 myself, I and neighborhood kids would always go to my friends house and play) I will never forget the panic I felt when the first zombie turns to look at you after devouring part of Kenneth, after the dining room. I say this because it's important to know that I am not 100% impartial to the mansion. It's like an old friend.\n\nThe gameplay hasn't been changed very much from the original's in 1996. I think this is awesome. It wouldn't be in a modern AAA blockbuster 60$ game, but going back now is in no way a chore. I experimented with the classic tank controls and the new "alternative" setting. For my first play through I chose to use the updated control scheme, since I have not played in so long to make the game a bit easier in my favor. I plan to go back and play in full classic mode after I beat it with the new control scheme, which is very slick and streamlined. I am using a wired XBOX 360 controller and so far no complaints at all with handling.\n\nInventory carrying limit is still low, forcing you to choose carefully and sometimes have to go back for items you decided to leave in storage that turns out are needed. This is annoying, but it is survival horror and the characters aren't carrying magic backpacks that can carry 4 guns, 1000 rounds of ammo and an assortment of plants, sprays and items. I like this structure. It adds a bit of tension, and yes sometimes repetition to areas that don't need it, but the realism it adds is worthwhile.\n\nI am only 1.5 hours into the game at the time of this review but I have seen enough of the mansion and gameplay to assess that there have been no graphics/audio glitches at all. The improved lighting is a huge step up. The backgrounds still remain murky and low res in spots, but I did not find this to detract from my experience. In fact, it only helped to recall those days in my friend's basement, stumbling through the game in terror. My rig is Windows 8.1, intel i7 4770k, 16 gigs of ram and Gigabyte GeForce GTX 770 OC 4GB GPU. I am using the 16:9 display at the highest settings allowed by the game without messing with .ini files. I will change these later, as I am enjoying the current presentation though I will have no problem cranking the game to 4K resolutions. As it is the game looks great. It could very well fool someone into thinking it a modern title at first glance. I am loving exploring the old mansion in the updated graphics. It looks very good in my opinion. There have been no frame rate stutters. I have read people complaining that they kept the slow door opening animations when going from room to room. I disagree and love how the tension goes up as you wait to find out what is behind the door you just figured out how to unlock.\n\nThe audio has always been a huge part of making a scary setting, and the classic clomps of the boots of the living and zombie footfalls ring through the halls. The sound of gunshots are a bit flat but get the job done. The shuffling of zombies eating and staggering, as well as the moans let you know that you are not alone, and that is not good. The fixed cameras raise tension as it allows enemies to be placed off screen, just the noises alerting you to their proximity. Then you have to go find the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, so that you can end their undead existence.\n\nThe story has been rock solid in the early REs, so nothing new there. Until it got convoluted and Hollywooded out the ♥♥♥, it has all the classic elements of night of the living dead and other classics, with some geopolitical intrigue thrown in.\n\nI heartily recommend this to anyone who has a history with this classic, whether on PS1 or the gamecube version. After all these years, the original Resident Evil/Biohazard title still holds up well enough to perhaps show the world just how far from its roots the series has strayed, and remind us why, in some ways it is a tragedy.","January 21, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

This forged the foundations of many mechanics that the series uses, but also abandoned some in later titles. In this game, you get a more horror-like experience and have to actually explore and solve puzzles to progress. You have to learn the surroundings, find keys to gain access to previously closed off areas.\n\nThe enemies are to be feared, in later titles enemies are usually thrown at you in bulks and waves. And you're given an abundance of ammo to blast them away with.In this, they are used appropriately to portray an actual threat, and in most cases, you have to use your ammo sparingly, and actually look around for it.\n\nIn later titles, you usually have a linear path in most cases. In this game, it's possible to be backtracking quite a few times, you get extremely accustomed to navigating this mansion I'll tell you right now.\n\nWell that's a bit of my opinion on this game. And to top it off, the PC port actually works.\n\nThis is a fantastic game, obviously not for everyone though. If you want a different experience and want to play a well designed game though, I highly recommend Resident Evil.

They made the presentation and graphics up-to-date while keeping the atmosphere of the original game. This is the most important, even though a lot of "HD remakes"  failed to do it (khm SIlent Hill khm).\nBut did they fix anything the original game had issues with? Not like they had much to fix. The only bad things about it were the clunky controlls and sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera views, even though these became basically signature elements of the old school survival horror games.\nFirst off, the fixed camera angles force the type of controls those games have, if you had the traditional up-left-down-right unchanged it would be very confusing. The traditional way is that you go in the direction you face with, turning by the side keys and go backwards with down. The problem with this was always the fact that you turn slowly, since most of the time it has to be precise, but sometimes you need it to be fast because of enemies and curvy areas.\nThey tried a method where you always effectively go forwards, every key turns and moves you character instantly and the directions change based on the camera angle. It works fine when you have to go fast, except the fact that the update of the directions is weird. So every time the view changes, sometimes your character just turns back and goes back to the other view, sometimes it works intended and you continue going to your original direction. With better direction updating it could've been awesome, was a good effort though.\nThe camera angles are still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ occasionally, but I didn't expect that those will be gone.\n\nOther than this there isn't much to say. They maybe should've stuck to the bad voice acting, because that was hilarious in the original game. It's not great by any means, but the ridiculously overacted and read up lines are unfortunately gone. In exchange, the game has a more serious tone.\n\nIt's a great remake, it doesn't matter if you have played the original, you should play this if you like horror games. It's a classic.","March 29","true","13.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The most obvious is the up res'ed textures, backgrouds, and overall resolution. There's also a new control scheme and a even new character skins.\n\nIf you're an old timer looking for an excuse to replay one of your childhood favorites, RE1 Remaster won't disappoint. All of the classic tank control, hallway rerunning, and key collecting goodness remain intact. I do recommend turning the difficulty to hard on your first go if you are looking for that "true" classic RE experience. (Normal would definitely be considered easy to series vets)\n\nIf you are new to classic RE, this would be a great time to see what all the hoohaa is all about. Playing the old PSX version for the younger generation might be difficult due to the dated look, but now that we have a much superior visual product that still has the classic mechanics, it can potentially show case that these older mechanics still has merit in today's gaming world. But be aware, if you are new it won't play like modern games. There will be a large degree of backtracking, and confusion at first. But if you can get over that hump, I think most can get a lot of enjoyment out of RE1 Remaster\n\nI've said plenty of positive things about this game so far, but it is not perfect. Though it does run mostly well, at a consistent 60FPS, it does dip down due to a loading bug every now and then. It happens randomly and not always in the same location. It is noticeable. Though most of the textures and models have been up res'ed expertly, there are still some props in the game that has very low res or stretched textures that make it look very out of place.\n\nOverall I think RE1 Remaster was done well for the most part. I'm enjoying it and can only recommend it to any one curious. But do know I'm a classic RE fan, played it since the PSX days, so I will have some nostalgia bias.\n\nPros:\n- Feels and plays just like classic RE1\n- Updated visuals are mostly well done\n- New features such and additional skins are welcomed\n- Still one of the freakiest games out there\n\nCons:\n- Some technical bugs on load\n- Might be frustrating for the uninitiated\n- We need a Resident Evil 2 Remake (pls Capcom)","January 21, 2015","true","7.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I've been waiting for it to happen for a very long time. I was not part of the occult Nintendo and was not interested in their gamecube. As the original release of the game back in 2002 was exclusive for the console in which at the time I only bought PS2.\n\nFirst of all, the 2002 release of Resident Evil remake was a remastered version of the 1996 title. At the time, there was many limitations in what video game graphics could achieve and so, the result was completely new textures, Improved voice over and additional features not seen in the 1996 classic. It was well received by the media. However, it still featured the same old tank - like controls, Low aspect ratio and blurry textures for the backgrounds. Suffice to say, if none of these problems were addressed, then This HD remaster should not be called HD remaster at all. Hands down to Capcom for giving us the love that we deserved.\n\nThis HD Remaster version of the 2002 release improved the overall texture quality further and that the character models were really detailed and looked nice. They improved the music in the game so that it is more immersive and added lighting effects not found in the original. What's interesting is that they added a alternative control scheme in which it plays like later games in the series (Using analogue sticks) while still keep the original control for players who want it.\n\nNow for the downside, background textures seems to be ignored by the HD remaster as they are blurry and completely out of sync with detailed character model. It may work by making the characters stand out more, but it is definitely lazy to say the least. What I have noticed is that the quality of cinematics still remained the same and from this we can tell that this game has ages well.\n\nIf you are a new comer to the series, this game is a good starting point because it puts you at pretty much the beginning of the Umbrella trilogy storyline and introduced you to all the characters straight away. Althought, the mechanics are simple. The game makes up for this with frustrating puzzles and annoying back tracking to keep you busy. The most important thing in the game is item management. If you can manage your inventory well, you will minimise the time spend running around and significantly improve on the efficiency.\n\nThe game has you take control in one of the two characters Jill or Chris. The selection has no effect in the storyline. What it matters is the partners you will get teamed up with and some characteristic perks like Jill runs faster but dies quicker and has 8 item slots and Chris runs slower but do not go down easily and has 6 item slots. These are the things purely gameplaye oriented.\n\nThe eerie atmosphere found in the game keeps you at the edge of your seat most of the time. The feeling when the music sends chill down your spine and you cannot get away from due to frustration of solving puzzles. The groaning sound that the zombie makes and the fact that you cannot see them. The nervous moments of watching the door opening animations. The dead angles in which you must proceed to the edge for it to change view only to get ♥♥♥♥ed by Crimson Heads. These are the traits of game developer Shinji Mikami and it is masterful as well as elegant. It is so well thought out and executed that it redefined the whole genre and influenced many games.\n\nWhat I must criticize is the fact that like most Capcom games, this port is some what lazy and not refined fully and pushed to an early release as a way of grabing money. Because at release the optimization was poor and for a game that was 10-12 years old. It requires a ridiculous powerful rig to run it smoothly. For mid - range specs and many laptops you will have to do some configurations. Here I will give you some tips on the possible fixes.\n\nFor Nvidia cards, if you experience slow motion and out of sync problems. Do the following:\n- Go to Nvidia control panel by right clicking on desktop\n- Go to manage 3D settings\n- In the drop down menu with list of games, find Resident Evil HD Remaster\n- Select High Performance as the game is default to use your integrated graphics\n- Apply settings\n\nFor AMD Cards it is slightly easier\n-If you have integrated graphics, try switch it to GPU\n-Set the game FPS in game settings to 30FPS lock\n\nThese configurations are only need if you have a lower spec. If you have a powerful gaming rig, the game will run smoothly without the need to configure.\n\nI have enjoyed this game very much as it brings back memories of old school game control and unforgiving gameplay. Save frequently is required but ink ribbon is limited. Players have to think ahead and think smart to be good at it. For now I only hope that Capcom will bring more HD remasters such as RE2 and RE3 as those were one of my favorites. As for Resident Evil HD Remaster I will give it a 9/10 if not for the poor optimization it would of been a 10/10.\n\n\n","January 31, 2015","true","29.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you never experienced any the old Resident games than jumping into them with this is not a bad a start at all if you're hungry for a true hard survival horror game that will kill you many times if you don't manage you inventory,health items and ammo carefully.","January 20, 2015","true","23.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Biggest question I had was how the visuals would hold up seeing as how they've tried to remaster low resolution backgrounds and models. In that department most of the backgrounds actually look pretty good. Especially if you sit a couple of meters from your monitor/television. Some of them though look like absolute ♥♥♥. With all those resources I definitely feel that they could've remodeled some of the environments. The fans deserved it. The game deserves it. The areas affected/those that didn't get enough attention breaks the visuals and ruins the atmosphere a bit which is such a shame. New is the widescreen support which is awesome. All in all it's a fantastic game, a good port and one of my all time favourites.

The game has options for the original tank controls, or position oriented control scheme. Not much has changed, except a graphic overhaul and a bump up to 1080p resolution, from the GameCube version. My only gripe is that you cannot use DSR and crank the resolution up, like with most newer releases. The game is still rewarding and challenging, and now there are three difficulty settings. I picked what would equate to normal, and it is still challanging enough to feel like a true survival horror game as it is meat to be. Tight corridors and tense camera angles will have you sweating. From a technical standpoint the game runs without many issues, your gun will clip through walls if you are really close and aiming that direction, and a few minor bugs here and there. However they are not enough to take you out of what is otherwise a compeling and wonderfull puzzle filled horror adventure.\n\n9/10\npros\n-tense action\n-stays true to survival horror of the original\n-graphics are pretty nice\n-difficult\n\ncons\n-minor technical bugs\n-no DSR options\n-cannot skip the door opening sequence, even if you have been through the same door 5 times","January 21, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And it's better than ever. Fans rejoice! This is THE best version to date. Tank controls feel natural with WASD, even better than with a d-pad. Not sure how newcomers will react since much of the game design and control is very old school, including the pre-rendered backgrounds and fixed camera angles. Nonetheless, old school never looked or felt so fresh. Those new to the game willing to give it a chance may find the true definition of survival horror buried beneath the classic aesthetics and controls. Highly recommended for players who miss the original RE and Silent Hill days.

This is a fantastic remake of one of my favourite games on the PS1/Saturn. And this is my favourite remake of any game of all time, a game that came out on Gamecube and now this is a re-release of that REmake and its even better! 60FPS, Improved lighting, an option for alternative controls for those who dont want to use the "tank" movment, you can select between aspect Ratios 4:3 (original) and 16:9.\n\nThis is when Capcom were probably at their finest and before Resident Evil was turned into some sort of third person shooter with all the subtle understatment gone in favour of bravado with explosions in your face and poor gameplay,  seeds of which were laid by RE4.\n\nI'll keep it simple. If you like Survival Horror and never experianced this gem of a game then you need to buy it, its corny in parts but it adds to the charm and the unease of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deuciekins/recommended/304240/","Deuciekins","M3gadeuce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deuciekins/","563 products in account","First I'd like to get this off my chest. Resident Evil remake is not only my personal favorite game of the series by far, but it's also in my top 5 most favorite games of all time. That being said, I couldn't describe how excited I was to hear that this was coming to steam. So how does this stack up to the original remake on Gamecube?\n\nIn my opinion, 60 fps on this game is very much a welcome addition to this hd remake. Character and enemy designs are better and some areas in this remake are even more goregous compared to the original. The sound quality is better too. Also, there's a new control scheme for newcomers to the classic Resident Evil formula, which is yet another positive added to this version. I prefer the old tank controls however, but then again, I've played and beaten all of the numbered Resident Evils from 1 to 6.\n\nAs far as my gripes with this version, there are a few that do get on my nerves. First, while there are areas that look better than the original version of the game, there aren't really that many. A good amount of them look rather pixelated, and the quality of the video cutscenes don"t seem to be that great either. The pixelated areas kind of detract from the atmosphere in this game,  which is kind of irritating.It also seems that a lot of laptops who have more than enough power to run this game are still having difficulties getting 60 fps. Last, they should really do something about the mouse in game. I don't want to have to keep hiding my mouse in a corner so that the arrow doesn't get in the experience.\n\nIs this game better than the gamecube version? In my opinion, the gamecube version is still better than this one, but even so, this is still a game that everyone should have the chance to experience at least once. If there is anything for me to wish for, I can only hope that a patch can come for this game soon for laptop owners.","January 21, 2015","true","48.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Not only is the Resident Evil remake one of the best Resident Evil games, it is also one of the best survivor horror games of all time. For a game that originally came out in 2002 on the Gamecube, the visuals are AMAZING and even rivals a 7th gen game. This HD port uses the same engine as the gamecube version and enhances the visuals to the max without having to start from scratch. The Framerate is now at a buttersmooth 60fps, though you can change the frame rate to the original 30fps if you so desired. There are two control schemes: The classic "tank controls" which I can assume a lot of R.E. Veterans are going to use. And alterante, which makes the controls slightly easier and smoother but seem odd for Resident Evil game that uses a fixed camera. You can now play the game at 16:9 widescreen or play the game at the original 4:3 ratio via the options menu.\nThis isn't just a upscaled port either. Capcom have put a lot of time and effort into this port. The textures, enviornments, character models and meshes are a lot more refined and detailed as it enhances the creepy and immersive atmosphere. I am a HUGE Resident Evil fan and played at the RE game. This is one of the best, if not THE best Resident Evil game ever. A must play for fans of the survival horror genre and for Resident Evil fans alike. 9.6/10","January 20, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've been waiting for it to happen for a very long time. I was not part of the occult Nintendo and was not interested in their gamecube. As the original release of the game back in 2002 was exclusive for the console in which at the time I only bought PS2.\n\nFirst of all, the 2002 release of Resident Evil remake was a remastered version of the 1996 title. At the time, there was many limitations in what video game graphics could achieve and so, the result was completely new textures, Improved voice over and additional features not seen in the 1996 classic. It was well received by the media. However, it still featured the same old tank - like controls, Low aspect ratio and blurry textures for the backgrounds. Suffice to say, if none of these problems were addressed, then This HD remaster should not be called HD remaster at all. Hands down to Capcom for giving us the love that we deserved.\n\nThis HD Remaster version of the 2002 release improved the overall texture quality further and that the character models were really detailed and looked nice. They improved the music in the game so that it is more immersive and added lighting effects not found in the original. What's interesting is that they added a alternative control scheme in which it plays like later games in the series (Using analogue sticks) while still keep the original control for players who want it.\n\nNow for the downside, background textures seems to be ignored by the HD remaster as they are blurry and completely out of sync with detailed character model. It may work by making the characters stand out more, but it is definitely lazy to say the least. What I have noticed is that the quality of cinematics still remained the same and from this we can tell that this game has ages well.\n\nIf you are a new comer to the series, this game is a good starting point because it puts you at pretty much the beginning of the Umbrella trilogy storyline and introduced you to all the characters straight away. Althought, the mechanics are simple. The game makes up for this with frustrating puzzles and annoying back tracking to keep you busy. The most important thing in the game is item management. If you can manage your inventory well, you will minimise the time spend running around and significantly improve on the efficiency.\n\nThe game has you take control in one of the two characters Jill or Chris. The selection has no effect in the storyline. What it matters is the partners you will get teamed up with and some characteristic perks like Jill runs faster but dies quicker and has 8 item slots and Chris runs slower but do not go down easily and has 6 item slots. These are the things purely gameplaye oriented.\n\nThe eerie atmosphere found in the game keeps you at the edge of your seat most of the time. The feeling when the music sends chill down your spine and you cannot get away from due to frustration of solving puzzles. The groaning sound that the zombie makes and the fact that you cannot see them. The nervous moments of watching the door opening animations. The dead angles in which you must proceed to the edge for it to change view only to get ♥♥♥♥ed by Crimson Heads. These are the traits of game developer Shinji Mikami and it is masterful as well as elegant. It is so well thought out and executed that it redefined the whole genre and influenced many games.\n\nWhat I must criticize is the fact that like most Capcom games, this port is some what lazy and not refined fully and pushed to an early release as a way of grabing money. Because at release the optimization was poor and for a game that was 10-12 years old. It requires a ridiculous powerful rig to run it smoothly. For mid - range specs and many laptops you will have to do some configurations. Here I will give you some tips on the possible fixes.\n\nFor Nvidia cards, if you experience slow motion and out of sync problems. Do the following:\n- Go to Nvidia control panel by right clicking on desktop\n- Go to manage 3D settings\n- In the drop down menu with list of games, find Resident Evil HD Remaster\n- Select High Performance as the game is default to use your integrated graphics\n- Apply settings\n\nFor AMD Cards it is slightly easier\n-If you have integrated graphics, try switch it to GPU\n-Set the game FPS in game settings to 30FPS lock\n\nThese configurations are only need if you have a lower spec. If you have a powerful gaming rig, the game will run smoothly without the need to configure.\n\nI have enjoyed this game very much as it brings back memories of old school game control and unforgiving gameplay. Save frequently is required but ink ribbon is limited. Players have to think ahead and think smart to be good at it. For now I only hope that Capcom will bring more HD remasters such as RE2 and RE3 as those were one of my favorites. As for Resident Evil HD Remaster I will give it a 9/10 if not for the poor optimization it would of been a 10/10.\n\n\n","January 31, 2015","true","29.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I would buy any of the old Resident Evil games that are remastered (hopefully they remaster the second and third one too). Firstly, I read some other reviews and they were all slating the optimisation of this game, for me there is no problems. I have an i7 4790K with an ASUS GTX 970 and this game runs flawlessly at 60FPS as that is the cap that I have set. It went into fullscreen first time on the options menu and all of the settings were automatically configured to high as well as FXAA antialiasing.\n\nGameplay wise the game is brilliant. The player models and interactive objects look great in HD graphics and you can either choose the traditional Chris/Jill or the newly created Chris/Jill. Whilst having the newly updated player models the background still rendered image keeps the authentic, survival horror theme to the game, of which it created.\n\nWithout being biased I can strongly say that any avid Resident Evil fan will love this remaster whatever the look/gameplay is like. I am one of those people. I also like how this game will hopefully create new fans of the series as the time that this new HD remaster has come out, a whole new generation of gamers will get to experience it which should be considered a gift and should be respected.\n\nOverall, I think this remaster is brilliant and is worth the money for any fan of the series and even new players who are interested.","January 20, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Besides that, this is essentially the oringinal REmake from the Gamecube.

The game has some issues but has gotten at least one patch per day so far, I'm really surprised at the amount of support Capcom is putting behind this, especially since SSF4/USF4's netcode is still almost unplayably broken and they don't seem to care about that...\n\nMy only non-bug related complaint is that the new control method needs some tweaks. You hold the stick to move directly relative to the current camera angle, and continue holding when the camera changes and you'll keep running in a straight line even if you're now holding the stick in the wrong direction relative to the camera. Even in its current state it's MILES better than the original tank controls, however, sometimes you barely move the stick and you change direction and other times you move the stick quite far and your character just continues running into the wall...\n\nFor $20 definitely buy it and play it over and over again.","January 22, 2015","true","18.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vdckorn/recommended/304240/","vdckorn","Haters Gonna Hate Brah!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vdckorn/","1413 products in account","This game is still as good as it was when it was first for PS1 (I never played the gamecube/wii version) with updated graphics from the GC remake. You can play with a new modern controls or the tank controls and choose what graphics, resolution and more things in the settings (althoug there is few options).\n\nList of positive/negative things that I've noted at my first playthrough\n\nPositive  The game still feels like it's first release, with some minor tweaks/changes (like I've said, I've never played the GC/WII copy);\nLets you choose what kind of FPS and if you want to play with original resolution or by 16:9;\nThe game have some replayability (if you want to do the archivements or find about another endings or unlock all costumes/extra weapons) so you can wait some time and you will feel that your money is worth paying full price;\nLike I've said you get archivements, a leadboard (evem though I think it's already hacked because i've saw some people finish the game less than 10 min, until I see an video of that, I will not belive on that), and full support to the Xbox 360 gamepad (I do own one and played with him, felt great).\n\nNeutral\nThe Crimson Head, Fuel Canister and Lighter (for Jill only, as Chris starts with the Lighter) are a good new thing, it makes you think even more if you should take that items with you (if you shot and kill the zombie) to evade the possibility of they reviving as Crimson Head's zombies, or you just don't have the space so you shouldn't kill and just evade zombies (but still it takes up to two inventory slots and if one inventory slot filled makes you even consider what should you take or not with you, think about two as Jill with lower Heath and Damage). I do think that this actually is a positive thing (but still I do not like them hehe) but it was not released when the first Resident Evil came out so some people may dislike and even rage more as the game is not hard enough as it is.\n\nNegative\nThere are some issues in some areas of the game (mainly FPS drops). I did get rarely for the first part of the game, but in some parts or areas, my fps drops would go down for 25 FPS per second. It's probably not well optimised for some parts of the game or it's my CPU problem (but I don't belive in the latter as my CPU can handle more demaning games just fine, even being an Pentium G-3258 3,2 GHz [I didn't overclocked yet but this CPU is a Beast at 4-4,5 GHz, but still it can't compare to an i7] it should run well) I hope that they will bring some updates as it seems that some people are getting the same problem with better CPU's than mine. Also people complain about their mobile GPU's not working well, CAPCOM warned about that not being supported on the Requirements List of the game page but still they should look for some fix or update as many people also game on laptops (this last sentence is an opinion as not all laptop users had that problem but some complained about that in the forums);\nThe lack of an type of Mercenarys or like Sega Saturn's release: Battle Game minigame after your first playthrough. It would be even better as you could even take more hours to the game;\nSome desynchronization in the cutscenes. It was not all the time, but from some of them have that problem;\nSome areas are low rendered. The detail in the overall it's great, but some wall's/textures/cutscenes were poorly upgraded to 1080p.\n\n\nMy final rating at this game : 8,0/10.\n\nWhy? Because it mantains the core of the game, with only few tweaks/changes/additions for the better on my perspective, but they should had more carefull updating the game to the modern day as they have some desynchronization and low rendered textures in some parts of the game.","January 23, 2015","true","23.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I've beaten this game back on Gamecube many, many times. It's my favorite Resident Evil game, but before this it was probably close to 10 years since I've played it. I liked this game so much that I started a bar/cover band and named it Crimson Head (2005-2013 from WI, USA) after the Crimson Head zombies that were added to the Gamecube RE remake. This version looks sharp. The characters modeled looks improved, and the static backgrounds, while showing their age, still look good. Keep in mind that's based on a game from 2002. The game also runs at 60fps. It's still the same great game that was on the Gamecube, but now on PC and newer consoles. Now lets hope the rumor is true that they're remastering Resident Evil Zero, and lets hope they get ambitious and remake RE 2 & 3.

This version is pretty well optimized for PC, with a good range of graphics options and customizable keyboard control support. While the game runs flawlessly at 60fps and the updated models look fantastic, the pre-rendered backgrounds are hit or miss. There are some that stand out and look incredible, such as the entrance to the mansion. However many look like they were just upscaled versions of the previous textures and as a result look out of focus or muddy.\n\nGraphics updates aside, besides some new costumes and an alternative control scheme, the game itself is pretty much the same as its 2002 version. It is nice revisiting this game now after all these years, its "dated" survival horror gameplay standing out as fresh after playing so many action oriented horror games. I found myself missing all the puzzles, having to decide whether to fight or run with my limited resources, and how good it felt to finally find that key I needed to progress. This game is a classic, survival horror at its finest. Whether you're experiencing it for the first time, or a returning fan, you're in for a treat.","January 21, 2015","true","15.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanicBacon/recommended/304240/","SatanicBacon","Reverend Recoil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanicBacon/","98 products in account","The original Remake once exclusive to the Nintendo Game Cube because they were trying to play it off as a big boy console. Did I mention that whoever came up with that concept was an idiot? I'm pretty sure this is what happened:\n"Oh we're going to pack countless man hours and an endless budget into this amazing game, then we're going to sign an exclusivity contract with one of the most child-focused consoles on the market, then we're going to completely limit marketing/advertising for our product down to practically nothing! The game sells itself!" It actually didn't, go figure.\nThere are so many ways I can call out a senseless action of stupidity, but in this case I won't even bother any further, their actions speak volumes alone.\nSo here it is, Resident Evil HD Remaster in an updated, multi-platform release. Have you bought it yet? I sure hope so, because frankly you suck if you haven't yet. And I mean you're currently sucking bad, comparable to a leech, an engorged Texas tic, or Jenna Haze in Dark Side. So the best advice I can give you at this moment is to throw down the 20 bucks, slap that ♥♥♥♥ out of your mouth, and give yourself a better experience.\nThis game is beautiful, looks great at both 1080p or even lower resolutions.  You also have to keep in mind that most of this game is an upscaling of a 2002 game with pre-rendered backgrounds. What are "Pre-Rendered Backgrounds?" my, my, allow me to wipe the Call of Duty off your brain and enlighten you. Pre- rendered backgrounds are like paintings on a frickin wall, they're pretty and you look at them, you don't touch them. So given the fact that these "paintings" were made in 2002, they do kinda look stretched out in higher resolutions today, mainly when playing in 1080p up close, or any higher resolution if you can even pull that off. So yeah, there's a slight flaw but believe me it looks wonderful.\nCharacter models? They look FU*KING amazing. That's right, they look so good you just want to reach out and FU#K'EM!\nGameplay? Feel exactly like the oldschool RE with tank controls and fixed camera angles. This is a win, and if you desire anything less, then YOU are the fail.\nI'll give this game a 12.0 on the 10.0 scale of badass, and it's good that Capcom is moving in this direction, because compared to the newer games (4-6) The Remake of the original throws those pieces of S#IT on the ground, rips out their throats, and relentlessly sodomizes them into oblivion.\nIt did the same to me AND I LIKED IT!        THAT, my friends, is Survival Horror.","February 23, 2015","true","20.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The fidelity of the backgrounds become noticeable on 1080p screens.\n\nIf you liked the REmake on the gamecube, its the same exact thing. If you're new and have never touched Resident Evil beside 4,5, or 6.

This game is amazing, and not because I have nostalgia for it, because when this game came out sadly they didn't make controllers the size of a digestive biscuit. It takes the tone so much more seriously than RE1 on the PS1 ever did.\n\nThe backtracking, amazingly doesn't feel cheap. The backtracking isn't just put there the fill time, but to add atmosphere. It'll force you to backtrack through a door that will break if you go through it, or through a place with a zombie and a crimson head.\n\nUnlike RE1, it isn't known for moments like "Wow, what a mansion!", and more for moments like the bit where you have to walk through a hallway, and there's a zombie standing outside, tapping on the glass slowly, but it never gets in. There's no insta-kills (Wink, wink!), there's no stupid basement music, there's only you, a few bullets, a mansion, and some zombies. I love it. So go buy this game. It's only £16.

I don't know why they think not having graphics options is a good idea. No way to put this in 4k, no way to turn off vsync unless you open the config and edit it. Which is not bad for me, but I don't feel like that should be forced. Just have a vsync option in the video settings, why is that so hard? Having an AMD card makes this game a pain to play with vsync on. Don't know why but any game with vsync is a stuttering screen tearing mess. Paying 20$ for this you would hope they'd support 4k... but fine it's an old game. 1080/1200 is as goood as it gets.\n\nGreat game the nostalgia is worth it. I could do without the door scenes... otherwise the game is pretty epic on scale if you never played it. Figuring everything out takes a long time. Once you figure it all out and work out a routine you can finish the game in under 3 hours, but you're looking at 10-20 if you do everything in the mansion.

It shouldnt be a problem unless you are playing the game for the wrong reasons :P\n\n-I recommend using original controls( tank-control ), unless you have a gamepad. Then use the "C"key for aiming & the "Q"key for quickturn. You'll get used to it after 10 minutes.\n-Also, aim for the head when zombie is close(press "up"(W) when shooting).\n-Save life and ammo by burning the bodies that dont go away when dead.\n\nupdate:\n\n- If you are a verteran at classic RE, then you should go for the HARD-mode. I have so far died 3 times(twice by shark & once got my head chopped off by a hunter), all of them was my own fault doing stupid stuff.\n\n-I have not noticed any of the out of sync audio or low FPS that some ppl have been complaing about.

Then spawned countless sequels, and even movies based on it. Forget what you heard about Resident Evil 4. This game is Shinji Mikami's true master piece. And while the game was good to begin with. They went back an remade it entirely for the Gamecube. And it may just be the most well done remake of a game ever done. Even if you played the PS1 original there is still lots of new stuff in this for you to experience. The game is a finely crafted none linear puzzle game blended with third person shooting. It's also incredibly impressive how it's pre-rendered backgrounds appear so real. A true work of art.\n\nAs for the HD Remaster. This edition updates the original Gamecube version with widescreen support, improved character models, and backgrounds. It also adds additional control schemes though they kind of break the game if you use them. The PC version runs pretty well in my experience, and I have not experienced any crashing or major bugs. They even have options to toggle off the new widescreen aspect ratio or use the old controls. My only complaint is not all the backgrounds seem to have gotten the same amount of polish. The Mansion looks wonderful but some other areas don't seem to have been updated much. All in all though this is pretty much the definitive version of the game in my opinion. If you have never played RE1 do yourself a favor, and find out why this series became popular in the first place.","January 20, 2015","true","21.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I genuinely forgot all about creatures like crimsonheads, which made this awesome to experience again. The only complaints I could have about this game are the simple things, remember to save often because autosave doesn't exist and you will die, and could find yourself several hours behind again, and if you know the game like the back of your hand, you could beat it in under two hours, much like the other older titles, the backtracking and inventory management is what slows you down long enough to stack on game time, but after the third playthrough, it should be pretty easy for you, if it's not already.  this game is worth playing just to meet lisa trevor and one zombie mode (if it's even in this one) where you have to run from a zombie Forest speyer that can open doors and chase you. but you can't kill him because he has grenades on him, and one shot ends your game. all in all, super happy to see this on steam 10/10","January 21, 2015","true","24.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Resident Evil has become so bloated in its sequels and spin offs, all of them underwhelming, that revisiting Spencer Mansion for the third time is sadly a breath of fresh air. Nevertheless, it is a welcomed breath of fresh air as we now have the best Resident Evil in some years.\n\nLeave it to a polished up version of a 2002 Gamecube release, which in itself was a remake of the original 1996 release of Resident Evil's starting point, to put smiles on the faces of all the devoted old school fans who have wanted the series to return to its terrifying albeit cheesy and clunky roots. Capcom achieves greatness with making the arguably best even better by tidying up the controls, graphics, textures and sound, and letting it live and breath on current generation consoles. Those who only know modern Resident Evil, or never got to play this in 2002 entry have themselves a fantastic experience ahead of them as they explore Spencer Mansion and witness the groundbreaking horror first hand with the original core characters.\n\nThis game doubles as a grocery list of what Survival Horror should be, and how the modern conveniences of gaming do not always make for the best experience. This take on Resident Evil is both familiar and curious, both comfortable and nerve racking, and both full of nostalgia and yet as challenging as a never before seen adventure. So those of you who have played the original '96 game, are still in for surprises around some corners, and challenges that will make resources vital. The dialogue, though still a bit cheesy, is multiple levels up from that of the delightfully awkward original script. It remains similar enough to bring back all the memories of the original, but separates itself enough from the past to intrigue, creating an almost parallel world experience with how similar but more thought out the new dialogue is. I found myself both listening to the new, but in my head quoting the old, making for some laughs. Once again, those first person views of doors opening, tight corridors with the moaning undead near by, and limping through halls praying for ammo and health all have your hair on end, and it is a most welcome return. The Mansion is only slightly redesigned enough to make you lull into comfort, thinking you have the situation under control before springing something new on you such as a new zombie placement, or unfamiliar room, or retelling an old experience in less predictably ways. The results are fun and frightening. The Mansion is alive with creaks and shutters, moving light and flashes of lighting, shadows and mirrors, fog and water, all pulling you in deeper than ever before.\n\nThis is Resident Evil in all its Survival Horror glory. It would be impossible to rate this any lower than a perfect score, seeing as it is a better version of a past masterpiece, and then improved once again on top of that.

I grew up on the tank controls and couldn't play this game any other way. Thankfully for people not like me they added in a yucky n00b control scheme(heh just kidding) Besides the new scheme and the new 16:9 panning screen mode there isn't much else new, it's Resident Evil how it's meant to be played, very little ammo, fixed camera angles, Chris's muscles are now in proportion with the rest of his body and zombies, lots and lots of zombies.\n\nOne thing you will notice straight away; the 3D polygonal characters like Chris, Jill, Wesker, Barry and the mutants that infest spencer mansion are massively improved in quality, higher resolution textures along with nice anti aliasing and higher polygon count really show how these GameCube assets really hold up to todays standards. Also 3D objects like movable boxes and shelves also look vastly improved - which brings us onto our first bad point. Not all pre rendered backgrounds were born equal, some look sharp and massively upscaled, like the crypt where Trevor is in his coffin and some are very blurry like the room where you play moonlight sonata, so much so that the shelf you move to get the first page of the music notes actually looks better than the background textures. It's a real shame because if they treated all the backgrounds like they treated the best ones you'd have one stunning looking game.\n\nFrom a port perspective, things started rocky, first of all no borderless window mode. You guys with multi monitors will have to wait for some enterprising modders to fix this for you. Secondly in the menu it will only let you choose up to 1080p which is a real problem for me because I have a 1440p monitor. However you can edit an ini file to get 1440p but I heard that 4K is not working and this ini edit will only allow up to 1600p. You can choose 30 or 60 fps along with variable, I don't know what variable does but I've read it is up to 120fps which is good. You have texture quality along with shadow quality and rounding it out is v-sync, not much but enough. The game ran fine at 1440p for me but I do have a GTX 980 so it would want to, depending on the card you have your mileage may vary.\n\nI was born and bred a Resident Evil fan, I think I've bought Resident Evil(be it original or REmake) five times now and this is the best version, it's a little rough around the edges but it looks good overall and the characters look great. I think if you're a diehard like me this is a no brainer, it's one of the greatest games of all time at its complete best. If you're looking for a great survival horror game with old game mechanics then maybe watch some youtube videos before taking the plunge, it is still €20 or your regional equivalent. If you want to send a message to Capcom that this is the future of Resident Evil then buy it as well. In the famous words of the IGN reviewer "I can't help but feel terrified of Crimson Heads. Even 19 years after I first encountered them" neither can I even though it feels like only 12 years.","January 20, 2015","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Resident Evil has become so bloated in its sequels and spin offs, all of them underwhelming, that revisiting Spencer Mansion for the third time is sadly a breath of fresh air. Nevertheless, it is a welcomed breath of fresh air as we now have the best Resident Evil in some years.\n\nLeave it to a polished up version of a 2002 Gamecube release, which in itself was a remake of the original 1996 release of Resident Evil's starting point, to put smiles on the faces of all the devoted old school fans who have wanted the series to return to its terrifying albeit cheesy and clunky roots. Capcom achieves greatness with making the arguably best even better by tidying up the controls, graphics, textures and sound, and letting it live and breath on current generation consoles. Those who only know modern Resident Evil, or never got to play this in 2002 entry have themselves a fantastic experience ahead of them as they explore Spencer Mansion and witness the groundbreaking horror first hand with the original core characters.\n\nThis game doubles as a grocery list of what Survival Horror should be, and how the modern conveniences of gaming do not always make for the best experience. This take on Resident Evil is both familiar and curious, both comfortable and nerve racking, and both full of nostalgia and yet as challenging as a never before seen adventure. So those of you who have played the original '96 game, are still in for surprises around some corners, and challenges that will make resources vital. The dialogue, though still a bit cheesy, is multiple levels up from that of the delightfully awkward original script. It remains similar enough to bring back all the memories of the original, but separates itself enough from the past to intrigue, creating an almost parallel world experience with how similar but more thought out the new dialogue is. I found myself both listening to the new, but in my head quoting the old, making for some laughs. Once again, those first person views of doors opening, tight corridors with the moaning undead near by, and limping through halls praying for ammo and health all have your hair on end, and it is a most welcome return. The Mansion is only slightly redesigned enough to make you lull into comfort, thinking you have the situation under control before springing something new on you such as a new zombie placement, or unfamiliar room, or retelling an old experience in less predictably ways. The results are fun and frightening. The Mansion is alive with creaks and shutters, moving light and flashes of lighting, shadows and mirrors, fog and water, all pulling you in deeper than ever before.\n\nThis is Resident Evil in all its Survival Horror glory. It would be impossible to rate this any lower than a perfect score, seeing as it is a better version of a past masterpiece, and then improved once again on top of that. Get lost in Spencer Mansion, and take a bloody bite out of the game that started it all, the one and only, Resident Evil.","January 20, 2015","true","17.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And is the best Resident Evil by far. I really don't write reviews. But as I was reading other reviews, I felt like people were not being all the way truthful at all. First of all here's the setup of my rig\n\nGeForce GTX 660 Ti\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40 GHz\n16 GB RAM (15.95 GB usable)\nOS Windows 8.1\n\nI've been a fan of this game since the original Playstation version. The truth is this is, this is a straight port from the Gamecube version. I do get a steady 60 FPS. And some of the only differences I can see is the characters have been polished a little up. But most of the game looks just like it did on Gamecube. And for the download size to be 20 GB. I just don't get it. It's strange because when you find something in the game the has been updated, such as a room or a lamp. It's just strange to see a high testured object like a lamp on the desk. When everything else in the room looks like as crainy as can be. I'm talking 90's style. When you have these two different contrast like that side by side it does take away from the atmosphere. I just wish they would have remastered the whole game. Because when they say HD remaster. I take them at there word. You would think at least 70% of the game would be redone. But it's more like 25%. But all of that said for the price, it is still worth it to me. It's one of the best survival horror games ever made. And if your a fan of this game or you haven't played it yet. I would check it out for sure. And it still has that awesome bad acting & the lips still don't match up. But I can over look all that, for a classic game I love. But a lot of fan boys on here are not telling the truth. And I can only speak for myself,  but I like to know what I'm buying. So the truth is this is a straight Gamecube port that know runs at 60 FPS. But I've read a lot of unhappy people reviews on here, that have monster rigs (way over the spec's needed ). Most have a way better setup then me. And they are having a lot of slow down, game running under 30 FPS, cut scene missing dialogue. I have had good luck this time around, & had none of these problems. But for the price of ordering a pizza it's worth the gamble to me. Oh yeah, if you choose to. You can play Chris Renfield on anabolic steroids. And you can play Jill in Swat gear or in original outfit","January 21, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And is the best Resident Evil by far. I really don't write reviews. But as I was reading other reviews, I felt like people were not being all the way truthful at all. First of all here's the setup of my rig\n\nGeForce GTX 660 Ti\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40 GHz\n16 GB RAM (15.95 GB usable)\nOS Windows 8.1\n\nI've been a fan of this game since the original Playstation version. The truth is this is, this is a straight port from the Gamecube version. I do get a steady 60 FPS. And some of the only differences I can see is the characters have been polished a little up. But most of the game looks just like it did on Gamecube. And for the download size to be 20 GB. I just don't get it. It's strange because when you find something in the game the has been updated, such as a room or a lamp. It's just strange to see a high testured object like a lamp on the desk. When everything else in the room looks like as crainy as can be. I'm talking 90's style. When you have these two different contrast like that side by side it does take away from the atmosphere. I just wish they would have remastered the whole game. Because when they say HD remaster. I take them at there word. You would think at least 70% of the game would be redone. But it's more like 25%. But all of that said for the price, it is still worth it to me. It's one of the best survival horror games ever made. And if your a fan of this game or you haven't played it yet. I would check it out for sure. And it still has that awesome bad acting & the lips still don't match up. But I can over look all that, for a classic game I love. But a lot of fan boys on here are not telling the truth. And I can only speak for myself,  but I like to know what I'm buying. So the truth is this is a straight Gamecube port that know runs at 60 FPS. But I've read a lot of unhappy people reviews on here, that have monster rigs (way over the spec's needed ). Most have a way better setup then me. And they are having a lot of slow down, game running under 30 FPS, cut scene missing dialogue. I have had good luck this time around, & had none of these problems. But for the price of ordering a pizza it's worth the gamble to me. Oh yeah, if you choose to. You can play Chris Renfield on anabolic steroids.

Never saw a reason to get a GameCube other than this game, and getting a GC for just one game I was interested in didn't seem to make too much sense.  Finally playing, and completing, this game was a fantastic experience.\n\nThe gameplay is a huge contrast to what Capcom has done with the RE series recently.  I personally love the slower paced gameplay of these classic RE titles.  This game isn't too hard to figure out, both gameplay and puzzle wise, but even then it doesn't hold your hand the entire time.  That is what makes this game great.  Want a good survival horror game?  This is it.\n\nI, and a lot of others (I'm sure), would love to see REmake 2 as well!\n\nPros:\n+ Upgraded 3D models\n+ Added widescreen support\n+ Decent PC visual settings\n+ Keyboard control support\n+ 60+ FPS\n+ Classic Resident Evil gameplay\n\nCons:\n- The pre-rendered backgrounds don't look the best (blurry)\n- Movement (especially with the keyboard) is a little awkward, sometimes my controller is unresponsive for a second or two\n- Refresh rate capped at 60Hz (I own a 144Hz monitor)","January 23, 2015","true","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is amazing, and not because I have nostalgia for it, because when this game came out sadly they didn't make controllers the size of a digestive biscuit. It takes the tone so much more seriously than RE1 on the PS1 ever did.\n\nThe backtracking, amazingly doesn't feel cheap. The backtracking isn't just put there the fill time, but to add atmosphere. It'll force you to backtrack through a door that will break if you go through it, or through a place with a zombie and a crimson head.\n\nUnlike RE1, it isn't known for moments like "Wow, what a mansion!", and more for moments like the bit where you have to walk through a hallway, and there's a zombie standing outside, tapping on the glass slowly, but it never gets in. There's no insta-kills (Wink, wink!), there's no stupid basement music, there's only you, a few bullets, a mansion, and some zombies. I love it. So go buy this game. It's only £16.

I don't know why they think not having graphics options is a good idea. No way to put this in 4k, no way to turn off vsync unless you open the config and edit it. Which is not bad for me, but I don't feel like that should be forced. Just have a vsync option in the video settings, why is that so hard? Having an AMD card makes this game a pain to play with vsync on. Don't know why but any game with vsync is a stuttering screen tearing mess. Paying 20$ for this you would hope they'd support 4k... but fine it's an old game. 1080/1200 is as goood as it gets.\n\nGreat game the nostalgia is worth it. I could do without the door scenes... otherwise the game is pretty epic on scale if you never played it. Figuring everything out takes a long time. Once you figure it all out and work out a routine you can finish the game in under 3 hours, but you're looking at 10-20 if you do everything in the mansion.

Did I mention that whoever came up with that concept was an idiot? I'm pretty sure this is what happened:\n"Oh we're going to pack countless man hours and an endless budget into this amazing game, then we're going to sign an exclusivity contract with one of the most child-focused consoles on the market, then we're going to completely limit marketing/advertising for our product down to practically nothing! The game sells itself!" It actually didn't, go figure.\nThere are so many ways I can call out a senseless action of stupidity, but in this case I won't even bother any further, their actions speak volumes alone.\nSo here it is, Resident Evil HD Remaster in an updated, multi-platform release. Have you bought it yet? I sure hope so, because frankly you suck if you haven't yet. And I mean you're currently sucking bad, comparable to a leech, an engorged Texas tic, or Jenna Haze in Dark Side. So the best advice I can give you at this moment is to throw down the 20 bucks, slap that ♥♥♥♥ out of your mouth, and give yourself a better experience.\nThis game is beautiful, looks great at both 1080p or even lower resolutions.  You also have to keep in mind that most of this game is an upscaling of a 2002 game with pre-rendered backgrounds. What are "Pre-Rendered Backgrounds?" my, my, allow me to wipe the Call of Duty off your brain and enlighten you. Pre- rendered backgrounds are like paintings on a frickin wall, they're pretty and you look at them, you don't touch them. So given the fact that these "paintings" were made in 2002, they do kinda look stretched out in higher resolutions today, mainly when playing in 1080p up close, or any higher resolution if you can even pull that off. So yeah, there's a slight flaw but believe me it looks wonderful.\nCharacter models? They look FU*KING amazing. That's right, they look so good you just want to reach out and FU#K'EM!\nGameplay? Feel exactly like the oldschool RE with tank controls and fixed camera angles. This is a win, and if you desire anything less, then YOU are the fail.\nI'll give this game a 12.0 on the 10.0 scale of badass, and it's good that Capcom is moving in this direction, because compared to the newer games (4-6) The Remake of the original throws those pieces of S#IT on the ground, rips out their throats, and relentlessly sodomizes them into oblivion.\nIt did the same to me AND I LIKED IT!

This is the pinnacle of horror games. Hell this is hands down the best Resident Evil made so far, and has been improved with the HD remaster. The atmosphere, gameplay, sound, everything is amazing. The gameplay has had some tweaks that mad ammo and health less plentiful, but the controls are a lot better and easy for new players to get used to. I really reccomend buying this game for many reasons stated above. The only cons this game has is the port tends to be rather funny and suffer from  slowdown on weaker PCs. Also, you really need a controller to play this game well. I reccomend a DS4.","August 30, 2015","true","47.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The new controls offer the elimination of the classic Tank Controls, removing the run button (for as long as you play the game with the new controls) and making the game more streamlined. That said, the forced perspective does not work in the new control schemes favor. You're better off using tank controls. The game can also be modded, furthering it's replay value when it already ridiculuous amounts of post game content anyway.\n\nI don't have much more to say other than, it's basically the Gamecube Remake with just a few more bells and whistles, and that it's a fantastic port. (I had no problems with it, so you might want to see other reviews for port issues and what not.) I really can't say anymore, as the game simply speaks for itself. I suppose the last thing I can add is....um.....ROLL THE CONTROL STICK TO ESCAPE! (I'm serious my fellow gamers, I did not know how to escape zombies properly for about 65% of the entire game, making me rethink whether or not CapCom knows what Easy and Normal mode mean. I know how now, so Easy is Easy and Normal is Normal, before though......it was rough....) Well, that's it. Hope you enjoyed the review (or don't...I don't really care...) 19tangerines out!\n\n","July 1, 2015","true","32.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Now, it serves as proof that no matter how much time passes, console games can, and are, ported to the PC. This particular one was remastered most excellently. The graphics are certainly as enhanced as the comparisons show. The atmosphere and the sound effects are among the most lifelike in any video game to date. The lighting, both from the moonlight and the candles and the contrast of the shadows  is very impressive. In Resident Evil HD Remaster, the line between video games and cinema is much thinner than it was before. In the original game, there was no lightning or thunder, no running water or leaves moving in the wind, but there are in this version and they create a great ambiance.\n\nThe gameplay is modelled after the classic stop and shoot design, but somehow that makes the experience even more suspenseful. The fixed camera angles add great tension and dread to the atmosphere. The shooting mechanics are crisp and the autoaim is a very welcome feature that will appeal to the early Resident Evil fans who were frustrated by having to turn and face the enemy manually. Also, the self-defense technique of sticking a hand grenade in the mouth of a zombie, cerberus or hunter, offers a very inventive and spectacular way to blow their heads off, either by running away and letting the grenade go off, or shooting it with a weapon.\n\nFor the fans and newcomers to the game, you'll find much to like about the port of the Resident Evil remake. The least of which will be a more elabourate Spencer Mansion. Many new areas have been added to it, making the building more believable and complete. The larger library, the enlarged and new balconies are particularly noteworthy. Don't miss out on this game. If you value sophisticated level design, mystery and action, I think you will enjoy what this remastered port has to offer.","February 25","true","15.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thraxza/recommended/304240/","thraxza","Thr@x","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thraxza/","59 products in account","6/10\n\nResident Evil began life in a troubled mansion, overrun with bloodthirsty zombies, man-eating plants and killer sharks and while the franchise has severely lost its way since then, Resident Evil HD was Capcom’s way out of this corporate nightmare.\n\nIn Resident Evil, players take on the role of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, members of a special police task force or S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) sent to investigate a series of murders – victims were apparently eaten – stemming from the infamous Spencer Mansion located in the outskirts of Raccoon City.\n\nYou begin the game by choosing from three needless difficulty settings since the overall gameplay experience is outright determined by which character you choose to play.\n\nEquipped with a starting pistol, Jill is able to carry more gear while stumbling upon more ammunition and healing herbs than the game’s irksome inventory system will allow. Chris on the other hand begins his journey with little more than a knife and must otherwise navigate the entire game with just six items at a time, including weapons and ammunition.\n\nAnd yet even despite Jill’s inherent advantage, Resident Evil is not an action game. Normally ‘being stuck’ costs you nothing, but in Resident Evil, each backtrack, each re-calculated route through the mansion means burning through your already limited supplies and still not even finding what you’re looking for.\n\nMoreover it only takes a couple of direct attacks to kill you while the niggling inventory or rather lack of, will often see you ill-equipped to combat the bloodcurdling creatures in the next room.\n\nThe struggle for survival further extends to the game’s unique save system. Unlike its modern counterparts, Resident Evil forgoes any sort of checkpoint or quick save options in favour of collectable Ink Ribbons which you must lug around in your inventory.\n\nAdditionally the game only allows you to save in specific rooms that contain a typewriter, turning your ability to save into a diminishing resource.\n\nEssentially, Resident Evil HD is just a re-mastered version of the Resident Evil (2002) remake for the Nintendo GameCube and not Shinji Mikami’s genre-defining 1996 original. I use the term re-mastered lightly because the game certainly isn’t pushing any boundaries when it comes to what we can expect from modern visuals and is instead more like a fresh coat of paint.\n\nThe game is built from start to finish with the same dingy, low-resolution, pre-rendered backdrops with only character models and usable objects restored in pin-sharp, high-definition detail.\n\nMore of a widescreen replication than actual recreation, even the traditional cut scenes, both live-action and CGI, are still incredibly poor and do little to mask the game’s exasperating dialogue.\n\nOne thing I will say is that where the PlayStation version felt clunky, the HD version makes exploring the iconic mansion a treat. Instead of having to struggle with the game’s original ‘tank-like’ controls, players are now given complete freedom of movement.\n\nAs mentioned in Telkom Gaming’s History of Resident Evil, the game was originally tailored as a first person shooter but the mechanic was later scrapped in favour of a third-person perspective, which was believed to be ‘scarier’.\n\nThe perspective switch allowed Mikami to control the camera at every point in the game and therefore make something as trivial as creeping around a corner, fundamentally terrifying since there was no way to see what was on the other side.\n\nWhile these fixed camera angles irrefutably added to the game’s tension, when paired with the haphazard controls of the original, something as simple as dodging a zombie in a narrow corridor could end in a bloody mess.\n\nBack then pressing left didn’t move the character, it turned the character left. If you wanted to move to the right, you had to turn the character to the right, then press up on the d-pad or analog stick. The modern control scheme however allows players to move in the direction they point and the result is a liberating and far less frustrating experience.\n\nIn truth Resident Evil HD includes just enough visual improvements to warrant a new release tag but not enough to stand on its own feet.\n\nThe problem therein lies in the concept of a re-mastering rather than an actual remake. The former never really merits the time and money it takes to develop (Final Fantasy VII) whereas had Capcom chose to completely overhaul this time-old classic, complete with new features and the latest visual technology, Resident Evil HD could easily have gotten away with being Resident Evil 7.\n\nIn fact, the Resident Evil (2002) remake for the Nintendo GameCube did just that. It built on Resident Evil’s existing foundations, combined new story elements (Lisa Trevor), gameplay mechanics (Crimson Heads) and the best visuals of its time to produce an authentic but loyal tribute to the franchise.\n\nResident Evil HD on the other hand feels more like a port of a port if anything else.","February 20","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was woefully mistaken. I can run the game on a smooth 9 frames per second while watching cut scenes that lag behind. Hell I wasn't able to get past the first room just because how annoying this was. For me Chris moves in your standard slow 80's motion picture of a lifeguard running across the sandy shores of a beach to either punch some sharks, or rescue a dame in distress. How ever the one thing I did like is these door animations every time you transition between rooms. I can see how that can add immerse yourself into a game. However all I got instead (Mostly my fault) was Wesker constantly telling me that I must figure off who fired off shots in the room I started the game in. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone with a ♥♥♥♥♥ier computer then mine. But from the small portion of game I blundered on through I would recommend this to anyone with the computer to run it properly. Also take in mind that I was unable to actually get past the first room so really my recommendation of this game means nothing.","April 1","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

This game is what survival-horror actually means. RE4 was my first game of the series and while it was one of my favourite games of all time, I can't help but wish they had gone back to this style of movement and aiming for RE5 and RE6.\n\nThe over-the-shoulder view and aiming style does make more sense, and gives you much more control; but that control takes away from the difficulty and the almost claustrophobic style of fear moving through the mansion's corridors brings. I think they should either go back to this style or make a spin-off series that controls like the originals.","January 22, 2015","true","32.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

If like me you cant quite remember how to instantly solve all the puzzles and which rooms to go to first then you can expect about a 12 hour play through per character, with bonus items awarded to promote re playing as the same character.\nRe-done graphics are pretty spot on and most of the scenes look beautiful, one small grip however is that, for an HD remake in 2015, 1920x1200 as a max resolution is pretty poor, and the odd fmv sequence are in their original 320(?)p format which look terrible, surely they could have afforded to re-do these tiny sequences (maybe about 20 seconds worth of fmv in total).","January 22, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Some people still unsatisfied with the graphics, well, at least it's better than the average level. If you have the doubt about the program optimization, I'd say its ok. Actually you should look at the performance of this game on ps3 and xbox360, and you will say 'Wow its f***king great!' By the way if you can stand Ubi's games I think there's no problem any more.\n\nFew guys say there may be not synchronized between audio and video, but most of us never faced such problems. In my opinion the reason why you might face this trouble should because of your hardware, or drivers. To solve these problems, I suggest you can set the frame to 30fps, and, turn off the f**king vertical synchronous. Remember, if you have two or more video cards, this game probably only use one of them, especially integrated graphics, you'd better choose the better one or find some patch to fix it.","January 20, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Unterschiede sind\ndie Möglichkeit, den Charakter relativ zur Kamera zu bewegen\neine auf Widescreen optimierte Bildschirmdarstellung\nHigh - Definition Charaktermodelle\nEin leichterer zur Auswahl stehender Schwierigkeitsgrad\nBekleidete Zombies in den Laboren\n\nFür alle, die sich mit den alten RE Spielen nicht auseinander gesetzt haben:\nEs handelt sich hierbei um ein ruhiges und langsameres Action Adventure. Man erschließt sich durch das Lösen von Rätseln und Aufsammeln von Schlüsselgegenständen Schritt für Schritt ein düsteres Herrenhaus, in dem sich neben Zombies auch noch einige andere Monster befinden.\nWenn man noch nicht weiß, was zu tun ist und wo man lang muss, können Munition und Heil-Items schnell knapp werden.\nFür ein erstes Durchspielen sollte man etwa 10 Stunden einplanen.\n\nDas Spiel glänzt mit seiner unheimlichen Atmosphäre und immenser Spannung. Jump Scares existieren, sind aber nicht die Hauptquelle des Horrors. Stattdessen spielt das Spiel mit Erwartungen und Irreführungen. Das Befürchten von Monstern ist hier Schlimmer, als ihr Auftauchen!","November 1, 2015","true","11.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Screens aren't static anymore giving more motion to the game.\nThe framerate isn't only improved but the blurring motion that was in the gamecube version is not present and it's just super smooth now.\nTo my surprise you get new outfits for Chris and Jill in the form of their BSAA uniforms which is obviously copy-pasta from RE5's DLC (which is frustrating since we didn't see that PC side) which is fun, but now there's more game modes too including some that are...probably gonna be left to the speed runner pros. True Survival for more realistic gameplay? Fair enough. Invisible Zombie Mode? Atari 2600 game options anyone?\n\nBut yes, playing with my Cousin who's a big fan of the series we both noticed the difference and while some may find the scrolling and maybe odd smoothness 60fps gives- they give you the option to change both so there's no reason to hate what's been added.\n\nHopefully we'll see a Resident Evil 2 remake, I'm hoping they don't push Zero as ..that game was weird with it's items but either way! Solid remaster of a remake of a ol' game.\nI didn't run into any performance issues however, that may be because my set up is different though.\ni7-4770k\nGTX-970\n8GB ram\n","January 23, 2015","true","19.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Barely. While some of the bullshots may have looked good, guess what - they weren't real.\n\nIn the first half hour you can see upon a few seconds study how every texture and model in the game seeps with 13 year old "quality". This is most definitely just a touch up. It's not a bad touch up - and it's the best looking version you're going to find anywhere - but make no mistake, it's a touch up. The only true additions are the new control scheme and the enhanced lighting. Other than that, you can see the rigid low poly models like Jills hat and shoulder guards, Barry's solid metal vest, Barry's HORRIBLE looking magnum for one thing...it's just silly. Obviously they weren't going to go back and re-remake it again, but come on. I've worked with the original GC models, ripped from the game, and these don't look very much better.\n\nOther than that...boob physics, and achievements. Same great retcon-full story that all of these Steam "reviewers" are accrediting the success of Resident Evil and survival horror in general to, ignoring the fact that when REmake came out, the survival horror genre was actually finished, and has been dead ever since with very few exceptions. If you don't believe me, well, then that doesn't affect you because you didn't actuall play RE since day 1 to know the original story.\n\nBuy it but do it for 14.99 and not 20. I myself bought it and a copy for a friend, believing all the rave reviews, and wish I hadn't waited an extra couple of hours and missed the discounts.","January 20, 2015","true","68.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
