And talking about being a badass, the main protagonist - Reverend Ray, voiced by Marc Alaimo who did not just a great work, but one of the major points why I simply LOVE the game, not to mention that the story itself teaches you important lessons.\n\nOverall the game is great for its age(2006) and I highly recommend it to try it\n\n10/10","November 28, 2013","true","10.4"," 66 of 75 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","66","75","0","3"

I retrieve my arrow, which has pinned his forearm to his chest.\n\nGreat FPS Wild West style! This is NOT an easy game, even on easiest difficulty. You can run 'n gun, but that tactic will only get you so far. Some parts require stealth, which adds to the difficulty, but also the fun.

Solid shooting mechanics mix with poor level design while potentially interesting protagonists are bludgeoned with ho-hum enemies. Sadly some of the game's signature features, such as the slow-motion focus shooting, are hugely overused and actually drag the game down.Call of Juarez's plot unfolds from each of two character perspectives. The first, Billy, is a worthless do-nothing that finds himself wandering back home after years of searching for the mythical treasure of Juarez.He's an entirely annoying character in spirit and nearly all of the levels designed for him involve some sort of sneaking or rock climbing expedition, which only compounds the issue.he second character, Reverend Ray, is a preacher with a dark past that has actively been seeking redemption through prayer and church. When his brother is killed, supposedly by Billy, his more violent side pushes to the front again as he begins the chase for righteous vengeance across the wild, slaughtering any wicked men in his way. The violent road eventually leads to unfortunate consequences as Revered Ray's convictions and faith are turned upside down. Both characters are given skills to help differentiate their styles of play, Ray being the run and gun and Billy being the sneak about, but the techniques aren't necessarily welcome.One of the game's more interesting features, called concentration mode, also ends up being one of the game's worst enemies. When activated, time will slow down for Ray after drawing his guns. The recharge time on Ray's ability is too fast, allowing you to simply wait and use it over and over. Having a special ability like this should actually be special rather than standard.While the special focus ability is optional, the levels, unfortunately, are not.  The corridor shooter sections with Reverend Ray running point aren't necessarily all bad. Running and gunning through an Old West town is fun. But corridor shooting can only get you so far these days. Even worse are the levels with jumping puzzles and whip swinging. Visually Call of Juarez is decent enough though it won't win any awards. It looked pretty good when it was originally announced, but these days it's mid-range at best. Character models, faces particularly, are the best the game has to offer. Environments are blocky and offer up some strange texturing creating passable play areas. Multiplayer also has its moments, though most of them are more cheap thrills than deep gaming. Call of Juarez might appeal to you, but it's not the Wild West fun I was hoping for.","November 10, 2014","true","6.5"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","42","47","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/3020/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want a quick summary of why I recommend Call of Juarez skip the Results and read from there.\n\nTechland starts the series with the epic western mystery action adventure. Call of Jaurez draws you in to a world of hardship and torment that plagues the old west. In particularly how racism and corruption of the older days impacted the life of Billy Candle, a young man.\n\nStory:\nCall of Juarez is a Western style action game. The story is incredibly interesting, but honestly takes a while to get into. Call of Juarez is a western mystery surrounding the story of the gold of Juarez. The story surrounds the protagonist Billy Candle, a boy without a father, from the little town of Hope (an ironic name). Billy ends up being caught up in a mystery of whether he may or may not have murdered his parents. The death of Billy’s parents and the prejudice of the Hope forces Billy to go on the lamb. Reverend Ray, brother to Billy’s mother’s lover, hunts Billy for this crime. In order to start a new life Billy is set for Juarez, but will Reverend Ray catch him?\n\nCampaign:\nIn the campaign you play both Billy and Ray throughout. Billy as he is on the lamb and the Reverend as he hunts him down. There are fifteen chapters to the game, and they only become longer as you progress further. Each chapter begins with a dialogue read either by Billy or Ray. The story is rather gripping, but I didn't start really caring much about the characters until about Chapter VII. The game has some levels that are incredibly long, while others than are very short. I would recommend saving a lot during the game as for me the Auto-Save feature did not work. What is most interesting is how the levels are designed; some of them are essentially open world while others are pathways. For an older game, 2006, the levels can be quite expansive and rather innovative. Some of these levels will require you to solve puzzles, other will require you to complete tasks, but most the time you will just be running and gunning like a madman.\n\nGameplay:\nOnce you’ve mastered the basic mechanics of the game there is not much more too it. Billy Candle should always use the Bow and Arrow as it causes time to slow for him. While Reverend Ray should always quick draw as it causes time to slow for him. There are many different types of weapons, but you will notice that as the game progresses they are all essentially the same and pistols with quick reload are always the best bet. Rifles win over shotguns, because you will never be close to enemies that need a big dose of Lead (Pb). And on the incredibly rare occasion you find one, a scoped rifle is the best gun. The weapons break over time, so you will be constantly throwing away your guns and essentially selecting the same ones.  The movement is rather clunky, but for a 2006 title it does a good job. If you are interested in getting into Call of Juarez series (although I have not played Bound in Blood) Gunslinger is a completely different game with no references to the original. So you could start wherever you want and just work your way back to this one.\n\nHints:\n>Despite there being many interesting and cool guns, they all do the same basic damage and essentially there is no reason to use anything other than the Quick Reload weapons and the Bow.\n>Just remember with Reverend Ray you can always quick draw, just put away your guns, wait a few moments, and then right click your mouse.\n\nDifficulty Problems:\nI beat this game on Medium Difficulty, but I would say I was really upset I couldn't play it on Hard Difficulty. I wanted to, but the first episode where you had to run away from the rain of bullets was essentially impossible, so because of that one annoying part I had to play the whole game on medium.\n\nResults:\nIf you like Westerns, you can get past the mechanics/graphics of older generation games, and are interested in an epic adventure then this is the game for you. The game presents a lot of challenges, mystery, character development, open world environments, and combat. The game was incredibly easy and I never was really posed with a single challenge, although a lack of challenge just makes the game seem like a 80s action movie. Call of Jaurez is a fun game coupled with a fantastic campaign. I recommend Call of Jaurez, especially if you can get it for a good sale.\n\nPros:\n+Interesting story, characters and level design.\n+Nice variety of weapons (despite you only ever really using one type of them)\n+No limit to “Quick Draw” Ability\n+A long campaign that requires a variety of tactics and battle types.\n+Being able to swing with your whip from tree to tree.\n\nCons:\n-My game glitched making me unable to finish the final scene, but you can easily watch it online (despite it not being as gratifying as completing it yourself).\n-The game can take a while to load even though its an old game.\n-The dialogue at the beginning of each episode is read incredibly slow\n-The guns lose duration and break, which is incredibly annoying as some weapons, like the scoped rifle, are near impossible to find.\n-Some of the levels are so big you find yourself running between zones for a couple minutes with no enemies.","February 26, 2014","true","13.0"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","0"

Not in a good way like a wine either.\n\nThe Good:\nThe first person shooter mechanics work well, though they do feel like an older style. This game tends to be "run and gun", think Quake, but perhaps a little more tactical. The enemy AI don't exactly outwit you, although, do they ever in a first person shooter? The combat is surprisingly fun, and the bullets feel surprisingly real. You get shot in the head with a rifle in real life, chances are you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You get shot in the head with a rifle in Call of Juarez? Chances are... you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Don't get me wrong though, this is no Dark Souls. The combat can be challenging (at least I found it so on normal difficulty), but you're not going to be repeating fights over and over again.\n\nThe story on offer whilst not ground-breaking is what any Western fan would like. You've got fabelled treasure, Mexicans, a Native American who offers spiritual guidance, and of course vengance.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe voice acting in this game is average as hell. In particular the main character sounded so false I'm convinced that I myself could portray a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mexican better. The Preacher's voice on the otherhand was pretty bad ♥♥♥, so not too many points lost here.\n\nThe Ugly:\nThe graphics like the rest of the game are close to 10 years old. They're pretty gross and the textures lack diversity. That being said, you probably can't find any other game of this age that has aged any better. The graphics are still at a level where gameplay isn't a blurred mess, all the main characters look distinct and that's good enough for me!\n\nConclusion:\nDo you love Westerns? Do you like feeling love you're a cowboy? Can you tolerate a dated game?\nIf you're answer is yes to these, this games worth picking up.\nDo you love high res textures? Do you love high quality voiceacting? Do you hate dated mechanics?\nIf you're answer is yes to these, don't bother. Get down to gamestop for the latest and greatest Assassins of Duty III - Escape to Africa  :^)\n\nMy personal score: 8/10, looking forward to picking up the sequel.","September 6, 2015","true","7.6"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","25","28","8","2"

However, the atmosphere, the voice acting, the action, the gameplay and the storyline all come together to make a great western.  Techland, creators of Dead Island and the Call of Juarez series, offer a wonderful graphical experience.  There are some little issues here and there with the game.  I had my share or horseriding issues, or the strange sneaking ability that doesn't always work.  As a whole, great game, and I highly recommend it to those who want to play a good Western style game.  Just be aware, this game is not easy.  Even on easy, the game will make replay the same mission again and again.  Sometimes the autosave feature is too far between saves, so make sure to save your game often.  Restarting a mission just before an autosave and having to do the whole thing again is very frustrating.","November 12, 2014","true","12.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

The story is told over the course of 15 levels switching between two characters and retelling certain events from different perspectives.\n\n+ Good soundtrack\n\nThe Average:\n\nControls and animation feel stiff and cumbersome. There are times when you can jump and grab a ledge easily and other times you are not allowed to jump over a knee high barricade because the game designers don't want you going a certain way.\n\nThe game features stealth sections every once in a while to break up the gameplay. Although its nice to have a change of pace, these stealth sections are average at best. Enemies will sometimes spot you a mile away while other times you can crouch right in front of them. Worse, if you do get spotted you have to replay the entire section over again, granted they are not very long but still frustrating none the less.\n\nShooting mechanics are average. Guns have no weight or feel to them, have poor accuracy and often times gets pretty frustrating to get through certain sections.\n\nThe bad\n\n- While the graphics are good, especially the outdoor environments, textures and character models are bad.\n\n- The last main mission has respawning enemies making for a very frustrating experiences causing you to abuse quick save/load to get by certain sections\n\n- game crashed a few times\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough a very average game by today's standards I still think its worth checking out even at a discounted price. Strangely enough the outdoor environments are really the best thing this game has to offer.\n","December 7, 2015","true","6.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

This game is pretty old now and there are some problems with this game, but I still liked it very much and I recommend it to everybody who likes western theme.\nFirst, let's talk about the good things. What I especially liked is the atmosphere, soundtrack and the story (except for this terrible final ending scene). You know, there are some games that keeps you interested in the story from the beginning and till the end. Call of Juarez is one of those.\nAbout the gameplay - we have 2 playable characters with different playstyles. When you play Reverend Ray its your classical FPS, where you shoot your enemies using rifles, shotguns, dual pistols and stylish slowmotion ability. When you play as Billy Candle, prepare for some stealth and lasso swinging (both are extremely unpolished, but you will get used to them after some time). Actually Billy's missions can be frustrating at first, but when you get used to them, they will not be a problem.\nUnfortunately there are plenty of bugs in the game, I've had some funny ones with people stuck in the walls etc. Weapon variety is not impressive either. But anyway, the game is decent, and you should try it.\nVERDICT: There are some problems, unpolished stuff and bugs in the game, but captivating story, decent soundtrack, "dark atmpsphere" and Reverend Ray, who is a total badass makes this game worthy of your attention. I honestly didn't like it at first, but the more I played, the more interested I was. If you don't like western setting, maybe you won't like it. But if you do, this is a must.\nMy personal rating for the game is 7.5/10","October 31, 2014","true","8.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

Despite the outdated graphics which might put some people off, but please do consider it's a game from 2006, and the performance issues I had I actually really enjoyed my time with it. Call of Juarez lets you play as two different characters and both play an important role on the plot which I found out to be rather interesting but, of course, that depends from person to person. The two things I most enjoyed about Call of Juarez was probably the soundtrack which sets you in the right western mood as you play and the gun handling, I actually was really surprised by how good each gun felt and how satisfying was to shoot and kill someone with a headshot. Probably the worst thing about this game for me is the level design, even though it might look interesting at certain points, I realized that most of the time it lacks variety and they just put up a bunch of hills, grass and trees and there you go.

About 8 hours worth of gameplay, with many interesting and innovative features, including some way ahead of their time.\n\nCoJ is a rather good game as games go. The story covers Reverend Ray on one side, and Billy Candle on the other. Ray's gameplay in rather combat heavy, with lots of gunplay. Billy's story is more stealth focussed, with a bullwhip for mobility and a bow for stealth/long range combat. If the game had an unremarkable story, its gameplay would earn it a decent enough review.\n\nBut the story is where this game stands out. Without revealing anything or putting up any spoilers, it features two awesome characters who you genuinely begin to feel for at various points in the story. The first 2 thirds of the story set what would appear to be a set in stone atmosphere, but this changes in dramatic fashion. One of few games which would make a good movie.\n\nWell worth playing for anybody who appreciates a fantastic story.

This game is basically a Spaghetti western, from the story line to the bullet-time-like concentration mode. The story is linear and central to this game. For those who insist on an open world, this game is not for you. I noticed quite a few reviewers gave a thumbs down to the game simply because it was a linear game.\n\nThat said, there are some really annoying things about this game. The physics don't work right at times. For example, you can get stuck trying to simply jump a broken fence or onto a crate. Not being able to pick something up that's inside a drawer you just opened is also annoying. You'll have to try to figure out how to crouch in just the right position in order to target the item.  It's just unnecessary frustration. I also really hate that they made jumping a mandatory skill in the game. You'll find yourself falling because you timed your jump between platforms wrong.

This is what a Western should be.\n\nWhile Call of Juarez isn’t particularly perfect in most of these areas, the graphics are visually pleasing for a dated game, the atmosphere is excellent, thanks to the superb cinematic score and the game play is not only varied, but intense and immersive.\n\nWhen you’ve finished with the brief, yet engrossing single-player campaign, you will enjoy the online multiplayer, thanks to some classic modes re-created with some old-west charm.\n","May 23, 2014","true","12.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Reviews were negative and the whole first person,GTA knockoff thing didn't appeal to me. I've only played this, Bound in Blood, and Gunslinger. So, on to this game.\nI think this is the best, and worst game in the Call of Juarez series. First, the good stuff. With the exception of the stiff facial animation, the graphics are kinda neat for a 2007 game (obviously aside from Crysis). The foliage actually looks better than most games I've played, and the screen space sun rays make for some cool lighting. The shadows are actually higher resolution than the sequels. But the thing that most impressed me, regarding the visuals, was the dust effect from bullet impacts. In other games, you shoot a tree, the ground, whatever, and the bullet kicks up a small cloud of dust. Call of Juarez goes one step further. If you fire a bullet, an arrow, or even use Billy's whip on one of those dust clouds, it will spread out and away from the projectile. I love the dynamic effect this has on shootouts.\nHow's the gameplay? Pretty good, when you're in combat. As Ray McCall you can dual wield pistols and occasionally activate a sort of bullet-time for a few seconds. As Billy, the game enters slow-mo every time you aim your bow. Levels tend to be fairly wide open with plenty of space to move around. But there was one thing I could not stand, the duals, which, like the sequels, were a real pain. Overall, the combat is fun, though difficult. However, this game isn't all fighting. It also has stealth and platforming sections, but these were worse than the duals. Enemies seemed to spot me no matter what I did. And there's nothing more infuriating in this game than thinking you've just escaped, and a sharp sound indicates you were caught, triggering an instant fail state. If you manage to get past the stealth sections without rage quitting, then the platforming level might just do you in. Jumping gaps feels awkward, and while using your whip to swing on branches SOUNDS cool, it's almost impossible to accurately determine where you'll land. I lost count of the number of times I fell to my death because of the clumsy first-person platforming.\nThe story is alright, better than Gunslinger, but worse than Bound in Blood.\nI recommend this game IF you can get past the frustrating platforming and stealth levels, and have fun with the combat and visuals.\n","February 11","true","7.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/D_A/recommended/3020/","D_A","Damien Azreal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/D_A/","346 products in account","Back in 2006 Techland were still relatively unknown. Having released Chrome before hand, a shooter that got a rather mixed reaction.\nThey followed up with Call of Juarez. Going even further into their own direction they decided to focus on a wild west themed shooter built on their own in house engine.\n\nWhat we got was a gorgeous looking shooter that palyed like a spagetti western with bits of Robert Rodriguez attitude here and there.\n\nI bought the original retail release back in 2006 and after finishing it, I hadn't ever really returned to it. But, recently I bought the game again on STEAM and decided to give the entire series (yes even The Cartel) a proper rerun.\n\nWith the first Call of Juarez I'm still in love with the verys imple and direct style of the game. While at times still wonderfully beautiful in it's visuals, it still comes up short on character animations, which were a bit stiff even back in 2006.\nAnd at times, the character models even look a bit rough, as if they are not up to the same level of quality as the levels themselves. The levels... vast, wide open areas. They don't offer much (or any) in the way of exploration. But, they are large enough to give you the feeling of how large the wild west was.\n\nThe story, is good. Nothing great, but nothing bad. It's solid writing, decent voice acting... but nothing I want to spoil or get into. But, the game is worth playing simply for Reverand Ray alone. His character is and will always be the best part of the first two CoJ titles.\nThe other main character Billy, is... okay. But, at times he's more annoying then engaging and a lot of the time I simply wanted to return to Ray.\n\nGameplay is were the game falters. Switching back and forth between Ray and Billy, offering up variety in gameplay and level design. Something most shooters struggle with.\nWith Ray, it's a more straight forward shooter experience. He's a brawler, strong and a very talented gunfighter. Billy, is weak, but fast and sneaky. And very skilled with a bow and arrow.\nWhile the variety is nice, it's also here that problems arise. Ray's levels are wonderful. WIth his armor chestplate able to deflect shots, and his concentration mode being able to down multiple enemies quickly. Issues arise during the "dualing", never a great setup... a mouse cursor bug on mordern OS causes the game to be incredibly frustrating during these parts.\nAs for Billy, while the platforming works very well and the stealth is actually done very well also. Billy is very weak, and more often then not they throw you into combat situations as him. Often expecting you to try and just run from them instead of fighting.\nBut, as weak as he is even one lucky shot as you're trying to run (or ride away on a horse) can kill you.\n\nA flawed gem, but one I'm enjoying replaying.","November 1, 2015","true","6.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The last six and a half years have be relatively kind to Call of Juarez but it is definitely one for the genre or series fans rather than everyone and the current Steam price of £14 that I'm seeing is definitely too much and I'm glad I didn't pay that much.\n\nMechanicially the game is quite interesting. The plot and the mechanics revolve arround two seperate characters, the young agile sneaky Billy and old psychopathic Reverend Ray. Billy's levels revolve arround stealth and movement, Ray's arround shooting everything that moves before it can shoot you. Neither is perfect, Billy's stealth ability to hide in bushes for instance is particularly dependant on the level designers whim rather than any sense of logic and the Reverend's bullettime ability with pistols is obscenely overpowered, makes no sense at all and breaks up the shooting almost as much as Fallout 3's V.A.T.S. system. So yeah, the run and gun character plays like something out of an RPG... Honestly, it isn't as bad as that sounds though and I had fun playing his levels, and Billy's for that matter, throughout the game. The fact that the mechanics are a bit different from the norm and have their own particular feel is really what has kept this game feeling fresh.\n\nIt also doesn't outstay its welcome, which admittedly is a flattering way of saying it is short but short and good is a heck of a lot better than long and boring any day. Particularly if you're not paying the sort of money that would demand a game that is both long and good.\n\nPlot wise, well it is a western and as such it probably can't be expected to deliver too much and it doesn't really. Two fairly interesting main characters, Ray in particular wouldn't be that interesting just as a background character but as a viewpoint character he is a minor stroke of genus. Sadly the supporting cast are wooden cutouts at best. The female characters are particular badly done by. There are four in total that I noticed: there is Suzy, who works as a prosititute and who basically only exists to have her gun stolen by Billy while she is trying to "welcome you home" behind her pimp's back. Then there is Billy's mother who is brutally murdered before she even has a chance to appear in the game and exists pretty much only as an example of the woman in the fridge trope. Then there is the sheriff's wife who is a damsel that must be rescued from some random dudes for reasons. Then there is Molly, the love interest and main female character who is pretty much the most generic boring useless damsel in distress you could hope to meet. If any of these characters had anything approaching an actual character then I must have missed it. As a side note the game should probably come with a trigger warning for sexual violence since it can't seem to shut up about it. I guess they were trying to make it sound gritty but it is completely overdone.\n\nWould I recommend it? Well for all my gripes I did have fun and for the couple of quid I paid for it I easily got value for money out of it. I didn't pay £14 for it though and I wouldn't recommend that you do either but as a game that is still fun and interesting, so yeah, I'll recommend it.","December 14, 2013","true","10.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

One thing that ruined it for me and has kind of put me in a downer *POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!*, is at the end, you have to shoot somebody, and it wasn't working for me when I was clicking my left and right mouse buttons or pressing two to reach for the gun in my inventory, and I had to search for like half hour what the heck was up with that and I thought it was a glitch. So I ended up nearly half smashing my keyboard mashing every button to see what worked and it didn't. But I found out you draw your gun by the controls you would use in a gun fight (moving mouse up and down), which was odd as it wasn't, and that really bugged me and put me in a grump by the time of the ending. It was a decent conclusion to the story, though it does end rather sort of obruptly if you will, not too great of a conclusion when there is a lot of things that could have been revealed, and it just pops up with "THE END", and when you continue, you're right back at the menu again.

The first game was a prequal to the second, using  a very post modernist way to tell its backstory. Well designed, Call of Juarez has an intuitive game system and graphics engine, no doubt. Despite the valleylike walls of the settings, which make the levels feel like open mazes, the environments are  pleasing tothe eye. The shooting dynamics are well implemented. Billy's whip and Ray's excellent handling of guns are interesting new features. However, the stealth chapters of the story tend deprive players of having more of a chance to have firefights, which is remedied later on in the game, but only in the final chapter. Also, interactions with NPC's of the chapters is reduced to a minimum, leading to the impression that there isn't much human involvement beyond the strictly necessary.\n\nCall of Juarez is a useful case study and a compelling adventure, though it was a new breed of animal in its infancy. The game has to be appreciated for all that it's got, not the elements that sometimes don't feel satisfying or complete enough.","December 29, 2013","true","12.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I mean, you could probably fire up the game, go to the bathroom and take a dump and be back in time just to see the last centimeter of the loading bar filling up. The other negative is a technical issue, there's no option for vsync and it has to be forced on via d3doverdriver. I wasn't able to force it via AMD's CCC. Another negative would be the horse controls, not the best, but a good effort for a game from 2006.\n\nNow the positives; the story is a classic western tale. A young man comes home after months of searching for treasure and isn't exactly given a warm welcome. It only gets worse when he arrives at his farm to find his mother and step father dead. Billy is one of two protagonists, the other being Reverand Ray, the brother of Billy's step father. Switching between the two characters throughout the various episodes during the duration of the game sets up brilliant pacing with the story. As Ray hunts down Billy, believing he murdered his brother and in-law, you'll come across bandits and apache, various landscape of the massive western USA. From mountains and valleys, to the heat stricken Mexico. It's quite the adventure.\n\nWhat I really liked about the gameplay was the change in tone, Billy, being a slimmer character and less hardened, used stealth to sneak through levels, while Ray is the run and gun type while taking cover and strategizing.\n\nThat's about it.\n\n9/10","June 24, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One minute you will be having the time of your life and the next you'll be wishing it was just over.. Call of Juarez shines when you are in a shoot out with bandits. When you shoot a guy in the face and he does three backflips before he lands it's pretty funny. Also Billy gets to use a bow which goes into Slow Mo when right clicked. I never had as much fun with a video game then I did with that bow.\n\nSadly Call of Juarez lacks focus. It has a poor story, poor platforming, and poor direction. Most of the level are completely linear but at the end they throw in these big open world like areas with nothing at all in them. They also have a level that is based around platforming which like I said isn't all that great. CoJ also wants you to remember everything it teaches you because at some point in the game it will use that feature. I found myself stuck many times because a feature that quickly explained then never used again is randomly used again under a time limit(short ones at that).\n\nNone the less I say pick of CoJ for yourself and give it a go.

Well its pretty standart fps stuff. The guns in the game work like any other guns but as a cowboy you can duel wield two guns of youre own choice. The hit detection isnt the best in the game since many times you miss youre target completly and the stealth is broken beyond repair since enemies see you five miles away and have shoot you and dont miss a single shot. This game has a pretty good story and the graphics do look good when maxed out, but some of the charecter desings do look ugly.

The gun fights in this game are awesome with the physics of the AI as you shoot them they die the way you shoot them instead of just falling to the ground which is a very nice touch to the game. The slow-mo action is really awesome and gives you the edge you need to defeat your enemies. The things to know when playing this game is first and far most save alot, if you don't it will bring you back quite a bit because the auto-save feature sometimes has a big gap in between each auto-save. I loved the shootouts, the scenery of the valley's,canyons, and towns were you fight. The horseback riding was fun but a little stiff. The overall game and story were very well done . Multiplayer is still active but small. The whole game was a great story and adventure!","December 6, 2011","true","9.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/megamagition/recommended/3020/","megamagition","Frogger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/megamagition/","241 products in account","From the moment you start playing the game you can tell the studio was very ambitious and put a lot of heart into this western fps title, however, either due to their inexperience, budget constraints or some drunk binges between level and gameplay designers, they also created mechanics and levels that led to a lot of frustration.\n\nThroughout the campaign you play as either Billy or the Priest. They both play quite differently based on the mechanics and weapons they get in the levels. The Priest is where the meat of the game is. Fun, fast, frantic shoot em up action with slo mo, dual pistols, shotguns and rifles and the occasional stand off western style(which is pretty meh because its timed and thus you know exactly when the opponent is about to shoot).\n\nAs a counterpoint to that, to let the player take a breather, Billy gets the levels where he has to stealth and platform. This would be fine, except both elements are pretty flawed. Stealth is mostly fine and will provide little to no challenge as you can sneak by anyone as long as they're not looking directly at you, however platforming is really really bad. First of all, you get a whip which you can use to attach to trees. The hit detection is very poor and you'll often only be able to use it only specific branches or trunk of a tree, which sometimes turns it into a tedious guessing game. The whip is also a missed opportunity as you could have used it in clever ways in combat to reposition enemies and grab items, but ultimately its for swinging from trees. Then the very worst part of platforming is that an animation plays out every time you reach for a ledge and Billy makes a noise. Now, in the early levels thats fine, if a bit annoying. BUT. Some level designer decides to a create a whole mission around you climbing a mountain. Now imagine that you have to wait for an animation and sound to play out as you're climbing 30-40 ledges, sometimes up to 6 in a row.\n\nThe only redeemable quality about Billy is that he gets to use the bow, which is one of the best and most fun to use weapons in the game as you slow down time when you aim with it and its fun to take out enemies from a long range. Now, i mentioned that you had to a climb a mountain. That mission is part of series of bizzare quests involving a shaman thats easily the worst part of the game. You have to hunt 3 rabbits, which would be fine if they weren't REALLY REALLY SMALL, and some of the areas you're supposed to find them have grass twice as big as the rabbit. Even after the string of horrible shaman related quests, most of Billys quests after that resolve around platforming and solving puzzles all of a sudden, it takes a bizzare turn, as if the developers didn't know what to do with the character and the approach they were taking.\n\nBesides the mentioned shaman quests which have pretty poor level design, you will also be revisiting the same levels with both characters for the majority of the game(due to budget constraints im guessing), which also makes me think that the shaman quests were implemented just to extend the playing time.\n\nTalking more on the side the pros than cons, as I mentioned, it's really fun to play as the Priest Ray and the horse riding and horse combat in this fps is surprisingly really really good, which makes for exciting chase scenes. The game also creates an immersive atmoshphere and has a passable story. Billy isn't really likeable as a character, but Ray is definitely the highlight in the story, a flawed man on his own path to redemption, his voice acting really stands out as one of the best I've heard in a game ever, and stands tall above the passable voice acting of the other characters. It's grizzly and haunting.\n\nOverall, it's hard to recommend the game to everyone. I can see that playing as Billy could really turn some people off this game and the levels in which you play as him become more flawed as you go along, but the Ray segments are all fun shoot em up segments, and evne Billys levels have some exciting moments. It's definitely flawed, but if you can get past that it's a short, fun campaign.\n\n","September 20, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Gun dude is hunting the stealth dude for most of the game and this leads to some level reusing, but since the playstyles are so different it doesn't really bother me.\nShooting feels ok. There's a duel mode that I didn't really dig but it wasn't terrible.\nI generally don't like stealth but in this game it was quite fun. Except for one part you can snipe dudes with a bow instead of sneaking past them and I like that. And even for the pure sneaking part - this game is from the good days of quick save/load hotkeys so no problem. There are some timed things that I generally don't like, but quick save made it bearable.\nThe story is a western FPS game story, full of cliches. But that doesn't really bother me, until the end where I just had to laugh.\n(Spoilers for big bad/ending) So, the main bad is your father, who of course offers you to join him and rule together! You then fight him in a duel and kill him, then you go and save the girl and the now friendly gun dude. But hey, guess who shows up and shoots the gun dude? The bad guy! He had an armor! So you have a fist fight with him, and take him out. Then you hug the girl and live happily ever after...or you would if he didn't get up AGAIN behind you with a knife! But the gun dude is not TOTALLY dead so he takes him out, for the last time.\n\nGraphically the game is quite dated but I didn't mind.\n\n\n- The English voice acting is not good, in case of stealth dude I thought it was downright terrible.\n- The minimap is bad, but it only matters in a stupid mission in the middle of the game where you must hunt three rabbits for an old Indian dude.\n\n\n4.5 silver sloths\n","July 30, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Ray's special ability to use both guns in a slow mo was amusing, but usually wasn't practical. Found myself rarely using pistols if I had shotgun/rifle ammo. Most enemies are bullet sponges except when using a powerful gun.\n\nVery restricted to where you can explore and is sometimes difficult to navigate through levels as there is only a minimap indicator, usually with some red marker in some general direction, but you aren't told that there is actually a mountain you have to navigate around to get there.\n\nForced myself to play the game more than three instances with a total of 5 hours, but have not found it enjoyable as of yet. It was enjoyable for the first hour, but it got extremely repetitive fast.\n\nHowever I will compliment this games graphics and performance considering it is a 2006 game. Also has quite advanced mechanics such as overheating guns, dual wielding, special abilties and using boxes as stepladders.\n\nWas not particularly too interested in the story as the cutscenes were quite long and lost interest rather fast. I just wanted to clear levels after the second hour.\n\nVerdict: 6/10, not bad, but not great.

In practice, sometimes this is true (first person tower defense games are ok), but in the case of Call of Juarez, it simply leads to jumbled, subpar gameplay.\n\nIt's not even fair to say that Call of Juarez is a hybrid, it's basically two different games in the same shell tied together with a crappy story.  You could get much the same experience by playing a level of Thief, and then playing a level of Call of Duty.  Well, sort of, both of those games are much better designed than their respective segments in Call of Juarez.\n\nStarting with the sneaky bits, in Call of Juarez there doesn't appear to be all that much actual sneaking.  Apparently to the developers, jumping out of windows is the same as sneaking, because you do that an awful lot.  Even if you do manage to sneak past your enemies, the game will just have them find you anyway at the next set piece.  Also, a hallmark of sneaking games is the relatively open level design and expectation that you'll find your own way around.  Call of Juarez thinks you're too stupid to handle open levels, so the everything is just linear with a couple of crate puzzles thrown in.\n\nThe shooting bits are hardly any better.  Every shooter has to have its AWESOME SHOOTER MECHANIC THAT NO ONE HAS EVER DONE BEFORE to differentiate itself, and in the case of Call of Juarez, it's a quickdraw mechanic.  In practice, this is sort of the wild west version of bullet time from Max Payne except for the fact that your character can't hit the broad side of a barn.  In most fpses I can crack off head shot after head shot, but the controls are so soft in this game that I'm lucky if I manage to shoot in the general direction of my foes.\n\nThere's not to say there aren't some cool things about this game.  For one, you play as a preacher for the shooty bits, and there's nothing cooler than a preacher with guns.","January 11, 2014","false","1.3"," 4 of 24 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","24","0","0"

The shooting mechanics aren't very good though, despite the fun slow motion gun draw you can sometimes do. The game is actually very decent, but I'll give it a slight no recommendation based on that while it's kind of intriguing with its setting and story, the gameplay is boring and sometimes frustrating with its checkpoint system and hefty loading times for a such an old game. Graphics aren't very spectacular either of course because of the age of this game. The multiplayer part of this game isn't very good, though surprisingly active.\n\nIf you can stomach with the flaws of this game and are willing to play the lenghty singleplayer, it's a quite nice western game after all. But overall, I think most gamers wouldn't finish this game. Personally I had decent fun with it even I decided not to finish it. Despite liking some of the aspects this game offers, I'll give it a borderline no recommandation.","December 18, 2013","false","3.2"," 3 of 22 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","3","22","0","0"

Voice acting, art style, story, etc. Switching between characters on both sides of the fence also made for interesting gamplay styles and narrative.\n\nHowever, some of the gameplay mechanics are very flawed. Random difficulty spikes and changes in mechanics like fist fighting weren't really fun. There are some stretches of the game where you have to go a long time without heath pickups, and whether you take damage or not is dependent on a random dice roll of whether or not enemies hit your armor or head.\n\nThe maps are generally linear but whenever new path ways open up, it's not always evident where you are supposed to backtrack to find a new path. This leads to a lot of wandering around, and if you are in a sequence where you have a time limit, finding out where you need to go may lead to failure. There are also stuck in geometry problems if you wander off the the path.\n\nIt was probably great at the time it was new but it  seems like the game didn't age very well by today's standards. By the end it felt like a boring (but very difficult) slog.\n\nI'm still glad I got to get closure on this story, but if you are interested in a western themed shooter, play the sequel Bound in Blood first, and then decide whether you want to play this one to get the full story. The sequel is actually a prequel story-wise, so you don't really lose anything by playing them out of order, in my opinion. Playing this one really made me appreciate the sequel. The devs learned many lessons and improved upon pretty much every gameplay aspect.","December 13, 2014","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "black Friday" sale resulted in all of the Juarez games being 50% off, so I took the plunge.  Unfortunately, it is really hard to go back to the beginning on some of these franchises, as the early ones seem so primitive by comparison.  Maybe this game was great years ago when it came out, but I m finding it a little-- well, primitive.  With the graphics this is to be expected.  Howver, the user controls have apparently also evolved quite a bit since the original game.  I didn't expect this much difference, as many games have pretty similar controls from the beginning-- like the COD series.  The user controls in the original  COJ are pretty different from Gunslinger, especially the focus and dueling.  I'm still trying to figure it all out.  I realize the later games built on these early techniques, but again-- very differentn, and hard to go back.\n\nStill, if you get it on sale, and don't mind a nostalgic game experience, you may enjoy the original Call of Juarez.  If you already played Gunslinger, Just don't expect too much.","November 28, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cross","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028390148/","81 products in account","Up to now I've only played two games in Call of Juarez series: this one and Call of Juarez the Cartel. I'll be honest and I know this is going to be a controversial statement: at first, I enjoyed the Cartel much more than this one. Idk, this one just seemed a little too old school and somewhat archaic for me to get into it. On top of that, the action I experienced (the first two stages) wasn't really all that engaging, unlike the Cartel where (despite that game's lacking polish) I was engaged from the very first level due to the fast-paced combat. Having finished The Cartel, I decided to give this game a second chance and... wow.  How wrong I was to put this one down so quickly. I got past the second level and carried on through the game, marvelling at how much fun it is and how solid it is in execution.\n\nWhile Call of Juarez the Cartel features nothing more than endless firefights with mindless explosive combat and a terrible story filled with unlikeable characters (kinda like a playable Michael Bay movie), this one features a really engaging storyline along with two types of gameplay: stealth and gunfighting. You play as two characters: Reverend Ray and Billy. Billy's the one you start out with and he's all about the stealth. Unfortunately, it's not that good a first impression. Billy's gameplay is typically slower and less exciting than Ray's, focusing first person platforming and stealth. The mechanics  for his gameplay take a little training to get used to, but once you do, it's a lot of fun to play. Still, it's nowhere near as fun as Ray's segments, which are straight up "kill-everyone-in-sight" actioners that leave you breathless by the end. Ray's stages aren't exactly as fast-paced and explosive as the gunfights featured in The Cartel, but that in no way means they're any less good. In fact, they're prpbably better due to one reason: a little something I like to call "Gun-Punch". The shooting in this game, despite featuring mediocre animations for both shooting and reloading, feels very punchy and satisfying. Whenever you shoot an enemy, it feels like the bullets are really punching through the enemy's body and leaving him in pieces (not literally, there's no gore here).\n\nThe controls, while a little outdated, get the job done and eventually start feeling natural. The graphics are outdated as well, but that doesn't mean they're exactly unattractive. The environments and gun textures are both gorgeous for their time. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the character models (which lack detail) or the aniamtions for pretty much everything from jumping, to shooting and reloading your guns. Fortunately, these problems don't detract from the game's enjoyment factor or playability. WHat might detract from the playability though is that the game has some slightly poor optimization. I have a mid-range laptop with an nvidia gt640 card and, while I can run the game on max settings, it sometimes drops from 60 fps all the way into the low 30's. Keep in mind I can play games like far cry 3 at very high settins with an average framerate of 60-40 fps so a framerate like this on a game this dated-looking isn't really my system's fault. Still, even in the low 30's the game feels smooth enough so it's not really a problem. To sum up:\n\nPros:\nViscerally satisfying, punchy combat (not including some flat-feeling hand to hand combat sections).\nSome gorgeous environments and good-looking weapons.\nEngaging story driven by two very likeable and interesting characters.\nStealth segments are capable of providing a good sense of tension.\nAbsolutely nails that Wild West atmosphere.\nAtmospheric soundtrack.\n\nCons:\nUgly character models and animations.\nStealth segments take a little getting used to.\nControls are very different from modern first person shooters and might trouble some players.\nLacking optimization in the framerate department.\n\nBottom line: For such a dated game, Call of Juarez is a ton of fun packing one of the most interesting storylines I've ever come across. The flaws are a little annoying at times, but they certainly don't break the game. If you consider yourself a fan of the Wild West and are jonesing for solid shooter set in that scenario, don't hesitate to pick this one up. For 10 bucks, it's a steal.","February 15, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are a little dated by today's standards and I couldn't get DX10 to work, but the story makes it worth it. You play two characters and switch between their stories throughout the game. As the priest, you usually play straightforward shooting levels. As the runaway, you usually play more stealth-oriented levels (often needing to platform or cross gaps using your rope somewhat like Metroid's Grapple Beam). The combat system involves time slowdowns to make things easier to deal with. It's a little awkward at first with the priest (because you have to aim two reticles at once) but I was able to get used to it and use it well.

Billy was the "trouble maker" and everyone in the town hated his guts. the only one who liked you in the home town was your ma, and a girl at the brothel named Suzy. after everyone giving Billy the hardest of time, he ran away to look for the Gold of Juarez. some time later he returns empty handed, and the town is still on his neck.\n\nim gonna skip the rest for now to get onto the gameplay, you get 2 pistol sloths, this is pretty cool as you can dual wield identical guns or diffrent guns. some might be rusty and break after a few barrels, some might be ready to break. you get a sloth for ranged and shotgun on the share. its a small variety, but enough to get you trough thte game without losing intrest. there are more sloths, but they are specific for each char.\n\nwith that said, you play between 2 characters: Billy and Ray. Ray being the brother of you stepdad, being a priest. while Billy is the acrobat, Ray is heavy and have a chance of dodging bullets thanks to his chainmail armor. but this takes away his ability to climb. Ray can use dynamite whenever he finds it and got a bible he will always carry around. Billy on the other hand.. personally i never found dynamite as billy.. but he gets to use a bow which is the most usefull weapon you get. there are plenty of ammo, and i always had above 50 bullets, but when aiming with the bow, you enter slowmo, making it easy to hit moving targets, but you gotta aim infront of the run motion, or else you'll just hit the air behind him.\n\nanother good thing about controlling billy is the stealth mechanics, it doesnt work too good on its own, but during stealth chapters, its pretty fun. you get prectiaclly invisible in bushes and the AI dont know you'r whereabouts unless they've seen you hide.\n\nhere is the downside, tought.. sometimes during cutscene, if you see the screen sorta shake, get ready to load back, cause you'll either fall trough the map, or levitate up, just to fall to your death. its a problem i had a few times, mostly as Ray, but just stand on solid ground before entering the cutscene and try from diffrent angles and you'll bne fine.\n\nanother bad thing that is more major to the game is the Whip mechanic. as billy, you get the whip that will help you around, over clifs, scaling mountains and some other places.. but its so inacurate that it was a pain to use instead of fun. the whip is so short that its barely usefull, and you gotta stand on the edge of the cliff to use it, risking falling down. and you can even use it on the thinest of branch.. it is usefull as a melee tough, as you might not wanna waste bullets on the wildlife or close up enemies.\n\naiming from a distance with the guns need some work, and you're practically a sitting duck if you try. unless you got a rifle. you collect health from bottle of alcohol(?) and depending on the difficulity you choose, it gives a fair amount of health.. i usually play on the hardest difficulity to get the challange and put the game to the challange, but i barely could stand the 2nd chapter, because the aiming and the cutscene went against me. it got too frustrating, so i finishd the game on easy. its hard enought to fight against the game mechanics of the first stages. but it either smoothes out the futher you play, or you simply get used to it\n\nthere is a dual system that is alil funny and alil wierd. when you are challanged, you push your mouse up to draw your gun. you dodge bullets in slowmo while aiming for the kill.. nothing to say about it. its fun and difficult, but not because of the game mechanics, its because you gotta do serval things at the same time. aim for a lethal shot on the enemy, watch out for bullets, dodge bullets. even if it is slowmo, bullets travels fast, so you gotta keep up.\n\ni give alot of these verdicts, and i cant really tell why, but i enjoyd the game enough to give it a 7/10. its clunky and got some stupid things, yeah, sure. but that didnt really take away from the whole experience. Call of Juarez is a game serie i could get addicted to if it wasnt for the lack of games and replayability. atleast this is a game you might just wanna play trough once or twice. the others however... i will cover that on those games ;P","December 30, 2014","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3526991/recommended/3020/","3526991","Monsieur Robert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3526991/","66 products in account","All in all, Call of Juarez is a great game that blends elements of old and new FPS together in an intriguing way. Combined with an awesome story and voice-acting worthy of any good western film or novel, the game is more than worth the cost. It takes a little getting used to but if you keep at it, you won't be disappointed.\nThe game regularly shifts between two characters, which is very cool from a story perspective, as you see how two people sharing the same story can have very different perspectives. However, the two characters are mechanically different, which can be a pain as one gets used to the play style of one, only to be thrown back into the other guy and having to adjust abruptly.\nBilly plays fast and light, and integrates some modern ideas of platforming such as grabbing ledges and using a whip to swing across gaps or climb up to higher places. The whip requires precise placement to work correctly and the timing of jumps and swings can be tricky to learn, but it beats having to stack boxes to get over a two-foot fence any day. Save often though!\nReverend Ray is a very different play. He can only do classic hop-style platforming, which means even the simplest fence can require piling of crates to surmount, a distracting thing to do in the middle of a wild shoot-out.  However, he is a great gun handler and even wears a breastplate that blocks a lot of otherwise painful shots. However, this is essential as Ray is not very fast and fighting from cover is not the easiest thing to do. However, there are few things more evocative than to walk through a town full of bad guys, shooting them down while listening to some of the best voice-acting I've ever heard in a game. Fear the wrath of Ray!\nShooting is very much a mix of old and new. The basic shooting is very old-school with lightning reloads, no ironsights, and most guns need multiple hits to kill even basic baddies. But there are more sophisticated shooting modes such as dueling mode and quick-shooting which wouldn't be at all out of place in the latest games today.\nOne thing that must be addressed because some gamers really get hung up about these things: there is culturally-insensitive content in this game including casual racism, sexual violence, and religious extremism. This is a spaghetti western in game form, not a documentary trying to encapsulate the truth about people in the Old West. Movie stereotypes and cliches are in full force here. Mexicans are portrayed as brutish and dishonest; Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, are intolerant and cruel hypocrites; and aboriginal Americans are either wizened animists or blood-thirsty savages. There is also plenty of bad language, much of it sexually explicit. This game is not remotely as extreme as many, but it earns its M-rating nonetheless, so parents be advised.\n\nAll that said, enjoy this first of a great franchise, one of the best western FPS ever made, and a delight.\n","January 17, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It certainly doesn't feel like a modern shooter. And there are some parts in the game, where the desgin feels kind of rough by todays standards. But if you ask me, that's totally okay. I actually like it, how some parts aren't completely polished. It's certainly different from modern shooter single player games, which offer a very dense and fine-tuned action experience. That's not the case here. The design is more similar to some classic shooters like Quake, the old shadow warrior, duke nukem or jedi knight.\n\nSo if you're okay with playing a shooter that's kinda oldschool sometimes, which doesn't take too long to play through, then go for it. You won't regret it, because for what it is, it's actually great.\n\nInterestingly enough, the storytelling and voiceacting is done in a way that puts many modern games to shame, which is definitely worth mentioning too.","August 30, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It certainly doesn't feel like a modern shooter. And there are some parts in the game, where the desgin feels kind of rough by todays standards. But if you ask me, that's totally okay. I actually like it, how some parts aren't completely polished. It's certainly different from modern shooter single player games, which offer a very dense and fine-tuned action experience. That's not the case here. The design is more similar to some classic shooters like Quake, the old shadow warrior, duke nukem or jedi knight.\n\nSo if you're okay with playing a shooter that's kinda oldschool sometimes, which doesn't take too long to play through, then go for it. You won't regret it, because for what it is, it's actually great.\n\nInterestingly enough, the storytelling and voiceacting is done in a way that puts many modern games to shame, which is definitely worth mentioning too.","August 30, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I therefore, loved this game.\n\nThere were a few inconviniences, like how crappy the death animations were, how much I hated Billy's puzzles and gymnastics levels and the question that how the hell was a wimp like Billy Candle so popular with the ladies?\n\nThe shooting was pretty much great and man was the Reverend Ray badass. I loved the shooting ♥♥♥♥ out of him. "And there was sent fire down upon thee..." and then Juarez pours fire on him in the pit xD\n\nThe horseriding controls were quite crap. horses were impossible to control well and it was nigh impossible (get it? horses, nigh?) to fight from horseback, but at least it wasn't necessary except in that one level!\n\nOverall great game, fun as fuzz, can't wait to play the rest of the series!","September 17, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The series is about half and half in my opinion. Bound in Blood and Gunslinger are both great entries in the series. This one is the original and all I have to say is that it's outdated and unremarkable. It runs like crap on high end PCs in DirectX 10 mode and it feels janky at 60 FPS. The bullet time is awkward (you have to holster your guns first and then whip them right back out while trying to shoot with two auto piloted crosshairs) and the stealth is just god awful. The premise is cool, where you play two characters playing a game of Cat and Mouse with each other but that's all I have to say that's positive. Many might say this harkens back to the older, more open first person shooters. While this may be true, it still doesn't change the fact the game gives you very broad objectives with very little hints as to what you actually need to do to complete these objectives and not die four times doing a simple task such as "Jump out the window of a house". My bullets didn't feel like they made any impact and the game is strewn with bad level design. Refund please.","August 9, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is very fun, and very simple. Headshotws are one kills which is a great time saver at time and help. I did find shoot offs pretty hard to enjoy as you can't actually see your hand or gun, you just need to click like mad to get the aim out.\n\nHelp on the glitch:\nAs for them who deal with the glitch (it will happen even if you lower your res) just before coming out of the tunnels, following the train tracks, click quick save (f5) and walk along side the left wall, this will avoid a black screen after the cutscene. You will be on the ground for a bit, but just keep walking straight.\n\nAnyway, the game is worth it, but i would only buy it on sale.

Since then I have tried several good western games such as gun, which is also good, but not with the game play of Outlaws - now there is. Call of Juarez is like a modernised version of Outlaws and it is very enjoyable. Have seen some complaints about the fast draws, but I am a PC person and use a mouse and keyboard, so no problems and great fun. I am so happy to have found this gem and have played it all the way through. I have an i3 processor and GTX 750 graphics card  and could run everything at max settings, which meant fairly good graphics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hydragod/recommended/3020/","hydragod","Junior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hydragod/","206 products in account","Call of Juarez, formerly known as The Lawman is an western first-person shooter developed by Techland and published by Ubisoft in 2006-2007.\n\nIn Call of Juarez you play two sides of the coin, on one side you play as Billy Candle and on the other as Reverend Ray. Billy Candle is an half-white, half-Mexican in search for the legendary lost gold of Juarez, a treasure hidden somewhere inside this city. When Billy is not capable of finding this treasure, he decides to go home to pay a visit to his mother and stepfather at the farm. On arrival, Billy is confronted with the death of his parents, murdered. The other character, Reverend Ray is Billy's step uncle and preacher. Ray is an reformed revolver hero who is dedicated to spreading the tales of The Lord, but when he hears about the commotion at the farm of his brother, he is going to pay a visit as well and sees Billy being panicked and Billy runs away from the dead bodies. Ray thinks Billy is responsible and promises Revenge and start hunting down Billy as long as he can.\n\nDuring the storyline, the game switches from character now and then. The game knows several features such as akimbo (wearing double weapons), sneaking, climbing by rope, revolver duels and bullet-time where you have to time and mark your shots at your enemies in order to finish them off quickly in the end. You also have to deal with several types of enemies like bandits, Apache Indians, Mexicans and several landlords.\n\nI really like this game because of the western atmosphere, the smooth switch between characters that initiate a story cliffhanger at the end of each chapter, the wild gunpowder action, voice acting, traveling by foot or horse and the vast landscapes from the rocky mountains, lurid towns and barren tundras filled with various wild animals.\n\nI highly recommend this game to people who like western first-person shooters with a very good storyline and large areas, certainly when the game is on sale!","May 21","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unqlfife/recommended/3020/","unqlfife","rad1c","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unqlfife/","270 products in account","I wanted to love this game as I like spaghetti western much. Voice acting is great, the story is together and looks fun (at least until the point where I get), and I always found it entertaining to play with multiple protagonists - and this game delivers that.\n\nSadly, however, I have to thumb down the game as it was coded so sloppy it renders the game pretty much unplayable fairly quickly (it was 2.1 hrs for me).\nFirst off, the bugs. I fell off the render engine a few times, boxes/doors/etc sometimes start "shaking" when/after used, one either automatically picks up health restore item or not, no indication on "weapon health", it just starts flashing after a while and gets destroyed in a few shots (magically, it was just the left hand gun for me, never the right), and so on.\n\n\nAdding to that, the whole gaming experience is just not very good. What annoys me the most are two things:\n\n1) The game stinks of being HEAVILY scripted. You literally feel triggering not-very-smart and very repetitive events by passing through particular points on map (after 3-4 times you'll learn when and where will it happen next).\nSo basically, instead of being catched by the story and thrill of western-fights, the whole gaming experience feels like "trigger event, kill all, move forward, trigger event, kill all, move forward", and on and on and on.\nSadly, the same applies to AI. Both movement and firing.\n\n2) Enemies are popping in as if they were camoed elite commando ninjas. Everyone dressed to the background and hide in shadows, while the player cannot take cover, or kite the enemy and sneak attack, or anything.\nSo (see point #1), you step out to an open area, enemies spawn all around, no cover, nothing, and they start firing at you. Until they don't shoot, most of the time they are close to invisible thanks to their placement.\n\n\nSo if you want to support the devs, buy the game. Otherwise go for Call of Juarez: Gunslinger. The studio developed a lot, learned from their mistakes and made a HILARIOUS game.
