Gamepads do work, however you have to figure out what does what in game- cause again, the game only displays KB+M UI and tips during tutorial and in game.\n\n- Sloppy formatting: When reading the expanded info about each class, nearly every description either continues beyond its intended bounding box or is just abruptly cut off mid-sentence. Same with Skill info boxes- cut offs and typos.\n\n--- There's zero player base, max I've seen online at any point since purchasing is 7. The funny part with this is the game locks you from playing anything but 1 vs 1 until you're a certain Level- So I'm not even able to Que into those people games. Though I doubt they're public to begin with, most likely customs.\n\nAlso- the enemy AI is non-existent beyond run forward and shoot, then retreat once out numbered. It's honestly the most barebones it could ever be, and creates zero incentive to play bot matches.\n\n\nPros:\n\n+++ Very nice art style, animations and controls are good as well- though your characters do feel a bit on the sluggish side, likely and intended design due to the incredibly small map sizes.\n\n+ It's cheap, however that’s a double sided comment- since it's essentially unplayable/un-enjoyable. I'm debating a refund.\n\nSummary- This thing wasn't done cooking and was released pre-maturely, also- I personally had never heard of Awesomenauts before purchasing this, however it's clear to see their obvious similarities and that this one was simply eclipsed by it.","March 24","false","0.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
