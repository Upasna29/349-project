This is my opinion of the game as of this very early stage.\n\nPro:\n\nNo sub fees\nFleets of ships on one account.\n\nCons:\n\nPoorly balanced.\nHorrible sound / depth of music\nHorrible UI.\nNearly impossible to actually play the game and participate in chat.\n\n\nThe closest existing game is Eve Online.  With that said, you figure that they would have gotten a 3 month sub to Eve and discovered what works and, more importantly, what doesn't work in a space MMO.  Over a decade of live and learn in Eve Online, and they have foolishly ignored those lessons and are repeating the EXACT SAME problems that CCP is trying like hell to work their way out of right now.\n\nThe music is VERY repetitive and the SFX are Casio...  I shut both of them off in the first 5 hours just to save my sanity.\n\nThere are numerous areas where the mechanics do nothing to drive the game.    There seems to be lots of grind just for the sake of grinding.\n\nThe UI does nothing to improve the sense of community in the game.  Which is bad, because the community is the only content the game currently has other than mining or shooting NPCs.\n\nI have 70+ hours in it and I could (barely) fly the middle tier of ships.  Bear in mind that it would be horribly slow, but I could take a cruiser somewhere.\n\nI see potential, but there is a lot of work to be done before that is realized.  I'm bored already, which means that I'll probably go back to another game in the library.  This will removed a bit of content from the game.  I have serious doubts about the long term viability of this game unless they make some quick and effective improvements in the UI, leveling / balance mechanics and other items.\n\nThe Dev team should sit down and do a marathon session of Extra Credits and then take a look at what they have crafted.\n\nI'd love to love Gates of Horizon, but it just isn't there.  (Sadly)\n\nEdit:  1/3/2015 2110hrs.  Yep.  Logged in and looked at the fleet of ships and just couldn't bring myself  undock and grind mining  so I could grind refining or grind NPCs...\n\nGoH uses type dependant XP.  So, you earn XP of a certain type by doing that activity.  Trading stuff gets you trading XP.  Making items gets you crafting XP.  Resource gatherng and refining get you resource XP.  COmbat gets you warfare XP.\n\nThere is one (1) skill to to spend trading XP on.  Three to spend Resource XP on.  Like 5 to spend crafting XP on and a whopping 7 or 8 to spend combat XP on.\n\nIn order to fly a cruiser, the mechanics of the game dictatat that I have Piloting LVL 10.  Which means I would have to grind another ~80k of skill points that I can only gain in combat missions and only at 100 ponts at a time.  Bear in mind that the fleet commands can go wonky, and if that happens your ship(s) die.  Quickly.  Since combat grinding doesn't net any considerable amount of money, if a ship dies, you have to go mining to earn the $ to buy another combat hull.\n\nTo add to the fustration, the piloting aspect of the game mechanics in mining are the EXACT same as the piloting mechanics of combat in the game.  Orbit a rock and shoot mining lasers at it until it pops / the cargo holds are full or orbit a NPC and shoot combat lasers at it until it pops / you blow up.  The former nets you NO improvement to your piloting skill.  The latter nets you MINIMAL improvement to your combat skills, of which the piloting skill is one of like 8 skills that require combat XP points.\n\nEnd result for today after logging into GoH.  I just can't do it tonight.  I'd rather clean up gecko crap than grind more rocks or slowly warp between combat grinds.\n\nSo, for tonight at least, gecko $h!t wins over GoH...  I can't wait for an update.","January 2, 2015","false","76.5"," 169 of 214 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","169","214","4","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tvayumat/recommended/334290/","Tvayumat","Tvayumat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tvayumat/","296 products in account","I've been playing GoH for the last day or so, and thought I'd compile my thoughts for anyone considering dropping a tenner on this little game.\n\nLet's start with the cons, I always want to know the bad thing about a game first so they don't surprise me.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Graphics: Not a lot to say here. The graphics are VERY simplistic. The nature of the game and the ease of projecting starfields sort of makes up for this. Personally, I don't find it a bother, but it's worth noting.\n\n-GUI: The GUI has some definite weaknesses. For instance, the chatbox is tiny, only shows a few messages at a time, and automatically fades out. This renders meaningful communication difficult at best. If I had one priority target for the developer, it would be the chatbox and community interaction UI. NOTE: there IS a full-screen chat option that works well but... it's full screen. Tough to play AND chat.\n\n-Sound effects: This one stood out to me. The music is all pretty good, but then I fired a laser at someone and thought I had just cruised into a disco. PEW PEW PEW go the beams in one of the cheapest sci-fi sound effects I've heard in some time. Oh well, turn the SFX volume down until they get updated. Minor problem.\n\n-Missions: There aren't really any that I've found. The game expects you to head off into space and start making your way with comparatively little direction. While I enjoy the "make your own story" approach to gameplay, a LITTLE bit of handholding as far as where to get blueprints, how to explore, where to look for new ships would have been nice.\n\n-Beginning: In the beginning you have one ship and one agent. The game is fairly boring as you let him auto-combat or auto-mine everything, watching him orbit. Once you unlock a second agent/ship, the game starts to open up more, but the first hour or so is definitely underwhelming.\n\n-Explanation: How does giving ships orders work? Why is the "patrol" option greyed out? Why can't I order a ship  to auto harvest without micromanaging? All of these are answers new players could use.\n\nWhew... still with me? It's time to talk about the good stuff:\n\n-Concept: I LOVE the concept of this game. Rather that playing a single pilot who flies around, you are a "corporation". You hire agents, select their abilities, send them on missions, level them up, change their loadouts, etc. It plays more like an RTS than any sort of simulator, so don't expect careful maneuvering.\n\n-Depth of skill trees: There are enough skills with tangible benefits that leveling up your agents becomes quite involved. You want to plan which agent will specialize where and make sure he is getting the right sort of experience. Agents can both pilot ships and man guns or other modules on board ships piloted by other agents so... do you want three light ships, or one big ship with a gunner and a shield operator? This is where the game really shows its potential.\n\n-Community Quality: The chat may not be the best, but those pilots out there that ARE chatting are extremely helpful if you just ask. Many of the game's shortcomings as far as GUI and explanation have been answered for me almost immediately using in-system chat.\n\n-Potential: I know, saying "It COULD be so much!" sounds like wishful thinking, and maybe it is, but this game has IMMENSE potential if you look at it as a sort of "starter version".\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nAt $10, Gates of Horizon is worth every single penny.\n\nIt's not without it's flaws, but virtually all of those are easily fixed, and the fundamental core of the game works... if not beautifully, at least compellingly.\n\nToday I'm bouncing back and forth between GoH and Elite:Dangerous to get both my command AND my pilot fix.","January 3, 2015","true","25.0"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","43","54","0","0"

Similar to Eve Online.\n\nThe difference is that here, you're not only a pilot, you're a corporation. Of course you start with only one agents, but you can reach a maximum of 20, with the possibility to command a fleet of seven ships at the same time. The experience is totally sandbox, your objective is only to expand and gather power. Hunt pirates, mine ores, trade, explore, buy new ships, improve the equipments, find new agents, choose role and skills of your agent, you can do whatever you want.\n\ni'd like to play some more hours before writing a complete review, i'll update it when ready.\n\nEdit: I forgot.

There's some bugs here and there I've heard people talk about and one happened to me where I've been stuck but they'll get you out of it just write to the developers and wait a few hours if even that. It'l get better. 9.4/10 for me. And like someone in the game I saw said, this game isn't exactly for instant-gratification people. It's for people with strategy, focus, and people who like to chill and explore and work on their ship and make connections with people and go from there to get into some real good epic action. Sorry if this wasn't the most eloquent review but I think it's worth throwing in there. You play it yourself or research it more if you want to get better idea of what it's about.\n\n// Update 8/30/2015, 9 months later after writing this review //\n\nI've taken a few breaks from this game here and there, but always come back to it and get immersed again. It's the best spent $10 on a game I've ever spent.\nIn-game my corp name is Knight Of Zero.\n\nWe need more players but it's not a complete desert, and there are events and things to do. There's a consistent dozen or so of us at minimum every week all year so far. I mostly play on the .exe client and not through steam, so my real hours played is way higher than this. Probably in the thousands of hours.

They are improving the game month by month (and even more often) and they are ready to personally respond to players problems or requests.\n\nI really enjoy the gameplay and the micromanaging and the complexity of the strategies that can be implemented. You can choose a lot of details and completely customize each agent and spaceship (with an incredibly large skills tree and a huge amount of spaceship components sets).\n\nAt the end, it is definitely a more complex game than it seems at the first peak.

This does not mean that the game is hard to play, but that it is very diverse. You can play multiple roles, and since you are managing a whole corporation with many agents, you don’t have to limit yourself to just one.\n\nYou automatically gain experience in those areas you play. If you mine, you get experiences in mining, if you craft you get experiences in crafting and if you fight you get experiences for fighting…\nThis system of leveling, combined with playing multiple agents at the same time, gives you the opportunity to switch between different types of gameplay.\n\nThe game is still heavily developed, in an agile type of process. All basic features have already been implemented and are of good software quality. New releases with new features are released several times a month! The support is very active, personally responding within hours, and really trying to help you with your individual problem and not putting you off with a prepared statement. Often you will find developers in the common chat channel, ready for discussions with you.\n\nSo to sum it up, for a small amount of money you get a very good game, which might not be 100% feature complete, but is constantly improved and ready to play.","January 16, 2015","true","187.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Each faction only offers two ships for each class, but some of the ships do have some cool equipment slots and you can 'mount' agents to a equipment module so it's recommended to look at the Community Hub for a player guide so you can specialize your agents' attributes for fighting, trading, crafting or mining.\n\nI think I have seen up to 20 active players at a time, but players don't really interact with each other much. One of the pitfalls of this game is that there's not much to do outside of grinding levels and experience for new agents. Players can join groups known as 'holdings' and it's basically a guild system where you can own starbases and customize them. I think you can even get ore from planets in your zone of control. But there's not really that much to do with other players so it's kind of a singleplayer experience...\n\nThe crafting isn't really deep enough to make you want to do it, though it is more effective to craft your items than it is to buy them.\n\nGame might get better, but you could easily squeeze 100 hours or more out of this game so it's worth ten bucks even if it never recieves any other updates.

Playing it with a few friends. It would be frustrating without friends to play with or someone to help you rebuild equipment when you die as you learn how much firepower and defensive recovery you need to kill certain enemies and lose ships in the process through trial and error. Some people seem pretty friendly and helpful in the chat. I enjoy automining. It lets me be productive, gain experience, and hoard ore while I'm doing something else or am offline and away from keyboard completely. Can't wait until they implement autohunting. I just wish there were more players to interact with.\n\nAh so about the game. Basically it's an RPG real time strategy game.\nYou are the Corporation. You start at level 1 leadership. Leadership level is your 'main level'.\nYou then get 1 agent from the start and you go and do tasks that accumulate experience. There are 4 skill trees of experience.\n\nCrafting- Trading- Resource- and Warfare.\nDoing crafting tasks gets you craft exp which I think it's about 10% of it goes towards Leadership exp, and then you use your crafting exp to level up the crafting skills you want. Same goes for trading tasks, mining and refining tasks, and combat tasks. All of them raise towards Leadership exp but at a small fraction. Get enough exp for a leadership level up and then you can hire another agent. This means now you can fly 2 ships! You'll hit this point like 5-20mins within starting the game if you follow the tutorial guidelines. You can 'fleet' them together so that they attack the same target and stick together.\n\nWhat's really unique and cool about this game is exactly that, the fleets and multiple ship ownership.\nFleets are also 'parties' as you know from other MMO RPGs. Your ships share experience in a fleet. The ships with the most Skill Points from Agents [and I think the more advanced ones hold weighter exp-extract power too than say an equal amount of SP of standard skills] pull in the most experience and then splits that amongst the agents on that ship even further.\n\nYou can form a guild, in this game it's called a Holding. I'm in one called The Death Penalty with a few of my friends.\nWe're training up quite nicely. The leader can command 2 battleships. So far I can only command a Cruiser and 2 scouts.\nAnd while there are some very nice people, there are some smug bullies too that pretend to be your friend or friendly.\nTry not to let them drive you off the game. I hear a few groups like that have driven off a hundred plus new and intermediate players. There are a lot of constructive things you can do for leveling up and bettering your economy and skills while not entering into Red space where you can be hunted down.\n\n7.8/10, would be higher rating if there were like a minimum of 10x more systems and players. There's only like 60 systems and like 30 active players per week?\nI'm still new but my couple friends who have played about 2 months now say it's been like this since they've started.\nI don't know what gives, more players get in here lol.\n:-)","May 29, 2015","true","33.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

HAHAHAHA ive seen better drop rates in a TEXT BASED mmo, the fact that npc ships drop ZERO $$ is just stupid, yeah theyve added a so called "Alien Encounter" but guess what, if you dont have a end game ship your boned...on everything, its like this game is only geared  for end game players only or people who spend REAL $$$ for in game $$$, there is ZERO content for new players in this game, a fact ive pointed out several times in chat, only to be told they'll get around to it... WTF?!?!?!  seriously?? yeah i know this games still fairly new but come on! Even WOW had STARTING CONTENT in its beta!!!! EVERY MMO has some sort of starting content!! DEVS PLEASE step it up! stop thinking only of the kickstart backers (if you had one) and think of the NEW PLAYERS! I like the idea of a free to play EvE style game but come on, we all know you can step up your game and start adding some REAL In-game content, add missions,better loot drop, maybe shields,armor,$ insted of just ore, now yes theres prob some of this in the End Game/high level encounters but theres NONE for new players.\n\n\nHow is it possible to invest so many hours into testings, graphics, design and completely forget about gameplay? Multiplayer is absolutely dead and I can tell you why: game become boring after playing just few hours. Beauteful background, smooth animations and.. there is nothing to do. Yes, you do quests, you get levels and money, but it feels pointless.\nAs for guilds/corps? yeah theres a few but theres ZERO any reason to really be in one unles they give you stuff, theres ZERO Corp/guild PVP content all the corps ive seen all just mine and kill npcs.\n\nBasiclly unless you buy in game $ for real $, know the Devs and are best friends (which is how it  seems every high level player is) or are friends with the highe level players, your basically boned. if you want to solo this ISNT the game for you, as i said ive been playing this awhile and soloing is HELL, it will take you MONTHS if not YEARS to get anything good if you solo.\n\nmy rating 4 (just for the good controlls and the graphics) out of 10\n\npros-\n-Good Graphics that any laptop or PC can run\n-Easy to use interface\n-Friendly Community\n\nCons-\n-No in game content (quest/missions)\n-low loot drops\n-you have kill npcs or mine, transport the ore to a station that will actually buy or refine it and find a place to sell that OR craft just to get $\n-stupidly expinsive ships/gear that far outweight the effort it takes to get $\n-All current encounters are for High level/End Game players\n-Its a MASSIVE grind/effort for VERY LITTLE reword\n\n\nAI is too primitive, Ship's design.. kek.. I have no idea what guys were thinking, best trading/mining ship hes such an ugly weapon placement, I wish designer to have a car with 5 wheels.. one at place of driver.

IT'S AN EARLY ACCESS GAME!\nDon't be fooled - this game is in ALPHA. Means early development phase with lots of features missing and lots of bugs.\n\nAt first glance it looks very attractive. It looks simple enough. First achievements are rewarding and pretty fast to get. It only becomes obvious that this game is shallow and empty when you try to delve deeper. Suddenly you realize that you can't use better ships and components even if you can afford them. You can't craft anything decent yourself without putting couple of weeks effort into grind.\n\nAnd most of the time you will spend grinding. Grind, grind, grind. You'll waste huge amounts of time developing skills of your agents only to relize that you've done it wrong. Every new agent will become a pain in the bottom instead of a reward.\n\nUser interface is awful. It makes you feel like a cripple when trying to manage more than one agent. Combat control interface is so limited you can't even designate roles for ships in your fleet. Switching between your ships is very slow and requires several clicks.\n\nPvP is non-existant. Everyone can escape a battle with a double-click. The only chance is jumping in on a single ship which is just out of a gate and it will take some time for him to accelerate or ganking AFKs.\n\nThe gap between high level players and low level players is tremendous. And there is no any migration mechanism for high levels. You all boil in a single and very small pot. Universe is very small. Occasionally you'll be ganked by high levels (just out of boredom), occasionally high levels will wipe all asteroids right in front of you in a matter of seconds.\n\nEverything in this game is raw and undeveloped.

And initially, it feels much the same: You undock your ship and do things in space like shoot rocks and pirates.\n\nThe similarities end there, however.  Understandably, as a very early MMO, there's a lot to be improved upon and mechanics that don't exactly work yet.  PVP is trash as there's neither aggression mechanics nor warp disruption, so catching somebody who either doesn't want to fight or wants to fight until it's clear that they're losing is impossible.  I've exploded at least a hundred ships in this game, and all of them were AFK or butterfingering their warp button.\n\nI understand that a small sandbox MMO doesn't need to have the same PVP mechanics as one of the largest, and GoH is doing a lot of things right (for example, you control a fleet of 1-7 ships instead of a single ship, which is a fun deviation from typical MMO design).  The main reason why I have to give this game a No recommendation, from the perspective of somebody who is primarily motivated by PVP, is that the Dev team simply refuses to answer questions about when or how they plan to make PVP feasible.  They are available around the clock, answering questions related to PVE topics, but when a PVP topic comes up, they are mute.\n\nThis lack of transparency is disturbing.\n\nFurther, those who do PVP are treated with scorn by the overwhelmingly larger PVE community, who will chant "Go back to EVE" at any suggestion that the current PVP mechanics might be added or improved.  At first I thought it was funny, being an EVE veteran, and had heard much of the same whining from the EVE playerbase.  The difference here is that the "powers that be" - the few players who already own Battleships, which are a hard-counter to literally everything in the game - are themselves strongly against the improvement or addition of PVP features.\n\nSo it could be that you're looking for a game in which you mine, build, mine, build, mine, and build some more, and don't do much else.  Gates of Horizon would be your game.  If you are looking for a game with decent space combat, you're out of luck, and probably will be for the near, if not distant, future.","January 24, 2015","false","104.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Adding the red zones and PVP to a small game like this just strikes me as a waste of so much effort to copy what is avaliable in a much grander and prettier fashion now, in EVE, if we want more of that.\n\nThe only thing this mini Eve has going for it is no subscription fee. If you want a mini Eve with no sub and mini just about every thing Eve has then sure go ahead and get this.\n\nTLDR: You want Eve? go play Eve. This is NOT it. You want a nice relaxing non PVP game where you can mine and do your own thing?

They are still activly changing the game.  So far they have only changed things pertaining to PvE the developers seem to ignore the PvP side of things and focus on pleasing the carebares.  they have expanded the universe 3 times and all 3 times it has been "safe space".  When "PvPers" ask the developers about anything that has to do with PvP they are quickly dismissed and ignored.  If they were intending on working on PvP later they could atleast say as mutch.  The unwillingness to even say this leads to the belief that this will be a game like eve with no pvp.  for a game the almost completly emulates EVE why would they try to phase out the one thing that makes it so fun(PvP).\ntherefore i have to change my recommendation from yes to a big fat NO!","January 21, 2015","false","597.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Even more, once engaged in combat, they keep fighting no matter what, even after you order them to fly back to base (they completely ignore the order).\nSo yeah... I'm going to uninstall it and hope that a year or two from now it will be better.\n\nStill, my respect and kudos for making a SteamOS executable.
