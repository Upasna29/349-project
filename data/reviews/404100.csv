Let me offer some bulletpoints so far, and I may change my post depending on how far I get into the game.\n\n----Pros\n+I'm pleased to say that the controls are fantastic. A bug or two persisted at launch, but the developers have swiflty patched it out and I can report that everything works smoothly. I'm more of a gamepad kind of guy, but I must say their use of keyboard controls is refreshing, and anyone who likes either scheme will not be disappointed.\n+the graphics are nice, once again utilizing fine spritework instead of lazy pixel art like it's become a habit of in indie games\n+there's about 7-10 tracks of music in the game, but they're really catchy. I've often left the game open just to listen to some of the boss music (incase you're wondering why I have so much playtime). Soundtrack when?\n+the pacing is smooth, in that you'll never suffer a massive whiplash in difficulty. Also, the game advertises 4 planets to explore, and each has 8-10 levels each. The length of each level is about 1/3rd of the length of your average GA level, so I'd reckon this game is almost twice as long.\n+overall it's an enjoyable experience with a good difficulty curve. Expect to die a bit\n+The game, unlike its predecessor, utilizes a save system, where you can start off where you left at certain checkpoints, so you don't have to do the whole game in one run. In exchange, your mech can't tank hits anymore. A few shots and you're dead, and hazards are actually a threat to you now.\n+you trade in the shield of the GMR-SALADIN in favor of multiple weapons, each of which function as your basic damage dealers, but there's enough variety for each playstyle.\n+the game makes good on its promise of large, imposing bosses. Each has a distinct feeling to them, a strategy to take them down, and even unique arenas to fight them in. Whether you're soaring through the sky, or running on a collapsing bridge, they change up the formula to keep you on your toes.\n+the store page says they make several references to their older works, like Satazius and Vulkaiser and I think even Armed Seven reared his robotic mug. I won't spoil anything for you, but the way they reference each is pretty cool, and they're not just background murals or small missable things.\n+Nyu Media and Astro Port have been quick to keep watch over and work out any issues with gameplay or other bugs (as with all their games) so you can expect a quality product. I definitely love this game enough to fully recommend it, so it's hard to contain my enthusiasm in a single review.\n\n----Cons\n-achievements are a little bugged, but a fix is in the works from what I've heard (doesn't affect the game, so if you're not a dedicated achievement hunter, this shouldn't be a problem)\n-not too many configuration options, as you can't personally drag the screen to your desired size, but it does offer some choices.\n\nOn that note, I think that, along with Xenoblade Chronicles X, Earth Defense Force for the PS4, and Final Fantasy 15 (and the promised magitek missions), robots are coming back in style. Steel Strider is a fine staging point for that. Now if only Astro Port could make a 3D robot game where you drive it around like in XCX. That would be cool, but that's for another day.","November 12, 2015","true","25.4"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","32","34","0","0"

You pilot a towering behemoth and it's armed with the latest high-tech weaponry. The catch of course is that your mobility is somewhat limited. While you aren't slow, you have to consider the fact that you're operating over a dozen tons of machinery. This additional weight forces you to consider each situation carefully, so as to avoid as much damage as possible. I've always had a fondness for this sub-genre. When done well, it creates a satisfying experience. Steel Strider is successful at delivering this intense and challenging game-design.\n\nThe plot for this game can be rather amusing, depending on your familiarity with Astroport's library. Otherwise, just think of it as an excuse to hop into a Gemini-class MCR (Manned Combat Robot) and turn armies of mechs into so much scrap. There are four areas, which are broken up into several stages. Typically these stages offer a mix of shooting, platforming, boss-fights, and even a few surprises. As with previous titles, your score reflects how well you handle this myriad of situations.\n\nThe Gemini is capable of using several weapons. These are scattered across every stage. The strategy is in using the right weapon for whatever comes up. Assault rifles and shotguns are great for handling smaller enemies and missiles, but you might want rockets or grenades for when mechs crowd together. Conservation of ammo is somewhat important. Although your handgun and beamsword are always available, you'll always want some heavy artillery to chew through bosses quickly.\n\nUnfortunately for you, having a massive arsenal is just part of the survival equation in this game. The Gemini is imposing, but it can't take much damage. A few rockets, a handful of bullets, one too many run-ins with a pile bunker; death comes very easily in this game. You're a slightly smaller target than the mech in Gigantic Army, but you don't even get a shield. This means that you have to take every precaution, use weapons to their fullest, and come to grips with the limited maneuverability offered by your jetpack. As with ammo, conserving armor is very important. Your mech isn't repaired in-between stages, so you have to make the most of the limited drops available.\n\nUnlike previous Astroport titles, you get unlimited continues. The catch is that you'll restart the stage with however much armor you had originally. So if you reach a boss-fight, and your mech can't even take one hit, well.... you're just going to have to be that darn good. You might even find yourself restarting stages, just so you can (hopefully) take more armor into the next one. At least the stages are really short. Most of them should only take a couple minutes to complete. By the way, this is all irrelevant if you're playing for score. Completing areas without continuing results in a large amount of bonus points.\n\nFinding the right balance between conservation and wrecking havok is what makes Steel Strider unique and entertaining. It reminds me of Doom in the sense that no weapon ever really replaces another*. Each gun has their own ammo, and you can't simply use the most powerful one to trivialize encounters. Each of them has their use in the game, and it's up to you to determine the whens and wheres. Understanding the enemy and their tactics is rewarding as well. Their ability to fire at you is limited by the mechanics of the game. So for large walker-type mechs, you can dispatch them easily by staying close and slashing at their legs. They're at a distinct disadvantage, because they can't aim their cannons far enough downward. For action games, sometimes it's the little details that really matter.\n\nThe only aspect where Steel Strider is lacking is the music. There are some tunes, but none of them are really memorable. A great soundtrack can elevate even the worst games, let alone good ones. It could be that I'm just not a fan of the style of music. I would have preferred something a little more catchy and impactful, like the music from Assault Suits Valken. The controls and camera will take some practice as well. I noticed that most players use the mouse & keyboard, but I went with an X360 game-pad. This can make aiming a little tricky, especially if your right thumb is shaking due to a really tense situation. I look at this as all part of the learning curve. Once you get the hang of it, you'll appreciate the added precision.\n\nAstroport is one of those developers that makes game-design look easy. Time and time again they've delivered quality software. This could be attributed to their focus on shooters, but I think there's more to it than that. Astroport understands the essentials, and doesn't create a lot of unnecessary content or bloat. At less than an hour, Steel Strider doesn't take long to complete. The longevity of this game comes from replays, harder difficulties, and challenging the online leaderboards. For fans of Gigantic Army or mechs in general, this game is definitely worth checking out.\n\n*Aside from the minigun replacing the pistol of course.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","November 18, 2015","true","3.1"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","2"

You aim with the mouse now. The newer, shinier Gemini mech is a very different beast; no longer do you have a massive metal riot shield to protect yourself with, which is a shame because the new robot is ominously less sturdy and absorbs significantly less damage. To counteract this, no longer are you expected to play the game as one huge chunk with no save options. Wanted to beat Gigantic Army? You did so in one solid sitting or you didn’t do it at all! This never felt unfair because the Saladin could handle a pummelling. But, on the other hand, the weaker Gemini’s war against everything feels equally balanced thanks to being able to save at the start of each bite-sized mission segment.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12737/pc/steel-strider/review.html\n\n","November 18, 2015","true","4.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

For all its flaws Steel Strider is some of the most enjoyable 16-bit inspired experiences I have had in a long time.\n\nSteel Strider is a mech action game much in the same style as the Turrican series back in the early 90s. Progressing through each level sees you encounter stronger enemies and more and more elaborate boss fights and it’s the boss fights that really make this game fun. If using a gamepad it works like a side scrolling twin stick shooter but I personally found playing the game with the mouse and keyboard much easier.\n\nWhen the game first came out it was plagued by a bug that forced you to jump when you fired. This has since been fixed but is the reason why this review is a few days late.\n\nControlling your Mech is fluid and generally the float mechanic works well. Rarely did I screw up due to the controls. As the game progresses the difficulty curve ramps up but the game always felt fair. When I died… and that happened a lot I was left feeling it was my fault and I could do better. A slight gripe is the fact that sometimes a save point left you with little or no life making the next section a massive uphill struggle and often I found myself in a situation where I had no choice but to kill a boss without getting hit at all.\n\nLuckily there is a nice spread of weapons ranging from your humble handgun to the shotgun which is essentially a spread beam, the powerful rocket launcher the swarm destroying missiles and the boss killers that are the railgun and the lightning gun. As you progress through the game these get upgrade but the upgrades feel a little shallow and never seem to improve your weapons all that much. You can switch between weapons at will as long as you have ammunition and you quickly learn when to use what weapon and they all had a use at different points of the campaign. You do have a laser sword for close range combat but I found myself rarely using it as I progressed through the game.\n\nWhile not a massive issue a slight gripe is the general resolution of the game. Running in a 4:3 aspect ratio with a max resolution of 1024 x 768 is not exactly modern. Now I understand this is a retro game but literally this looks like a game I could be running on an emulator from the era. In pursuit of video game journalism I am still trying to work out why Japanese developer still produce a lot of games in 4:3 and I have never really found a proper answer.. Despite all these issues the game actually looks pretty good especially with some of the screen filling bosses.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time with Steel Strider. Not a perfect game but one I would definitely recommend to fans of the genre.\n\nFor our video review please follow this link: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/151122_game-tutor-grades-steel-strider\n\nTHIS GAME WAS REVIEWED USING A COPY OF THE GAME PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPER.

So much so that some of the weapons, the screen layout and the control scheme are pretty much identical. What made ABUSE special was the controls: move your character with the cursor keys, aim with the mouse - that allowed for movement and aiming in different directions and it was quite a departure from the average run and gun game at the time.\n\nSTEEL STRIDER takes this as a foundation and adds a layer of the typical Astro Port "Real Robot Mecha-Action". There is momentum to your jumps, your jetpack just boosts after a bit of delay and generally speaking there seems to be a tiny delay to anything you do - suitably transporting the idea of controlling a warmachine. Though, in a much smaller scale than in previous games. These changes make Steel Strider more action-oriented and less "Assault Suits"-style - but compared to Astro Ports other releases  this also means the game is much less clunky and might suit the tastes of a broader audience that don't fancy that "weight".\n\nYou also have a much wider selection of different weapon types at your disposal at all time. As a result battles tend to be more tactical. Different weapons are suitable for different combat situations and figuring out how to handle various situations is half the fun of STEEL STRIDER. There is also a slight managment aspect as ammo and health is somewhat sparse and carries over from area to area, so you don't want to waste your "bosskillers" on the average opposition and make every shot count. Depending on your skill you might even be able to fend off your attackers just with plasma saber and handgun to save ammo for the big guys.\n\nTalking about the big guys, boss battles are badass as always - nice patterns, massive bosses and even some cameos from other Astro Port titles. There are always massive explosions and lasers going off in all directions - so if you are in it for some 90ies 2D badassery, Steel Strider delivers. The presentation is done in the same style as pretty much all the other Astro Port games, no surprises here and just like all the other releases, a bunch of achievements are broken too - again, no surprises. The camera movement when playing on an analogue-stick can be somewhat irritating and sometimes you end up in some bad situations with too little health or not enough ammo that might force you to replay a segment, but otherwise it's a really solid game and well worth it.\n\nIf you liked the games Astro Port did up to this point, getting STEEL STRIDER is pretty much a no-brainer - it complements the ideas and concepts of GIGANTIC ARMY and ARMED SEVEN nicely. Definite recommendation for Mecha-fanboys and 2D-junkies.","December 1, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I know some people say games like this have weak stories but if you play all the games together you get to see the rich timeline and growth of the universe these games take place in.

As you play, you'll receive a variety of upgrades and new weapons that will greatly help in your quest.\n\nPlaying through on Easy, I felt that at times there weren't enough checkpoints (for easy mode), causing one to have to constantly replay difficult sections should they die at a bad time. The weapons all have their uses, though the arc on the grenade launcher did feel a bit odd. There also didn't seem to be enough health packs (again, for easy mode), often leaving me having to attempt to go through sections taking no damage as I'm extremely low.\n\nDespite those complaints, the game is fairly enjoyable, and will last around an hour (if you don't die a lot - deaths and some cases of rage quitting from a launch bug (since fixed) are what caused my playtime to be higher). Replayability comes down to if you want to try it at higher difficulties or not, and trying to beat your best high score.
