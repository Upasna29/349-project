"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/32360/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is a remake of the popular Lucas Art point and click adventure game which was released back in 1990. The remake was released in mid-2009 on PC, Mac, PSN and Xbox Live Arcade. The game is set in the Caribbean at the time of pirates. You play as Guy Threepwood - a guy who dreams of becoming a pirate.\n\nThis game is set in a third person perspective point and click style gameplay. You are able to explore around the world and interact with objects in a couple of different ways, such as inspecting them, picking them up, pushing or pulling for example, whilst you are also able to interact with other NPCs in the game through multiple dialogue options. The game has no death scenes in it for your character; game play is heavily focused on puzzles and exploring. The puzzles in The Secret of Monkey Island are in adventure style; and make no sense what so ever until you finally figure it out, then it becomes clear as day, but all of the puzzles are fun to take part in. Personally my favourite would be the pirate insulting duels. This was the first game in a long while that actually had me taking notes on a pen and paper! None of the puzzles are really time based, so you can spend as much time as you want on them without being penalized.\n\nWhat I really liked about The Secret of Monkey Island is that you can either play the game in the remastered settings with the higher quality art style, or you can actually play it in the classic pixel style that the original game was based on, you can do this on a scene by scene basis too.  The art style of the remastered edition looks really good though, lots of vibrant colours and some really nice looking background environments.\n\nAs this was my first experience with The Secret of Monkey Island I wasn't sure what to expect from it story wise, but I was pleasantly surprised when there is a whole load of humour added into the plot. Every single character I ran into had an extremely memorable persona. I don't want to spoil any of the story since the game is essentially the story, but it is captivating and interesting right until the end.\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is completely voice acted, and done really well. Even the none main characters are voice acted, such as bar dwellers and town folk which was a nice touch, much of the sound track is also the same, just remastered to a higher quality.\n\nThis is another game that completely baffled me at parts, whether it be on some of the puzzles or just knowing where to go next to progress the story; which resulted in me looking up the guide, to be honest I am not sure how you are supposed to figure some of it but it has been done by plenty of others! I was really immersed in the story of the game and didn't want to lose too much time faffing around with not knowing where to go so I was happy to look up the answers this time.\n\nEach of the game's scenes has plenty of objects that you can interact with, most will end up with Guy giving some sort of witty remark towards them, and there are also lots of NPCs which you can talk with to get more out of the plot and some of the side stories going off in the game too.\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island took me ten hours to complete; this was with the aid of a guide at parts, and following up all dialog options with NPCs to get the most out of the lore; I thought this was a pretty good length for the game considering I actually thought it would be a lot shorter given my past experience of point and click games. Given that the story is linear and that there is only one ending to the game, there is no reason to replay it through a second time though.\n\nGiven that this is a remastered edition of the game, it works fine on the newer operating systems, and I was able to play at 4K resolutions perfectly fine. I encountered minor problems with the controls in the game, and the scroll wheel functionality when choosing which action to take on objects stopping randomly - but this was easily worked around by using the keyboard shortcuts.  An odd issue which has been reported is that for some reason the game refuses to run when being installed on a 3 TB hard drive, so that may be something to consider if you are purchasing it and you only have a 3 TB drive.\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island is often referred to as the pinnacle of point and click adventure games, and this series is what spawned many more of the greats we have today, and rightly so. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of my time playing this game, and the story is absolutely brilliant and I cannot wait to get stuck into the rest of the series. The low price of £6, 99 on Steam makes The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition a serious contender for a must play title.\n\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Audio    9    Excellent music (I mean come on! its monkey Island I don't think I will ever get that tune out of my head) and really well done voice acting for all the characters.    Gameplay    10    Ok, first I admit I am completely biased here: I love Monkey Island. Back from the days when I first got it to run on my 268 (I know showing my age) this game was something special. Monkey Island is one of the classic games from the golden age of point and click adventure games where LucasArts and Sierra ruled supreme with games like Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max and the Kings Quest series. The controls have been reworked, making them more user friendly for a modern audience, but are still faithful to the original and don't detract from the game in anyway. Even if you weren't old enough to appreciate these games the first time round they are masterpieces and I feel stand the test of time.        Story    10    The game is pretty much all about the story (a truly amazing story), and while you are free to do some exploring around the islands and some trial and error with the puzzles, the story is essentially linear (so don't expect an open world game). The dialogue is full of dry humour and the situations (and solutions to puzzles) fantastical, absurd and brilliant. While the story has many aspects that will appeal to younger players (slapstick humor), much of the humour will appeal to adults. The puzzles are challenging but not to the point of frustration and are worked into the story well.         Replayability    7    If you have played the game its likely to be memorable enough that you will know the solutions to the puzzles, but its still good fun, and was for me very nostalgic.        Overall    9.5    Completely biased review, take from it what you will, but we all have childhood games special to us and this was mine. Good times\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

It's rare to have humor used so well in a game. With your want-to-be pirate,  'hero',  ahem, Guybrush Threepwood there are plenty of hair-pulling challenges & interesting locations to explore.\n\nThere is even swashbuckling sword play, although in a much more creatively different way than you would ever expect! Mind you, that will happen a lot in MI, where the most creative .. strange .. crazy step is often the next step, not the logical one you think.\n\nThe fresh coat of paint in the Special Edition with its 3D-ish cartoon look enhances the setting well, although you can also switch to the classic graphics at any time too! Voice acting is excellent taking full advantage of the great dialog. Always enjoyable taking a pirate holiday back to MI! Yarr!\n\nTimeless point 'n' click adventure!

Dialogue stops are necessary to keep the game in-tact with the original flow, but can be a little distracting once voices are added to the mix.\n\nWORTH: Did I mention you can transition back and forth from remaster to classic? well, you can transition back and forth from remastered and classic.

The Secret of Monkey Island is indeed a definitive masterpiece of adventure gaming and one of the most important games in its genre.  It's also incredible fun to play, even today.  While the Special Edition is a mixed bag, the underlying game is as funny and charming as it has always been.  Every gamer deserves to treat themselves to this timeless masterpiece.\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island was a watershed game for Lucas Arts.  While their earlier efforts were also excellent (especially Zak McKracken, which is so unfairly forgotten), The Secret of Monkey Island is where everything comes together and the stage is set for a truly incredible run of masterpiece adventure games that would culminate with 1998's Grim Fandango - the greatest adventure game of all time.  The Secret of Monkey Island takes the brilliant ideas in Loom and for the first time, fully realizes them.  The Secret of Monkey Island is a game that refuses to allow the player to reach a dead end - one of the most maddening aspects of earlier adventure games where the player could reach a point in the game where further progress was impossible due to the lack of an item missed earlier in the game.  This required reloading an older save game, or even restarting the game entirely.  Not fun.  The Secret of Monkey Island also refuses to kill the player.  Unlike so many other early adventure games where death was a frequent and often unforeseeable occurrence, Monkey Island recognizes that dying is unnecessary and detracts from the fun.  The heart of adventure games is the exploration, story, and puzzles - and these are exactly the elements that The Secret of Monkey Island embodies.   The Secret of Monkey Island thus laid the foundation upon which the future of adventure gaming would be built.  No longer were adventure gamers going to be satisfied with unforeseeable deaths or maddening dead ends.\n\nNot only is the game a hallmark of the genre, but it is also a joy to play.  The characters are simply drawn, but charming.  Mighty pirate wannabe Guybrush Threepwood is a hilarious lead character and he is impossible to dislike.  His one liners will have you rolling.  Even some of the dialog choices you don't choose will have you snickering.  The story of Guybrush's quest to become a pirate is a wonderful mash-up of pulp piracy cliches.  There's buried treasure, thrilling sword fights, voodoo magic, mysterious islands, and even cannibals.  It's an inherently lighthearted and silly game, and every one of those elements (and much more) are inverted or lampooned in very funny ways.\n\nThe Special Edition update, however, is a mixed bag.  The game's graphics have been updated for significantly higher resolutions than the game's original 640x480 resolution and now supports widescreen resolutions.  I have mixed feelings about the update.  There is a certain flatness to the graphics work that I don't find attractive.  I do give the artists credit, however, for their attempt to remain very faithful to the original artwork as well as subsequent games in the series.  The animations are also rather rough.  Characters moonwalk around the screen in a decidedly unnatural way and there are some clipping issues.  All of these faults are almost certainly due to Lucas Arts not investing enough resources and trying to get by on the cheap.  It's a shame, because there is indeed potential for a wonderful remake.  The game also now supports full voice acting for all characters using the familiar voices from the later Monkey Island games.  The main cast is wonderful, but some of the supporting voices are a bit rough.  Also, some of the jokes are ruined with the poor timing of the audio - for instance, try asking the Men of Low Moral Fiber in town about what's in the keg.  It doesn't work like it does in text.  The other poor aspect of the Special Edition is the changes to the inventory and verb (interaction) system.  The game no longer has the classic SCUMM verbs in the lower portion of the screen along with inventory items.  The inventory must now be accessed via keyboard hotkey, and verbs must be selected via mouse scroll wheel or hot key.  This is a significant downgrade, in my opinion.  The original system was more streamlined and allowed for faster interactions.  There was one puzzle in the game that I couldn't manage in the Special Edition due to the cumbersome inventory system, but can easily accomplish in the original.  I won't spoil it for you, but will say that it involves grog.\n\nThe truly brilliant aspect of the Special Edition, however, is that the original, unaltered game is included and can be seamlessly switched between.  Essentially, you get two games and you can try them out and see which you like better, or complete the game both ways.  I still prefer the older version, but I'm an old grey beard gamer.  As I see it, there's just no improving on perfection, and The Secret of Monkey Island is a very near perfect adventure.","October 19, 2014","true","4.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","1"

I used to like a movie called The Adventures of Milo and Otis (a Westernized version of the Japanese movie 'A Kitten's Story'). It's a fun movie about a cat and a dog! They work together, solve crimes! Except there's all sorts of shady business concerning animal abuse around that film. I can't watch it anymore without wondering how many kittens and puppies died for this movie.\n\nNow that you've got that wonderful nugget of information, I'm here to tell you that The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is a classic that DOES hold up. It has no dead kittens in it. It has lots of ghosts, though. All those ghosts lovingly rendered in actual art graphics rather than those pixel art graphics that kids hate today. (If you like the pixel art graphics, all you have to do is press F10 and you will TRAVEL BACK IN TIME TO 1990 IN VIDEO GAME FORM!) Part of the draw of the Special Edition is that it modernizes the 1990 classic for 2015 audiences - because who in the hell wants to play with a verb menu permanently glued to the bottom of the screen these days? It's like watching a movie in a theatre with an uncomfortable mask on. That may fly in The Bad Old Days, but this is 2015 and I have MONITOR REAL ESTATE. There's also a built-in hint system if you get stuck on the puzzles. Just hammer the H button. The H button stands for "Help, Hi! Here Hi Ham Hin Hthis Hcomputer Hgame, Hand Hi Hhave Hno Hidea Hwhere Hto Hgo!"\n\nAs for the actual game itself? It's a pirate story with a wonderful atmosphere, interesting characters, and jokes coming out of the wazoo. But as for the progression and puzzles... well, they're not so hot. Half of the game is about gearing up for the big expedition, and then the other half quickly flys by. The puzzles range from 'fine' to 'irritating'. The best course of action when playing this is to take in the atmosphere and choose every dialogue option you can get. That means you get more jokes, and the puzzles aren't as tedious!\n\nAnyway, this is one of the greats, and no animals die in this video game, so I am happy to say it'll be a thing you can treasure for some time.","July 19, 2015","true","8.9"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","16","22","6","2"

You’re playing as Guybrush, a light-hearted, clumsy fellow on his way to becoming a real, grog drinking pirate. While trying to gain the respect of the real pirates, Elaine Marley, governor of Mêlée Island™ gets kidnapped by ghost pirate LeChuck and it is up to Guybrush to save the day.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=650056748\n\nAbout the Game\nThe Monkey Island series is by no doubt the best known point & click adventure series out there and anyone interested either in the genre itself or the evolution of video games as a whole should pick this game up. Lucas Arts has done a marvellous job at preserving the old game and has given players the option to experience the game with new graphics, a hint system, new controls, new music, and of course a voiceover. But if one had to nitpick, the remaster has a couple of very minor issues.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=650390054\n\nIt sounds odd to mention this in a point & click adventure, but this game is unresponsive at times. When moving the mouse to the edge of the screen and telling Guybrush to go there, he often times refuses to, something that later Lucas Arts adventure games remasters don’t suffer from. When having the new graphics turned on, I could also only navigate through the item menu via keyboard. This ultimately lead me to prefer the old graphics over the new.\n\nAnother issue is that, when playing with the modern graphics turned on, you can only select dialogue options when you move your mouse icon near the left-hand side of the of the screen. This edition also does not contain any achievements, unlike the Xbox 360 port of the special edition and the other Lucas Arts remasters. Audio commentary is also absent.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=650390688\n\nConclusion\nAt the end the question aficionados will ask themselves is: “Does it hold up?” It’s a mixed bag, there are several portions in the game that are just supposed to artificially lengthen the playtime instead of contributing to the story; Most notably the one segment where Guybrush has to pour grog from one mug to another while trying to reach an NPC and the other part where players venture through Monkey Island. These parts are just boring, tedious, and annoying. The puzzles at times rely on Moon Logic to solve them, which really dampens the fun that even the hint system cannot always help bring back. The humor is still on point, but it’s obvious, especially with the lack of a coherent narrative, that the Lucas Arts adventure games were still in their infancy here.","March 26","true","5.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

Having arrived on Melee Island, you follow wannabe Guybrush Threepwood on his quest to become a great pirate captain, which gets him in the way of ghost pirate LeChuck's evil plan.\n\nPros: This game an exact replica of the 1990 game with a fresh paint, capturing the cartoony feel to this comedic adventure. The game story breaks the forth wall constantly, anywhere from adressing and looking directly at the player, to referencing modern culture. Nostalgic players will especially enjoy the winks at other LucasArt adventure games such as Day of the Tentacle or the Indiana Jones series. You meet the most stereotypical characters throughout the story, collecting a huge assortment of objects and trickets you will use, pull, push, pick up and give to solve different puzzles. Dialog choices are used as an actual mechanic such as Swordfighting.\n\nCons: The story really is nothing special, and you don't feel compelled to do anything besides advance the linear story until the next gag comes along. If you played this game in the past and remember the solutions, you will find it a breeze to play through it again. Some animations are just HD versions of animation limitation of the old days, so in-game closups get dated animations with no lip movement during dialog. Controls for picking "verbs" and navigating your inventory feels clunky, especially during timed events. Some puzzles aren't obvious at all, requiring to try the same action or dialog choice over and over until a different result happens.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nI really feel like giving it a better rating, but I know a lot of the fun I had playing this game comes from nostalgic references which players who didn't play such games "back then" won't get or even notice. On it's own, it's still a good game for all ages, funny with a few challenging puzzles. Give it a try!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","February 28","true","8.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Monkey Island is a game that EVERY gamer MUST play, and this is the perfect time to do it, with this remake. Personally, i'm not a huge fan of this version of the game, i prefer the classic version but, ehy, this is great anyway, and it brought my memories back to when i was a child. But you don't care about this, don't you? So let's keep going. The graphics are modern and beautiful, the gameplay is the classic one that these games invented at their time, and as always, is GREAT. The story is a lot engaging, and the UNIVERSE of this game... Oh god. I just love it, is so well done, with its lore, its characters, its jokes, its stereotypes, THE GROG... Just play it and you'll understand, wait the sales if you need it but PLAY IT. You'll thank me later ;)\n(Sorry for my bad english)\n\nAnd remember..   "Never pay more than 20 bucks for a computer game."\n\nItaliano:\n\nOh, ragazzi, cosa c'è da dire? Monkey Island è un gioco che DEVE essere giocato da TUTTI i videogiocatori, e questo remake è l'occasione perfetta. Personalmente non vado PAZZO per questa versione del gioco, preferivo quella originale sotto certi aspetti ma, ehi, è comunque fantastico, e poi mi ha riportato con la mente a quando ero bambino. Ma a voi questo non interessa, giusto? La grafica è bella e moderna, la giocabilità è stupenda, il gameplay è quello classico del punta e clicca, inventato proprio da questi giochi ai loro tempi, la storia è avvincente e divertente e poi l'UNIVERSO di questo gioco è talmente ben fatto, con le sue battute, i suoi stereotipi, i personaggi, IL GROG... Giocatelo e basta, aspettate gli sconti se dovete ma, giocatelo. Poi mi ringrazierete ;)\n\nE ricordatevi...

You can easily switch between the new grpahics (they seem rushed and a little "off" - more than in Monkey Island 2) and the original UI.  You can use a gamepad, and while I didn't enjoy that control I have a few friends who used it with only some minor adjustment (cursing).\n\nAt any time you can switch between the two versions and can even grab hints in the newer one.  I did bonce back and forth in a few scenes to see how it looked "remastered" but just went right back to the original.\n\nThis game is a classic for a reason - you can't die, (rubber trees to the rescue!) it is clever and the story is great, and there are so many little gags and goofs that will keep you chuckling throughout the game.\n\nThis game is also why one day I will own my very own rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle - mark my words as I am also a Mighty Pirate!\n\nIf you can grab it on sale, don't miss it!","January 30","true","14.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YoreIore/recommended/32360/","YoreIore","Azathoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YoreIore/","300 products in account","An excellent remake of an absolute classic.  The Secret of Monkey Island is the quintessential point and click adventure game that is full of puzzles, witty humour and memorable characters.  The game is obviously at its best when you are playing it for the first time as it will be difficult and all the jokes will be fresh.  This hasn't stopped many players, including myself, playing the game dozens of times.\n\nThis remake allows you to play the game in its original form or with updated graphics, voice acting and controls.  This is where I found there to be a few problems.  The updated special edition gives you a fantastic way to play the game, but I found myself switching back to the old version during a few puzzles that require specific timing.  The updated mode forces you to scroll throw actions such as "Look at" or "Use" instead of having them all on the screen at once.  This can be frustrating and I think this is the wrong sort of game to force a controller like interface on players.  Having to switch between versions due to a frustrating control scheme isn't really good enough.\n\nThe game itself is challenging and it has more than one puzzle that will stump new players.  I would also go as far as to say that one specific part of the game has a ridiculous amount of back and forth between a few locations.  This has always bothered me, but it's a minor issue.  I simply recommend that you avoid a guide and give this a try, it's difficult, but you have all the time in the world and it's certainly rewarding when you make your way towards the end of the game.\n\nThis special edition is well worth the purchase as it offers new players the chance to experience a fantastic adventure game while offering the old fans a chance to play it with a bit of a makeover.","September 24, 2014","true","3.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/32360/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is a 2009 remake of old classic DOS point'n'click adventure title, that came out back in 1990. This version actually allows switching between original and remake on-the-fly. If you just want to play original, you can do it pretty much from beggining to the end, with almost no changes!\n\nMonkey Island itself is a classic LucasArts adventure game. It's well remembered for it's pirate (including voodoo) setting and humor, having world to expore and having puzzles to break head against, guessing what they want player to do. By that point, adventures games already had point'n'click setting in place, just clicking on needed verb and using it on object. Just clicking on object itself always uses the most logical verb (and often the only one possible), so you may just forget of this aspect.\nThe game is divided into three chapters, the first one being the biggest and most open one, travelling on Melee Island, talking around and trying to complete three main objectives in order to become pirate, while starting to figure out what Le Chuck has to do in this game. Second chapter has you on another island, bigger in space, but less in NPCs, just having this funnily annoying slightly crazed inhabitant of island dropping in and out. Final chapter, "Kicks Butt", kicks some serious butts. Linear, short, but bumps you up and is very worthy compared to Adventure games.\nNow, being classic adventure game, it's more concentrated on non-stop solving of 'puzzles' and interaction, with the only action sequences being sword fighting. Well, not exactly what you think. INSULT sword fighting, used only in chapter 1 anyway. Worth noting, you have to beat such "battles" by choosing correct reply to insults, while later throwing your own. Heck, most of them is spend on "farming" new insult and replies, by losing, to collect them all and beat the Swordmaster.\n\nOtherwise, standart classic LucasArts. Which means few things. First, there is no way to die or get stuck in dead end in this game, so you can do stupid things all the way you want, unlike classic Sierra. Second, you can choose few options in conversation, but none changes the plot or progression - it's either a puzzle by itself or "choose your own joke to make". (You can even choose "what we have learned" reply in the end of the game!). Third, the puzzles are either easy and logical or they are hard and make no common sense. Quite a common thing in classic adventure games, doing something unexpect for goals that plotwise aren't the ones you would want to do, Like, suddenly finding out that you have and actually can 'combine' items in your inventory, for single puzzle, to rescue some shady figure who probably wouldn't be much of good if freed.\n\nSpecial Edition keeps all of those and provides an upgrade to both graphics and sound, while messing around controls. Hands down, music is superior to soundblaster and art has more resolution than what original offered. But the gap is too big and those who grew with original may be put off. Difference between pixels-art that leaves something for imagination and defined art, you see. Where main character, Guybrush, was a normal guy in black and white in original, with who most people could reliate, becomes character in it's own with that hair. And sure thing, close-ups aren't drawn in same realistical way. But otherwise, it's fancy in it's own!\nIt also added voice acting to it, but because of limitation of original engine, it has awkward pause between each line, putting some players off. And once again, "it's not the way we imagined it when we played original".\n\nAnd you can switch between original and remake on the fly, with press of single button, no loading required! Nice! Though, you can notice that animation in remake somehow feels to follow animation of original closely, having same amount of animation frames, not always having art to make same sense in these cases.\n\nActually, it switches not only visual and audio, but interface too. And it's another reason to stay on original, being made with in way to allow it to be controlled by gamepads on consoles as well. It tries to be as good as in modern point'n'clicks, but clumpsier. Much. Main fault comes from technical aspect, actually, where for some reason sometimes it playes like the actual cursor is placed lower/higher than it's actually shown.\nAnd sure thing, to keep modern players sane, it incorporated hints system, when on the magical press of button, you get a hint hint hint. Good joy, much needed. Not always as straight as you would want it to be though, but anything helps.\n\nThus, nice remake of classic adventure game, which most recommend to play at least once, having humor, story and some puzzles that make no sense, this fault of adventure games eased up with hints. Not too long either and with charm.","November 4, 2014","true","11.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Although it was made in the 90s, it will always be a brilliant game, and this special edition shows that it can even stay up to date with modern video games (Although you can never beat the classic graphics).\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island series is one of the most funny games series that I have ever played, with the brilliantly weakened forth wall, and the cute child-like innocence of Guybrush Threepwood, every time I replay a Monkey Island game I cannot help but to laugh at the jokes and the little references, and every time I replay it, I always find new brilliantly absurd commands and interactions.\n\nThe special edition of this game is in some aspects an improvement, but in most, quite a disappointment. The inventory is different, there's voice acting, the Stump Joke is missing and a few more differences. The special edition shouldn't be thing to deter you from buying, or from not buying this game. If you don't like the notion of a special edition, and would rather the classic, floppy disk version, you shouldn't let that stop you from buying this version, quite a lot of the special edition factors can be turned off and, apart from the missing Stump Joke, not much else was changed. If you love modern, newer games, and feel that old games are in the past, you should still not let that stop you from buying this game, for the special edition has updated the game to look sleek and new, and if you cannot stand having to read dialogue, just turn on the voice acting.\n\nThe Special vs Classic edition aside, the dialogue in Money Island is very funny, Guybrush Threepwood constantly breaks the forth wall, so much so, that by the time of the second game, you would have forgotten that it was ever there. There are lines of dialogue that are just so perfect in the game, that you simply cannot help but to pick, sometimes it is Guybrush Threepwood saying he wants to be a fire-fighter (instead of a pirate) or him asking if two brothers are his mother. The plot of the game is not that thick and at some times it barely even makes any sense. But the love story in the whole series of Monkey Island games is the cutest love story you could ever see, with the stupid, innocent Guybrush, and the strong, independent Elaine, why they are even together boggles the best of the fans.\n\nThere are many good things about The Secret of Monkey Island, but one big factor that cannot be turned off or on is the difficulty. This game is very, VERY hard, because it is an old fashioned point and click game, it has absurd logic, Guybrush Threepwood cannot reach something a few metres off the ground and thinks that if he mixes red flowers with meat it will poison it, also somehow he is able to use a kitchen pot as a helmet....  The game thus feels as if it goes on forever when you play it, whether you spend ages pondering over a specific puzzle, executing trial and error, or you have a walkthrough up in a tab, trying to not overuse the hints, you will spend quite a bit of time on the game. Sometimes it is merely a simple puzzle that with stitch you up, or maybe it will be the whole game, either way, I heavily recommend having some sort of hint system or walkthrough handy, just in case.\n\nI would heavily recomend this game to you, even if you are a very serious person, the humor is not all there is to this game, it has a brilliant soundtrack and very difficult puzzles, and on a whole is quite an enoyable game.","November 29, 2014","true","10.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Well your going to have to figure that out yourself. But one thing that is not a secret, is how amazing this game is. Quite possibly the first adventure game I ever played and the game that got me hooked to the genre. I love the music, the humor, the storyline, and almost everything about the game. Now looking back 25 years later I do see that the game is not completely without flaw. First, the game was made in 1990 so the graphics aren't all that great and there are no voices. Second, the game is relatively short by today's standards. This is not something that bothers me and shouldn't for most people, but might to the more recent fans of adventure gaming. Luckily the Special Edition gives the best of both worlds graphically (sorry but the story is still just as short), as old fans and new fans can enjoy the game they would want to play. Because trust me, there are some old fans that would cringe at the new look. The classic version and new version can be switched seemlessly by hitting F10. The old version staying true to its ancient (voodoo?) roots of a verb menu and an inventory box. The new version many good additions added to its gameplay as the new version intoduces 3D art, voices, and a much larger screen of play (due to the fact that the verb menu and an inventory box have been removed). Although I do enjoy a much larger screen, this is the one thing about the new version I am not fond of. They do have a drop down menu for the verb menu by hitting Ctrl or V as well as one for the inventory by hitting Alt or I, but this feels like more of a hassle than the old game used to be. At the end of the day, this game is a keeper.

Sure you might not like it after awhile (I will admit that it does take some time to get into) but if you continue at it, you'll find something good in there.\n\nThat said, you should pick up this game anyways because what we have here is a huge part of gaming history. This was the series that saved LucasArts and was one of the lead pioneers of the adventure genre.\n\nVerdict: BUY\n\nGet it because then you'll have experienced a rather interesting bit of history.","November 30, 2010","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The backgrounds are ofter wonderful drawn, BUT, the characters now look far too cartoony, and are not close to their originals.

I think they have gone as far as they could to improve sound - graphics - while keeping in touch with the original. And they have left the core game - the puzzles - dialogues intact. The voice acting is consistent with later titles in the series as they have recruited the same roster of voice actors for the main characters. The ability to swap back and forth between the classic edition and the improved edition is genius, but it does get strangely addictive and I find myself wishing for some kind blinking mode where it would constantly swap back and forth in a slow pace just so I can apprciate the best of both worlds. If you are not familiar with the series but like adventure games it is fair enough to say that as long as you can take a light hearted adventure and do not mind old school adventure gaming puzzles you will end up making quite a lot of nice gaming memories for yourself and will no doubt find yourself laughing out at the absurdity of this yet believable pirate universe.","January 4, 2015","true","7.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

His adventure is a mixture of strange acquaintances, funny accidents, mysterious stories and pirate's humor.\n\nGame offers us really good story line in whcich we have to deal with creepy Captain LeChuk and his ghost crew. To do this we have to visit a lot of locations (there are really quite a lot of places), interact with some funny and some strange people. We have also to collect items which help us resolve another puzzles. Game especially focuses on exploring and resovling puzzles but soetimes we have to skillfully carry on dialogues to achieve our goals. All adventure is divided on 3 parts. Every part is more coplicated and demand more time.\n\nGame has really good and improved graphics. We can also choose old school pixel graphics. Animations look quite good, some pople said that they are primitive and poorly done. But I think that this game doesn't need pimped up animations and actions. Characters are well done, locations look like painted, sounds are fitted to actions and the music is awsome.\nEverything what we gather during playing is necessary. All items help us in game. By this we don't have garbage in our pocket like in other point and click games. All we need to do is to use it properly.\n\nI thinky you can buy this game. It has really attractve prices on sales so there is no abstacles to buy it and enjoy adventure. Arrrrrr !!!!\n\nAdvantages:\n- good graphics, well made backgrounds\n- interesting plot\n- pirate's humor\n- really good sounds and music\n- funny dialogues\n- interesting puzzles\n- a lot of locations and places\n\nCons:\n- game is to short, it should be much longer :)\n- sometimes game doesn't react on mouse clicking (but maybe it is only my problem?)","February 27","true","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Also the music has been slightly overworked, as it is now a full orchestra I guess and not only 8-Bit sound. But don't worry the songs are still the same and they sound incredible!\nOne off the best features is, that you can switch between the old and the new graphicstyle (which includes also the soundscape and the localization (synchro)), so if you dont't like the new graphics, you can easily switch between both, just by pressing one single button.\nWell, thats pretty much it.\nI think I dont't need to say much about the game itself, since it was and still is one of the most succesful point & click-adventures of all time.\nI higly recommend playing the game, for everyone who rudimentally likes p&c-adventures and because you can switch the graphics, even if you don't like the new graphic, that's no issue.\nThanks for reading this wall of text, and I wish much fun with the game (Yes, I'm sure that you're gonna play it.

My first play through of the game happened in 1998, when I picked up a copy of the "Monkey Island Madness" CD as part of a lucasarts anthology at a local cd and movie shop. I spent countless hours playing and enjoying the unique story and challenging puzzles. I have to admit I fall into the "hardcore fan" category for this series and take it quite seriously. As such it took me a very long time to come around and actually finish playing this special edition.\n\nMy first play through had me cursing the controls, hating the new shiny graphics (I know, I know you can switch to the old style), and being unsure of many of the voiceover choices. Dominic Armato returns to voice Guybrush as he has done for every Monkey Island since Curse, which is great because he fits the character amazingly. That is about where my praise stops for the voice actors however. Many of the characters made me cringe because of their bad interpretations of the dialogue. One of the things about 'SOMI' that made it so great was the amazing humour and fantastic character writing. Much of that charm and emotion did not translate well to voice actors (again, I praise Dominic for doing an amazing job despite the other actors). I found myself playing without voices for any cutscenes heavy on the dialogue.\n\nNext I must address the art. Which perhaps I have the most to gripe about (until we reach controls). The original SOMI is a GORGEOUS game, and the included "classic" gameplay showcases just how well the game has held up despite limiting tech when it was created. The carefully utilized colors and pixelated characters retain a charm that is hard to find in most modern games. The characters look terrible in the new art style, though none took as harsh of a beating as guybrush himself. Guybrush was given the neck of an irritated girrafe and the hair of a bad anime character that literally defies gravity. Much of the cutscene conversation interactions are more cartoony looking, and lack a gritty reach for realism that it felt like the original game tried to achieve. The characters lost much of their appeal and had it replaced with cartoon imitations in this new art style. Now before you accuse me of rampant fanboyism, I DO think that the special editon artwork has some charm despite it's faults.\n\nSo what's positive about the new art? Many of the backgrounds are fantastic! Melee Island in particular benefitted greatly from this update and if not for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character design, I would have found the ambience damn near flawless. I was excited to go places I knew very well and see how they now looked. If there is one thing I LOVED about this special edition it was most certainly those gorgeous painted enviroments. Kudos to the art team for that.\n\nAll of this was nitpicking however, and the true reason that despite my love for the series I had to not reccomend this game is that it's controls are simply not well suited for many of the puzzles. There is one puzzle in particular the puzzle in which you must continuously trade out mugs of grog to reach the jail cell that was literally impossible to do quick enough in the new control scheme. It felt like they wanted to simplify the system to leave the original action menu hidden, but it just ended up being confusing and hard to use, severely detracting from the experience. I was often switching back to the classic gameplay just to finish things quickly and easily without fumbling through the controls.\n\nAm I glad this was released? Hell yes, this series deserves more fans, and more people getting to enjoy it. And I acknowledge that my review will likely not be the typical experience as the special edition of this game is highly recieved by many many critics. If nothing else, I am happy to have a fully updated version of the classic game packaged with this so I do not have to bother with scumm or dosbox whenever I am feeling nostalgic. I promise my review (coming soon) of Lechuck's Revenge SE, is much more positive than this one (because its a much better update than this was).","May 3, 2015","false","4.7"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ottomic/recommended/32360/","Ottomic","Ottomic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ottomic/","282 products in account","I have a massive nostalgia hard-on for the series them being my first love in videogaming ever (when I was like 10 or so) so I might probably not be able to be really neutral on this review. Regardless, I will try and number the pros and cons of the game itself:\n\n- Silly story, silly dialogue. Very in-line with any other Lucasarts titles, Simon the Sorcerer, Teen Agent or the like. Harmless, witty and a bit meta sometimes. The kind of humor the Deponia guys have been trying (and failing) so hard to convey in their games.\n\n- Gameplay is what you would expect from a SCUMM game. Pure point and click, with some overworld map sections. Old and new versions use their own inventory and action systems, and I'll get into each one further on. Most of the game consists of going places, talking to people picking up stuff and using it on other stuff to advance further on in the story. At one point one will be required to master insult swordfighting, which is kind of a minigame that to me felt fun to do but that I could see some people seeing like a chore. It's fortunately not super long and it pretty much plays itself so it's not a big deal.\n\n- Although some puzzles are certainly random and cryptic, overall most times the solution to a problem will be hinted at by the game. You can't die*, you won't run out of time, the game will save you a lot of backtracking by skipping some of it, and there is not a lot that you won't be able to solve with some patience in last instance. There is also a hints system in the Special Edition, but I couldn't use it. I'll touch on that further on.\n\n*that ONE doesn't count\n\n- Music is great. Not only the main theme is one of the most iconic and memorable songs in all of videogaming for a reason, the whole OST is made of catchy pirate-caribbean-y songs. Personally I prefer the MIDI versions over the newer instrumentals. Probably nostalgia, see above.\n\nNow, I have vastly differing opinions regarding graphics, GUI and voices. This happens because Monkey Island Special Edition can be played in two ways that for me radically change how the game plays, and that kinda ruin each separate mode for me.\n\nRegarding voices, my problem is, very simply put, you can't play classic mode with voiceovers. Which absolutely baffles me considering not only that Monkey Island 2 SE already had that out of the box, but that also you can actually fix yourself a classic version with voiceovers using this[gratissaugen.de], so that gives no excuse as to why Lucasarts couldn't have patched this at some point. That kinda ruins Classic mode for me and made me feel kinda ripped off when I bought this before I found out about this third party workaround.\n\nInterface wise I guess it comes down more to personal opinion. I prefer the old SCUMM GUI where you had the array of actions and items on the bottom, and I think there's a good reason it was the standard on a ton of point and clicks of the 90s. I personally don't feel like I need to sacrifice the nimbleness of that system for collapsible inventories and contextual stuff like Sam & Max Hit the Road or this game's "remake" mode do just to see more of the screen honestly. So that's a yay for classic mode, nay for the remake. Regarding the hints system I thought it was a nice addition, but due to me having to play the game on scummvm using that patch above to be able to play Classic with voiceovers, I didn't have the chance to use it.\n\nNow: the graphics. Hoo boy.\n\nFirst off, let me say: I am aware the classic mode looks chunky as hell. I am aware that the new graphics do look very detailed and very in line with the series' aesthetics after it hit 3. The problem comes from how absolutely disconnected everything feels. Talking animations are, no joking, 2 frames, while people actually look like they are talking in classic mode. And it's not just the animation, but the fact that the newer models usually don't seem to look at each other while talking, instead just looking into the distance. A lot of the background does look nicer, yes, but the scaling is jarring as *hell* on the new graphics, while the pixely nature of the classic mode helps a lot with that. And honestly, getting into the models themselves, I personally prefer the more natural, regular dude kinda feel the old graphics have to the humongous bobbleheads that while detailed, sometimes feel like watching a bunch of animatronics.\n\nRegarding the graphics especially it's really heartbreaking to have seen Lucasarts in its final years pouring so much money and talent into remastering one of their pivotal adventure games and coming out with something that's so pretty yet so unpleasant and so unpractical. Especially when you compare it to the more-than-15-years-old Monkey Island 3, which in my opinion hit right all the notes this remaster does wrong.\n\nSo. As a product, out of the box, I don't think this is a very good game. Given that both versions have different features that could be cross-compatible, it would have been good to see more customization in that aspect, especially regarding voiceovers. I have huge problems with the remastered version's graphics, and overall I would recommend going here[gratissaugen.de] and playing classic with voiceovers.\n\nThat said, this is a very fun, long, memorable, silly and entertaining adventure with great voicework. If you're looking to get into the big point and clickers of the 90s, or if you're looking for the definitive version of this game, absolutely pick it up. Price is very reasonable, especially on bundle.\n\n9/10 for the game itself, 8/10 for the SE edition.","October 10, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The ONLY con it has, is two bugs one at Chapter 1, and another between chapter 2 and 3. On Chapter 1, the shopkeeper opens his safe and the combination is seen fast and once. if you dont get it, to bad, you can not open it and go on with the game. There is absolutely no way to see it again. You have to load your game to a past point. So when you go to Stan to buy a ship for the first time, before you go to the shopkeeper with his card, make yourself a favor and SAVE your game. You can thank me later.\nAlso, you have to make a fuse to the cannon using rope piece on Chapter 2, then get a piece of rope once AGAIN from the ship storage, in order to go on with the game. If you don't. you will not be able to get the oars later on chapter 3. You have to load the game being in the ship to fix it.\nAnyway the whole game goes on without any problem so it is a really fun and great experience. And also it is the first Guybrush's adventure.\nYou will see Monkey Island humor everywhere.","February 10, 2014","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They're awesome!)\n\nSo the story of this game (Which is very well written) is that you are Guybrush Threepwood, a wannabe pirate. You must go on three trials to become a true pirate, once LeChuck, the evil ghost captain, hear's that Guybrush is in town and up to no good (Well, no good for him) he attempts to capture him, torture him and kill him. He also want's to marry SPOILERS Guybrush's girlfriend, Elaine.\n\nIt's very difficult to find a flaw with this game, it seems almost perfect. The only problem is that sometimes there's no music which can be just eerie and just doesn't feel nice, it's a very scary game in that sense.\n\nThe other thing is some puzzles are too hard and keep you trapped on them for sometimes weeks, but you could use the hint system to help you which is a helpful add on.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty good in my opinion and so is the music (If it's even there) and the sound effects, although scary they're superbly atmospheric and you won't get tired of them.\n\nAnother thing you won't get tired of is the adventure: It seemingly never becomes boring, it always feels interesting and enjoyable.\n\nAnd there are a HUGE amount of locations and now for my favourite part of the whole game... The sword fighting. But let me keep that a surprise. Let me just say, it's not sword fighting like how you'd imagine it.\n\nThe graphics are good too, especially with the special edition's effect.\n\nAnd the final verdict for The Secret Of Monkey Island: Special Edition is the highest verdict so far... A 9.5/10. The few flaws JUST deprive it of that beautiful and unachieved 10/10 but it's still an amazing game and it will forever hold a piece in my heart.\n\nUntil the next review! :)","November 8, 2014","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have to switch back to retro if you want to skip dialogue\n\n- The interface is worse in modern mode than in retro mode. In the original, you had all your commands and inventory on the screen so it was easy to issue commands and use your inventory. In modern mode, inventory and commands are hidden off screen, you can use your mouse wheel to scroll through a list of commands but that becomes tedious. Lets say you want to combine items in your inventory, first press 'I' on the keyboard, then scroll to the 'use' icon with your mouse wheel and click on the item, THEN press 'I' again to open up your inventory and then find the item you want to combine it with...... nothing modern about this at all. If you are going to modernize the graphics then you should atleast modernize the interface as well.\n\n- A lot of puzzles require needless backtracking that makee solving them a huge chore.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI know Secret of Monkey Island is sacred to most gamers. It was one of the best and most successful point and click adventure games of its time. I'm glad they remade this game that works reasonably well for modern computers, but if you are going to play this, stick to the original mode.","March 21","false","4.3"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

Might have been awesome back in the 90s but right now it's clunky, boring, tedious and full of redundant backtracking. Go to one end of the world to pick up something that requires you to go to the other end of the world where you pick up something that sends you to the other end. Repeat 100 times over. Forced myself to sit through that for a few hours and I don't think I can take it anymore S:\n\nEdit: managed to finish it. That’s 9 hours I’m not going to get back. The game is pretty cute but it’s an absolute waste of time. The stupid backtracking never stops and what could have been a 2 hour silly and amusing game ended up being a 9 hour chore for me. Towards the end I was absolutely rushing through it as fast as I could using maximum hints and it was still super tedious. I remember playing numerous point and click games back then when I was younger and I don’t remember any of them being as annoying – maybe cause I was much younger heh.","January 2","false","9.0"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","5","17","0","2"

Puzzles, story, and humor.\n\nBut today, they are so frustrating to play. I can recognize the artificial difficulty elements for what they are -- time wasters. A way to make a short game feel longer. Having to walk back and forth across Melee Island will make you tear your hair out in boredom. In this game, at least, the puzzles do make sense and can be solved with just a little trial and error.\n\nBut the control system in this new edition is poor. It's easier to switch to the classic view (F10) and select actions off the menu than it is to spin the mouse wheel and try to figure out what all the icons mean.\n\nI can't recommend Monkey Island for anyone except the most die-hard nostalgia seeker.","August 3, 2012","false","3.2"," 16 of 79 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","16","79","0","0"

I wrote this review from a clean slate based on the game itself with no background. So if you enjoy point and click adventures then this review wont be of any use to you.\n\nHaving never played a game of this style, I went in to this very optimistic. I wanted to enjoy a great story with casual gameplay. But I basically only got the casual gameplay. This game, while loved by many as a cult classic, didnt seem to offer a story that was in depth enough to justify its incredibly slow pace. I have played a few games of a similar style which were captivating enough that they kept me interested.\n\nThe secret of Monkey Island may have been good in its day. It is just really hard to get over the graphics if you are spoiled by todays engines. The story only lasted a few hours thanks to the slow pace your character travels. The jokes would be just enough to make you chuckle on occasion but nothing to LOL about. In fact, the whole plot seems like a dull joke in the end.\n\nI cant say I recommend this game because I was truly very dissapointed.

A wonderfully nostalgic experience. Playing it now as a more analytical adult, I was able to appreciate just how well designed & written this game really is. Very few modern adventure games come close to this kind of quality. So it’s good that in the remake Lucasarts kept all the puzzles, screens and dialogue unchanged. But they’ve enhanced the experience with perfectly cast recorded voices, fully re-recorded live music, gorgeous HD painted backgrounds, a fantastically updated interface and a useful hint system. The best feature though is the ability to “hotswap” at any time to and from the original version of the game!!\n\nIf I was to do a little nitpicking tho, they did cut a few corners: character close-ups had no mouth movement when they spoke; the walk animation cycle for all characters was too “floaty”; 3D character designs fall just short of blending nicely with the painted backgrounds; visual effects for water, lava and ghost movement are admittedly pretty, but look more like an iTunes visualiser than something fitting into the visual style of the game. It also would’ve been nice if there’d been an option to hotswap to the classic version but still hear the new voices and music.\n\nNone of these shortcomings seriously affected my enjoyment of the game tho.

You're the stupidest/best pirate around!\n\nQuite literally a dream come true for me, and I'm sure many others.\nSecret of Monkey Island, and LeChuck's Revenge, were a couple of the games that defined my childhood.\nMany hours as a kid were spent playing, and watching my sister play, as we tried to figure out the silly and sometimes ridiculous puzzles, to progress without the aid of guides, because the internet wasn't quite as available as it is these days.\nSo words can't express my happiness when these remakes kinda came out of nowhere!\n\nThe characters are all memorable, and the humour never gets old, and while the Special Edition remade graphics are great, sometimes you just can't beat the good old pixely memories of Lucas Arts adventures, so it's awesome that this version of the game(s) actually lets you switch between the two graphical styles at the simple press of a button!\nThe voice acting may seem a little jarring for those very familiar with the original games, but it's well done and not as out-of-place feeling as I thought it might be. But even that can be turned off if you're more of a reader, and/or don't like the voices!\n\nOverall, a VERY worthwhile investment for those looking for some nostalgia, but not just wanting to buy the same game again. This is not just a simple cash grab, it's very clear that time and effort went into this Special Edition (and the one for LeChuck's Revenge), and it kept me smiling from start to finish, just like it always used to.","January 7, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These games gave away very little of how you can proceed without prior consideration.\n\nIt's the tale of want-to-be pirate Guybrush Threepwood travels to Melee Island to seek his fortunes and become a pirate by completing the Three Trials. Unfortunately his timing is terrible and the pirates of the area are hiding out in the Scumm Bar to hide from the famed specter pirate Le Chuck. Guybrush proceeds to complete the Three Trials before the towns Governor is abducted and taken to a desolate location nobody wants to go to in fear of their lives. Guybrush assembles a team and travels to discover the Secret of Monkey Island and defeat Le Chuck.\n\nMonkey Island has spawned a culture in video games, with many people contributing to the game's world and adding elements and stories. While many of these stories are officially unofficial, the user base has been growing for a very long time now.\n\nLucasArts click adventures reminisce of my childhood. The Day of the Tentacle for example I have fond memories playing with my father in all black and white, colour, and with voices. Another game which is much longer has been re-released for Steam is Monkey Island. I remember fondly of receiving the original Monkey Island from my grandfather. Even though I never played this game with my grandfather, and he wasn't a gamer himself, I still remember the moment I received this game in its oversized box.\n\nLike DOTT, MI is a LucasArts click adventure built using SCUMM. It's a fun and exciting classic which has been remastered with modern graphics which you can switch to classic mode to play using the original game. The ability to switch to classic mode is an exceptional feature which not only makes the game easier to play but it plays exactly like the original.\n\nI highly recommend this game in classic mode, for those of us who have any appreciation for how games used to be, and for those of us who have watched games evolve to where they've come to. If you fall into this category, you'll truly love this game.","December 25, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes you have to think non-logically before something makes sense, but it all does, eventually! Power through, and you'll keep being rewarded with absurdity and dry humor that's still fresh more than 20 years later.\n\nIt's too bad the Special Edition interface was never updated to match the much superior sequel's, nor were the speech samples tightened up (they're full of long pauses and seem stilted), but it's still a good buy.

The new art style, while cool, lacks the charm of the original; the soundtrack on the other hand sounds incredible in its newly remastered state.\n\nThis game is largely great, my only beef with it is that the cursor is not as clear as it could be, and makes scrolling between scenes difficult sometimes (most noticable in the Scumm bar itself); but as this is hardly a game that relies on reflex it doesn't really detract from the experience at all.\n\nTL:DR - if you haven't played this game before then get it; if you are a fan of the series then get this game if you'd like to play it through steam or weren't a fan of the original graphics.","December 8, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/32360/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition is a 2009 remake of the original point and click adventure game which was made back in 1990.\n\nStorywise, nothing has changed from the original, and after close to 20 years, it is still as funny and witty as ever. It certainly was very nostalgic to replay it again with enhanced visuals and music + voice acting. The story alone is worth 9.5 / 10. As i have played thru the game before, it took me about 4 hours to complete the game. For someone who is new to this game, it will probably take close to 15 hours or more depending on how fast they can solve the puzzles.\n\nAs this is a remake the graphics have certainly been ramped up from the original, although i felt that the modern look looks dated as compared to latest current adventure games. Its nice though that they have included the function to switch between 2009 and original audiovisuals at will.\n\nThe original verb commands UI was removed and replaced with 3 alternate input methods, firstly using scroll wheel to select action, secondly using hotkeys, thirdly using a single hotkey to display the list of verbs. Even though there were 3 different methods, they all still felt clunky as i thought it would have been better if they had used the UI that was used in another older Lucasarts game "Full Throttle".\n\nOther downsides include mouse clicks being quite unresponsive when clicking on options and no way to have modern voice acting with the original visuals, no additional extra bonus materials. None of these however, really matter much as this is a classic game that deserves its place among the greatest PC games of all time.\n\nOverall Rating: 8.5 / 10\nA refreshing remake, although slightly marred by unresponsive mouse controls. Feel free to add more points if that does not bother you. Veteran gamers will definitely appreciate the nostalgia and newer gamers can have a chance to experience one of the earliest classics in PC gaming history.","May 25, 2013","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A classic that holds up. It isn't immune from the fridge-logic or arbitrary only-the-designer-would-actually-solve-this-without-some-tiral-and-error puzzles seen in pretty much every adventure game. But it has so much humor and cleverness to it that I was able to forgive the game's shortcommings. It also has, easily, the best sword-fighting mechanic in any game I've played.\n\nIf you don't like point-and-clicks, this might not convert you because it does not fix the genre's greatest problems. Nonetheless, if you are to try only one adventure game I would recommend Monkey Island or Broken Sword--both have excellent writting and are much more logically grounded that most adventure games I've palyed (though in Monkey Island's case, that doens't mean the same thing it does in Broken Sword's as some degree of absurdity is inherent in Monkey Island's world, it's just that Monkey Island is more internally consistent with it's absurdity than it's cohorts).\n\nThe special edition is also particularly fabulous. The voicework is delightful, the artwork lovely, and every detail preserved. Hot-swapping between classic and special edition modes is impresssive; the team was clearly dedicated to preserving the game while also making it more accessible to newcomers. Especially since the entirety of the original game is included within it, this is the definitive edition of Monkey Island.","July 17, 2012","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great writing, really funny and a fantastic adventure with silly and clever puzzles. Today, perhaps adventure games like these are a little outdated. But this remake is well worth it, if you enjoy the series. In many ways, the first Monkey Island is the best game, and now you can enjoy it fully voice casted, with improved artistic graphics and music.\nAnd if you don't like that, you can easily swap back to the original version as well.\n\nPerhaps mostly suited to people who know and enjoy the series, but the game is good enough for people who have not tried it before and want to try a really funny and great adventure.

A wonderfully nostalgic experience. Playing it now as a more analytical adult, I was able to appreciate just how well designed & written this game really is. Very few modern adventure games come close to this kind of quality. So it’s good that in the remake Lucasarts kept all the puzzles, screens and dialogue unchanged. But they’ve enhanced the experience with perfectly cast recorded voices, fully re-recorded live music, gorgeous HD painted backgrounds, a fantastically updated interface and a useful hint system. The best feature though is the ability to “hotswap” at any time to and from the original version of the game!!\n\nIf I was to do a little nitpicking tho, they did cut a few corners: character close-ups had no mouth movement when they spoke; the walk animation cycle for all characters was too “floaty”; 3D character designs fall just short of blending nicely with the painted backgrounds; visual effects for water, lava and ghost movement are admittedly pretty, but look more like an iTunes visualiser than something fitting into the visual style of the game. It also would’ve been nice if there’d been an option to hotswap to the classic version but still hear the new voices and music.\n\nNone of these shortcomings seriously affected my enjoyment of the game tho.  All the awesomeness is still firmly there!","June 5, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyways this game is unrelated to those franchises minus the in jokes and references to the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies made through out the game. Monkey Island was an early example of computer games that interpet humor into the plot which will become a common genre for computer game in the following years. The story of Monkey island revolves on Guybrush Threepwood, a guy who is dead bent in becoming a pirate. He goes through tests set up by the more professional pirates to prove his own worth but along the way of his quest he encounters Elaine Marley, a beautiful governess who is targetted by LeChuck an undead pirate ghost who wants Elaine as his wife. A goal Guybrush will be sure will never be accomplished not when the love for Elaine burns brightly within him. The game is a combination of Monty Python & Mel Brooks comedies with a dash of Pirates of the Carribean. Which leads to a highly entertaining and memorible game that will satisfy anyone thirsty for adventure and humor in one package. A must buy game.","July 18, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That might sound like faint praise, but considering that I first played the original edition around 24 years ago and it was distributed on floppy disks, it's actually a testament to how good the game was.\n\nFor the positives, the updated graphics, story, and humor are pretty nice.  It's also nice that you can't really mess things up so bad that you need to load a saved game.  Saves, for the most part, are there just because you might want to stop playing for a while and come back later.\n\nUnfortunately, there are negatives.  The biggest is that a lot of the game is hunt-the-pixel.  Many of the items that you need to find/work with are fairly obvious in the environment.  But, many others are essentially indistinguishable from the background (a couple of planks especially spring to mind as well as the maps):  if you don't happen to mouse over the correct pixel, you'd never know you can do something there.  The "verb" and inventory system, though ground-breaking back in 1990 is a bit awkward today (I'm playing Monkey Island 2 right now, and they fixed this there).  Also, because the cut-scenes and dialogs are not skippable, the pacing drags.  Similarly to the hunt-the-pixel issue, in many cases you don't know that you can walk off the screen and get to another area.  And, finally, the introductory and ending credits are non-skippable.  There's nothing you can do about the introductory credits, and the only way I was able to quit the game during the ending credits was to Alt-Tab out and close the window from the desktop.\n\nSo, yes.  Pluses and minuses.  It's a shame I can't say the game is better than OK (it was tremendous in its day).  But, if you can buy it cheap enough, its current rendition is a good way to spend about 10 hours.","January 20, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm sure the Special Edition is a thankful graphics update for many but I can't NOT play this in Classic mode (press F10 at any time to toggle between the two).\n\nThe jokes aren't quite as funny to me 25 years later and the way they've aged depresses me slightly, like the pirate who is a lampshaded advertisement for Loom or the Used Boat Salesman who tries to sell you on rack-and-pinion steering in a throwaway gag.\n\nHowever the one part that still entertains me thoroughly is the Sword Fighting system while you learn to beat the Sword Master. I can't help but feel that was a stroke of genius.\n\nI remember finding the story to be a lot of fun as a child and it's kind of funny how it's almost come full circle, culturally. This game was based on a combination of the Pirates of the Carribean theme park ride and Tim Powers' On Stranger Tides. Then along came the movie series based on the same ride and same book. I would fear a baleful fit of, "Get off my lawn!" if someone born after the 1990s were to innocently draw a comparison.  I think despite that, this would be a great gift for the younger members of my family.\n\nPros:  Kid-friendly, fun story and a LucasArts classic\nCons: It's no spring chicken, even if it has a pulley-in-the-middle.","September 21, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this remake is well worth it, if you enjoy the series. In many ways, the first Monkey Island is the best game, and now you can enjoy it fully voice casted, with improved artistic graphics and music.\nAnd if you don't like that, you can easily swap back to the original version as well.\n\nPerhaps mostly suited to people who know and enjoy the series, but the game is good enough for people who have not tried it before and want to try a really funny and great adventure. Probably one of the better adventure games ever made, with a great style and atmosphere.","December 26, 2013","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That might sound like faint praise, but considering that I first played the original edition around 24 years ago and it was distributed on floppy disks, it's actually a testament to how good the game was.\n\nFor the positives, the updated graphics, story, and humor are pretty nice.  It's also nice that you can't really mess things up so bad that you need to load a saved game.  Saves, for the most part, are there just because you might want to stop playing for a while and come back later.\n\nUnfortunately, there are negatives.  The biggest is that a lot of the game is hunt-the-pixel.  Many of the items that you need to find/work with are fairly obvious in the environment.  But, many others are essentially indistinguishable from the background (a couple of planks especially spring to mind as well as the maps):  if you don't happen to mouse over the correct pixel, you'd never know you can do something there.  The "verb" and inventory system, though ground-breaking back in 1990 is a bit awkward today (I'm playing Monkey Island 2 right now, and they fixed this there).  Also, because the cut-scenes and dialogs are not skippable, the pacing drags.  Similarly to the hunt-the-pixel issue, in many cases you don't know that you can walk off the screen and get to another area.  And, finally, the introductory and ending credits are non-skippable.  There's nothing you can do about the introductory credits, and the only way I was able to quit the game during the ending credits was to Alt-Tab out and close the window from the desktop.\n\nSo, yes.  Pluses and minuses.  It's a shame I can't say the game is better than OK (it was tremendous in its day).  But, if you can buy it cheap enough, its current rendition is a good way to spend about 10 hours.","January 20, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But they’ve enhanced the experience with perfectly cast recorded voices, fully re-recorded live music, gorgeous HD painted backgrounds, a fantastically updated interface and a useful hint system. The best feature though is the ability to “hotswap” at any time to and from the original version of the game!!\n\nIf I was to do a little nitpicking tho, they did cut a few corners: character close-ups had no mouth movement when they spoke; the walk animation cycle for all characters was too “floaty”; 3D character designs fall just short of blending nicely with the painted backgrounds; visual effects for water, lava and ghost movement are admittedly pretty, but look more like an iTunes visualiser than something fitting into the visual style of the game. It also would’ve been nice if there’d been an option to hotswap to the classic version but still hear the new voices and music.\n\nNone of these shortcomings seriously affected my enjoyment of the game tho.  All the awesomeness is still firmly there!","June 5, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're the stupidest/best pirate around!\n\nQuite literally a dream come true for me, and I'm sure many others.\nSecret of Monkey Island, and LeChuck's Revenge, were a couple of the games that defined my childhood.\nMany hours as a kid were spent playing, and watching my sister play, as we tried to figure out the silly and sometimes ridiculous puzzles, to progress without the aid of guides, because the internet wasn't quite as available as it is these days.\nSo words can't express my happiness when these remakes kinda came out of nowhere!\n\nThe characters are all memorable, and the humour never gets old, and while the Special Edition remade graphics are great, sometimes you just can't beat the good old pixely memories of Lucas Arts adventures, so it's awesome that this version of the game(s) actually lets you switch between the two graphical styles at the simple press of a button!\nThe voice acting may seem a little jarring for those very familiar with the original games, but it's well done and not as out-of-place feeling as I thought it might be. But even that can be turned off if you're more of a reader, and/or don't like the voices!\n\nOverall, a VERY worthwhile investment for those looking for some nostalgia, but not just wanting to buy the same game again. This is not just a simple cash grab, it's very clear that time and effort went into this Special Edition (and the one for LeChuck's Revenge), and it kept me smiling from start to finish, just like it always used to.","January 7, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beleave it or not , pirates owes almost all its sucess to Monkey Island.  The original version of the script was actually a script for a movie based on teh first game The Secret of Monkey Island.\n\nLet me paint a picture for you.\n\nGuybrush Threepwood,  A tall lanky man in a white shirt and brown pants with light brown hair and a ponytail, the un experianced hero of our story who has to save the governor from the evil ghost pirate Lechuck.  sound farmiliar, it's none other than Will Turners direct inspiration.\n\nElane Marley, The Female Governor of Melee island, early on she is captured by the undead pirate Lechuck.  Sound Farmiliar THAT's RIGHT, its Elizebeth Swan's inspiration, Elizibeth being the governors daughter instead of the governor and ofcourse also being captured by an undead pirate, this time named Barbosa.\n\nThis leads us to Captain Lechuck, an evil ghost Pirate (who would later become a zombie and demon as he was killed off and ressurected)  who leads a crew of skeleton pirates and docks his ghost ship underneath a secret island called Monkey Island.\n\nMonkey Island itself was ripped off by the movie in their secret island that held cortezes gold.\n\nThe onyl anomaly is Captain Jack Sparrow, who was clearly added to the story as it evolved from Monkey Island into Pirates of the Carabian.\n\nTo fans of the game series this was very dissapointing and there are many many other heavy inspirations bordering on complete rip offs in pirates taken directly from monkey island.  The vodoo lady as teh vodoo lady, captain norrington as inspector from MI:1, the two goofy ghost pirates as BOB, theres even a reference to Murray(MI) in the form of a disembodiesd talking skull. amoung others.  I really wish they had kept it as a monkey island movie, even if they still wanted to brand it as their pirates of the carabian but kept the monkey island story intact.  But one can easily understand why they chose not to brand it after an old series of Lucas arts games from teh 90s, copywright not withstanding.\n\nHowever it woudl have been nice of disney to atleast TRY to change the story a bit and TRY to hide the fact that they directly ripped off Monkey Island,  atleast give credit where it is due.  Ofcourse the movie could also be seen as an homage to the game series, but never mentioning it in the credits somwhere proves they were attempting to hide that fact.\n\nIf you like pirates the movie or pirates in general than you owe it to yourself to check out the best pirate themed game series ever created, and the story that was so good it was borderline infringed upon by disney for their mega blockbuster.","June 20, 2015","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Original was released in 1990 and this special edition is the old game with new looks (nice) and new interface (clunky). As a bonus the classic mode is available which is basically the '90s original.\n\nMonkey Island is a well known classic, it was a great game more than 2 decades ago and it is a good game now. As with all oldskool adventure games you have to be prepared for some pixel hunting and illogical puzzles, fortunately not that often and also walkthroughs.\n\nVISUALS\n\nThe new look is quite nice and cartoony and also the classic mode, while not as nice, looks pretty charming. The characters look very differently, so you will want to check both SE and classic mode on close ups, just to compare.\n\nAUDIO\n\nThe lively pirate'y background music is ok, but can get repetitive. The sound effects can drive a person insane though, especially the crying cook was painful to the ears. The voice acting is very nice and fitting. The classic mode is devoid of voice acting and sound effects, and is mostly silent.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThis is you basic classic point and click oldskool adventure stuff. With the good and bad. Some puzzles can be... tricky. Need a key for closed door? Sure, just look in cereals. Fortunately most things are quite logical and can be solved. Sooner or later. I have to admit I did check a walkthrough once in a while, but I'm just not good with classic adventures.\n\nI have to say that for the 6 hours it took me to finish it I had fun. If you like adventure games you should get it, it's good AND it's a classic.\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island SE Random Game Footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/nApsmCYVzRI","October 10, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't say that I'm a fan of the new animation, but some of the background scenery is pleasing and the voice acting is great. The new interface makes sense, but, again, I prefer the classic approach.\n\nThat brings me to my favorite feature of this version: The ability to switch between the new and old versions in real-time. I spent most of my time playing in the classic mode, but did enjoy switching over to the new to hear some of my most fondly remembered scenes brought to life with the voice acting.\n\nSo, if you enjoyed the original, you'll definitely want to pick this up. If you've never played or heard of the game, it's a humorous and well-written game with an enjoyable storyline.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/32360/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","The Secret of Monkey Island SE brings a remade version of the classic point and click adventure game that is sure to please both new players and old fans alike. The core essentials of the game are left intact, with technical limitations of the older game being redone and upgraded to take advantage of modern computers.\n\nGameplay of Monkey Island is a point and click adventure, much like other PC titles in the 90s. Players move around, interact using certain actions, and can pick up and use multiple items for an action. In this remade version, the verb and inventory screens are hidden away by a keypress, allowing full use of the screen for the graphics. This does mean that trying to do certain actions is can be clunkier having to bring up the menu and pick the right option, but it doesn’t detract from the experience too badly. Puzzles are an integral part of adventure games, and this game does throw some interesting ones. Some puzzles are pretty obvious, while some others can be nonsensical, fitting with the game’s theme. At times knowing where to go or how to solve a puzzle can be daunting, but the remake luckily features a hint system to help guide players. The hint system works almost too well if overused, so try to use it at a minimum to enjoy solving and finding out things.  Inserted into the game is the ability to switch between Classic and Remake versions on the fly with a single button press, which changes the graphics, music, and UI. Overall, gameplay is fun and engaging even though some puzzles can be confusing or have strange solutions, since the hint system keeps things in check and helps players keep moving forward rather than being unable to solve a certain part.\n\nThe game’s art and music received the most attention in the remake, and it shows. The art designs have a huge change in quality, being high resolution cartoony graphics much like recent Monkey Island games. The cartoony style does feel different from the older pixelated realism style along with the animations being almost one to one with the original limited animation, but it does evoke a certain unique style in the spirit of the original. The music also has a huge overhaul, with the MIDI songs from the original having been redone with a real instruments in a live band. All of these remake additions can be changed back to the originals with a single button press, where the game instantly changes the art and music with a smooth transition. The redone art and music does a fantastic job of keeping things up to date and in high quality, staying very true to the source with the option to run with the original game content if so desired.\n\nThe story in The Secret of Monkey Island is fairly simple. You control Guybrush Threepwood, who wants to be a pirate. His actions bring the attention of several other characters that become the main focus of the game’s story.  It’s not an amazing story, but Monkey Island really shines in delivering its comedy. Characters are vibrant with unique traits, and the variety of odd items and silly lines makes for a fun experience. This is the charm of the game with less serious and more humorous things being the deciding concept of the game. The remake brings recorded voiceovers as well, which really helps to bring out each character with their own personality. Monkey Island brings both humor and unique characters with a straightforward story focused on making players have fun and laugh.\n\nMonkey Island SE is a point and click adventure for everyone with nicely redone visual and audio design, hints for new players, and new features like voiceovers and Classic mode switch. The core game is basically the original Secret of Monkey Island, but the additions in the remake make the Special Edition a definitive choice to play for new and old players.","February 28","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The puzzles are logical for the most of them if you have general knowledge. There is a how to play and a hint system, it sounds cheap, but it helps the game so much comparing to go over the internet to find what to do. It keeps the player in the game and beat Grim just by this fact; First use of the hint give you a lil help and the second use give you the full answer (maybe too much).\n\nI still looking for a point and click with many logical possibilities to advance instead of one which may help the flow. there is still some stuff you can miss by the order you do the things to advance which is not a bad thing cause it add replay value. The big positive is that the game is funny as hell and must play for point and click players.\n\nAnd Root Beer is da best","March 28","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hadn't ever played it, but I was already familiar with the Monkey Island series :).\n\nThe first I actually played was MI 3 (there's at least 4 of them to my knowledge).\n\nI can vaguely remember seeing bits of MI 2, and thought it was really awesome, so I'd most definitely recommend getting the pack (The Secret of Monkey Island + Monkey Island 2 - special edition).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nThe best thing about Monkey Island is it's wacky & silly sense of humour. I just love this stuff. It's not meant to be taken seriously!\n\nIf it wasn't for the built-in hints system, I most probably would have been stuck (especially near the end). I really was clueless as to how to proceed at one point, due to experiencing issues with pointing & clicking (which was rather frustrating, since this is a P&C game after all!).\n\nSo when that's a bit "off"... well, it definitely doesn't want to keep you going (which made me rely on the hints-system, more than I normally would have).\n\nBut considering it's old age, it really is a quality game, and well worth the money!\n\nIt's beauty lies in it's simplicity and lighthearted nature :). The story is very straightforward & ridiculously basic.\n\n[...young guy wants to be a pirate, ...goes off on a journey to become one, ...meets a girl on the way, ...they instantly fall in love (literally!), ...she gets in trouble, ...he faces the bad guy who got her in trouble & gets rid of him and then the lovebirds sail off together] :)\n\nThis is excellent for when you want to play something different for a change, where you're not expected to think too realistically and just have a good laugh.\n\nI needed some time to grow accustomed to the graphics, but after playing a while, I became fond of the style (especially the way Guybrush was portrayed). They definitely captured his spirit visually!\n\nAlso, there's a neat option that let's you switch from the "vintage" pixelated style to the remastered style by pressing F10 (it even helped me find something I couldn't see in the remastered version - go figure!).\n\nThe voice-acting is very well executed! Apparently the voice-actors each covered more than one character and I couldn't tell! And when you can't tell, guess what? That means they're really acting!\n\nAnd as for the music, the main theme is very catchy and fits the atmosphere perfectly. Same goes for the in-game soundtracks - very fitting!\n\nOnce you hear the OST, it's very hard to get it out of your head :).\n\nLastly, some of the subcharacters could definitely want you coming back for more :), they're just so much fun.\n\nPS I'm especially fond of Carla & Otis :). If you ever decide on playing the game, you'll soon figure out why ;).","January 9","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Original was released in 1990 and this special edition is the old game with new looks (nice) and new interface (clunky). As a bonus the classic mode is available which is basically the '90s original.\n\nMonkey Island is a well known classic, it was a great game more than 2 decades ago and it is a good game now. As with all oldskool adventure games you have to be prepared for some pixel hunting and illogical puzzles, fortunately not that often and also walkthroughs.\n\nVISUALS\n\nThe new look is quite nice and cartoony and also the classic mode, while not as nice, looks pretty charming. The characters look very differently, so you will want to check both SE and classic mode on close ups, just to compare.\n\nAUDIO\n\nThe lively pirate'y background music is ok, but can get repetitive. The sound effects can drive a person insane though, especially the crying cook was painful to the ears. The voice acting is very nice and fitting. The classic mode is devoid of voice acting and sound effects, and is mostly silent.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThis is you basic classic point and click oldskool adventure stuff. With the good and bad. Some puzzles can be... tricky. Need a key for closed door? Sure, just look in cereals. Fortunately most things are quite logical and can be solved. Sooner or later.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/32360/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","The Secret of Monkey Island SE brings a remade version of the classic point and click adventure game that is sure to please both new players and old fans alike. The core essentials of the game are left intact, with technical limitations of the older game being redone and upgraded to take advantage of modern computers.\n\nGameplay of Monkey Island is a point and click adventure, much like other PC titles in the 90s. Players move around, interact using certain actions, and can pick up and use multiple items for an action. In this remade version, the verb and inventory screens are hidden away by a keypress, allowing full use of the screen for the graphics. This does mean that trying to do certain actions is can be clunkier having to bring up the menu and pick the right option, but it doesn’t detract from the experience too badly. Puzzles are an integral part of adventure games, and this game does throw some interesting ones. Some puzzles are pretty obvious, while some others can be nonsensical, fitting with the game’s theme. At times knowing where to go or how to solve a puzzle can be daunting, but the remake luckily features a hint system to help guide players. The hint system works almost too well if overused, so try to use it at a minimum to enjoy solving and finding out things.  Inserted into the game is the ability to switch between Classic and Remake versions on the fly with a single button press, which changes the graphics, music, and UI. Overall, gameplay is fun and engaging even though some puzzles can be confusing or have strange solutions, since the hint system keeps things in check and helps players keep moving forward rather than being unable to solve a certain part.\n\nThe game’s art and music received the most attention in the remake, and it shows. The art designs have a huge change in quality, being high resolution cartoony graphics much like recent Monkey Island games. The cartoony style does feel different from the older pixelated realism style along with the animations being almost one to one with the original limited animation, but it does evoke a certain unique style in the spirit of the original. The music also has a huge overhaul, with the MIDI songs from the original having been redone with a real instruments in a live band. All of these remake additions can be changed back to the originals with a single button press, where the game instantly changes the art and music with a smooth transition. The redone art and music does a fantastic job of keeping things up to date and in high quality, staying very true to the source with the option to run with the original game content if so desired.\n\nThe story in The Secret of Monkey Island is fairly simple. You control Guybrush Threepwood, who wants to be a pirate. His actions bring the attention of several other characters that become the main focus of the game’s story.  It’s not an amazing story, but Monkey Island really shines in delivering its comedy. Characters are vibrant with unique traits, and the variety of odd items and silly lines makes for a fun experience. This is the charm of the game with less serious and more humorous things being the deciding concept of the game. The remake brings recorded voiceovers as well, which really helps to bring out each character with their own personality. Monkey Island brings both humor and unique characters with a straightforward story focused on making players have fun and laugh.\n\nMonkey Island SE is a point and click adventure for everyone with nicely redone visual and audio design, hints for new players, and new features like voiceovers and Classic mode switch. The core game is basically the original Secret of Monkey Island, but the additions in the remake make the Special Edition a definitive choice to play for new and old players.","February 28","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The puzzles are logical for the most of them if you have general knowledge. There is a how to play and a hint system, it sounds cheap, but it helps the game so much comparing to go over the internet to find what to do. It keeps the player in the game and beat Grim just by this fact; First use of the hint give you a lil help and the second use give you the full answer (maybe too much).\n\nI still looking for a point and click with many logical possibilities to advance instead of one which may help the flow. there is still some stuff you can miss by the order you do the things to advance which is not a bad thing cause it add replay value. The big positive is that the game is funny as hell and must play for point and click players.\n\nAnd Root Beer is da best","March 28","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hadn't ever played it, but I was already familiar with the Monkey Island series :).\n\nThe first I actually played was MI 3 (there's at least 4 of them to my knowledge).\n\nI can vaguely remember seeing bits of MI 2, and thought it was really awesome, so I'd most definitely recommend getting the pack (The Secret of Monkey Island + Monkey Island 2 - special edition).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nThe best thing about Monkey Island is it's wacky & silly sense of humour. I just love this stuff. It's not meant to be taken seriously!\n\nIf it wasn't for the built-in hints system, I most probably would have been stuck (especially near the end). I really was clueless as to how to proceed at one point, due to experiencing issues with pointing & clicking (which was rather frustrating, since this is a P&C game after all!).\n\nSo when that's a bit "off"... well, it definitely doesn't want to keep you going (which made me rely on the hints-system, more than I normally would have).\n\nBut considering it's old age, it really is a quality game, and well worth the money!\n\nIt's beauty lies in it's simplicity and lighthearted nature :). The story is very straightforward & ridiculously basic.\n\n[...young guy wants to be a pirate, ...goes off on a journey to become one, ...meets a girl on the way, ...they instantly fall in love (literally!), ...she gets in trouble, ...he faces the bad guy who got her in trouble & gets rid of him and then the lovebirds sail off together] :)\n\nThis is excellent for when you want to play something different for a change, where you're not expected to think too realistically and just have a good laugh.\n\nI needed some time to grow accustomed to the graphics, but after playing a while, I became fond of the style (especially the way Guybrush was portrayed). They definitely captured his spirit visually!\n\nAlso, there's a neat option that let's you switch from the "vintage" pixelated style to the remastered style by pressing F10 (it even helped me find something I couldn't see in the remastered version - go figure!).\n\nThe voice-acting is very well executed! Apparently the voice-actors each covered more than one character and I couldn't tell! And when you can't tell, guess what? That means they're really acting!\n\nAnd as for the music, the main theme is very catchy and fits the atmosphere perfectly. Same goes for the in-game soundtracks - very fitting!\n\nOnce you hear the OST, it's very hard to get it out of your head :).\n\nLastly, some of the subcharacters could definitely want you coming back for more :), they're just so much fun.\n\nPS I'm especially fond of Carla & Otis :). If you ever decide on playing the game, you'll soon figure out why ;).","January 9","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wit.\n\nThis remake is a lovingly re-creation of the original, that adds fantastic artwork and lively voice acting that feels perfectly in-keeping with the originals theme. The only character I think looks worse is Guybrush. He looks quite weedy in this rendition. You can really see the difference in the last shot, where you see his face in the old version.\n\nI have to admit that I preferred the IOS version of this game though. The UI on the PC feels much more clunky, often having to open two menu's to do something (verb menu and item menu) and it feels like a step back from the original's slightly more intuitive interface.\n\nAfter completing Monkey Island three times, including the original back in the day, I clearly have strong nostalgia with this title. But even after three times, some of the puzzles still feel pretty random or have flaky logic.\n\nStill a classic. 7/10","January 27","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're a wannabe pirate in this game who need to solve different trials to be accepted by the pirate community. The game is filled with a huge amount of humour, sometimes challenging puzzles (I have to admit, I even needed to check a walkthrough 2x). Even though it's the remastered edition with the ability to switch between the old and the new graphics and enjoyed the traditional look more.\nThere are very interesting characters: Stan the ship dealer, Le Chuck, the Sword master, the old man from the shop... Sometimes the characters even criticise themselves when you try to figure out something by "brute force" with trying out every item from your inventory :D.\nI found quite some references and similarities in other games. It's no wonder that it has such influence for later generation games.","January 4","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An absolutely classic game in what is an actually top-notch remasterization. The graphics look colorful and fun and respect those of the original, together with quality voice acting (Same as Curse of Monkey Island), as well as a new soundtrack (which sounds great and totally honors the original), and well...the game is just ALL there! But wait, maybe you're not one to really like remakes...well no problem! You can just change between the original and modern version just by tapping a key, and get the original graphics, menu and even music (the CD version). Want to see how cutscenes play out in either version? No problem! Both versions sync up, so you can just change on the fly, back and forth, and the transition is smooth and seamless. The only downsides i can think of are that you have no onscreen actions menu, you just tap keys for the functions that you want, or left/right-click on any object for basic actions (like look or talkt to), to the point some puzzles are better solved in the original version. Other than that, maybe, for purists, the graphics are more cartoony, specially the characters, which stands in stark contrast to the realistic character portraits from the original version. Not a big problem, really, but purists may prefer HD remasters of those instead of mere redesigns. Still, a fantastic Special Edition, and a most recommended purchase! 9/10","February 21","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

LucasArts helped define adventure gaming with the original Secret of Monkry Island, and it's stood the test of time since the remake has made it possible to keep on newer machines. That being said, I did not play this before the remake and I think the lack of nostaglia has made this game somehow less exciting for me than I had hoped for after years of hearing about it. The gameplay mechanics are tiresome, the story is pretty one-dimensional, and it's never going to crack my top 10 point-and-clicks of all time... but it's certainly worth having in your library if you see it on sale as a fun retroscpective on the genre.\n\nTL;DR worth it on sale as a throwback, but don't let the hype you may have heard set your bar so high that it can't reach it.","June 2","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
