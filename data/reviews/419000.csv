It's a fun game that requires logic, not quick reflexes. You just need to figure out how to get the pieces so that they will go to the desired places when you press the button. I've played for 3 hours now and I'm about halfway through the second stage (there are three) with a couple of the hardest ones on stage one still unsolved. So far, there have been a couple of puzzles where you need to move quick to get out of the way, but usually you can just stay on the button and observe how the pieces move. If you don't get it right, you can replay the puzzle normally or in shadow mode where you can see your previous setup to help figure out what went wrong.\n\nI prefer to play with a controller and the button mapping in this game is strange. A is cancel and B does the actions. Took me a while to realize that the controller does work once you find the right buttons. Also the difficulty levels aren't quite correct in my opinion. Some marked Normal are actually fairly tricky, whereas some marked Hard are not at all hard. However, that could be because I find it easier to solve hard puzzles with fewer pieces than normal puzzles with a lot of moving pieces. You usually have access to more than one puzzle at a time, so if you get stuck, just try another puzzle and come back later.","November 30, 2015","true","11.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

I've always enjoyed games like Sokoban, so this was a pleasant surprise. The magnet aspect makes it especially interesting.\n\nMy one complaint is that there's no way to cancel out of the level selection screen, for some reason.","November 29, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I can solve every puzzle I can reach, with the best score, I just can't manage the timing on an incredibly easy level. Very annoying.\n\nWhat takes this from an annoyance to a negative review is that I'm required to pass that level. I can literally do nothing else until it's finished: it doesn't matter that I've got 3 stars on every other accessible level or that I know how to solve it... I can't skip it and I'm done with attempting to fluke the perfect timing needed to finish the level, so that's it. The only thing left is to uninstall the game, dump it in the dark recesses of my game library and forget it exists...","February 21","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
