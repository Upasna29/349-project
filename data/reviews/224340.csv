Well, technically, it is, but isn't just not about finishing laps. There's some variety in it (killing enemies and carjacking, for example), which fit the movies if you think about it but the execution is terrible and is exactly what you would expect from a mobile game just a few years ago. It's very unpolished.\n\nThe AI is either incredibly stupid or 'smart'. There's no inbetween. Checkpoints are very rare and if you do have to restart there's no way to skip the ridiculous intros.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty good and the character models do look like the characters from the movies (in a way) but it's not enough to make this a good game.\n\nI was glad I finished it in just a couple of hours. Any longer and I would've thrown my controller into the screen. Avoid.\n\n[Rating: 42/100]","April 11, 2014","false","4.8"," 313 of 350 people (89%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","89","313","350","42","2"

But just like the awesome movies will you want to play the game ? In Fast And Furious Showdown you play as many charecters that appeared in the previous movies like Brian, Tej, Han etc. So how is the game ? The game is absolute garbage and the its one of the worst games i have played period. But first for the story. This takes place over the course of 5 and 6 with a bunch scenes explaing what happend in those movies, but the story is so confusing you will walk away more confused that anything. So how is the gameplay ? Its so horrible its not funny. The cars handle like complete ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and its hard to win a race when the car barely goes where you want to. The game is riddled with bugs. In Chapter 4 the game crashed constantly and i had to use a diffrent computer to get past the level. The game also looks like complete garbage. It looks like a very early PS2 game. Overall Fast And Furious Showdown is a mess of a game and im dissapointed that i bought it and i could have saved my money. I give Fast and Furious Showdown a 2/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 27, 2014","false","8.0"," 59 of 78 people (76%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","76","59","78","12","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/224340/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","This game is supposed to suck, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  One of my favorite things to do was car customization and like in the movies make it look as obnoxious as possible.   This added to my enjoyment of the game since I could quit out of any new mission cranking the cars doosh dial to over four popped collars, then completing it in all its blazing glory.  Everyone seems to hate this game including one review I read online judging the game solely on its Hip Hop and Rap music, saying the game had "dreary music reminiscent of a primitive time."  The games soundtrack isnt that bad, not to mention for people who hate rap and hip hop they can just turn off the music while keeping the sound on.  But why do that?  Dont be like that critic strumming his neckbeard to Beethoven's fifth.  Didnt that neckbeard know that the original notations for the metronome exist on Beethovens works?  Because he was the FIRST coposer to use the metronome, and believe me that ish made Beethoven the Fast and Furious of the OG musical composers who truly do kick it old skool.  The more you know ----=====*\n\nThe game is fun with its ridiculous ideas, one of them involves two cars driving away with a bank vault, which is probably alot better than listening to Bain whine about his thermal drill.  There are also these drift race point battles, that are kinda pointless since there is a multiplier so whoever is in first place wins, so its basically just a race with very little to do with drifting.  The settings for the game take place all over the world, from Mexico, to Buenos Aires, to right on the front steps of red square which is amusing since you drive around flipping over peoples cars, this must be normal in Russia I guess.  Races have different challenges which can be fun to complete though two were impossible I felt, one is where you fly through Hong Kong and not hit any cars, yea good luck with going through intersections and all that unscathed.  Another is where you are on an airstrip in Siberia, and are supposed to follow some jerk in a truck.  Only hes the biggest jerk in the world and just drives off leaving everyone else behind and if your not perfect you cant even keep up with him let alone complete the silly challenge of following in his draft for 1000 feet.  In many levels you can drive or shoot things, its fun mixing it up or doing one only the whole race and see if you can make it.  We need more games where we drive around shooting things, there really arent that many sadly.  Most racing games are just plain old easy peasy racers, push a button go fast, been there, done that, and it gets old, so this game mixes it up.\n\nThe AI sucks at times and can go full FUBAR such as when stealing that vault, the other computer controlled driver will just stop playing and not move.  As if they got bored and leave the room, I only saw this once but other missions kinda had the driver go crazy now and then.  This game is Co-Op on consoles, for some reason on PC there is no co-op which sucks, but since noone plays this game I guess it doesnt matter.  But this game would be really fun if it did work online.  The helicopter missions are boring... You fly around on rails and just blow stuff up, its kinda fun, but not that fun.  There is bonus content showcasing a bunch of movie stills, the concept art is amusing, it all looks like it belongs on an edgy trapper keeper from the 1980's.  Biggest downer is that Riddick isnt in this game, guess he knows not to just sign his image over to some movie-game tie-in, being a gamer, Riddick knew those things usually dont end well.\n\nEvery character in the game from the movies is named wrong, such as it will say the girls name Letty over the guy Shaw's picture.  Pretty sure their all messed up that way which is weird thats kind of the first thing they shoulda noticed was wrong since everytime they would test a track its RIGHT there, and I checked the credits, there is a WHOLE list of QA and testers, and noone saw this?  I mean I get some names are unisex like Tej, but girls names over guys heads.  I never even saw the movies but I am pretty sure Jason is a guys name and I can google who the people are from the movies in 2 secs.  Did they just get a list of names of characters from the series with no clue who they actually were to match them up correctly?  Oh its funneh... funnier over drinks, and this game is a good drinking party game with friends since misery loves company.\n\n-1 point for no online or else coulda been an easy ten.\nRating:  9/10  Value:  $9.99     <----Rating based on price, at $30.00 its 0/10","March 26, 2014","true","19.6"," 49 of 131 people (37%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","37","49","131","9","1"

Or maybe because it's a movie license.\nActually the game is quite fun, despite poor graphics (it has level of detail you expect from PS2 era game), missions are pretty varied, I'd say it' like Grand Theft Auto without on-foot part.

The car crashed into a concrete lamppost and two trees on Hercules Street, in a 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) speed zone near Kelly Johnson Parkway in Valencia, Santa Clarita, California, after which the vehicle burst into flames. The crash was caught on film by a security camera.Authorities determined that Rodas was driving the car, while Walker was the passenger. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department declared both victims dead at the scene. Rodas died of multiple traumatic injuries, while Walker died from the combined effects of traumatic and thermal trauma, according to the Los Angeles county coroner's office. Both of their bodies were burned beyond recognition.\n\nThe curve where Walker and Rodas were killed is a popular spot for drifting cars.The coroner's report stated that the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was traveling at a speed possibly as high as 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) before the crash. The coroner's report further stated that no alcohol or other drugs were found in the systems of either man.Furthermore, it states that there were no hints of technical problems with the car and neither a damaged surface of the street nor parts on the street played a role in the accident.Police investigated as to whether drag racing played a role, but were unable to find evidence of a second car's involvement.A piece of the car was stolen off the tow truck as the wreckage was towed away on a flatbed. Two men, Jameson Brooks Witty and Anthony Janow,were arrested for grand theft.Walker's autopsy showed "scant soot" in his trachea, leading investigators to believe he died before the car was engulfed in fire, where Rodas was killed on or shortly after impact by head, neck, and chest trauma.\n\nIn March 2014, further investigation revealed that the speed of the car was the main reason for the crash. The car was said to be traveling between 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) and 93 miles per hour (150 km/h), and had nine-year-old tires that were seldom driven on.\n\nWith Furious 7 in the middle of filming at the time of Walker's death, Universal announced an indeterminate hiatus on the production, citing a desire to speak with his family before determining what to do with the film.\n\nNumerous friends and movie stars posted tributes to Walker on social media His body was cremated and his ashes were buried in a non-denominational ceremony at Forest Lawn Memorial Park ‚Äì Hollywood Hills.\n\nIn December 2014, Walker's father, Paul William Walker III, filed a lawsuit against Roger Rodas's estate seeking the return of, or "a proportionate share" of revenue generated by a group of automobiles that were jointly owned by both Walker and Roger Rodas.\n\nIn September 2015, Walker's daughter Meadow Walker filed a suit against Porsche for wrongful death of her father, claiming that the Porsche Carrera GT had numerous design defects including a history of instability, and that seat belt placement can cause harm upon impact.Porsche's response denied any wrongdoing and blamed Walker himself, stating: "The perils, risk, and danger were open and obvious and known to him, and he chose to conduct himself in a manner so as to expose himself to such perils, dangers, and risks, thus assuming all the risks involved in using the vehicle."","August 1, 2015","true","25.1"," 8 of 41 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","8","41","0","0"
