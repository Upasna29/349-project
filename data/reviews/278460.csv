Took about 7 hrs if you're diligent about it, maybe a little faster if you're good at this genre.\n\nThis game is pretty legit.  I'll be brief and quickly summarize my first impressions from playing this game.\n\nPros:\nEntralling Story - Having finished my first playthrough I can safely say that Skyborn offers an entertaining tale with various twists and turns that'll keep the player on their toes.  I found the closure at the end to be very satisfying as well (not really a spoiler, I'm primarily trying to convey that the end wasn't half ♥♥♥♥♥).\n\nAvoidable combat - Unlike most RPGs where you run around and trigger random events that can't be seen, Skyborn has a system where players are able to physically see monsters on the screen.  This allows a player to circumvent an unwanted encounter while providing the option of easy EXP as well if they find themselves underleveled. Edit: I'll say this now - avoidable mobs are all OPTIONAL.  Under no circumstances was I ever pressed to level/grind on a normal clear.  I'm currently working on a hard clear to see if this is the same case.  Don't let this discourage you though, boss fights are still pretty difficult depending on your composition.\n\nBattle Arena - Later on in the game there's an arena that offers a substantial challenge if you find the fights to be too easy.  It poses a significant challenge compared to typical encounters.\n\nCrafting system - I haven't tried it too thoroughly yet, however there is a system in place for harvesting minerals etc and for creating weapons and armor.  It hasn't been too impactful in my playthrough since I've been finding gear frequently enough as is, but it's a nice side touch to have.\n\nConsistency/Persistent Story - The game feels very consistent throughout, and when I say that I mean so with regards to the story alawys being present.  Unlike other RPGs where you get a 30 second snippet of dialog followed by 2 hours of grinding mobs through a tower in order to reach an objective, Skyborn does a decent job of adding in short excerpts of character interaction to alleviate the grind.  While progressing through dungeons characters will talk and continue to give the player story while dungeon crawling.\n\nThe Music - The music in this game is by far satisfying and enjoyable to listen to.  This of course is my own personal preference, however if something like this appeals to you then by all means consider this when making your decision as well.\n\n\nCons:\nLack of Backtracking - There are a couple of areas where I realized some chests were left unlooted due to not understanding certain trigger mechanics until later in the game.  From what I can tell, I'm unable to revisit these places for the time being since map movement is very story driven.  This is important because certain items come from said chests... and one of the initial lines implies that you want to collect all of a particular set for extraordinary rewards. Edit: At some point in the game it does allow for freedom of movement/control of your ship/destination - just don't expect it too soon.\n\nOptions/Settings - I found this panel to be very lacking.  Not only do audio settings not save (I found myself having to lower game volume manually through the audio manager my OS provides) but there's very little customization available.  You can change the color of the major panels, however keybindings cannot be changed.  On top of that, the tutorial isn't very extensive, so figuring out what binds to what is a bit difficult at first.  They do bring up the least obvious binding (X has uses apparently), but they fail to mention that other buttons such as spacebar and enter can function as an "a" button if you were to play a hand held.\n\nStat Values - This is the min/maxer speaking at the moment.  With regards to stats in this game, their effects are very helterskelter as far as values go.  I'm not talking specific number crunching for damage per turn etc but rather lack of clarity.  It's not exactly clear what +1 agility will do as opposed to +1 strength which was a bit frustrating.\n\nAs for now, I'm a very satisfied customer considering the price I paid for this.  I'd strongly recommend it to anyone that was a fan of the old FFs (1-2 etc) who have a strong desire for pretty driven plot.  Overall, I'd give this game an 7.5/10 with everything above in mind. As far as buying goes, I'd be a bit hesitant in recommending full price for this game.  With the current half off sale though, it's very much so a buy that gives you your bang for your buck.","February 21, 2014","true","7.3"," 380 of 399 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","380","399","0","17"

Combat is quite fun and the augmentation system adds a little flavor to your gear so you can modify the characters as you see fit. The game itself allows you to explore for hidden items and upgrades and there are very few random battles which is the main reason I tend to avoid this style of RPG, so that is a definite plus! Monsters are visually wandering around and you can choose to fight or walk right by them most of the time when the story permits. Great game, looking forward to seeing how it all pans out!","February 21, 2014","true","1.2"," 119 of 148 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","119","148","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/recommended/278460/","Valerie-Valens","~★PetSquirrel★~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/","647 products in account","When the touchy subject of RPG Maker commercial games comes up, I am not one to judge or deny the legitimacy of RPG Maker games as a commercial product. I have seen some fantastic games made on the engine like To The Moon, and I have seen absolute garbage like the Laxius Force and Millenium Quest series being put up for sale. My interest for this title was raised when the discussion on RPG Maker commercial games mentioned Deadly Sin and its sequel as an example of good RPG Maker games, and one of the studio's earlier titles was this.\n\nThis game is a short story set in a steampunk fantasy world where the plot involves Claret Spencer, a mechanic who is about to get entangled in a pivotal racist conspiracy involving the Skyborn, a race of magic users with Dragon-wings, Humans, the ancient and near-extinct Fey, and Half-Breeds, the result of a Skyborn and a Human mating. The story is really focused in scope, goes through predictable motions and doesn't do enough world-building to be compelling. However, what it does have as far as story goes is quite competently written, and the characters in the story are fairly consistent in their actions.\n\nThe gameplay has a few unique twists to the bog-standard turn-based RPG and equipment system in that armor doesn't  directly come into play for damage-reduction, but instead, they increase various stats depending on type. In a way, the type of armor used determines the type of build for each character. The combat system is a standard Conditional Turn Based system but with a twist to keep things interesting, and encourages players to use more support skills, and it's the Threat system. Characters with the most threat will be targeted for single-target attacks, dealing damage and killing enemies will increase the threat of that character for the duration of the battle. This system allows for the utility of skills that can transfer threat from one character to another, or to gather an enormous amount of threat for one's self. This combination of systems allows for a lot of min maxing to be employed, which is pretty refreshing for an RPG Maker game. There is also an augment and forging system that allows players to further customise their gear, which is good.\n\nWhat is not so good, however, is the unintuitive way of how the stats are used and how they are never explained ingame. See, the Strength stat determines the damage dealt by regular weapon attacks regardless of type, Intelligence determines the effectiveness of special skills, and Agility merely determines the Speed, Critical and Evade chance. While this would make sense normally, there is also the idea that there are 3 different types of damage ; Physical, Magic and Tech and one would easily be forgiven for thinking that Strength, Intelligence and Agility would determine the effectiveness of Physical, Magical and Tech attacks respectively. This leaves for some results that just plain doesn't make sense, like Corwin's (The designated mage/healer.) magical blast weapon damage that is determined by his strength instead of Intelligence. The other issue with the combat and gameplay is that on Normal, it is either too easy, or you get wiped out real quickly, with no battles that provide an evenly-matched struggle, and the being wiped-out part only ever happens if you don't do the side-quests before the point of no return. Once you did all the side-quests before the endgame, then the endgame becomes ridiculously easy again,\n\nAnother bugbear of the gameplay of this game is that very few of the objects in the game can be interacted with with any measure, which brings us back to the point of the game being very focused and limited in scope to the point of its own detriment. It would have been nice if there are more props that give you flavour text, added an effect to your party, or can be interacted with to produce a sound effect. (Piano jingle, anyone?) As an RPG afficionado, I can tell you that most RPGs offer an immense amount of non-plot-relevant interactivity, which goes a long way with the immersion.\n\nAnother issue is that there aren't enough variety in the enemy mobs to keep things interesting. All the enemy mobs have a role that is theoretically mirrored by one of the characters', and very few of the skills that enemies have are unique to the enemies, as a result, most enemies are very predictable, and thus very easy to deal with, even enemies with the ability to OHKO half your party. That said, the abilities that you do gain throughout the game are very useful and are a nice change from the generic damage ones that plagues most RPG Maker games. I also do like the design of the dungeons themselves which strayed a lot from the conventional square-like design that even commercial RPGs from the 90's suffer from, this results in a lot of the dungeons and natural cave systems looking very very organic, which is a great plus for this game.\n\nThe strongest point of this game though, is the music. The soundtrack is very well-mastered with a lot of nice orchestral stings and swelling chords befitting of a fantasy RPG. It is no Falcom Sound Team JDK, but as far as indie RPG Maker projects go, the fact that the soundtrack isn't a set of crappy generic MIDIs alone is something I can appreciate a lot.\n\nSo the final verdict is, do I recommend this game? And the answer is unfortunately, nope. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this game, and as far as RPG Maker games go, this is one of the better ones. However, with how limited and focused the scope of the game is, there is not enough world-building and lore to keep the player invested in the story and its characters, and the paltry offering with regards to interactivity and side-quests certainly didn't help it. Ultimately, the biggest drawback of this game is that it is not ambitious enough for the premise it presents, and maybe if the combat system is given more depth, if there are more character and story arcs, and if there is a less-linear progression through the story, then it might be worth the $15 asking price. As it stands, I cannot really recommend this game, outside of at least a 50% off sale, unless you really like RPG Maker games.","March 8, 2014","false","12.5"," 107 of 134 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","107","134","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/278460/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","291 products in account","Skyborn is a unique story driven R.P.G. developed by Dancing Dragon Games and published by Degica. The Skyborn are a winged humanoid race that has defeated in war and consequently subjugated humankind. You take on the role of Claret Spencer, the star mechanic of an independent repair shop, who suddenly finds herself pulled into an epic city wide conflict which takes her and her friends on a journey through a tale of magic, metal and mystery as she unravels the secrets of the Skyborn. This is a R.P.G. Maker title which up to this point I had never heard of although I have played many games in the past with this same look and style. For those that don't know, R.P.G. Maker is a program that allows users to create their very own role playing games. With that said, the gripping story in this title is really well conceived and unfolds over the course of the game in unvoiced dialogue and cutscenes many times alongside gorgeous anime inspired handrawn artwork that is truly a pleasure to the eyes. There's enough intrigue, action and humor in this wonderful game to keep you consistently playing from start to finish.\n\nAs you travel through the beautiful and heavily steampunk themed world of the game, Claret and the allies that she manages to assemble along the way will be forced to do battle against the Skyborn themselves as well as a variety of other enemies and adversaries. The combat in this title, which is very fun and quite different from the typical R.P.G.'s that I tend to play, takes place in the form of the turn based J.R.P.G. battle systems similiar to many classic well known Japanese Role Playing Games like Final Fantasy and Grandia. As you win you constantly earn experience points and automatically level up your group. You also have the ability to upgrade the gear of your character and companions by purchasing, looting or crafting various weapon and armor sets. Besides the main story, Claret will meet many interesting and sometimes hilarious N.P.C.'s who will provide you with the chance to take on any number of optional sidequests. There is also an incentive to explore the world because there are many hidden items to find which can yield extra experience points and crafting materials as well as currency.\n\nThe musical score and sound effects in this title are phenomenal and fit the gameplay perfectly. Whether you are engaged in battle, leisurely strolling about or having a conversation there are tracks to suit the occasion. The world is filled with gears grinding and smokestacks puffing as one would expect in a steampunk themed game and this title does not dissapoint. I find myself listening to the classically inspired soundtrack on a daily basis as I'm logged on to Steam and will continue to do so because it's that memorable.\n\nDiscovering this game came as a huge surprise for me as I never thought that I would have enjoyed a title such as this as much as I have. Playing this game has definitely piqued my interest in the R.P.G. Maker genre. Like I stated before, this genre is completely new to me but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this title has to be one of the most well developed and polished of them all. I constantly find myself scouring Steam every week hoping that I might one day come across another gem like this one. If you're looking for a lighthearted roleplaying game with a fantastic story, just the right amount of humor and interesting combat then look no further...Skyborn would make an excellent addition to your library and is highly recommended! As a side note, the developers have recently begun asking the Steam community what they would like in another Skyborn game so I'm crossing my fingers and hope to die that a sequel could definitely be in the works.","March 20","true","33.1"," 54 of 56 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","54","56","0","9"

Now although you may think thats pretty lame, it is. HOWEVER! the story is good, progression, characters, the sound choices are good, theres very few glitches, just generally its a solid game 8/10 and it took up a decent ammount of my time.\n\nI have one complaint: The last boss is RNG defeatable, in other words, you can either be killed in one hit by its "Last Stand" move, or you spend an hour trying to kill it. I haven't killed it. Kind of makes me angry. This is really bad because the move can be used on any turn within that hour of fighting him, so the chances are extremely high that it will be activated. Now I know what you're thinking, maybe if you would just get more ready for the boss befor- NO. I have 4 level 50's and a level 58. I have maxed out gear, and I was doing 20k damage per round I attacked him. ♥♥♥♥ YOU.\n\nSo other than the last boss being unbeatable except by pure luck, this game is outstanding, I expected far less from an RPG maker game.

What makes it special from number of other RPGM games? Well, bunch of nice things.\n+ Skyborn presents you a rather deep world, with background story, interracial conflict.\n+ Unlike most of RPGM games, Skyborn is set in steampunk setting.\n+ Game is nicely balanced between storytelling and fighting. That means you do need to fight, but it's not too frequent.\n+ Game has implemented mouse controls. Mouse is fully operational and working for UI and movement control. No other RPGM games can offer you this.\n+ Crafting and upgrading mechanics without grind.\n+ Game encourages explorers with free extra EXP and useful items.\n+ Class speciality upgrades, which allow you put more strategy in fights. However there is an Ultimate Class for each character.\nNow what can keep you from buying it:\n- This is a j-rpg game. That means turn-based battles, mostly repetitive fights. Some of enemies will be very hard to defeat, until you discover their weaknesses. Sometimes it's oddly balanced, for example I couldn't kill one optional boss in the end, but easily defeated final boss.\n- Game comes without Steamworks support. That means no Cloud sync and no Achievements (which could be good)\n- Plot doesn't have open choices and has only one ending. It's good for a story, but nowadays most games feature multiple endings.\n\nStill so good.","January 31, 2015","true","32.8"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","47","52","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morriganstark/recommended/278460/","morriganstark","Morrigan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morriganstark/","45 products in account","Don't let the RPGMaker tag fool you, this is actually a fantastic game, reminiscent of the best JRPGs of the classic 16- and 32-bit era. The ensemble cast is fun and memorable, with each party member complementing each others quite nicely with their unique abilities. Too often in such games you will find a slew of useless abilities, status effects and debuffs that don't work (or that are nowhere near as useful as just dealing damage, for instance), but in this game, you have to really utilize each party member wisely to win, at least if you play on Hard (highly recommended for the best experience, though you will need an optimized party for the last boss). To the dev's credits, I don't think I found a single ability that was useless, and that's pretty much unheard of in the genre. ^^\n\nThere are no random battles; enemies appear on the screen, and they do not respawn. This is a godsend, because if there's one thing I don't miss from old jRPGs it's random battles every two steps that constantly interrupt your exploration. Each battle is fairly meaningful (again, on Hard) with plenty of strategy. Dungeon design could have been a bit more imaginative, it's mostly just standard "flip this switch to open this path"; but at least there's rewarding exploration and that's good enough. I would suggest to the devs to add more meaningful puzzles (à la Golden Sun or Wild ARMs) in a future game, that'd turn your game from good to spectacular. ^^\n\nThe story is nothing too original but it's well-written and engaging, never once did I groan in dismay at silly plot twists or anything like that, which happens far too often in these types of games, so congrats on a job well done.\n\nOh and what are RPGs without good soundtracks and art direction? Skyborn's is excellent in both cases, so don't worry about that. I really loved the sprites and characters portraits, the artists are clearly very talented.\n\nI do have some mild criticism, but it's nothing that detracted from my enjoyment: the dungeons could have been even better, as I mentioned before, and the crafting system is a bit tacked on, IMO, and not all that useful. And when shopping for equipment, there should be a better UI to compare with what you have equipped (and of course offer to auto-equip after buying). Luckily, the menus are quick and snappy so it's not much of an issue to navigate between menus, but that could certainly have been improved upon.\n\nSome have complained that the game is too short, but I disagree. Doing all the optional content I could find and retrying the last boss a few times, I have about 19 hours; that's more than fair for a game without filler. Personally I prefer this over a 50 hour long game with tons of boring side-quests and meandering stories that drag on and on, so I have no problem with the game's length. YMMV. I suspect those who spent less than 10 hours probably played on Normal or Easy and breezed through without doing the side-stuff, which is weird to me.\n\nAll in all, I was pleasantly surprised by how good this game was. I hesitated a long time before buying it, expecting a decent but probably amateurish product, but it's actually very well made, very polished, and the combat is, without hyperbole, among the best I've seen in turn-based JRPGs.","September 28, 2014","true","19.4"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","39","41","3","3"

The story is there, it isn't an award winning story, it's a story that holds together the game and the characters well enough.  Sound design is alright, nothing to really complain about, but I ended up muting the music and just playing mine.

There is no random encounters so you can pick and choose your fights, rewards exploring with decent loot and small stars that give extra exp. Biggest plus for me it is a fantasy world cross with machines really enjoy it a lot. Game is shorter then 8 hrs I spent on it but I like exploring. Would highly reccommend this game to anyone.","June 23, 2014","true","8.4"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","0"

Not as good as a FF, but good enough. It took me around 19 hours to finish the game completely and I most certainly recommend to play it on Hard mode. Yet, like any game, it's got some flaws.\n\nThe game is very entertaining and being made with RPG maker didn't bother me much except during the fights. Skyborn would have been much better with a FF like battle interface, just watching deck-like drawings moving on the screen isn't as exciting as it could be and it's a real shame that Skyborn lacks proper fighting grounds, especially considering the innovative combat sistem based on the threat level.\n\nSome people have complained about the dungeons, but to be honest I liked them and didn't feel like being slight variations of the same dungeons I'd already explored. I did, however, miss a full map that I could check so I could locate my position in the dungeon or track any possible hidden areas with chests.\n\nSpeaking of treasure chests, I couldn't help it but feel a bit down when I finally got to some particularly pesky chests only to find that they only had a potion or another healing item that I wasn't gonna use anyway. Some of the treasure chests' contents could have been better.\n\nAnd lastly, one of the things that bothered me the most about skyborn is that the game doesn't give you any information about stats and you can easily play through chunks of the game the wrong, or at least not in the most optimal, way.\n\nOther than this, there are only minor issues that could have been improved to make the game better. For instance, moving through the menus can sometimes get chaotic, I really missed the FF battle option of remembering your last action, in Skyborn you always start on the "attack" command and the forge system is one of those things you think is important and you're going to be using in the future but you end up not using, or at least not as much as you think you would. Also, the Colosseum could have been improved, the augmentation system should have been explained in depth and Skyborn would've benefited greatly from Steam achievements. But none of this flaws break the game.\n\nIn short, those are all the issues that I found in the game, but don't let that distract you from the truth. Despite everything, Skyborn is a really good game, very enjoyable with a nice difficulty curve (provided you play on Hard mode) which presents several innovations, such as a new battle system and an engaging story, that could have made of skyborn another "Chrono Trigger"-like quality game but doesn't quite reach the top as it stands.\n\nOverall: 8.75/10\n\nLoved the music BTW!  (^_^)\n\n\nEDIT = They've implemented achievements now, so Hurray for them!!","October 5, 2015","true","57.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

The final boss battle is somewhat cliche in my opinion but everything else is spot on. It took me 9 hours to complete the game and I did that in one sitting, meaning I couldn't separate myself from it until I finished it.\n\nI was very sceptic about the game and I got it for virtually free. I didn't expect much from it even from the start because of prejustices toward the genre that I had but once I started it up, and realized how much work actually went into this game and how it does its best to push the genre to its limits, I was blown away.\n\nRecommendations to this game.\nIt is truly...\nSKYBORN *dun dun dun*","June 5, 2014","true","9.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlmaElma/recommended/278460/","AlmaElma","Alma ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlmaElma/","217 products in account","★★☆☆☆ Graphics and SoundHonestly, this game isn't that bad looking on the initially. Of course, this is completely thrown out the window the moment you enter combat. The enemies are almost entirely generic RPGmaker enemies. They do not match the theme of the game or the visuals. The attacks are unsatisfying visually, too. Then you find most of the puzzles in the dungeons involve pressing giant color coded buttons. Also, every enemy is represented by the same imp sprite. This game looks good but uses way too much stock assets and ends up looking kind of ugly.\nMusic is nothing to note. It's usually not annoying, but it can be at times. Nothing stands out about it.\nThe sounds are once again, extremely unsatisfying. Honestly I turned them off after a while.\n\n★☆☆☆☆ GameplayThis game throws an interesting concept at you, the Threat mechanic. The enemies will always attack the party member with the highest "threat level", which is generated by moves items and certain equipment. It's not chance based ether, they will always focus you. This turns certain party members into punching bags while the others are for aoe dps. It makes the game laughably easy because there no chances, it's abuseable to all hell.\nBattle system aside, there are no random encounters, they're all scripted, meaning that EXP is fixed and there's no difficulty curve as long as you fight everything in order. Not that the enemies are ever particularly difficult, even on the highest setting, due to the threat mechanic.\nParties are not customizable in the slightest, you are given 5 party members that follow a role that will remain exactly the same regardless of how you decide to reclass them.\nStats are meaningless and easy to inflate due to a poorly designed "augmentation" system.\nSimply put, it's lazy and didn't think mechanic with a lot of potential through very well.\n\n★★★☆☆ StoryThis is probably the game's greatest attribute. I'm being a little bit generous because the storytelling is rather forced upon you and rushed, but the theme and overall feeling has a good basis. The characters are likable from the start, but unfortunately do not really undergo any sense of development. It's a very short story and could probably benefit from slowing down a little bit.\n\n★★☆☆☆ OverallI don't recommend this game. It's short lived and a very forgettable experience. The entire time I found myself wanting to like this game, hoping it would get better, but it never does. Good concept, bad presentation, badly put together.","January 7, 2015","false","10.3"," 82 of 134 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","82","134","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baniann/recommended/278460/","baniann","baniann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baniann/","488 products in account","This title manages to overcome many of the issues that it could have faced and really raises the bar for what I'll be coming to expect from indie JRPGs and titles using the RPGMaker engine. Of the indie old-school RPGs I've played thusfar, it is the best title of that sub-category that is available on Steam right now and excels in every area, exceeding all my expectations. Though this is going to be quite a glowing review, I'll get into some of the downsides toward the end.\n\nThere are largely original assets in terms of graphics- an original, rarely-explored Steampunk setting to explore, well done full-screen character designs, and a bunch of animations and effects that add more immersion and personality to the cut-scenes. It all ends up comparing favorably to retail classics. This is one of those titles where you can just look at the screenshots to see if it will be pleasing aesthetically, the actual game does not deviate far from that though unfortunately many of the dungeon areas fall into the typical types of rainforests, caves, mines, etc. Battle graphics are quite simplistic. I greatly enjoy the character designs which seem like a curious blend of Eastern and Western ideas.\n\nAs for gameplay, there are enough nooks and crannies to the systems that it better resembles early PS1 RPGs like Grandia or Wild Arms rather than NES/SNES RPGs. The battle system is reminiscent of Grandia with multiple gauges and turn order being dictated by a character's speed stat and also by a weight stat, based on how many items they have equipped. There are some unusual ideas here, such as physical offensive characters having an "energy" gauge that fills up and makes more of their abilities accessible and a "threat" gauge that affects which character will face the brunt of attacks. Buffs, debuffs, and status effects are also available very early on and relevant quickly during battles. The most noteworthy thing about character management is about halfway through the game and again 3/4 of the way through, you receive special items that allow non-linear character classes. For example, a character can choose to learn high level healing OR offensive magic so your choices can accommodate your play style.\n\nThere is a weapons and armor crafting and customization system along with the option to use multiple weapon types such as guns, dual-wielding swords, etc. In addition to seeking out treasure from dungeons you also seek out resources to create much stronger versions of the weapons and gear you'd buy from the shops in town. There is a battle coliseum and super tough optional enemies that add a few hours of gameplay.\n\nDungeons are well-designed areas rife with very simple puzzles to work out. Towns are attractively intricate in design but have little to do beyond speaking to some NPCs, perhaps accepting a quest, and checking out the shops. This is perhaps an overly relaxed game in terms of complexity, but also a fast-paced one, which is a huge factor in its enjoyability. I would recommend choosing hard difficulty though my first playthrough (clocking in at almost 9 hours) was on medium.\n\nThe menus are polished and a handy quest log can keep track of where you're at and what you're to do next (this could have been useful for so many old-school RPGs..) lack of cursor memory is my only complaint with the menus.\n\nMusic is excellent, the original soundtrack sounds very reminiscent of earlier JRPGs but with enough technical merit to avoid sounding generic. The story is similarly exceptional- usually I expect these homages to old RPGs to come across more as fanfiction than an original story but Skyborn's writing may even exceed (or at least manage to bypass) limitations of both its peers and forebears. There are no issues with translation here, since the story is originally drawn up in English. Didn't catch any grammatical errors, it just seems also at a high standard of quality and the first hour alone is brimming with excitement. The characters are lively, amusing, and  mature in their actions. Those who dislike the slapstick that is common in more lighthearted RPGs will likely find this title appreciable.\n\nThe story takes place in an alternate, very steampunk-inspired universe where there are three races- humans, the winged Skyborn, and the unfortunate half-breeds that are at the bottom of the hierarchy and face violent discrimination from both groups. There is another race to speak of, but I'll get on with things. The heroine, Claret, works at a mechanic shop until she finds herself caught between an escalating conflict between humans and the very powerful Skyborn who are seeking to enslave and decimate the other races. She's a plucky but strong and capable heroine who isn't over-the-top; rather, she reacts very relateably to the unfolding story and does what she can to help. From there the conflict becomes more chaotic and both allies and enemies are not as they may seem. Some entertaining twists along the way.\n\nFlashbacks with gameplay portions and specialized artwork to match add an extra bit of attention to detail in the story and help flesh out the characters. It's not the most original storyline in the world and I wish there were just a bit more character interactions since quite a likeable group is assembled, but it is one of the high points of Skyborn overall.\n\nNow for some of the downsides- this game's standard price is $15 and is about 8 hours long. Almost $2 per hour. Give or take a few hours if you wish to thoroughly explore each of the minor quests and grind out levels for a tough optional boss. That is still a lot to ask for a short title, and especially for a short title with as many old-school sensibilities as this one has. Absolutely worth the time if it's on sale. Even though I loved it, I can really only recommend this title at its full price wholeheartedly to someone who is looking for an old-school indie JRPG that performs exceptionally in its class.","March 22, 2014","true","13.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jubilee23/recommended/278460/","jubilee23","Atlas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jubilee23/","239 products in account","This is JRPG-lite and I mean it in the best possible way ever. If you're wanting to play a simple JRPG without dumping a large amount of time into it, this game is for you.\n\nThe nostalgia that assaulted me within the first couple hours of the game was real. It's relatively shortish for a JRPG. My 100% leisurely playthrough on hard took me around 14 hours, but I enjoyed every moment of it except for a few boss fights.\n\nThe game itself isn't very difficult. Even on hard it's at most an entertaining challenge. Until you get to a certain few boss battles.\n\nThe 2nd boss fight took me half an hour to beat because it was hard. Really, really hard but beatable once you figure out how to go about it. The last boss battle made me want to break something. The last boss is just incredibly difficult to defeat because he has a skill that, unless you debuff him in time, will 99.9% of the time wipe out your entire party. I barely won this battle through the skin of my teeth. It was incredibly frustrating because I had gotten so close a few times only to get wiped out with a single attack.\n\nTo beat the last boss you will need SPD (puffin feathers) on every bit of Chaska's armour, (Sullivan's too just to be safe), so she can use Humilator to debuff the boss immediately after he buffs himself with his Energy skill. Make sure she (and Sullivan if possible) has Haste all the time. I was not prepared for this battle, but I used the souls augment on Chaska and the whopping three puffin feathers I had in my inventory. The permanent Haste ability from the soul was enough to get me barely through the battle. I completely lucked out. Alda somehow survived his ridiculous OP attack and somehow I managed to kill him via status effect. I don't even know what happened, but I'm not complaining.\n\nA lot of the boss battles had a lot of luck attributed to them. If they use certain skills before you're prepared (ie: when you first encounter them) they can devastate you, but when you try again and they don't use that skill, it's a piece of cake. It's frustrating sometimes, but it didn't stop me from continuing to play.\n\nAnother thing were that were two areas that looped so that you could never figure out whether or not you had gotten all the goodies in the area unless you walked in circles for forever. The battle UI also looks terrible.\n\nAside from that, this was a genuinely fun game. It's gorgeous looking, and an incredibly well put together for a RPG Maker game. The story is pretty light and entertaining for the first half and gets more serious as the game goes on. It's not the greatest story ever, but it's and good enough.\n\nA huge plus is that there are no random battles. The monsters are all visible and you can choose whether or not you want to fight them. There is nothing more annoying in JRPGs then having to fight every two steps when you're trying to explore every inch of the map. I like grinding for the most part, I really do, but as a completionist that drives me insane.\n\nThe character portraits are a really nice touch. Character design is great. I love the characters in the game. I love our spunky protagonist and her interactions with our tank. They're hilarious. I ship it.\n\nThe music is top notch as well.\n\nI really highly recommend this game if you're looking for a nice little time killer. I didn't expect much when I started playing and found myself really, really enjoying this.\n\nEdit: I have been informed that you should put defense on stuff, so you don't get slaughtered by monsters. I wished someone had told me this earlier because I put attack on everything and was wondering why I could get owned very, very quickly. In hindsight, this was completely too obvious for me.","January 24, 2015","true","17.1"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

Bravo to the artist for literally carrying this game.\n\nSadly they left in the default sounds effects.  For a small budget you can get loads of free on the right sites with enough leg work.  It doesn't seem like the developer knew to do this. I broke quite a few events and even managed to find multiple passability bugs.  It really seems like this was someone's first RPG maker game as it has a lot of quality errors.\n\n*To the people who quality tested this game: Shame on you.  You missed a lot.  I won't go further into muck racking than that.  You failed at your job, and it blatantly shows.*\n\nGood music was another positive quality.  The theme was used enough and remixed to the atmosphere of the areas that it wasn't tired, but invigorating hearing it.  I was enthralled enough to keep playing with the BGM going.\n\nThe story was patchworked at best, with things shoe horned in that left me confused at times without explinations. I enjoyed the ride, but the story didn't go anywhere.  The big reveal at the end came out of nowhere and literally stopped the story dead to justify the end boss.  Even then the ending showed that a support character was the most important and invested character in the game, not Claret.  Claret was the falling star of Skyborn, and is sadly on the cover.  She has no place on the title, because this is not her story.  It's Claska's story and rise to power.\n\nThe battle system is simply steam rolling enemies at any difficulty.  The side boss is not worth revisiting, nor does she make any sense in the explaination of this world.  She seems to be able to go to the Fae world, so I assume she is an Earthenfae too.  Not that we are given any reason to invest in her.\n\nItems weren't worth investing into.  At a point in the game where major upgrades are bought you replace them with found treasure almost instantly.  It's a big time sink that didn't need to be there.  Had weapons been upgraded like Claska's claw it would have been a bit of a smoother transition and better use of the anvil and synth system which fell short of simply buying better gear.\n\nSkyborn can't decide what the Prometheus Engine is.  It tells us it is an Airship Engine at first, then an anti magic shield, and finally it turns out to be a mecha robot.  It has all but 30 seconds of screen time and isn't used in the final encounter.  Big build up and grind for little pay off there.  Claret focus quickly dwindled.\n\nSully's focus happened at the wrong times with his father being shoe horned in, and then almost forgot about his sister nor does she appear in the Fae Realm with the other half breeds.  His part as the Red Spectre had little to do with anything other than baiting the player.\n\nCorwin is the ultimate silent character.  I feel like he wasn't even there.  He didn't even so much as chew the scenery.\n\nAlda's derpy blonde face with it's crossed eyes had me amused, but her character's motivation kept changing to the point I felt she wasn't a liability so much as a natural blonde.  She is the over kill character.  She is far too powerful to be in the group.  EMP blast and Missle Launch had nothing on her Mystic Blade and Lightfury.\n\nIn the end it was worth one playthrough.  Was it perfect?  No.  Was it good?  Yes.  But it felt hastily put together and poorly tested.  You really need to pick and choose your testers.  Their laziness and inability to grow with the project's need hurt all of your custom materials.\n\nIt wasn't the developers fault with this game, his staff didn't measure up to the challange.  Hopefully Phil finds better people.","June 21, 2014","false","8.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSanjuro/recommended/278460/","MrSanjuro","Tsunday.幻想","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSanjuro/","145 products in account","As an avid fan of the RPG/JRPG franchise, and a diligent user of the RPG Maker it glads me to no end seeing projects from RPG Maker gets published like this. Not only does it spur me (and perhaps others) to try harder with their own projects, but it also serves as a sort of inspiration. Because let's be honest, not everyone who uses RPG Maker is educated in programming.\n\nEducated or not, this is a interesting little game. Note that by the time I write this review, I have yet to complete the game but I can already tell how it is going to end, and most of the details surrounding this game. As an RPG, it's very basic but enjoyable. However, for a open-world style setting it's way too linear and convoluted. And yet some maps are just way too large or a complete mess. I can understand the point of trying to make a forest into a maze...ish... thing but some players might actually have some serious issues with this and ultimately drop it just for a reason like this, seeing how fast paced the game is in general (I did not have any issues though, too many RPGs son). The combat system is extremely basic and simple, almost to the point where I actually got a little disappointed in it. It's solid though, I've seen way too many games screw up their combat system trying to make it either too complex or stylish.\n\nTowns are actually pretty damn good. Their designs are amazing, there's so many details and blends in perfectly with the setting of the game, the Steampunk style. It gives you a good feel for how the people are living, how the society is built up and whatnot. I cannot say the same about the clothing and weaponchoice for some characters, but that's hardly an issue. There are way more games that is just ridiculous about their choices of weapons, clothing and the likes (Final Fantasy X anyone?)\n\nSome other complaints I have is about the "crafting". Just like with the combat, it's really simple. But that's hardly the issue. In order to craft new weapons or augment/upgrade them, you need resources, right? Fair enough. You encounter resources by proceeding with the storyline. Everywhere. Literally. Since the game has moving enemy groups, it means you can skip those of you want to. But not resources, they're stuck in the walls. And they're everywhere. The game becomes more of a scavenger hunt than an RPG, simply because when you find one node you spot another one not too far away. And this goes on forever. To add salt to the injury, in order to craft you need an anvil. Also fair enough. BUT PLEASE GIVE ME AN ANVIL SO I CAN CRAFT, IT'S BEEN TWO HOURS OF GAMEPLAY SINCE I'VE SEEN THE LAST ONE JASJGLKAGLJDLHSKÖDLFJ....\n\n... I should also mention that if you just want to play for the storyline (which is actually pretty good, though some parts of the dialogue is quite... corny... and generic...) there's the skipable combat. Also, if you're worried about the experience needed for some of the of course mandatory boss fights, the creator(s?) has thought about that aswell. There are experience nodes scattered all around the map, just like with the resource nodes (wohoo, more scavenging!). These will yield you all the experience you'll need to safely pass the game on easy. And to add to that, during the game you can choose the difficulty you desire. There are three of them, depending on how hardcore and how casual you are.\n\nI can't say too much about the characters yet, because I haven't finished the game. But so far there hasn't been much development on many of the characters. We are introduced to them in different ways, but that's it. Only one of the characters has a solid introduction, aswell as history which we get to know but as I said, can't say too much yet. Graphics are average, the character has multiple "sprites" for facial and emotional expressions which was actually more than I hoped for. The design fits into the Steampunk setting aswell. Music... not quite sure what to say. I don't know if it's from one of the DLCs (I don't own any of the DLCs) or if it's composed by someone else but all I have to say is that... it's neglectable. It's so bland and generic, I don't think it would have mattered if it was there or not. Doesn't matter of it's symphonical (is that even a word lol), it doesn't fit.\n\nConclusion, I'd say it's a below average RPG. It is well made in certain aspects, has a lot of thought put into it but the execution is not just there. It lacks so much to kick it up a notch and make it an unpolished gem. Doesn't matter how much of hard work is put into it, there room available for better performance, dialogue, combat system (my biggest complaint here), maps, NPCs (falls into dialogues) etc is just too great. Don't get me wrong, however. I am enjoying what I am playing and I will finish it. But the full price of the game for what you're getting is not worth it (bought it on sale). But if you want some casual time-killer, or inspiration for your own RPG game this is a good buy (only if it's on sale!).\n\n3½/10\n\nEdit: I've read a little on the Steam community for this game, and I noticed I might have missed a couple of things in this review, such as being able to use the cursor and whatnot (which is actually a cool feature). Despite of this, my opinion still won't change. You can make nice scripts, you can program a fully established battle system and make amazing designs but if you don't put it where it belongs it's a waste. I am however rooting for the next project, mistakes provides experience.","February 23, 2014","false","6.2"," 49 of 86 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","49","86","0","2"

I think the word that most aptly describes the game is "charming." The storyline -- a character gets swept up in events beyond their control and ends up joining a rebellion against tyrants -- is one I'm a total sucker for and when you combine that with a female main character, well, I'm sold. This is an RPG-maker game, so you can't expect fantastic graphics (though I thought the character designs were well-done) and Skyborn does have some faults. First of all, the controls can be fairly finicky and I found myself having to switch from keyboard controls (arrow keys) to my mouse (or vice versa) to navigate dungeons. Secondly, Skyborn desperately needs a map function. I spent right around nine hours playing the game and at least two of those hours were spent wandering dungeons aimlessly as I was lost. I appreciated that the dungeons were expansive and even included navigation puzzles but if you're going to do that you've gotta include some sort of map function so the player isn't retreading the same ground. And speaking of maps, a few of the city maps were full of needless obstacles that were more irritating than anything. Finally, as much as I enjoyed the game, I think it's a little over-priced (I bought it on sale). $15 seems a bit much for a 10 hour game, especially when they could have easily added more content in terms of deeper characterization, character backstories, and lore. But if you can catch Skyborn at $10 or less, you like old school RPGs, or want to support developers that create interesting female leads -- definitely worth the money!","January 1, 2015","true","8.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

This game was a nostalgic piece for me due to my love for RPG video games and Steampunk in general.\n\nThe game takes roughly 7-8 hours to beat and is overall a really interesting game. I enjoyed many aspects of Skyborn, especially the combat machanics, the soundtrack, and the story. I won't spoil anything about the story, for I recommend that you should definitely play the game for the full experience. I must say, however, that the characters are very easy to get attached to. All of the characters have a personality of their own, and I found them quite charming and interesting. But, in regards to the soundtrack, each piece fit the mood whenever it was necessary. Of course, this is my own personal preference, and some may or may not feel satisfied with the soundtrack.\nThe combat mechanics were easy to understand and very enjoyable. I was overjoyed when I realized that combat was unavoidable for most enemies. I've always disliked random encounters to a degree, and I truly love the option of avoiding or jumping into combat. I would fight some enemies in order to gain experience and eventually continue on when I believed I was ready for the next stage. The combat itself is turn-based and very strategic based on your playstyle. I'm a sucker for strategy-based systems, so the combat mechanics were some of the best I had seen in a long time.\n\nThere are only a few cons I found within the game. I found the crafting somewhat cringeworthy due to the fact that I crafted  and bought some of the highest-level gear near the middle of the game. I soon found the crafting system to be somewhat miniscule due to the fact that I did not require it at all after I crafted 3rd tier armor and weapons. I understand that this could be because Skyborn is not a lengthy game, but this incident made this system, which was excellent in the beginning, seem almost useless near the end.\nAnother con I found was the lack of backtracking. Once again, this is probably because the game is not lengthy. I somewhat expected a larger world with backtracking requirements here and there. The game has enough content to complete the story and satisfy the player, but it almost felt like the world was somewhat empty. I enjoy engrossing myself in the world of the characters in the game, so, when I'm limitted as to where I can go and what I can do, I question the condition and lore of the world as a whole. This is simply a personal arguement between me and other games. Other players may or may not feel the same way.\n\nIn all, Skyborn is a wonderful game and I recommend it. I only wish that the game could be longer. If Skyborn was longer, perhaps the cons of the game would have vanish. However, I do highly recommend Skyborn because of its story, fascinating characters, and overall enjoyment. I guarantee that you will enjoy this game.","June 29, 2014","true","8.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I'm enjoying it a lot; I'm a fan of the snes jrpg genre and strongly story-driven games. This game makes excellent use of in-game storytelling and ambient story through characters in towns etc. Characters are convincing and dialog is well-written and tailored to each character. There is a quest log (somewhere) but you won't need it because your goals are integrated into the story like they should be.\n\nThere are a few RPG-maker glitches which detract from the game a bit: fixed screen resolution, lack of freedom to walk up and down stairs and climb ladders, not many walk-behinds around buildings and fences, some mistached graphics (e.g. the graphic style of explosions doesn't match the rest of the game) but nothing terrible.\n\nI also feel that some of the maps are a bit too linear (in terms of choices) and could do with some more player-driven exploration and discovery rather than boxing the player in. That said, map layout is good and does show you areas you cannot reach yet, and bring you back around through places you've been before, which is great. They are also well finished, rather than chopped off randomly at screen edges like a lot of poor quality games.\n\nI haven't seen many other modern jrpgs around that are actually good enough to pay for, so if you're a fan of the genre, this one is worth checking out.","March 2, 2014","true","2.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There is a wierd system of resistances that bassically ammounts to a game of rock paper scisors based on your characters and the enemy type.  There is little variation in the packs you will encounter and less (aside from crits) randomness in the battles so you will simply have a winning pattern for each pack type.\n\nStill, the game *is* fun, just simple and fairly standard.

Its nice that the option is there, but overall combat in the game was rather easy, possibly too easy.\n\nThe story of the game usually left me scratching my head.  For example, there's one point in the story where one of the bad guys does something bad, but the protagonist asks how the bad guy followed her and his reply is that he just tracked her good deeds.  But the player never sees her doing any good deeds like what he implies and you were really just running around in caves, so the excuse is just really bad and makes no sense.  It just threw me out of the story a bit, and there's a few moments like these where something odd breaks immersion.  It doesn't happen too often, and sometimes the game does a good job of telling a story where you do feel a bit invested, so it does try to make up for it.\n\nThe game itself is a bit short.  I'd say you could probably beat this game in about 7~10 hours.  Meeting the final boss and quickly dispatching him sort of surprised me, because then the game was over.  I could tell though that some ideas were there to try to extend the length (since he didn't die too quickly), so I will give the makers credit there, but the game's difficulty sort of countered that.\n\nOverall, I'm not sure if I could fully recommend this game, a lot of the issues are pretty minor and not too destructive, but mainly the game's length and the difficulty of the game doesn't really warrant the current sale price (which is $14.99 as of this review) to me.  I would say get this game if you still want a simple story with good visuals, fairly varied combat, and a game made with RPG Maker that you want to support.

The production (visuals, audio) are nice, but nothing particularly noteworthy. Any saving grace would have to come from the gameplay...and that, in my experience, has been hit-and-miss.\n\nThere was clearly attention paid to gameplay details, which I can respect.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/avibs/recommended/278460/","avibs","Dingerbongle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/avibs/","109 products in account","An incredibly fun, if short, RPG that has incredible potential.\n\nLength - 2/5\n\nThe game lasts maybe 6-13 hours per run, assuming you explore the massively huge areas that you get.  Unfortunately, you only have a handful of areas to explore, and the game itself feels a little short.\n\nContent (Dangerous zones) - 4/5\n\nAlthough you only have a few areas to work with in the game, each zone is HUGE.  One zone takes maybe an hour or two to actually explore every nook and cranny of it.  Not only that, you are rewarded for exploring the huge areas (that you can also easily get lost in) with small consumables to ore for crafting to ultimate armor and weapons.  Each zone is beautifully and realistically made just for its terrain alone.  In addition to the beautiful zones, there are appropriate lighting effects to really add to their flavor.\n\nUnfortunately, the variety of monsters, their formations, and skill splash feel painfull average.  Although you don't face the same three enemies over and over again, you also don't face very many different enemies in random battles.  Some of them, sadly, only have one or two skills to take note of.\n\nContent (Safe zones) - 5/5\nThe towns and villages in this game are incredibly made with vibrant NPCs from start to finish.  The lighting effects, incredibly beautiful terrain, and heartwarming NPCs bring life to these massive towns.  There are also rewards for exploring towns through exploration nodes (grants exp) and some small items.\n\nBalance (Early game + Mid game) - 4/5\nNot too rough; not too easy.  Just the perfect blend.  Random battles don't take too long, but they aren't excruciatingly long either.\n\nBalance (End game) - 2.5/5\nUnfortunately, the balance is heavily skewed when nearing the end of the game.  2 or 3 characters start dealing insane amounts of damage while the others are unable to provide significant contribution to DPS.  In addition, random enemies and bosses start to hit you with insane AoE damage (and healing doesn't seem perfectly tuned with that).  It doesn't help that some characters can take out most end game boss's (not optional but mandatory) HP bars to 25% with one skill.  Overall, this part of the game, combat wise, seems to be a little rushed or trying its best to cope with its new conditions (no spoilers, but it should be obvious which party member I'm talking about).\n\nLore - 3.5/5\nThe lore of the game felt interesting, and it hinted at a bigger depth than what the game actually provided with us.  Unfortunately, the depth and significant parts of the lore felt slammed onto the player near the end of the game with little to no mention in the first parts of it.  Lore was great; execution was a little sloppy.\n\nPlot - 5/5\nIn the short time in the game, I constantly felt excited to keep the plot rolling.  There was little time for resting, and I knew that every action my party did was significant to their cause.\n\nThe premises were amazing, if a bit cliche.  It can be summarized generally in a sentence: The Skyborn, conquerers of the world, are imprisoning all half-breeds (half Skyborn and half Human), and a small group of rebels want to stop this injustice.","June 22, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Here are a few things that stuck out to me:\n\nPROS:\n\n-lots of polish. plenty of little animations and cinematics that make the game feel more immersive. The character thumbnails are drawn with multiple different facial expressions to be used when appropriate, etc.\n\n-characters and writing are both very good. I really enjoyed the dialogue and the storytelling had me really interested in what was happening just minutes into the game. The story isn't groundbreakingly original persay, but I did really enjoy it, and the execution was very good. I felt genuinely interested and invested in what was going on in the Skyborn world all the way through the end.\n\n-good combat mechanics - I really had to think about how I was going to equip my characters  and what actions to choose in a battle.\n\nCONS\n\n- bit pricy. I thought it was worth it personally, but it only took me 15 hours to beat, and a dollar per hour of gameplay seems a lot higher than most games on the market.\n\n- very linear. no worldmap to move around on, and only a handful of towns. I usually enjoy games that are more on the linear side, so this will be a bigger con to some people than it is to me.\n\n- you'll have to look up the stats online to figure out what they do, or you'll be somewhat blind in choosing how to augment your equipment. As another  reviewer is saying, it's not explained and it's not obvious. Even knowing a little bit, I never quite knew whether I was making the best choices with my equipment, and I made lots of costly mistakes that I couldn't undo without reverting to a save.\n\n- enemies wander on the map instead of having random encounters. This would be fine, but when you kill them, they never come back, so if there's a way to grind in this game, I never figured out what it is, which is really frustrating since I couldn't figure out how I was supposed to beat the next guys at the colluseum. I just wasn't strong enough and had no idea how to get stronger. I suppose I could've looked online, but I really prefer to avoid walkthroughs if I can.\n\nOverall, excellent game. Engaging story, lovable characters, fun combat, and just the sort of retro RPG experience I was looking for.","March 24, 2014","true","15.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's simple.  It's old-school.  It's turn based.  While these are amazing things in and of themselves, they combine to make a very lovely, relaxing game here.\n\nThe story doesn't blow you away, sure.  It is fun and enjoyable though.  Satisfies nostalgic feelings for RPG's from my childhood.\nCharacters are fun and relatable.  Battle is a cake walk until you select "Hard".  Then you're actually in for a bit of a fun challenge.  This is one of the few games I actually can find excitement to play lately.  There's just something satisfying about it.  I purposefully engage every enemy (enemy sprites move around the map and you can avoid them if you desire to do so), and don't find it to feel tired and repetitive thus far.\n\nWeapons and armor are augmentable and there is actually some thought required to be optimal, which is a nice change.\n\nThat having been said, I would not pay $15 for this game.  At all.  I find the sale price to be perfectly reasonable however.  I even feel that it's a worthwhile purchase in that price range and would buy it again in a heart beat.\n\nThere's a certain zen-like simplicity to this game, its combat and music, that just make it very relaxing and surprisingly addictive.\n\nStop thinking about it and buy it already!\n\nTo the Devs, thank you so much for this!

Logged 10 hours on it with searching most areas. It is very well created giving just enough control to the player to feel important, yet not giving options everywhere so you sit thinking over the best option for 5-10 minutes trying to get the best outcomes. The story is certainly a good one and I wish there was more to it. I'm a 90s kid so I enjoyed the game play which is much like an old gameboy game with a top down view of the map which is layered over a background image. There are only 5 characters for your party and the equipment in game is not much varied but really you basically get exactly what you need with only having to choose the fight style of each character.\n\nTip: When you get the apples, use them. They work for the whole party. I sat on my first one till I got the second one cause I thought it was only for one character.\n\nA great game to pass the time. I already wanted more of the game, but perhaps it ended with just the right amount of playthrough so it didn't get old before the final boss.\n\nP.S. Anyone figure out what beating Saerhel gets you?

In a lot of these games I can easly predict which way is the treasure  and which way is the exit.  With this game I found myself exploring maps. Two tumbs up here.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nShort:  I did unessisary grinding, exploration and all the side quests and still finished at under  hours on my first playthrough.\nAlmost 0 replay value: not even a + game option to let you play through again with all your stuff intact.  If you want to play through again you gotta lose all you've don so far and start fresh.  This is made worse by the shortness of the game itself.\nCrafting:  Normally a plus in this game it's a minus because it is pointless.  9 times out of 10 you are better off selling off the crafting materials and buying the gear that you need in the next town since it is the same stuff you would have crafted anyway and the money you get will go further than if you had made the gear instead of buying it.\nSide Quests:  I found around 3 of them and I feel confident that I explored enough to say that is close to if not all there are.  If your going to have side quests have a bunch otherwise just skip them.  Much like crafting it felt like they added them out of a sense of duty than out of a real desire to have them be part of the game.\n\nThe Ugly:\nThe limited number of side quests and crafting options combined with the shortness of the story makes me think DLC.   I hope I'm wrong but the game feels more like a framework that they are planning to add a ton of DLC to flesh out rather than just give us the whole thing from the start.\n\nIn short good game for under 10 bucks but full price isn't worth it.","February 23, 2014","false","10.2"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","26","48","0","2"

Overall, it's not a bad game, really. It has a few hiccups here than there you come to expect from indie games such as collision detection issues. For a game created in RPG maker, its really nice.\nI also noticed when I was dual wielding pistols, and one was very weak the other very strong, but they both hit for the same damage. I don't know if they just calculate the formula then split it that way, or if its really only taking into account one; this was an annoyance when testing weapons.\n\nThe game itself was pretty fun, I enjoyed the crafting and augmenting system a good deal, the story was pretty nice, and the characters were all solid. It had one major factor that ruined it for me: the difficulty.\n\nAs i said I havent finished this game, so maybe it gets harder; but I am currently 2 hours into it, and have yet to have any party member die nor have I felt the need to use an item. After two hours I feel I should have something to think about, but instead I have a character with 3 AoEs that an pretty much wipe the map (and this is with pretty bad weapons) and a tank that can always hold aggro and never dies. The bosses are laughably easy, I dont think any of them have brought any of my characters below 80% health.\n\nAside from the mobs being horrendously easy, there is also never a point where you are in danger. All the mobs you can simply ignore and walk past, no line of sight or anything to really worry about, so anytime you are low on health you can just go to one of the various healing points (which are free) and heal up. Their is usually one somewhere in a dungeon, so if you wanted you could go in between every mob you fight. The mobs also don't respawn (not a big deal, since you will never find yourself needing to grind) which is just a personal annoyance of mine.\n\nI even gimped myself a bit, i began to not augment things and not really buy any upgrades; hell, two of my characters didn't even use all their gear slots, and I still had no worry at all.\n\nIf you want a casual game to walk through with a decent story, by all means pick up this game. Just expect to kill all the mobs using the same tactic and never having a real challenge out of it.","November 4, 2014","false","7.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

I just can't call it bad. I love it. I love the taunt system even through it's  been reused in other games like Deadly Sin. I love the structure of the story and how you never really get overwhelmed by things to do but you still feel free enough for it to not be 100% linear. All and all the only critizism I have towards the game originates from it being made on RPG maker and possibly, like I said before, that the taunt system is a reused asset from other games the group has made, but even then, for this price, it's a really good first entry for JRPG styled games.\n\nI won't follow a number rating system, so I'll just list a few major cons and pros :\n\nPros\n\n- Good structured storyline\n- Memorable and likable characters\n- Strong female lead\n- Tactical gameplay due to the energy and taunt system\n- An interesting crafting and mining system\n\nCons\n\n- Generic JRPG formula\n- RPG Maker graphics\n- Reused graphical assets\n- Reused taunt mechanic\n-  No airship battles  (Okay maybe that was too much to ask for)\n\nNow that I look at all of these points, I realise that there is a specific kind of person who would enjoy a JRPG game. I grew up with the old Final Fantasy games so I never really cared for graphics, but I do know that there are people who require beautiful tree physics or else they'd rate a game bad despite what the game has to offer at the gameplay or story standpoint. There's also the fact that I do read quite a bit, so I find reading through the lore of a JRPG quite normal ; there will always be those people who are too impatient to read the text on the screen. So I do suggest people who are hesistant on buying this game to spend some time and anaylse if you're patient enough for the reading and don't mind the look of a game too much as in the end those two are the biggest factors in liking a game like this.\n\nThanks for reading my first proper review of a game .u.","July 29, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game follows humans and half-breed who are trying to rebel against a tyranny, the Skyborn.  At the beginning, you don't really know who is who, but in the end you find out how all three factions relate to each other and what went wrong.\n\nThe game play is quite good.  Most of the time, you move the group around by manipulating one of the characters, the others automatically follow.  The combat system takes a few tries to figure out what to do, but then I learned to love how combat worked.  Each character has a default attack, plus skills to use during combat.  They also have access to a few items.  Just attacking will get your group killed.  You need to have the characters work together to defeat strong foes.  For example, one of the characters, Claret, does tech attacks.  Another character can lower an enemy's tech resistance.  So first you lower the resistence, and then you attack.  While that mean the character lowering the resistence doesn't do an attack, the resulting damage adds up to more in the end.\n\nThe storyline is well thought out, the characters are interesting, and the plot might leave you thinking.  Overall, I loved playing Skyborn and I recommend this game to anyone who likes playing RPGs.","July 1, 2014","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters are interesting and have enough depth to allow you to pick a favourite. Claret in particular is well written, funny and an enjoyable protagonist to play. Non party characters do tend to be extremly 1 dimensional though.\n\nThe combat can get a bit boring but Skyborn doesn’t have random battles, instead battles are represented by a monster wondering about on the map, so you can avoid them if you want and xp is earned by exploring as well as from battles so I never felt like I had to battle or else lose out on xp.\n\nAnd while the story does have some plot holes, it is interesting and keeps your attention throughout the game.\n\nSo, I’m recommending Skyborn, especially for those that enjoyed the early Final Fantasy games,but you might want to wait for a sale as it is a short enough game. I completed pretty much everything and got it finished in 10 hours and others seem to have gotten it finished in much shorter times.","March 8, 2014","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a classic story of rebellion set in a steampunk world.\n\nPros:\n* No random battles to annoy you - instead, it uses a Lufia mechanic, where the monsters move around the map, and the battles only trigger if you run into them.\n* The battle mechanic itself is interesting too: there's a concept of "Threat", and the party member with the highest amount of Threat will be targeted for all enemy attacks, which makes it easy to designate a "tank" for receiving the brunt of the damage (all but AoE). It gets tricky, though, when your DPS characters start dealing out considerable amounts of damage, and thus, increasing their own Threat. It often begs the decision whether your DPS character should kill an enemy and receive the bulk of the Threat (and the full force of the next enemy attack), or do something else and let that enemy live to attack one more time, but give your tank an opportunity to rebuild their Threat.\n* The game rewards exploration by way of "exploration points" - free XP just for exploring the map.\n* There are plenty of secret treasures to be found in the game! Completing the few hidden (and not so hidden) optional highly-challenging bosses and dungeons will result in great rewards.\n\nCons:\n* Doesn't support the Steam overlay (Shift+Tab).\n\nOverall, with full completion, this game took me about 12 hours to beat. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.","March 2, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Because of the short length, the story and characters feel condensed. The ending really does come quick. This is the first RPGMaker game I have played. I enjoyed it for what it was and I did get a key for free.\n\nSome notes on the game:\n- Map layouts are sometimes confusing, but are always linear, especially with the color coded puzzles.\n- Checkpoints are generous, so healing and MP management was never an issue for me. I never used any healing items aside from reviving.\n- Forging was only useful near the first half of the game. Once I got enough ore and forged my things, I was already at a shop where I could buy better armor.\n- Money was not really an issue either. It's best to save for when you get the highest tier shops near the arena.\n- Fights were mildly easy with the right setups. When the classes fully unlocked, I felt way overpowered at the endgame.\n- It's pretty easy to run past monsters. They aren't randomized and they don't respawn, but I fought them all anyways.\n- My max level jumped from 49 to 67 by getting everything and beating all bosses (beating the hardest optional boss gives you a giant boost in levels).\n- The optional boss in the last dungeon was pretty challenging, I really enjoyed that fight.\n- Another reviewer mentioned this, but they are right about stats. STR deals attack power, even for Corwin. INT is for tech and magic damage which is useful for Claret and Alda's tier 2 and 3 class skills.\n- Debuffs (Equalizer, Majesty, and Humiliator) are extremely useful.\n- The best way to power up is through augments: clusters, ingots, and then rainbow prisms.\n- I suggest giving the weight reducer potion to Claret. I gave it to Sullivan, but his final gear was way below his weight limit.","October 17, 2015","true","24.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Deadly Sin II came shortly after. Their latest, steam available title, is Skyborn. If you play all three games, you will noticed that the underlying battle mechanic and misc. scripts have changed very little between the three. The largest change being the simplification of skill advancement, and the 'GUI' in the battle scene. But the crafting (augments), threat system, etc... All pretty much identical.\n\nTL,DR version:\nSkyborn isn't all that different from its predecessors Deadly Sin I & II, but it is different EXACTLY where it matters the most. I am referring to the story of course... If you've played the other two games and fought a single battle, you've played Skyborn's as well. While it  may look different, battles really aren't in any measurable sense.\n\nHowever, Skyborn has a far superior story line.\n\nWhile it has a few pacing issues that DS1 didn’t suffer (IMO), it is FAR better packaged, along with accompanying graphics and music. This game plays like an interactive movie... A 'B' movie with almost no budget, but respectable movie none the less. This strength outweighs its flaws to where I will recommend it, even to non RPG Maker enthusiasts.\n\nPro:\n\n- The Intro is GREAT. (First hour or so)\nThe main character is well spoken, and has very HUMAN reactions (as opposed to typical JRPG tropes) to the nature of her circumstance. The camera movement, NPC introductions, and 'framing' of the events, that sweep you off into an adventure, are spot on. This is without a doubt the best written intro to ANY RPG Maker game to date. (IMO) It is a BIG reason why I recommend it.\n\n- Unlike Deadly Sin, the maps are pretty & reasonably designed.\nOne of my biggest gripes with RPGMaker games is the haphazard nature of their maps... And while this developers previous games have been above average (in presentation) they were quite 'typical' in floor plan. Until Skyborn. Yes, it is still very linear, but there aren't nearly as many pointlessly long hallway dead ends, nor inexplicable road blocks.\n\n\nCon:\n\n- Difficulty Spikes.\nUgh... UGH!! ARGHAHH!!!!!\nWhy is this so difficult for RPG Maker developers to get even SLIGHLY balanced?!?\n(Read my Deadly Sin review if you want to read my small rant)\n\n- One collection side quest - time sink.\nA flower collecting side quest... /sigh\nThe reward wasn't even worth it... Not in the slightest.\n\n- This is Deadly Sin, re-skinned with a new story...\nIf it wasn't such an improvement over the previous titles, this would have counted for more, and likely caused me to not recommend the game... It screams laziness.  It wouldn't be so bad if the game was LONGER and BETTER BALANCED for its complete repeat of the guts of the DS titles. But it's NOT. It actually feels shorter... though that may simply be my bias.\n(Yes I realize that they made the transition to a newer RPG Maker tool set... It's still no excuse.)\n\n\nWrap Up:\nIf you liked the Deadly Sin series. Buy this one without hesitation. Even at the MSRP. It was that enjoyable for me.\n\nHowever, if you are NOT a fan of RPG Maker games... This is worth the discounted price IMO. As long as you understand you are not buying a balanced game with satisfying combat. You are buying an interactive novel with a reasonably well done story.\n\nThat also happens to have JRPG levels of grind.","July 5, 2015","true","10.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Linear gameplay (you can't go back to certain areas), good story and possibly a low amount of combat (you can avoid monsters), paired with a high amount of experience gain makes leveling and clearing the game rather easy.\n\nHowever, there is a arena mode that will offer some challenge later on (haven't tried it yet). The atmosphere and game world is beliavable and unique and the encounters differ from location to location. Music is good and mostly fitting. I wish I could resize the window to a size I wanted through the game menu - this isn't possible right now.\n\nThere are some small inaccuracies and glitches in the game. For example, an ability that's supposed to slow enemy STR and Speed by 50%, does damage for 50% of their current hp instead. Abilities could use more balance; you stop getting abilities at certain points in the game, so leveling doesn't really do much. The enemies can be very unbalanced, being easy to kill at first and then they start doing insane damage, 1 hitting some members of your party (when I went to the mine for the second time, I got hit for 30k when I had 2k hp).\n\nThe end boss is incredibly unbalanced, often almost 1 hitting my whole team and keeps doing that until i run out of mana or get critically hit. very frustrating ; i have teh best gear, augments and everything but it simply hits for too much .. even though I did skip doing colosseum and getting full card set, it should be doable as I followed the story right.\n\nI'd say the game is worth at least 5€ tho.\n\n8/10","March 17, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thus, the max level i reached is 65. The sidequest are easy to clear and the best thing in this game is that each character has different roles unlike some of the RPG I played which have same roles which is really pointless.\n\nSecondly, Some of the area in the game is confusing(contains warp) which makes me walk 1-2 rounds to remember the path to walk. To clear the spade quest(13 cards, it would require time to lurk around the map and especially map that warp it would really takes time and hunting treasure box sure is interesting)\n\nThirdly, I would just say that this is an appealing RPG game.","November 25, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is an RPGMaker game, but the creativity present in this game allows it to shine despite the limitations of the engine.\n\nUnlike many RPGs, Skyborn has zero random encounters. You encounter enemies by running into an enemy sprite on the map. The downside of this system is that enemies do not respawn, limiting resources somewhat. The lack of spawning enemies might be a limitation of RPGMaker, but Skyborn is so well polished that I can't even call this a limitation.\n\nAs a result of the enemy encounter system, there is effectively no gringind. Though this did shorten the game considerably, it kept it very much to the point. Leveling does very little to make things easier. Rather, what you do with your items, skills and equipment will ultimately determine the outcome of every encounter.\n\nDuring battle, the order in which each character may act (both allies and enemies) is displayed, allowing for deeper levels of strategy. The display wasn't immediately self-explanatory, but I couldn't help but get excited once I realized what it was. A character's speed reflects the number of times they can act before another character. Speed is a critical factor in Skyborn. It can be increased with some careful planning, but will fall drastically if a character is loaded up with equipment that is heavier than they can handle.\n\nThe graphics are pleasant to look at, and are of a very high quality for a retro 2D RPG. If you don't believe me, check out the screenshots for this game. There's no background graphics for battles (the map graphics are darkened considerably), but this ironically kept me more immersed in the battle itself. The environments are varied and gameplay elements encourage exploring. Even when it's detrimental, I never go straight for the boss. I can't help myself.\n\nThe story is decent, well executed, and draws you in. On the down side, it is a bit short, and nothing surprising happens. Optional quests are also somewhat lacking due to the game's length, but most are quite fun and challenging.\n\nThere is an optional super-boss very near the end of the game. If you have any plans on beating it, you'll probably want to keep a save file before the point of no return, so you can experiment with equipment and other such things.\n\nSkyborn is a much more casual RPG experience than I'm used to. But there are plenty of other casual RPGs that are phenomenal (Chrono Trigger and Earthbound to name a few). Skyborn isn't among the best RPGs I've played, but it is a clean, well polished game with its own unique charm.","December 16, 2014","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imonurside/recommended/278460/","imonurside","Titopotamous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imonurside/","393 products in account","Bringing to mind memories of days past, Skyborn is a turn-based Role-Playing Game that recalls famous titles from the mid-90s.\nDrawing inspiration from games that made the JRPG genre famous, such as Chrono Trigger, various Final Fantasy titles, and lesser-known gems like RoboTrek, Skyborn weaves a story that leaves those that play it wanting more, even after the end. A memorable cast of characters and well-written interactions, along with a cohesive story and a refreshing plot twist, really make Skyborn a title that no Turn-based RPG fan should go without.\nThough I enjoyed the game immensely, I did notice a couple of issues that prevent me from giving this game a full 10/10. A couple of characters had a few cliche traits that detracted a little from my overall experience. Though the character development fixes this, it comes a little too late to be completely redeemable. An overall dearth of sidequests, outside of one or two "go here, get that, come talk to me" fetch missions, is a bit hard to excuse in a genre known for its fluff and filler that add dozens of hours to a game such as this.\n\nThough the battle system is overall well-done, many times, up until near the end of the game, merely mashing the "z" key to attack and select the first target, will suffice. Enemies are plentiful enough in the game to build the party's experience levels to laughable proportions, making each battle after a certain level in an area a breeze. Later in the game, however, using each character's strenghs in conjunction with each other is encouraged, and the results are often awesome to behold, as what would have chipped a small portion from an enemy's lifebar becomes a devestating one-hit kill with a little preparation. However, even this can be fleeting, as some character class choices render them useless near the end of the game.\n\nA fully-fledged crafting system is in place in this game, and gathering the materials necessary to make the higher grades require a bit of treasure hunting in each area. However, each of these materials is often guarded by monsters, and so getting these materials, while good for armor, makes for an overly-easy endgame.\n\nAs far as plot goes, for a turn-based RPG, the lack of any single main villain makes the plot a bit dull. While character interaction attempts to make up for this, in the end, and without any main face behind all of the wrongdoings witnessed throughout the game, it ultimately falls flat.\n\nAll of that said, Skyborn is still a fantastic game, well worth the price and time. 7/10.","August 16, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I fell in love with the characters and the plot was pretty good and got me ready to see what adventures the game had in store for me.\nHowever, by the addition of the fith party member it started to feel... rushed. Characters started to contridict themselves and it felt a bit flat. The whole story was like a beginners arc to a much larger story but pushed itself straight into SURPRISE this is the end of the world as we know it and you have to save it.\nI wouldn't say that it should have been much longer, but for me it felt a bit lacking.\n\nThe battle system was unique but I found it a little frustrating when a party memeber is a dedicated healer and enemies can hardly do %20 of a member's HP. Also, you don't really HAVE to do much battling if you like to explore maps because if you do you will find glowing orbs of exp that will keep you up to speed with most bosses. I copletely ignored my equipment until the end of the game and still beat the final boss in under 10 minutes. (who was only announced right before his appearance) kinda underwhelming.\n\nOverall\nI did enjoy the first %75 of the game and felt like buying it on sale was not a waste of time or money.

Skyborn offers a standard RPG experience but with some neat features, such as the ability to forge more powerful weapons and armor and adding augments to further enchance equipment. These Augmentations can either make you more physically imposing, a more powerful spell caster or a more nimble character overall. So there is a small element of battle preparation and strategy when forging and augmenting your party's equipment.\n\nVisually it's much like many RPG Maker and 16-Bit era RPGs of it's day though some of the steampunk aspects stand out a little for me. Music and sounds are pretty good as well, with some haunting melodies and catchy battle themes, though the sounds used are standard RPG Maker stock noises. Battles play out like many J-RPGs in that each character and enemy take their turn with a choice of physical attack, special skill, or defending. Though I've only started playing this game I highly recommend giving it a try, especially if you are a fan of RPGs in general, you will not be disappointed.","September 1, 2014","true","19.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Thought I'd turn it on, play a few minutes and go meh. To my surprise I was enjoying it. Story is so far is... meh generic jrpg/rpg story line. However, it was the innovation with game mechanics for a jrpg that I was enjoying. Like a MMO it has a threat system. Balancing that threat bar to have your healer/squishies not be attacks and have your big swoll guy take all the damage. As well as mana regen in combat through either regular attack or when character turn ends (haven't figured out which one it was). As I keep playing though I do hope there are some more rpg elements like a class system or story choices... so on ward.. to keep playing and find out.    So far I would recommend it. For either a intro into the jrpg genre or just  innovation with the combat system.

If you're interested in it, I'll send you the whole review, just!\n\nPros\n-Great world! It starts out fairly average, but it later reveals itself. It has a few interesting concepts, worth looking into.\n-Unique combat system. It's a mixture of the classic turn-based combat, with a few more modern Skills and Gameplay concepts, akin to MMOs, like a threat system, big focus on buffs and debuffs rather than pure firepower, and good interaction and role separation between classes.\n-It looks pretty good.\n-Music is simply fantastic! It really reminded my of Golden Sun. While it's not quite at that level, it's still very good, and it feels more modern sounding. I really liked it.\n-Provides a good challenge on Hard Mode without feeling too frustrating (until the last 2 Bosses, which are impossible unless you do absolutely every objective before heading into the final section of the game. However, nothing previously indicates that to be the case, which one is likely to miss, not realizing it until it's too late to go back.)\n-No random encounters! You can see those encounters on the screen, approaching at will.\n-Retry feature to get right back into a battle when you're defeated.\n-Good control scheme (I personally used a controller for a more laid back experience, and it worked fine).\n\nCons\n-Lack of any resolution options, leaving you with a very badly scaled game in Fullscreen, or just a small window (the latter is recommended, Fullscreen looke hideous).\n-Poor interface design, looking very average, and not very functional.\n-The crafting system was awful to navigate, and didn't provide much benefit, as you could earn enough gold to render it useless, as everything would be for sale.\n-The game loved to surprise you with Boss Fights, and having you walk for half an hour if you did something wrong regarding leveling, or equipment. Some Boss Fights also appeared out of nowhere, sometimes making it impossible to procceed without reverting a couple of Saves.\n-Low amount of Save Slots (only 4).\n-The last few maps seemed a bit too clustered and confusing.\n-Lack of information. This game is not very informative regarding some of its details, leaving it all to trial and error. Sometimes, it can be very damaging to the player's experience. Every shop, forge (for crafting) is very far apart, leaving the player with empty hands for long periods of time.\nIn the end, it was my downfall, as I literally couldn't go back, but HAD to, to be able to finish the game. Again, it does NOT give the player enough information for the player to make some decisions safely, but it was a big sore spot for me.\n\n\nOverall, Skyborn was an enjoyable experience. I liked a lot of it! But, looking back at it, it is also riddled with so, so many issues...!\nSome of those are inherent to RPGMaker, but some of those were also huge design flaws, which is disappointing.\nIf you're looking for a JRPG with a more modern feel, give this one a try! I enjoyed most of it.\nNot recommended at full price, though, 15$ seems way too high for this game. It feels small at times,and just doesn't seem worth that price point, with so many amazing games at 10$.","May 10, 2014","true","17.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It cracked my top favorite RPG Maker games, some of which are, for example, LISA and Data Hacker. Firstly, something that always annoys me while playing these types of games is the utilization of the default resources available on the engine. Lots of games feature this negative aspect and that simply takes me off the title's experience. Skyborn basically has custom everything, from the tiles, to character design, to even battle effects and battle sounds. The soundtrack is also pretty amazing and I found it perfectly fitting the game's setting.\n\nThe story in Skyborn is a huge positive aspect in my books. A civil war is occuring in the realms where this title takes place. Skyborn wish to destroy and enslave Humanity, claiming they are a better species and were born for the purpose of ruling everything and everyone. Skyborn have wings. That's enough to convince you on what side you should take, am I right?\n\nFour mechanics, and various little changes, distinguish this title from other RPG Maker games. The first being mining. By clicking on an ore located on a wall, you mine it. That simple. Secondly, crafting. Ores found by mining can be used in means of crafting new armor and weapons for your party. In third place comes augments. Items can be found all over various environments, which have the purpose of enhancing character's weapons/armor stats. And, lastly, side quest are available to extend a bit of the playtime this game can offer. I found 3 in total.\n\nConcluding this review, my final thoughts are simple: if you've been looking for an RPG that provides some kind of nostalgia, and also made in RPG Maker, Skyborn is definitely worth your time and your money. It will not be easily forgettable, as the story is indeed well crafted, from the beggining to the very end.

But not all RPG Maker games are bad - just look at Skyborn.\n\nIt's certainly not perfect. It's a little rough around the edges, there's a few minor mapping errors here and there, there's a couple glitches, and the game balancing isn't the best... but it's okay. The overall mapping is beautiful and well designed, as are the graphics themselves which are largely custom made, featuring only a few of the basic RTP assets that come with RPG Maker. The music is all custom as far as I know, and is actually rather good. My only complaint is that none of the music loops for some reason, it just fades out and starts over.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's pretty solid, if unbalanced. It uses a variant of the Charge Turn Battle System (the one from Final Fantasy X), which is in my opinion one of the best battle systems available for RPG Maker. All of your party members are decided by plot progression, and you have very little control over what skills and spells they learn (only decided by two class change events partway through the game, which change which skills you will learn), but you rarely feel like you're lacking in skill variety, and most of your skills are actually useful in one way or another. You've got an offensive fighter, a tank, a healer, an offensive debuffer and a sort of battle-mage, and each party member fills their purpose pretty well, except for maybe Sullivan, the tank, who does a great tanking job, but lacks any real offensive options at all.\n\nThe main twist of the battle system is the Threat system, which brings MMO-style aggro into a turn-based RPG, where your party member's actions will determine how likely they will be to be attacked. But other than that, it's a pretty standard system, with a very heavy focus on managing buffs, debuffs and threat.\n\nStory-wise, it's a pretty standard rebels-against-the-empire story, with a few little twists and turns. If you like the Steampunk setting, you'll like Skyborn, since it's all about steam engines and airships and stuff like that.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend Skyborn. It's a pretty good JRPG-styled game on a platform with very few good games of the genre. It took me about 12 hours to beat the game, and I did pretty much everything there was to do (to my knowledge), so it's not a huge time investment, but it's fun while it lasts.","August 14, 2014","true","27.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","0"

I thought maybe this was about dragons. I had no idea this is about dragoons. So as the story goes. YOu start out as a tinkerer named claret. So you can not name any of the characters for your own. so this is not a options game. I believe this is a RPG Maker VX ace game that was enhanced with mouse support and some keyboard support. I know a script on getting the keys E, S, F, D to work on this. Oh lol im talking about scripts. Well you arrive in a town that has no map. So good luck. not that i dont like games with no maps but its very confusing. However on this title I was not so lost as I have a high IQ to figure out where I have been and where I wanted to go. I did like the mouse support as this made the way of walking very easy to point and click to use.\n\nNow hmm the game feels like your going to do some grinding but there is very little as if you look for the little experience points in the game, then you dont really grind at all. Now I was concerned about what that has to do with the support jobs to earn. I think that the way you use the different weapons are great but the way you can only get a certain number of upgrades from the character. So if your looking for a way to get better upgrades. I believe there should be a picture of what your trying to achieve. It is like blind crafting and what are we crafting and is it better. I know this is a different perspective but crafting blindly to achieve a greater craft? You will just have to play to see what I mean.\n\nFive player support. Now that was a Party no doubt and the overall support of the last character was a 1:4 ratio as you are advancing with this character as to be like her. There are twist to her role and I support the team that came up with that. I wish there was more story to the Fey characters. If there is Skyborn 2 hopefully. I would try to support the character that is odd in the game and at least get a supply of weapons for her. I just feel characters need to support characters to a 50/50 percentage. That is how I feel I know that is not likely but character support would be nice. I do see that some of the characters really hate each other lol and so that was entertaining.\n\nOkay so I beat it once but I would replay this as to try to work on the areas I failed to see. There is a point of no return in the game and you better pay attention. The boss at the end is extremely difficult and will let you know if your worthy. So you get a free battle it seems till he decides at 30% he's had enough of you and WHAM whole party is retrying. OH the Army of the military Skyborn seems incomplete as I was not sure who the commander was or was that the point.\n\nNow the action of the sequence was intense. I did like the next character reference like something of Dragonwarrior series. I like to read the action. Can you tell? So you fight in a sequenced way of fighting and the options of availability are not in a constant order. So if you have a enemy that only gets affected by certain options of the party. So you need 3 characters at all times. If you have 1 or 2 in the other areas of the game. I believe you will see a cruel fate mostly.\n\nSo with that said. I would recommend SKyborn to a player it is rare and seems like another of its kind shall embark soon....","June 17, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Typical GBA style RPG if I had to throw it in a category. Kindof reminds me of Golden Sun or a FFIVish clone.\n\nI really do enjoy the steampunk styling, the optional battles, the battles themselves, full mouse function (one handed skill ++), augmentation of items, and the threat system. The card-like battles are a nice break from the all-too-common sprite battles (insert FF memories here). The threat system is overwhelmingly my favorite part of this game; all monsters focus their attacks on the character with the highest threat. Threat is dependent on damage dealt (think enmity/paladin if you've played FFXI), and pretty much eliminates the whole sh*t-my-healer-died headache.\n\nIt's casual; you play it when you're watching investigative murder porn or whatever. I don't even know what the game music sounds like; I've played through it with iTunes on in the bkg, nothing's missed.\n\nWhat I dislike:\ni. the menus are quite primitive. I had difficulty quickly comparing armor pieces upon pickup.\nii. sprites for the monsters are overused. Haven't finished the game yet, but would've been interesting to see different models for different baddies.\n\nWhy should you consider it? It's 15$. That's a movie; play it for 2 hours and you've been more cost efficient with your wallet than going to see a lame Thor sequel. If you miss older rpg games before the community was obsessed with graphics, you'll probably like this psuedo-throwback.","February 23, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Let's start with the good:\n\nPros:\nProbably the best overall of the RPG Maker games.\nThe protagonists are generally likeable and believable characters.\nThe antagonists do a good job of making you hate and want to beat them.\nThe game mechanics have a reasonable amount of depth and options that are introduced gradually throughout the course of the game which prevents information overload.\nWith one exception, the game plays fair and enemies generally have access to the same options and resources as the player.\n\nCons:\nVery short, especially for an RPG.\nVery easy, even on Hard difficulty. Even the optional superboss.\nThe final boss has an unavoidable death combo and the fight lasts long enough he usually gets at least one chance to use it on you at which point everyone dies. He is otherwise entirely trivial.\nMostly linear. There aren't many side quests overall and most of them are along the lines of complete an additional objective in the area you were going anyways instead of directing you somewhere else. It's also rare there is more than one place you could go and get something done at any given time.\nOnce you get past the first few levels you no longer gain skills by leveling up, only by reaching certain points in the game.\n\nWhat I'd like to have seen:\n\nAt least twice as long.\nBuff the difficulty considerably (leave Easy easy for those not looking for a hard game).\nBuff all the final boss' attacks except for the unavoidable death combo, then either make sure you always have time to react or make it not always kill everyone instantly. That way he provides a hard but legitimate challenge.\nMore side quests and side areas.\nInstead of class changing instantly granting all the skills, make it give one now and the rest with level requirements.\nMassively buff the super boss. She's honestly a joke, her best attack does 2k or 3k on all at full power. Anyone complaining she's hard didn't go in prepared at all and is taking much more damage than that.","August 4, 2014","true","40.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I like the touches they did with the battles. Overal the Ui is being the Ui and doing it's job. telling me what I need to know without overwhelming me with boxes upon boxes.\n\nStory\nThe story really interest me. has a bit of clice [parents left turns out they were rebels blah] but it's all clice when you look at all rpgs. The storys great you really can see how they play out in some scenes\n\nweapon crafting\nUnique and some what nice.\n\nstatus effects\nPlayers arn't restricted in status effects. all effects only lessen things and nothing takes away a players turn. blind something that would make you miss lowers your damage. there hasn't been a sleep spell nor has there been something that disables my player and makes me feel like that person is useless until there status effect is removed. any time I attack I feel that I'm doing something.\n\nCons:\n\nGive a character a double attack.\nI craft a steel weapon [probably teir 2-3] and recieve a weapon in a dungeon i'm dealing 400 per hit twice. and if charged for a moment 1k possibly. This really hurts the fact that the main chracter is dealing all the damage. I get that 1's a healer 1's a tank and then you have your character. but for the early story thats 1 person dealing tons of damage 2-3 shotting all the monsters for no reason.... no reason at all. My tank tanks and my healers heals are kind of weak. and my 4th party memeber who is crit happy only deals 150 base damage. so I have to protect the double attacker because she is all my damage... :/ makes the game feel like I'm forced to deal all damage with her.\n\nWeapon crafting limitation\nSo I can't see what weapons I'm making or what armor I'm making and I understand something basic like a mage can't wear something heavy. and my tank shouldn't wear light things. but what does it all make? not knowing what desicion I'm making really hurts when I build a +2 damage for my damage dealer and get a new weapon in that dungeon moments later. or when I build something for my tank to attack and deal more damage to gain threat for the finishing blow and he gets a weapon. You can't craft weapons for other party memebers that I know of just yet. the first 4 you get you make weapons for the people who get items in the dungeon.... it makes crafting weapons worthless early on. and How was I to know?  I've just wasted resorces thats what I know.\n\ndifficulty/ bosses\nbosses on normal difficulty arn't fun... You fight monsters 2-3 shot each of them, sometimes 1 shot. you fight the boss [which i've encountered 3] they hit all of your party memebers they 3 shot the tank and the 6 shot the person i'm desperatly keeping alive using heal all the potions I can throw on her because shes the ONLY ONE that can HURT THE BOSS. and a tech boss [2nd boss] and a female skyborn boss [3rd boss] share the ablity that gives them haste + all stats pretty much. :/ like really...\n\nMoney issues. what exactly has real value...\n\nYour shops seem rather strange. you don't buy weapons you buy augments which can only be put on 1 weapon. ontop of that you don't need potions because you 2-3 shot everything. and you have a healer that uses 2-1% of mana to cast heal. and the mana used has no issues. no one has mana problems. :/ your tank uses 0 mana to taunt. your damage uses 22% to deal aoe damage which sets ablaze sometimes. and your crit happy person uses it to blind people. which just lowers damage and doesn't affect bosses... I have no clue what to spend the money on since Augments really seem like a 1 item use and you don't feel a value for them.\n\nEarly game healer/ healing outside of comabt,\n\nhealer in dungeon 1. It is little to no cost to heal and it has the problems of not really doing much of a heal inside of battle. The regen ablity is nice. and dehablity is nice but your taking a party memeber giving them the healler roll. so giving them damage doesn't really help your team. if your a healer. you need to use your action to heal. not deal damage.\n\nNo grind factor.\n\nall encounters are plotted. meaning I can't go off and grind if i'm struggling with a boss. It's fine if the enemies are plotted but if they are. they need a respawn or their needs to be a way I can grind if I feel I'm unable to progress. If i'm struggling it means I've made a mistake with my resources but I have no way of destroying my weapon to craft armor. or to craft anything that could really help me out. heck I don't even know what teir my armor is when I get it because when I crafted new armor it was same teir as class 1 and I had no clue. their for MORE resorces wasted.\n\n\n\nFinal analysis\n\n\nI played the game and I'll still play the game for more research if my mind changes on this game and i'll rereview it but from first dungeons and bosses if it remains the same then It's going to stay this way.\n\nArt 5/5\nGame play 2/5\nSound 4/5\nprice 2/5\nStory 4/5\n\nFInal verdict 6/10\n\nBuy it if it's on sale for under 10 maybe 8 dollars but its not worth your 15 dollars... it really isn't Their are plenty of games that look nice sound nice but play better then what this has to offer in its early on game play.\n","December 9, 2014","false","14.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I found the story premise to be interesting, the art to be overall nice looking, and the dungeons to be well designed. It's a fun game worth playing, but the asking price is entirely too high for what the game is.\n\nThe following reasons are why I think that the game isn't worth what they are asking for it:\n1) The game is WAY too short for the pricetag. I did absolutely everything to do in game--all the sidequests as well as the optional bosses--and I clocked in at just under 15 hours of in-game time, which includes a few times when I left the game open while doing other things. I would expect at least 15 hours of base gameplay and 3~5 hours of extras for what amounts to about $15 USD.\n\n2) The plot was interesting, but extremely under developed; the ending also did not wrap things up as well as it could have. I would have liked to see a lot more time spent developing the world lore--both historical and present--in side quests and other optional events. I would also have liked to see more intra-character development in optional quests, events, and other places.\n\n3) The crafting system, while a good idea, was poorly designed. The UI was terrible (generic message window instead of a more in-depth interface that would let you know exactly what you were crafting) and the only things worth crafting were the +2 weapons. If this system had given the TLC it deserved, it could have added hours on to the fun bonus content.\n\n4)  The battle system is poorly balanced. I went through the entire game in hard mode. On the plus side, the beginning part of the game was actually hard enough so that I had to use items (I am a person who stockpiles items "for when I need them" and then never uses them), but by the time I got to my first class change I was tearing through the enemies like they were paper. The only battles that gave me trouble were the arena ones, the Venom Depth ones, Saehral, and the final boss (although the final boss was only troublesome because of bad timing). I believe I finished the game at around level 66 (Alda was 74ish because she was 10 levels ahead of everyone else), but only because beating Saehral levelled me up at least 15 levels.\n\n5) Bugs. There were some minor bugs regarding being able to walk on tiles that you shouldn't, but the big ones was that some of the item and augment effects didn't work as advertised.","August 25, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/votetuckie/recommended/278460/","votetuckie","Tuckie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/votetuckie/","151 products in account","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls action role-playing video game series, following The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Skyrim was released on November 11, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released—Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn—which were repackaged into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition, which released on June 4, 2013.\n\nSkyrim's main story revolves around the player character's efforts to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. Set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, the game takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops their character by improving their skills. Unlike previous The Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim does not require the player to select a character class at the beginning of the game, negating a problem the development team felt previous entries had by forcing the player into a rigid play-style too early into the game. Skyrim continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.\n\nThe game was developed using the in-house Creation Engine, built specifically for the game. Skyrim is not a direct sequel to previous The Elder Scrolls games, and was considered a spiritual successor to Oblivion and 2008's Fallout 3. The team opted for a more unique and diverse game world than Oblivion's Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly responding well to the refined character development and setting. The game shipped over seven million copies to retailers within the first week of its release, and sold over 20 million copies across all three platforms.\n\nGameplay\nSee also: Gameplay of The Elder Scrolls series\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, playable from either a first- or third-person perspective. The player may freely roam over the land of Skyrim, which is an open world environment consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, cities, towns and villages.[3] The player may navigate the game world more quickly by riding horses, or by utilizing a fast-travel system that allows them to warp to previously-discovered locations.[4] The game's main quest can be completed or ignored at the player's preference after the first stage of the quest is finished. Non-player characters (NPCs) populate the world and can be interacted with in a number of ways; the player may engage them in conversation, marry an eligible NPC or kill them. As in previous Elder Scrolls games, killing certain NPCs can make some quests or items unobtainable. Some NPCs cannot be killed. If witnessed, crimes like murder and theft accrue the player bounty points in each of the world's nine districts. Should the player be stopped by a guard, they may wipe their bounty with gold or jail time, or may resist arrest which will trigger an aggressive pursuit. NPCs may allocate the player additional side-quests, and some side-quests have parameters adjusted based on nearby dungeons the player has yet to explore.[5][6] Some NPCs that are befriended or hired by the player may act as companions who will accompany the player and provide aid in combat.[7] The player may choose to join factions, which are organized groups of NPCs such as the Dark Brotherhood, a band of assassins or the player may choose to destroy them.[8] Each of the factions has an associated quest path to progress through. The cities and towns in the game world each have an economy, which the player can stimulate by completing jobs such as farming.[9]\nThe player character engages in combat with monsters while exploring a dungeon. The player may dual-wield weapons and magic at once in order to be more effective against enemies.\n\nA perpetual objective for the player is to develop their character. At the beginning of the game, the player creates their character by selecting one of several races, including humans, elves and anthropomorphic (including cat and lizard-like) creatures, and then customizes their character's appearance.[10] Over the course of the game, the player improves their character's skills, which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas. There are eighteen skills divided evenly between the three schools of combat, magic and stealth. When the player has trained skills enough to meet the required experience, their character levels up. Each time their character levels, the player may choose to select a skill-specific ability called a perk, or store perk points for later use. Unlike earlier entries in The Elder Scrolls series which used a character class system to determine which skills would contribute to the character's leveling, Skyrim allows the player to discover preferred skills as they play the game and rewards the player with more experience when a frequently-used skill is leveled.[5][11] A head-up display (HUD) appears when any of the player's three main attributes are being depleted. Attributes regenerate over time, although this process can be accelerated by using potions or regenerative spells. Health is depleted primarily when the player takes damage, and the loss of all health results in death. Magicka is depleted by the use of spells and by being struck by lightning-based attacks. Stamina determines the player's effectiveness in combat and is depleted by sprinting, power attacking, and being struck by frost-based attacks. The player's inventory can be accessed from the menu and items can be viewed in 3D, which may prove essential in solving puzzles found in dungeons.[12]\n\n","April 21, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Actually I think that's not doing it justice, I think it's actually one of the best Classic-Style RPGs I've seen. The level of detail that was put into this game with it's multitude of custom-drawn character artwork, each with multiple facial expressions. The battle system was fun and interesting, and not once did it feel "dull" or "repetitive" as these RPGMaker games tend to do sometimes.\n\nEven with the Vanilla RPGMaker Map Textures, this game knew exactly what it wanted to be and the Steampunk-ish world-setting was actually very beautiful to look at, I kinda had a huge nostalgia trip back to the days of SNES-Era Squaresoft Games such as Final Fantasy III while I was playing this. (That's what we called them back then. Nowadays, we say "Square Enix" and "Final Fantasy VI")\n\nI absolutely fell in love with the universe and it's characters. (Especially Chaska) And while the story never really graduates beyond your archtypical "Noble Rebels versus Evil Empire" which we've seen hundreds of times before, I feel as if that's not really much of a point against it when this game is so well made and so much fun to play.\n\nIn short, this is not the "same ol' same ol' RPGMaker Game just like all the others." It really stands out from the very crowded scene of RPGMaker titles which all seem to blend together sometimes. And it's just plain really damn good. Should you buy it?

They are used to create games that are everything a good JRPG should never be. However, every now and then, a new game is made with this engine that just blows away the minds of the players. Skyborn is one of those games.\n\nThe storyline is perfect, and the timing of events really helps keep the player engaged.  The protagonist of the story investigates the more grey areas of life, and how "even the most broken of things can be made into something great". Throughout the whole game I was sucked into a world of humor, action, and beauty, which leads onto my next point: the graphics.\n\nThe majority of the graphics are custom, and the graphics that are not, are used perfectly. The tiling was very well done, and I only noticed a few problems here and there, but all and all, it was very well executed.\n\nWhat makes many JRPGs boring is the repetitive and often hard battles. Skyborn does not follow the classic random battle system, but rather the player can see what enemies are on the map, and can avoid about 90% of them if they want (something I am guilty of, I must admit). Also, as the game progresses, the player can choose to upgrade the character's classes. This makes the battles very appealing and fun to engage in. There are 3 battle difficulty settings on this game, and the player can change the difficulty when ever he desires. I myself decided to play on Normal, and only switched to Easy for one boss midgame that was incredibly hard for me to defeat. The combat is turnbased, but with a large amount of strategy involved. I often found my characters taking on specific roles. For example, I had 3 support characters (1 heals, 1 buff, and 1 tank), and then I had 2 characters (female, typically :P ) that were the kickass dps of this game. I rather enjoyed this approach, and loved that I could not just barge in a battle, but rather had to think about every move I made.\n\nThe game has a pretty sweet crafting system that is indispensable at the beginning of the game, but useless at endgame. Ore would be mined, with which could be crafted into armour at an anvil, which can be found all over the world. Armour and weapons can also be "Augmented", which is the equivalent to enchanting/socekting an item. This allowed for an even more extended customizability, though I did find the lack of speed increase augmentations quite distressing (there are a few, but not many).\n\n\nThough I tried hard to find fault with this game, it just isn't happening. If you are not into linear and short games, then this is not for you, however if you have 3-5 hours to spare, than buy this game right now, you will not regret it, I promise.","June 2, 2014","true","16.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even the music will make you raise an eyebrow in notice every now and then, the game feels like the devs actually cared about it. Downsides, it IS a rather short game, took about 5+ hrs to complete, but that's because you never actually have to grind. Also, although it is story driven, there are few extra areas to explore, gameplay is very linear. Despite this, still felt like a very enjoyable and complete package, pick it up if you want a good story to hold you through a day.","February 23, 2014","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omegaclawe/recommended/278460/","omegaclawe","Omegaclawe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omegaclawe/","673 products in account","It seems to me that this game was primarily made by an artist: The art is beautiful, but the programming / systems involved are not particularly complex. Fortunately, there was a lot of hard work put into them, and despite being a simplistic affair, the combat is balanced and even strategically challenging on harder difficulties. One particular (optional) fight, which I later discovered defaulted to the hard difficulty, was amoung the most challenging RPG fights I have ever done, and yet, it was not arbitrary... it just required a lot of strategy... though by the time I finished it, I was pretty much untouchable.\n\nIn the meantime, if you don't care too much about the battles, you can drop the difficulty to easy and enjoy roughly ten hours of a well told story. It's not quite Bioshock, but many a sucessful AAA title has gone to field with worse, and it's engaging enough that I played through it in one go, without feeling any desire to stop midway through. Nor did I feel the need for a walkthrough or to look up advice on the game, which was fortunate, since there is rather little.","February 23, 2014","true","13.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was lucky enough to get it free in a giveaway, but if you are considering paying for this, I beg you to consider your money put elsewhere.\n\nThe story, and characters, are quite frankly, abyssmal. You play Claret Spencer, your typical 18 (16? I don't know she was never given an age.) year old-raging-on-hormones-because-all-girls-do-that shop mechanic. The characters act so suprised about things that should be understood so easily. The characters had to re-explain to Claret over and over certain aspects of the universe, like skyborns and magic. I've been here for ten minutes and I understand everything in this games history better than the main character that has spent her life here.\n\nAs for bugs, straight off the first weird conversation scene thing, you walk out of your shop and can just ♥♥♥♥ing walk through guard rails and stairs to stand in puddles or walls. The stairs are also really gimicky, sometimes you get thrown off of them into walls and stuff, but don't worry, just phase your way back into reality by walking in said wall till you reach the actual path again.\n\nThis game brings nothing new that is worthwhile to the table. It has a "threat" system, where enemies attack whoever of your party attacks them more, which at first seems like a cool idea, till you get a mage and relize you can constantly heal the character they're attacking and never worry about said mage taking damage, pretty much impossible to die, making combat boring pretty fast.\n\nWARNING: SPOILERS -- What I really wanted from this game was choice, I wanted to join the super-cool skyborn soldiers but instead the game makes them out to be complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who try to kill you, a random human they've never seen before, whenever they meet you. At one point you're told to follow the rebels back to their hideout and report back to a skyborn to get your brother out of prison. I was totally ready to do that, but then the "Red Spectre" tells you what "horrible" people the skyborn are, torturing humans to see if they can use magic. I didn't care, sounds like an effective way to see who can use magic to me! But when the time comes you have no choice and you're character imediately without your consent is like "HOW HORABLE IL HALP!!!!XOXOXO".\n\nI could keep going, there are TONS of plot holes in this game, your brother apparently sells your shop, and you along with it, to an actually nice rich guy who your character hates for no reason, simply because your brother wants to go out and see the world...or something. Oh and your character is mad at the skyborn because they arrested your friend/boyfriend/employee for being a half-breed when he is in fact a half-breed and the skyborn were totally right. But whatever, you're automatically good no matter what you do because you're the hero, right!?!?!\n\nAnyway, this game just infuriated me to now end, I actually quit when it MADE me sign up for the rebels. 3/10 would not play again.","September 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

If you are used to a good turn based system combat, id avoid this.

It's totally linear as in questing and travel for the most part, but I did find the story enjoyable and my only gripe is that there is no continue after the main quest.  This game would be in my minds the perfect little budget RPG if they let you keep playing to the finish some of the stuff like the arena and so on.  But I highly recommend anyone who played games like Legend of Zelda and Dragon Knight of old to try it out.","February 23, 2014","true","6.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

That's probably because the characters are really charmingly written and there weren't any cheesy lines that made me cringe like in most of the homemade RPG-Maker games. Even the character that I thought I would hate at the beginning, turned out to be very likeable and sort of funny very fast =)\n\nNext would be the music, which is in my humble opinion very solid orchestral music that always fits the environment. The dungeon music is mysterious and calm, the battle music is kind of epic, majestic and uplifting and overall the music is just very nice to listen to. Stylewise the tracks feel always very gentle, atmospheric, diversified and not just right up in your face, which I like a lot.\n\nNow to the battlesystem. Optically it has a typical RPG-Maker interface, without dynamicly fighting charactermodels, but that's fine for me, because all and all the drawn character models and the interface are very pretty.\nThe battles are turnbased and revolve around the classic HP / MP formular with the little change that is the Threat-Bar. Everytime your characters attack the enemies the Threat-Bar of those characters fill up depending on how much damage they deal and the character with the highest Threat get's attacked by the enemies, except of course when the enemies use multi-target attacks. So since you get a tank-like character very early on you want to use him exactly like that and let the others do damage/healing/status effects while keeping up the Threat-Level on the tank. Also i would recommend anyone to play this game on Hard, because that is when the battles actually get fun and strategic. So, uh... I like it =D\n\nLast but not least, the graphics are very well meshed together and the mapping is always very detailed, pretty, and never feels unnatural. Also, getting around in the dungeons never felt tedious so far, since the maps feel very natural to get through and the monsters are optional obstacles to fight (don't know if that changes later).\nAlso I dig the Steampunk-Style =)\n\nTo round this review up:\nIt's a very fun classical RPG with charming characters, good dialogue, a (so far) promising story, a slightly changed turnbased battle-system, very nice music, nice mapping, good pacing and a nice steampunk environment.\n\nI like it !!! =)","August 11, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a good game for wandering, especially in some of the later levels because it's just darn pretty! If you're like me and you want to do ALL THE QUESTS and find ALL THE THINGS, you can probably get another few hours out of it.\n\nAditionally, when they tell you that you're about to go past the point of no return, they really mean it! If you have unfinished quests, or if you just want to meander through some areas again, make sure you do it before taking on that mission.\n\nOverall, it's a gorgeous game, great music, and a wonderful story line.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sardern/recommended/278460/","sardern","Da_Beerman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sardern/","67 products in account","Skyborn is a game that I initially expected to dislike, the early dialogue is really blunt exposition that occasionally resembles a flashback episode. The game continues to push you through scripted pieces about an evil race of winged people with early twists that move so fast I hardly remember them. If you've played these kind of games on super NES this is comfort food almost that's too comfortable as the harder fights are in a Colosseum, as very few fights in the main quest will challenge those who put ingots into their weapons.\n\nYet the game eventually won me over and cleansed my snickering black heart, the game's humor is gentle and devoid of overt references and while the writing remains blunt the complete lack of cynicism lowered my defenses and was even invested in what will happen to the girl from the sewers. There is such care into keeping your attention and making the environments rewarding to explore, there are no random battles and numerous hidden places where exp boosts hide, creepy barflies that offer you suspicious drinks, and even a constantly hungry lady.\n\nFor seven hours I played this and upgraded my swords and rivet guns, a bit short for those who miss 40 hour games  from the 90s but a not a second too long. The game not only is aware of the past it embraces those old games wholeheartedly like the most affectionate love letter.","February 26, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fairly typical to the genre, but I found that it had some nice tweaks that kept it interesting.\n\nThe turn-based combat system features "threat" for each party member, which rises as that character does more damage against enemies. Enemies will always attack the party member with the highest threat, leading to some interesting decisions. The characters' special abilities were varied and each party member felt unique. Buffs, debuffs, and other status changes were key to winning battles, so I didn't feel like I was just constantly tapping the button to attack. Several times during the game the characters will be able to upgrade their class, with each of the options granting different new abilities.\n\nThere are no random battles, but instead monsters wander around the map. Once they are defeated, they're gone forever, so you can't really over-grind. Leveling up doesn't increase your stats all that much anyway, and most of your stat boosts will come from new equipment. Equipment can be forged from various stones found in the environment and further augmented with gems and other items.\n\nThe story involves the conflicts of ground-dwelling humans and winged skyborn who are gifted with magical abilities. It kept me playing and had a few unexpected twists, but wasn't anything truly ground-breaking.\n\nI first started the game on Normal difficulty, but after finding a few battles too easy I switched over to Hard. I found battles much more interesting on this setting and I kept it this way until the very end of the game. The second-to-last boss kept destroying my entire party before they could take any actions. As I was at the point of no return with no way to get better equipment, I could either load up an earlier save, or decrease the difficulty level. I chose the latter. Reading the game's author's comments on Steam, it looks like defeating the final bosses on Hard would have required a lot more effort, so my regret over this decision is minimal.\n\nIf you're looking for a relatively-short classic JRPG with a few modern twists, I'd definitely recommend giving Skyborn a shot. It's been bundled several times and I expect it to do so again, so you should be able to find it for cheap.","March 23, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's probably because the characters are really charmingly written and there weren't any cheesy lines that made me cringe like in most of the homemade RPG-Maker games. Even the character that I thought I would hate at the beginning, turned out to be very likeable and sort of funny very fast =)\n\nNext would be the music, which is in my humble opinion very solid orchestral music that always fits the environment. The dungeon music is mysterious and calm, the battle music is kind of epic, majestic and uplifting and overall the music is just very nice to listen to. Stylewise the tracks feel always very gentle, atmospheric, diversified and not just right up in your face, which I like a lot.\n\nNow to the battlesystem. Optically it has a typical RPG-Maker interface, without dynamicly fighting charactermodels, but that's fine for me, because all and all the drawn character models and the interface are very pretty.\nThe battles are turnbased and revolve around the classic HP / MP formular with the little change that is the Threat-Bar. Everytime your characters attack the enemies the Threat-Bar of those characters fill up depending on how much damage they deal and the character with the highest Threat get's attacked by the enemies, except of course when the enemies use multi-target attacks. So since you get a tank-like character very early on you want to use him exactly like that and let the others do damage/healing/status effects while keeping up the Threat-Level on the tank. Also i would recommend anyone to play this game on Hard, because that is when the battles actually get fun and strategic. So, uh... I like it =D\n\nLast but not least, the graphics are very well meshed together and the mapping is always very detailed, pretty, and never feels unnatural. Also, getting around in the dungeons never felt tedious so far, since the maps feel very natural to get through and the monsters are optional obstacles to fight (don't know if that changes later).\nAlso I dig the Steampunk-Style =)\n\nTo round this review up:\nIt's a very fun classical RPG with charming characters, good dialogue, a (so far) promising story, a slightly changed turnbased battle-system, very nice music, nice mapping, good pacing and a nice steampunk environment.\n\nI like it !!! =)","August 11, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not amazing, but not bad.\n\nIts strongest points are the setting, story, and characters. Admittedly, there are a lot of bog standard tropes across the board, but they're pretty well-executed. The world is interesting, and I found myself wanting to know more about it. The characters are well-written and more fun than I expected. The story could have benefited from more development and better pacing, but still, it was engaging enough to keep me playing to the end (seven hours or so).\n\nThat's more than I can say for the combat, however. My biggest issue with the game is how boring the combat became. I'm not an RPG veteran by any stretch, and I paid almost no attention to Skyborn's mechanics, yet I was still able to snooze through all but one fight. Sooner rather than later, Claret got some mega-OP skills that obliterated anything that tried to get in her way, which completely trivialized most of the enemies and turned encounters into tedious detours. Also, the combat screen uses default RPG Maker enemy sprites, which often look weirdly out of place amongst the otherwise consistent anime aesthetics.\n\nFinal verdict: yes, it's worth playing, but wait for a sale.","June 29, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sprites themselves had excellent articulation (Claret's hammering and Dhacian's sword come to mind), and the various expressions of the characters were extremely well done. The Claret-in-Prometheus-Engine sprite seemed a teensy bit off (color-wise) in a couple of frames (and I was dissappointed that it didn't replace the standard walking sprite in the final dungeon), but not jarringly so. The artist really should get a round of applause.\n\nWRITING: This game's writing is very well done. In terms of plot, the story is familiar without being boring, and unusual without needing a compendium's worth of beforehand knowledge. The dialogue is both written and presented well. I know you don't know me, but that is very high praise coming from me; I am unbelievably nitpicky when it comes to dialogue and dialogue presentation. Skyborn does both quite well. The characters are believable and well-written, and especially unusual is that I did not find even one single character annoying!\n\nSOUND: Very good. The music always fit the mood of the scene and was never once annoying. The choice to not use the battle theme in tense moments keeps the player immersed in the feeling of the scene. I have no complaints about the music.\n\nMECHANICS: Autodash is wonderful, as always. The battle system works well with all available features and functions. Sometimes I swear I just couldn't keep threat on Sullivan, but the threat system was rewarding and satisfying no less. Mechanically, the game is sound. I do have a few issues that I will outline below:\n\n- The Platina Coin augment does not confer blind as is stated by its description, but silence instead.\n- The status effects are not adequately described ingame; without having and using a skill that causes them, it's difficult to know what a status effect does when it's inflicted on you or an enemy.\n- The overall effect of the +1-4 Metal Ingots could have been explained better. I had no idea that it affected more than just attack damage and weight.\n- The Exploration Points (sp?) seemed oddly out of place. There was no counter keeping track of how many I'd found, and frankly, they seemed like a last minute addition to re-balance the game. They come off as a bit of a clumsy afterthought to me.\n\nAESTHETICS: All in all, this game is pleasant to both look at and play. The maps are well made, being both intuitive and easy to figure out (and believe me, I've seen some downright OFFENSIVE mapping in some games). The art was fantastic (Saehral really outdid herself), the sound was great, and the dialogue was arranged well. In terms of battle animations, I'd have perhaps liked to see some more custom ones, rather than stock RPGMaker animations, but they still convey what is necessary. There were a few capitalization errors in a few item descriptions, in particular the Branch of Life, Ether, Medical Herb and Potion, but not everybody is a Grammar Nazi.\n\nCONCLUSION: This is more than an above-average game; this is a very good game that's easily worth the full price. It'll keep you busy for 10 hours minimum - more if you take care of all the bonus content - and you'll have a good time while you're at it.","June 22, 2014","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In general I can tentatively recommend buying this game. Best to wait for a sale.\nHaving said that here is a rundown of things that the game does right, only to squander it.\n\n-The game introduces early on an airship. This is great and makes for a nice start. Only it goes nowhere with this, you can only use it very late in game to travel to old areas and not many at that. Considering the short length of the game, I wonder why it was included at all.\n\n-Tileset and general look of the game is very nice, if you like the RPGmaker. It feels all very cohesive and fitting. Sadly there is very little interaction with the environment. No flavor text when looking through bookshelfs or things like that.\n\n-No random battles is a nice change of pace. In general the combat is well thought out and nuanced. Such a shame then that the game can't be arsed to tell you that. Nearly all mechanics go unexplained, the different dmg sources and how they are dependent on your stats goes unmentioned and the buff mechanic is a huge mess.\nThe only indicator what buffs/debuffs your characters have are small shifting Icons, which I still haven't completely learned by the end of the game. Though that is still a lot better than what you know about the enemy. You can't check whether your debuff is still active on him, only see once it's applied and it pops out briefly once it fades. If you haven't paid attention for a single turn, you might have missed that your debuffs are gone. Which can mean instant death against the tough optional bosses.\n\nSo why recommend it? The story is nice and manages to tell a tale driven by it's characters. Those same characters manage to feel real enough, though I guess that is a matter of taste. So again, a tentative recommendation.","March 14, 2014","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's crafting, an arena, collectables and tons of places to explore.\nThe story is pretty well written. The characters were memorable. Their individual storylines were awesome to read and wove into the main story really well. (Personally, Alda's is my favourite storyline. Especially the end.)\nIt plays a little like a visual novel.

It takes a bit of experimenting and trial & error to work out exactly what's going on in the game.\nMouse interaction was not smooth. It was difficult to navigate the inventory. Mouse control over the menus was pretty clunky as well.\nQuest menu sucked. Sometimes the writing at the end would be cut off and it was impossible to read the last couple of steps.

I enjoyed it and recommend this game.\n\nStory: 8/10\nVisual: 7/10\nAudio: 9/10\n>>>Overall: 8/10\n\nLong version:\nThis game has many unique plot interests and story points that truly feel planned and thought out rather than the scripted tropes many RPG Maker games force on players. Also, there is some room at the end for a possible sequel. The locations to explore, though somewhat easy to lose one's self in, remind me of old school RPGs that did not hold your hand with a map or perfectly linear routes (I honestly prefer this style, it makes you have to think or make notes). The music to this game was very fitting and truly gave me the full experience I'm sure the developers were intending. I appreciated how it flowed well with the art style and visual feel of the game. The one thing I wished to see was character pictures in chat for all talking NPCs that did not have character busts.. it's odd to me seeing a text box show up with no image. I also wish the game had cause to visit more locations, since the game could've easily extended to a total of 12 hours with how much backstory and develpment they could have entertained.\n\nOverall, this has been one of the better RPG Maker derived games that I have played, and truly one that was worth the money. I hope you folks out there on Steam give this a chance, and I hope that you developers reading this are already working on a followup for this excellently crafted game.

It reminds me of FF6, mixing steampunk and fantasy. The characters are quirky and funny, the plot, while not the greatest, is quite good. I like the "threat meter" system, it's pretty innovative, and the visuals and designs of the maps as well.\n\nThe only downside about this is that the ending felt a bit too rushed, I feel as if few of the characters had little character developments, or had their developments off screen, as well as some of the characters' histories (we only get short descriptions of the more important things but what about the less important but still interesting ones? To get the players to invest more into the characters) There's only very little sidequests, and lack of downtime scenes (like a breather episode to get the tension off from the heavy-burdening duties, which shouldn't only be in the ending).\n\nBut overall its really enjoyable!","June 3, 2014","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I waited until it came packaged in a bundle sale, and I actually feel I made away like a thief for the price I paid.\n\nI've been playing RPGs since the early-mid eras of the Final Fantasy (and other 8-16-bit console games), Wizardry, and Might and Magic games, as well as a fair share of "real" indie RPGs like the Avernum series, Planet Stronghold, Loren Amazon Princess, Deadly Sin 2, and even Science Girls! I'm getting a bit jaded on the whole grind-heavy RPG genre as a whole, but even so, I had no real qualms about this game.\n\nYou can honestly play the game how you want:\n- No random encounters\n- level-ups give you very few stats in comparison to equipment, i.e. you can skip as much as you can sneak past\n- powerful equipment is found via exploration, crafting, or the optional dungeons and colosseum battles\n- crafting is actually useful and you find all the materials you need during normal gameplay: no random drops or farming!\n- many of my "expert" tier craft items were actually used instead of my "unique" endgame loot\n- powerful augment items and accessories to further customize the roles of your equipment and characters\n- a number of class changes that include skill and stat choices for all characters\n- incentives for exploration: rare equipment, unlocking new areas, and experience bonuses\n- surprisingly strategic combat skill decisions and equipment trade-off choices\n\nThe characters and story are somewhat typical JRPG fare, but they maintain enough character to be interesting enough in their own right and be fairly memorable, helped by the well-drawn and expressive character art sprites (as seen in the pics). There's also a fair bit of light humor, although it's usually not the blatant laugh-cue type of humor. Instead, it tends to be due to quirks between the characters' interactions; you can take it or leave it without offending you either way. An example of this might be meeting an oddball NPC and having two of your characters giving each other wide-eyed looks.\n\nProduction quality seemed pretty good overall, excepting the usual annoying RPG Maker limitations like game settings being tied to your save file instead of globally, so you have to switch to windowed mode every time, or the game's volume is always at full blast when you start the game -- use your Windows volume panel to adjust the game's volume individually instead. The music, sound, and special effects aren't going to win any awards, but they're all better than average.\n\nThe game is indeed a bit short: Played at a leisurely pace, 17 hours in Steam, 12 hours logged in saves, and that's with all the optional content. However, you never really feel like you're wasting your time. Even the larger areas manage to mitigate extreme tedium, being that most treasure and combat is optional.\n\nI remember playing many crappy RPGs on my SNES as a kid. I could easily see this game being something I would've really enjoyed back then and reminisced on as an adult. I can't say this game will distract you from the flashier games available on Steam, but if you're for a good, low-key, SNES-style RPG that's not too time-demanding, Skyborn should be at the top of your list!","June 4, 2014","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Can be finished in under 10 hours, which I feel was a perfect amount of time to play it.\n\nThe story is mostly a well trodden one, with twists every so often that actually caught me off guard (and quite a few that made me go... really?). The ending is a little anti-climactic, and I really recommend playing it on the Hard Difficulty setting if you are looking for a challange.\n\nThe combat is alright. Standard Dragon Quest fare, with the addition of a threat system, which more often than not got on my nerves. There are a few 1HKO mobs later in the game that will wreck your ♥♥♥♥ if you aren't careful, but most if not all can be managed with a little brain power. There are also out of combat puzzles, but they are your standard "Find the switch" type things, which usually will lead to a nice reward for completing it.\n\nI also enjoyed the sidequests, and outside of one optional boss, I completed all of the side quests. They are few in number, but they are quite useful in getting your BIS gear and being able to actually hold a candle to that optional boss.\n\nFor $15, you could definiately do much worse. Its a nice experience for the time given, and the price point isn't too high. I might wait on it to go on sale during the summer sales (if it does), but if you want an old school style RPG, give it a try, and see if its the RPG for you!\n\n(I did encounter a few bugs, namely a RGSS3 bug that makes your arrow keys not work.

If an RPG has a good plot in an interesting setting with unique characters and a good combat system, who cares how it was made?  Luckily, Skyborn has all this and more.  It starts off fairly easy but the combat system has enough depth to really give you a challenge after the first few areas.  I played on medium difficulty and I found the battles challenging and fun.  There are also plenty of optional battles in the late game that will challenge you, but they're not needed to beat the game. The story is the best part of Skyborn.  There's a unique setting combined with memorable characters.  The game is a nice length as well.  It's probably 11 to 15 hours total.  I did all 4 sidequests along with the arena and the Venom Depths which are optional, along with maybe 45 minutes of afking for dinner, beer, and bathroom breaks.\n\nAs far as the details of the game go, I enjoyed the level design.  Graphics are SNES level, but I'm playing for the plot and there were some moments where certain levels looked quite pleasing and so I'd say the graphics are fine for the genre.  The plot and setting were great.  This isn't a generic steampunk cliché universe.  There's no annoying puzzles and all but one time it was clear where to go next. The crafting and augmenting system is deep enough to cause you to put some real thought into what to upgrade and it's fairly open.  You can skip crafting if you like, but it's fun to forge very powerful weapons for your favorite character.  The music was ok, not fantastic.  Sound effects were solid.  In the first 2 to 3 hours of the game, the enemies can seem a little repetitive and it's a bit too easy (on medium) but that changes.  There's also no real "grinding" levels.  Enemies do not respawn so it's to your advantage to fight every enemy, but you don't just have to sit around leveling up.  Bosses are challenging and feel epic.  Overall, I'd give the game an 8/10 for being an enjoyable, well made RPG.  It's a bit expensive at the current 15$ price tag, but if you can pick up this game on a sale, it's worth it.","May 8, 2014","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shops were placed conveniently between stretches of dungeon to buy (or make) better weapons and armor.

Some areas (Nordenwald Forest *cough*) were rather lengthy with extended puzzles involving painful walking from one end of the map to the other.

I enjoyed playing the game for the most part.  The story may use a tried and true plot device, but it does contain a few twists that I, at least, didn't see coming.  The world is fairly small, but most of the areas are very diversified so it doesn't feel that way.  Also the smithing is a nice touch, though I would have liked to make higher quality armor as well.\n\nMy problem with the game was the combat balance.  For one I almost immediately turned the game up to hard.  This is something I almost never do as I generally like to keep combat just difficult enough that I keep interested without becoming a hassle.  On Normal there was absolutely no challenge.  For most random encounters that didn't change much on Hard.  Boss battles, came in two varities: 'What just wiped me in 2 seconds' or 'what did I just roll over.'  There are certain skills in the game (For you and your enemies) that are just ridiculously strong.  But if you don't use them, then battles just drag on because at least with how I was building characters (trying to emphasize +Str as much as I could!) only 1-2 of my characters ever did appreciable amounts of damage.  Also the character classes are very specialized. Only certain people dealt damage, and at times it really felt the only reason "threat" existed was to give the tank something to do on his turn.\n\nOverall Story is a +, game balance is a -.  Take your pick on which is more important to you.","February 24, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A Threat System, in a Turn-based RPG? Awesome! The Action List reminded me of games like Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy Tactics, while the Threat System clearly takes ideas out of MMORPGs.\n\nThe Crafting system has its flaws; you can't see WHAT you're about to make until you've already made it, but thankfully you can save anywhere so you can save before you use your materials. A couple hours into the game and I'm already making "Tier 3" gear, so something tells me the game isn't hugely long. But then it doesn't have to be; I've played a lot of Sub-5 hour games and enjoyed them for what they were.\n\nThe story seems well-written thusfar, it is basically a Final Fantasy in a Steampunk setting. Pretty standard fare, though this isn't a bad thing for those looking for some nostalgia. The characters seem fairly well-done, each with their strengths and weaknesses (though the Claret seems a touch overpowered). The Magic and Energy Systems are well-implemented and make sense, and the Class Changes were an interesting addition as well.\n\nOverall: 8.5\n\nShort, enjoyable nostalgia trip for those of you who remember the SNES Era Final Fantasy/Lufia-type games fondly.","June 11, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the "threat meter" system, it's pretty innovative, and the visuals and designs of the maps as well.\n\nThe only downside about this is that the ending felt a bit too rushed, I feel as if few of the characters had little character developments, or had their developments off screen, as well as some of the characters' histories (we only get short descriptions of the more important things but what about the less important but still interesting ones? To get the players to invest more into the characters) There's only very little sidequests, and lack of downtime scenes (like a breather episode to get the tension off from the heavy-burdening duties, which shouldn't only be in the ending).\n\nBut overall its really enjoyable!","June 3, 2014","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art work for this game is also very nice to look at, not professional mind you but still very good. The maps and out side world are pleasant with lots to look at but not filled with clutter.  this game offers a crafting system that on one hand is rewarding to find components to craft with, but unfortunately the crafting system leaves something to be desired. all in all this game has good balance the character roles are well defined. my mage is not a tank my tank is not a DPSer and I have options to develop my character classes the way I want to fit with my play style through class upgrades reminiscent of the original Final Fantasy games.  I felt the ending was a bit rushed and you can get through the story line rather fast so you wont be racking up 40+ hrs of game time on this one you might not even get half that. so I wish the game had been a bit longer with some more side quests to do or even a bit more towards the end.  I don't want to be down on this game just fair. I will add that this has been the most enjoyable game of its type I have played so far. great work!!!","January 20, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's extremely well written and definitely one of a kind. It has it's flaws, I actually found it to start getting a little slow towards the middle, but not unbearably so. Short gameplay, but a really fulfilling story and interesting lore. My major quarral was the lack of the ability to complete the side quests after the main story was through. I'll drop it a star for that, because it was a pretty major letdown. Otherwise, it's a four out of five stars. This is my first playthrough of an RPG Maker title, so maybe as I realize the potential of this engine by playing games in the future (created in RPG Maker) my review might change.

No pause feature ftw, anyways... I enjoyed the game for the most part, I think that the combat system could use some work however, primarily the fact that it's more of a whoever can hit the hardest the fastest wins type system. I had taken the pure dark side of corwin and actually have to say minus the lacking of any revival it was really nice being able to never worry about health until you get to the insta killing foes(there were only such when you are undergeared, I didn't finish the colleseum, just enough for gear and such from the shops due to the tough guys, have to say they are stronger than anything you encounter after it...). The music was decently done, though I'd have liked some intense music during boss fights... And the end boss was a big let down...hell there is a tougher fight in the same area in the form of a reoccuring NPC who talks about food a lot(Forgot her name, couldn't even come close to beating her). Over all though I'd recommend this game purely for a quick hit it and quit it game, the main issue I had was that it looked like it was made on one of the RPG makers and as such lacks any real potential that a hand crafted game could have(odds are it may have been hand done, but just wasn't planned to be pushed further... either way it's still good) I'd love to see a sequal or what happens next, though I'll say that the story definately could of used some work, and chaska while I loved her design, her personality was poorly done... the others were at least somewhat respectable for their roles... I will add however that it's not worth $15 due to it's length...","September 16, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It exposes interracial and social classes conflicts in a steampunk-fantasy sort of environment. The story is good but the arcs of the characters' stories are not very complicated and there are no important choices to make or crossroads where several endings can develop.\n\nFights are not at every corner of an alley because you can visually choose (most of the times) if you fight enemies or you just ignore them. The story/fighting ratio is well balanced, but while some generic enemies are a piece of cake some bosses are a pain in the mouse's left button. By the way, while some enemies' design goes according to the world presented, some others seem to have been taken out of other very different projects.\n\nGameplay is easy either with a keyboard or with the mouse, but the UI both in the character menus and in battle is a little bit of a mess and if you pause the game for a long time you will have to re-learn almost everything. Fights are repetitive and turn-based and the special effects are not outstanding but acceptable. You can upgrade your characters' classes and abbilities but even then some of they are left behind while others grow.\n\nI recommend Skyborn if you like classical J-turn-based-RPGs and you are not too exigent.","July 1, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roania/recommended/278460/","Roania","Roania","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roania/","535 products in account","Let me tldr my review: This game's story is one of the best I've encountered from an independent studio, and the mechanics itself work quite well. But my experience has not been a positive one. I may keep playing just to enjoy the story, but probably not on my pc if I do. My experience may not happen for everyone, but I can only speak for my experience.\n\nFor the rest of you.\n\nI want to love this game. I do. I really do. But the design choices that have been made are pretty bad and the excuses made for them even moreso.\n\n640X800 is not an acceptable visual resolution in 2015, or in 2014, or in 2013, or in fact any time in the past decade. To hard code it at that level seems almost preposterous. We can blame the system he used to craft this game all we and he wants, but I have played a good number of RPGmaker games and they all worked just fine in higher resolutions.\n\nGoing on isn't explaining, so let's explain. When I enter fullscreen mode, a good 1/6 of the screen becomes invisible. Unfortunately, it's the part of the screen where all the buttons are. This appears to be hardcoded. I have tried a number of solutions to make the screen fit into my monitor, and none have worked.\n\nSo I could play it in windowed mode? Yes, but windowed mode is not resizable. And I've not had much luck in moving it around the screen, either. More importantly, I don't like playing in windowed mode and I resent being told that is my only choice.\n\nYou may be asking. why is this a big deal? Well, it isn't, strawman. It is not a big deal. It is, however, enough of one. The market is full. Crowded to the brim with games as good or almost as good as this, many of them almost as well written or even better written. When it comes to things like this, everyone decides their own place to draw the line, and this is mine.\n\nI already own the game, I wouldn't return it if I could, and I wish the developers all the best in their future endeavours. But I cannot recommend this game.","December 23, 2015","false","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Totally blew away my expectations. I didn't think a indie game would ever get me hooked, but once I started playing, I knew I had to finish. Characters are interesting and story line is great. Battle mechanics are decent and what you would expect from an old Final Fantasy game, but with a slight twist and faster paced.\n\n\nOnly bad thing I can say about it is that it is relatively short. I did everything I could in the game and took my time. Took me 13-14 hours to finish, but you can easily finish in under 9. Also the equipment and upgrading system was sub par. You would have to switch back and forth menus and you had no way of comparing equipment you craft until you actually make it.\n\nI recommend you play on hard mode if you want a challenge. Otherwise it's too easy.","December 8, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Skyborn is an RPG-Maker made game with it's unique style, the environments throught the game are very well detailed which just goes to show how much work and time the developers put on it.\nThe game is very story-driven so if you're not so much into story and more into constant action this isn't the game for you. The characters are well designed, each one having it's unique objective and background explained in the game through constant flashbacks, which in turn translates into a nice storytelling. Skyborn features a crafting system which allows you to craft armors and weapons from ores you pick along the way and an augment system which allows you to enchant them, the system itself is really simple but at the same time really addicting and you'll find yourself more often than not looking at every wall in search of ores (I know I did!).\nNot all is good about the game however. Some changes to the battle system for example (which still features some RPG-Maker standard sprites and grid system) could have been explored way better. The mouse feature, here strangely introduced, also doesn't make much sense for this kind of game, you'll find out that using the mouse will only make things more complicated and unnatural, luckily the developers added an option in the menu to toggle on/off the mouse feature. Achievements for Steam also not supported which is actually a real bummer since you have so much to achieve in this game! Oh well :)\nOverall a great game with over 12+ hours of content to explore, be it sidequesting, following the main story line or crafting in your free time.

I did not think that I would like an rpgmaker game as much as this one, especially since it's turn-based. I got the game when it was free, so wait for a sale.\n\nAwesome points:\nThere is a lot of freedom in this game. You can do whatever you want, whenever you want. There's crafting, an arena, collectables and tons of places to explore.\nThe story is pretty well written. The characters were memorable. Their individual storylines were awesome to read and wove into the main story really well. (Personally, Alda's is my favourite storyline. Especially the end.)\nIt plays a little like a visual novel. With fighting and exploring. Not bad. Lots of reading.\nDownsides include:\nLack of map, extremely easy to get lost. I would love to have a minimap or something to show locations.\nVery little tooltips. Though, that may be an upside as well? It takes a bit of experimenting and trial & error to work out exactly what's going on in the game.\nMouse interaction was not smooth. It was difficult to navigate the inventory. Mouse control over the menus was pretty clunky as well.\nQuest menu sucked. Sometimes the writing at the end would be cut off and it was impossible to read the last couple of steps. Sometimes I forgot who I had to return my sidequest to, as the place wasn't stated. Ended up running around for half an hour talking to everyone I came across.\nIf you can deal with the downsides, the game is enjoyable and worth the time.","November 5, 2015","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've finished it in normal and hard difficult\nPro:\n-from normal to hard you can really see the differences even at the first enemy, if you fail 1 turn you will lose the fight; the boss are really difficult if you don't play smart (i advise to clean every zone of the map before fight the boss so you can level up enough and find enough equipment PS: USE THE AUGMENT, THE RIGHT ONE ON THE RIGHT CHARACTER);\n-really Really REALLY difficult final boss in hard mode, i've won only at the fifth try (play so smart or you will never win)\n-every character has his story and you can understand why everyone is in the group\n-a lot of item, equipment and augment that you can find if you explore the game\n-a lot of customization for every character\n-you will receive thropy if you defeat boss in hard mode (only in hard)\n-good soundtrack\n-dont know what else i can say because i don't want to spoiler but there are more pro.\n\nCons:\n-explore everything before the "there is no turning back" or you will not finish the game in hard mode and the only thing that you will do is to restart if from the beginning becouse you will get oneshotted (or maybe just put it on easy but there will be no more fun)\n-sad ending!

Level design is refreshing, and of a very cool art style. Aside from the hero's avatars being selected from stock images, the story is very present here and quickly wraps you in.\n\nIf you are a fan of classic RPG or JRPG games such as Chrono Trigger, the original Final Fantasy series, and turn based combat; this is a nice addition for your collection. The story is well written, with a couple twists! Check it out, this game doesn't actually suck.\n\n8/10","October 2, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've finished it in normal and hard difficult\nPro:\n-from normal to hard you can really see the differences even at the first enemy, if you fail 1 turn you will lose the fight; the boss are really difficult if you don't play smart (i advise to clean every zone of the map before fight the boss so you can level up enough and find enough equipment PS: USE THE AUGMENT, THE RIGHT ONE ON THE RIGHT CHARACTER);\n-really Really REALLY difficult final boss in hard mode, i've won only at the fifth try (play so smart or you will never win)\n-every character has his story and you can understand why everyone is in the group\n-a lot of item, equipment and augment that you can find if you explore the game\n-a lot of customization for every character\n-you will receive thropy if you defeat boss in hard mode (only in hard)\n-good soundtrack\n-dont know what else i can say because i don't want to spoiler but there are more pro.\n\nCons:\n-explore everything before the "there is no turning back" or you will not finish the game in hard mode and the only thing that you will do is to restart if from the beginning becouse you will get oneshotted (or maybe just put it on easy but there will be no more fun)\n-sad ending! (even happy because you can see everyone ending)\n-no more cons for me\n\nBUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nPS(sorry if my english is not that good)\nReally like this game and i hope everybody that can play it will play it!","October 11, 2015","true","49.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiznit/recommended/278460/","fiznit","fizzy flask","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiznit/","379 products in account","LOVED This game. It took me about 8 hours to clear (I played in offline mode on my laptop for half of it). The combat is balanced and the characters are interesting and all useful in their own way. All characters are customizable from picking which skills they learn, to choosing equipment, to finally choosing which item/buff to apply to each piece of equipment. Building up my characters was the funnest part. The combat is interesting. It has a threat system where enemies focus on the party members doing the flashiest moves. Exploring the game world is vastly rewarding and encouraged. Not only do you find great gear, but you can find experience points by exploring. The game also has additional side content that I didnt complete in my 8 hour playthrough. This includes, a fighting arena, a side dungeon to explore, and finding a deck of cards that has been scattered across the land. My only complaint is that the weapon/armor crafting system in this game seems tacked on and forgettable. The items you can craft are limited and you usually have them by the time you can craft them anyway. Having said that, this is a game that no RPG fan should miss out on. 9.5/10","October 12, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will say dont take my own opinion at this point in time look at some other peoples reviews to get a better opinion of the game or look at some gameplay online.)\n\nThe game has some good music but it can be forgettable at times and somehow in my opinion it feels like theres no type of story astablished in the first five minutes even if there is a lot of dialogue in the start of the game but along with this i can also see theres no real character introductions as well it kinda makes the player to have to go on a guess at the start to figure out the personalities of each person to potentially see any development later on in the game.\n\nThe gameplay is your generic rpg gameplay you walk around and talk to people do some quests and fight some monsters. (I think this is mainly due to being used in the rpgmaker engine what seems like that could be a limitation) The Battle gameplay is somewhat interesting with having the threat meter where enemys will focus on the highest threat hero on their turn whats a very interesting mechanic what forces you to actually defend your best hero in the party and its pulled off well (in the fights i have experienced so far)\n\nThe game does seem pretty good from what i have experienced so far but theres also a factor what makes me not want to play the game again and i cant say i have a genuine oppinion untill i have completed the game so i would say dont go off from what i say look at some more reviews before getting a buyers opinion.\n\nI would recommend this game to any rpg fan but not to any newcomers to the rpg genre.","October 13, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

There is another race called the Skyborn who are opressing humans and half skyborn half humans. You eventually... <spoiler!!>\n\nWell, just play the damn game, its well worth it if you are in to this genre.\n\nPros:\n\nSaturated content, like all good RPGs should have.\n\nThis game is amazing, so many things to do, so many secrets and areas to go to.\n\nGood characters and story (the jungle mission was freaking amazing, learning the past of another character and some other things. I was like holy ♥♥♥♥ I just had fun).\n\nAmazing soundtrack. Everything just flows.\n\nAMAZING character customization, it beats many other full scale free rpg's (mmorpg's too for that matter) that I've played. You can improve, augment, create and do many more things with your items. And too many extra things to name.\n\nA lot of side missions that the npc's give (they give hints on secrets too!)\n\nAnd not to mention the npc's all have their little attitudes and get you into the lore of the game. I reccomend for having more immersion, take your time and read all the dialogue (thats what these older top down games are about guys!!!)\n\nCons:\n\nNothing in particular, it's an rpgmaker game, so expect dated graphics, but this game isn't for gamers that care about that sort of thing.\n\nAlso, this game is not for people new to the genre (it is, but some whole game quests like looking for the playing cards will get messed up if you dont literally walk on every inch of the world in every mission, or you need to go back later).\n\nEnd result: 9/10, not for everyone but it nails the content in every way possible for this genre.\n\nP.S: I got this as a free key from pcgamer, IDK if it's still available.","September 17, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Requimatic/recommended/278460/","Requimatic","Requimatic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Requimatic/","33 products in account","REVIEW:\n\n\nWhile very skeptical when first acquiring the game, I decided to give it a go and was not let down. Very similar to the RPGs of old, those seeking to re-enter that kind of world won't be let down either!\n\n\nStory - While perhaps not the most deep story ever written for an RPG, it certainly wasn't bad. It had, to me, plenty of depth for the length of the game as a whole. It also had a good amount of all the story elements one would look for. While it wasn't necessarily evoking particular emotions for me, it might for you. I give the story a solid 8/10.\n\nAudio - The sound track for the game was particularly good, which caught me by surprise. I never found myself thinking "Man, this track is annoying..." and muting the sound. Do you remember how Chrono Trigger's amazing sound track really set the atmosphere for the different areas in the game? Skyborn does the same. I give the audio a well-deserved 10/10.\n\nVisual - Again, this game takes me back. There's nostalgia everywhere. With that in mind, the graphics, sprites, artwork, etc. don't let down. Very pleasing to the eye, in every area of the game. I can't think of an area or situation in which I thought something looked like it could have been done better. The different artwork and visual effects all fit in their respective areas, and paired with the music really brought everything together. Visuals get a 10/10 from me as well.\n\nGameplay - Here's where I get really nitpicky. There are a few things here that could be done better, so I'll list them in no particular order:\n\n1. Mouse controls - During battles (which were handled great! no random battles!), I found myself accidentally clicking on an option I didn't intend to. For example, a few times I misclicked and ended up "Guarding" on a turn that I needed to do something else... because the curser was "stuck" on the icon beside it. It's kind of hard to describe, but if you're careful it isn't too much of an issue.\n\n2. DEBUFFS - This one is a major gripe for me. You can track buffs/debuffs on your party with a visual alert in the upper-right corner of their portraits. Enemy debuffs, however, you have to deliberately watch for "-DebuffName" to appear in text near the bottom of their image when it wears off. This can be very, very debilitating to your plans if a necessary debuff (Majesty, for example) falls off without you noticing it... which is very possible if the enemy uses some form of buff that either removes it, or grants them all kinds of buffs and your debuffs just happen to fall on off that turn anyway.\n\nFor future games, I would most definitely recommend some kind of visual aid for enemy debuffs, if possible. Granted, there was really only a few situaions where it was of dire importance that I had to keep track of enemy debuffs, but it meant a party wipe (no joke) if one fell off and I didn't notice.\n\n3. Difficulty - Not necessarily a gripe, but also not necessarily something I can comment on entirely. The game has 3 different combat difficulties: Easy, Medium (Normal?), and Hard. I played through the game on Normal, and found it to be far too easy in parts. I haven't played through it again on Hard, so I can't comment on Hard mode; however, given the resources available to you, "Normal" difficulty becomes a little too easy. (Except for a few parts, but I'm not going to spoil anything here.)\n\n4. Game Length - I put in 15 hours to this game before completion. This is with about a 99% completion rate. While 15 hours is a far cry from the 50 to 60 hours a game like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 3 (6) had with a similar completion rate, it was pretty generous for this game. Also note that about 4 of those hours are me back-tracking in the damned forest.\n\nWith those small issues in mind, I'm going with an 8/10 on the gameplay. It had everything I liked, a little more, but also a few issues I feel could have been handled better.\n\n\nVERDICT:\n\nOver all, I give Skyborn a 9/10, and a high recommendation to anyone who grew up with the great RPGs from the SNES era, who are looking for a piece of nostalgic greatness. A true diamond in the rough, I really hope to see more like this from the developers. (Even a sequel would be great!)","September 17, 2015","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trite-n-tragic/recommended/278460/","trite-n-tragic","dk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trite-n-tragic/","238 products in account","I honestly had my doubts when it came to another RPG Maker game. I waited until it came packaged in a bundle sale, and I actually feel I made away like a thief for the price I paid.\n\nI've been playing RPGs since the early-mid eras of the Final Fantasy (and other 8-16-bit console games), Wizardry, and Might and Magic games, as well as a fair share of "real" indie RPGs like the Avernum series, Planet Stronghold, Loren Amazon Princess, Deadly Sin 2, and even Science Girls! I'm getting a bit jaded on the whole grind-heavy RPG genre as a whole, but even so, I had no real qualms about this game.\n\nYou can honestly play the game how you want:\n- No random encounters\n- level-ups give you very few stats in comparison to equipment, i.e. you can skip as much as you can sneak past\n- powerful equipment is found via exploration, crafting, or the optional dungeons and colosseum battles\n- crafting is actually useful and you find all the materials you need during normal gameplay: no random drops or farming!\n- many of my "expert" tier craft items were actually used instead of my "unique" endgame loot\n- powerful augment items and accessories to further customize the roles of your equipment and characters\n- a number of class changes that include skill and stat choices for all characters\n- incentives for exploration: rare equipment, unlocking new areas, and experience bonuses\n- surprisingly strategic combat skill decisions and equipment trade-off choices\n\nThe characters and story are somewhat typical JRPG fare, but they maintain enough character to be interesting enough in their own right and be fairly memorable, helped by the well-drawn and expressive character art sprites (as seen in the pics). There's also a fair bit of light humor, although it's usually not the blatant laugh-cue type of humor. Instead, it tends to be due to quirks between the characters' interactions; you can take it or leave it without offending you either way. An example of this might be meeting an oddball NPC and having two of your characters giving each other wide-eyed looks.\n\nProduction quality seemed pretty good overall, excepting the usual annoying RPG Maker limitations like game settings being tied to your save file instead of globally, so you have to switch to windowed mode every time, or the game's volume is always at full blast when you start the game -- use your Windows volume panel to adjust the game's volume individually instead. The music, sound, and special effects aren't going to win any awards, but they're all better than average.\n\nThe game is indeed a bit short: Played at a leisurely pace, 17 hours in Steam, 12 hours logged in saves, and that's with all the optional content. However, you never really feel like you're wasting your time. Even the larger areas manage to mitigate extreme tedium, being that most treasure and combat is optional.\n\nI remember playing many crappy RPGs on my SNES as a kid. I could easily see this game being something I would've really enjoyed back then and reminisced on as an adult. I can't say this game will distract you from the flashier games available on Steam, but if you're for a good, low-key, SNES-style RPG that's not too time-demanding, Skyborn should be at the top of your list!","June 4, 2014","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You control a band of characters that are trying to save the world from the tyrannical yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill. It was all made with RPG Maker, but don't let that turn you off -- I'd say it's worth a look.\n\nI found this game rather charming. While the plot, music, and graphics aren't the newest and shiniest things ever, everything is good quality and holds together well enough for me to enjoy playing through it -- I even want to run through it again later. There are moments between characters to establish them more beyond "insert hero person here", and the world combines steampunk with a more standard fantasy setting in a way that's enjoyable, with more going on than is apparent at first. While there might not be a whole lot more to do than just the main story, there are some sidequests for players who poke around looking for extra treasure, and there's a crafting/augment system for people who want to micromanage their equipment a bit more.\n\nThe battle system is pretty fun to work with -- each character has a threat level that rises as they do damage, and whoever has the highest threat will be soaking up most of the attacks. The key is to make sure the tankiest character in your group keeps their threat level the highest (easier said than done, at times!), and I feel it works fairly well. Most fights are fairly simple, though there are some trickier fights later in the game -- the final boss and bonus boss in particular are pretty darn hard to deal with.\n\nAll in all, I'd say give this game a try if a charming little steampunk/fantasy turn-based RPG with fun characters and a neat battle system sounds interesting to you.","March 7","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's surprisingly well written, and the gameplay is well balanced.\n\nThe gameplay is far from revolutionary, apart from the 'threat'-mechanic which I've never seen before, but works really well and is nicely streamlined. It's well balanced, but some areas lack a little polish. That's acceptable since it was made by a small team, and it never breaks the game in any way. The soundtrack is nothing revolutionary either, but at least it's nice music and it fits the settings it plays in.\n\nThe main characters are well written and realtable. The game succeeded in making me like the heroes and at least disliking the villains enough that I agree with the ultimate goal the heroes are working towards. The story is not overly dramatic, it doesn't try desperately to be funny all the time, and it's not all grim or lighthearted. It introduces characters at a good pace and gives them space to develop over time.\n\nThis game is like a good fantasy-steampunk book, with monster slaying in between every chapter. The game succeedes in really feeling like an adventure, but it never loses sight of the end goal.","February 24","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterZoentrobe/recommended/278460/","MasterZoentrobe","MasterZoen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterZoentrobe/","172 products in account","Overall, this a very good game. Although it's got a few problems, these can easily be overlooked.\n\nThe Good\n________\n\nStory: The plot is engaging, with a lot of neat moments where you feel emotionally compelled to keep playing. If you're playing an RPG, you NEED a good story to compel play. At the beginning you're forced to betray/trick someone to save your family. Who isn't willing to do everything they can for their family?\n\nBGM: The music is very atmospheric, usually fitting situation well and sound very much like music from games on the PS2 or XBOX. The music is in stereo as well, but this is less useful than stereo sound effects.\n\nGraphics: The visuals are reminiscent of the 16-bit era of console gaming in terms of color and the sprite drawing methods common on the NES/SNES, Genisis, and PSX. More than anything else I'm reminded of the original Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest) 1-3 and Breath of Fire 1 and 2 games in regards to gameplay, with a Town overmap, a menu overmap, dungeon overmap, and world overmap, along with the turn based combat system. Also, when going full screen on my monitor the game doesn't look bad, but doesn't have 1080p support running at 640x480, so probably won't work well with or look good on TVs.\n\nThe Bad\n_______\n\nSound: The sound effects are very subpar by todays standards, but equal to if not better than those of the 16-bit and 32-bit console era. The sound effects do not seem to be in stereo.\n\nSound/Visual Timing: Often sound effects, i.e. attacks in combat, will occur just before the visual identifier does. This tends to throw the combat immersion right out the window for me, but it's not overly horrible, and certainly doesn't break the game.\n\nThe Ugly\n_______\n\nControls: X-input controllers, that is to say anything resembling the Xbox 360 controller, have wonky button command registers, with Menu/Cancel being assigned to B and Interact/Accept being assinged to X, and Previous Page/Next Page being assigned to Back/Start respectively. Worse, still, there is no way to reassign them in game.\n\nThe controls for D-input controllers, resembling Playstation 2 or 3 controllers, is much better with Menu/Cancel being assigned to X and Interact/Accept being assigned to O, and Previous Page/Next Page assigned to L2/R2 respectively. The Logitech F series controllers 310, 510, and 710, are able to switch between these input types, so I recommend using D-input with them. I've tested PS3, Wireless Xbox 360 for Windows, and Logitech F510 controllers with this game.\n\nMouse and keyboard are simple enough with the avatar attempting to take the shortest route to where you click on the overmaps or moving in the cardinals with the arrow keys, and clicking on commands and enemies in combat or selecting them with left/right arrow keys and pressing enter.","February 19","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters and dialogue are great, are the environments are lush. My main complaint is that it's seems rather short: the game was over before I at all felt like the story was coming to a climax (there were actually a few sidequests that I hadn't quite finished, which I figured I'd have ample opportunity to return to). So my pacing about building equipment and using rare items was totally off. I was also disappointed with the total lack of controlling an airship on a overworld map. Despite these gripes, I really enjoyed the game and heartedly recommend it. I will definitely be playing it again in the future!","June 19, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game play is short, but works. The characters are nice, although somewhat predictable.\n\nWhat got me was that my party was slowly becoming a glass cannon. You can easily avoid monsters, and there is no obvious leveling ground.\n\nAs such, I started my "no turning back now", and was able to easily make it to the end boss, including killing all the bosses within the area before the final boss.\n\nBut then, the final boss has an AOE that one shots my entire party.\n\nSo that is my only complaint, that you really need to attack monsters while going through, don't avoid them. If you do, you can easily end up not knowing the end of the game because the last boss is just so much more powerful.","June 7, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It exposes interracial and social classes conflicts in a steampunk-fantasy sort of environment. The story is good but the arcs of the characters' stories are not very complicated and there are no important choices to make or crossroads where several endings can develop.\n\nFights are not at every corner of an alley because you can visually choose (most of the times) if you fight enemies or you just ignore them. The story/fighting ratio is well balanced, but while some generic enemies are a piece of cake some bosses are a pain in the mouse's left button. By the way, while some enemies' design goes according to the world presented, some others seem to have been taken out of other very different projects.\n\nGameplay is easy either with a keyboard or with the mouse, but the UI both in the character menus and in battle is a little bit of a mess and if you pause the game for a long time you will have to re-learn almost everything. Fights are repetitive and turn-based and the special effects are not outstanding but acceptable. You can upgrade your characters' classes and abbilities but even then some of they are left behind while others grow.\n\nI recommend Skyborn if you like classical J-turn-based-RPGs and you are not too exigent.","July 1, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I completed this rpg in about 15 hours and I must say it was well worth it. But as usual, I like to give my likes and dislikes with every review so let's begin.\n\nLikes:\n1. Compelling story, truly an innocative piece. The whole story surrounding skyborn is enthralling and worth discovery the aspects of what, how and when did they came to be.\n2. Characters are well thought out and utterly enjoying, had a few laughs and lead protanganist stoood out quite clearly among the others, however I must say all contributed to making the game enjoyable.\n3. Battle system is damn good for an RPG such as this, developers got this down. Skills were on point for each character and it was nice that they thought of an upgrade system as well.\n4. Augmenting system was verry good, love that aspect. did not use much of the actual making thing part of the game, but that was also well done.\n5. Grapppphics, the graphics of the game is astounding, this is the first 2D..I think, rpg with such beautiful graphics I was amazed. Cleaan and not overbearing.\n\nSeee basicallly, a recommended game from all of these points. But on to dislikes.\n1. Sometimes there was some kinda lag or drag...like a fps thing. I am rather confused why this happens since it requires limited specs to run.\n2. Difficulty, yes I played it on hard, so why the hell am I complaining if I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me. Welll....I defeated MOST of the bosses on hard, but the thing is once you defeat a monster, they dont respawn so you basically have a limited level cap from what exp points you gather. So the question is, how on earth I am suppose to beat something when you go from 1 to 1000 in the gap between one battle to the next. NUH MEK NO SENSE TO ME. But I digress I changed the difficulty in 4 instances because of this.\n3. Why no respawn of monsters,if you lack the necessary level to win then it would make sense to level up. Thats rpg, I dont like turing down the difficulty just to progress in the story, and YES I TRIED, and it impossibru.\n4. What elsse.... could use just a little more sidequest, think it was only 2. Could have improvise more and still not compromise the quality of the game.\n\nOverall pretty good, I recommended...ooh wait yes.\n5. The price of this game is not worth 14.99 it is marketed for. Should have been priced waaay lower. Yes it is well planned and so, but the value does not equate the experience. But I bought it for maybe $6.99 while on sale.. and I think that is more deserving. But then again, I from Jamaiaca, wher my dollar is quite devalued and so it is hard to fork out soo much money for an rpg as this. But then maybe mi cheap, who knows...hhappy playing folks.","March 19","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Skyborn is an RPG-Maker made game with it's unique style, the environments throught the game are very well detailed which just goes to show how much work and time the developers put on it.\nThe game is very story-driven so if you're not so much into story and more into constant action this isn't the game for you. The characters are well designed, each one having it's unique objective and background explained in the game through constant flashbacks, which in turn translates into a nice storytelling. Skyborn features a crafting system which allows you to craft armors and weapons from ores you pick along the way and an augment system which allows you to enchant them, the system itself is really simple but at the same time really addicting and you'll find yourself more often than not looking at every wall in search of ores (I know I did!).\nNot all is good about the game however. Some changes to the battle system for example (which still features some RPG-Maker standard sprites and grid system) could have been explored way better. The mouse feature, here strangely introduced, also doesn't make much sense for this kind of game, you'll find out that using the mouse will only make things more complicated and unnatural, luckily the developers added an option in the menu to toggle on/off the mouse feature. Achievements for Steam also not supported which is actually a real bummer since you have so much to achieve in this game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadaghram/recommended/278460/","Deadaghram","Deadaghram","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadaghram/","133 products in account","A story of rebellion against an unjust dictator(s), of human integrity, and of magic vs technology.  There's also a random chick who threatens, emptily, to eat you but never tries.  Unless you let her (but for real, why was she in the game)!\n\nYou play as Claret, a mechanic in the upper level of human society who repairs airships and makes the occasional automaton who can beep.  She somehow understands perfectly because reasons.  In her life is her brother and some random dude.  Her brother ends up being an awful guy (for reasons you'll learn five minutes in), but only for the first 10 minutes.  After wards, he changes into a damsel in distress and then we forget he exists.  If you don't have character art/portraits, then no one cares about you.  Welcome to video games.\n\nThe game play is typical old school RPG affair: you go to various lands; a desert, a volcano (that has surprising soothing music), a forest, ruins, and a multi-layered, caste style city.  You meet various people from all background, five of which are usable in combat, and then save the world.\n\nCombat is a bit different than many games.  For the first half it's, arguably, optional.  You can find shining dots across the map and use that to level-up which give more exp than the actual monsters (only early on).  They're pretty easy to see to don't worry about missing any, besides, there's always the actual combat system to level up on.  Once you get all five characters, the dots effectiveness diminishes and killing monsters starts to be rewarding.  Fortunately, the battles can be fun.\n\nEach character has a set of skills they learn, and that depend on their role in your party and the class you choose from.  At several points in the game, you have the option (meaning it's also optional) to upgrade character classes and learn new skills and passively upgrade stats.\n\nHere's the kicker, though.  All of the skills are useful through out all of the game.  We've all played games where the earliest skills becomes obsolete about 10 minutes after learning it but Skyborn isn't one of those games.  That level 1 skill is still useful throughout the entire game or, at the very least, becomes a bridge to the more powerful, expensive, skills learned later in the game.  This is especially true for the non-magical characters who use energy (EN) to attack.  These characters gain EN when using basic attacks, or 0 EN skills, and release the EN when using the more powerful skills.  Buff/debuffs are one or two of a kind and are useful at all portions.  There is also a threat system that works similar to MMORPGS where, whoever has the most threat, gets punched in the face.  There is a bar that says who has what and is only relevant to enemy parties.  You can still attack whoever.\n\nYou also have the option to play each character in a variety of ways.  Do you want your mage to do damage with in-hands or with their spells?  Do you one character to be the buff/debuff character or the straight DPS?  Which character do you want to the tank?  Even the gear add to this.  Late game, there are multiple options for equipment for each character.  Some raise INT to do more damage with skills, some raise STR to do more with in-hands.  There are some limitations but there are freedoms not seen often in Skyborn.  *Keep in mind, I was playing on easy mode.  Apparently, hard has more set restrictions.\n\nCharacters are not on-screen in combat but the enemy sprites are.  Sadly, there is no animation but animation is hard and expensive for a small 2-3 people company.  Spell effects do exist and most are 32-bit pretty so there's something to look at while you shoot a “totally not a manticore” in the face.  There are no random battles and each enemy cluster is visible on the screen and only enters combat when it touches you.\n\nThe characters all have a definite personality and the developers did of a good job of trying to get you to emphasize with them.  There's the strong, independent female lead, the rich guy who actually just wants to be the hero, the good natured girl-beast who has been treated like an outcast, the sick of being pushed around mage, and the always questioning “superior race”.  When one character can no longer do a certain “thing” at the end of game, you feel bad.  When you find about the final fate of those captives, you're shocked and disgusted.  I was torn during the middle of the game when faced with the moral dilemma.  Alas, this is a liner game so the moral dilemma didn't fall into my hands but was played out as it did.\n\nThe game boosts an original soundtrack that is pretty good.  Nothing spectacular but nothing ruins the mood.  It's all very relaxing and worth listening to once or twice.  I'd get into specifics but I'm a bad musician and everyone has their own tastes so here's some streamable links so you can decide on your own:\n\nSpotift Web Player[open.spotify.com]\niTunes[itunes.apple.com]\n\nArt Work is pretty.  I'm not familiar with RPGMaker so I can't say how much of it has been over saturated in it's games.  Typical retro style; look at the screenshots.\n\nOverall, Skyborn was a fun experience and, since the game is often on sale, is worth the money spent and time “wasted”.  I got 16 hours out of it and I've seen the game sell for a few bucks USD and it's worth it on sale.\n\nRandom high number / asinine equal or greater number","December 9, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anjesen/recommended/278460/","anjesen","Anjesen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anjesen/","124 products in account","Skyborn is a short RPGMaker-made game that's very good looking (in the japanese anime classical style) and has great music.  It exposes interracial and social classes conflicts in a steampunk-fantasy sort of environment. The story is good but the arcs of the characters' stories are not very complicated and there are no important choices to make or crossroads where several endings can develop.\n\nFights are not at every corner of an alley because you can visually choose (most of the times) if you fight enemies or you just ignore them. The story/fighting ratio is well balanced, but while some generic enemies are a piece of cake some bosses are a pain in the mouse's left button. By the way, while some enemies' design goes according to the world presented, some others seem to have been taken out of other very different projects.\n\nGameplay is easy either with a keyboard or with the mouse, but the UI both in the character menus and in battle is a little bit of a mess and if you pause the game for a long time you will have to re-learn almost everything. Fights are repetitive and turn-based and the special effects are not outstanding but acceptable. You can upgrade your characters' classes and abbilities but even then some of they are left behind while others grow.\n\nI recommend Skyborn if you like classical J-turn-based-RPGs and you are not too exigent.","July 1, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't played a JRPG-ish type of game since Albert Odyssey on the Sega Saturn back in the mid 90's honestly, so when I saw Skyborn pop up, I was intrigued.\n\nI was hopeful that Skyborn would capture that spirit and feel that made me fall in love with the genre (but not rely on nostalgia).  My expectations were met and exceeded.  This is a fantastic JRPG game that has all the elements that make the genre great.  The story is fantastic, the battle system is tight, the graphics are clear and crisp and the musical score is extremely well done.\n\nAnother thing I enjoy here are that there are elements of random turn-based battles, but it's not random at all.  Enemies walk on paths that you can somewhat predict.  If you engage an enemy, you battle.  If you avoid the enemy, you don't.  There are certain narrow walkways where it would be hard to avoid an enemy, but honestly, you could probably play the entire game with only accidentally engaging a few enemies.  Or, you can choose to engage all enemies.  I love this option, because you still get plenty of fighting time, but you have a say in exactly when you'll be battling.\n\nThe end result is a 8 hour (if you play just to win) to probably 15 hour (if you do all the quests and explore everywhere) JRPG that anyone will love who is a fan of the genre.\n\n","July 23, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You control a band of characters that are trying to save the world from the tyrannical yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill. It was all made with RPG Maker, but don't let that turn you off -- I'd say it's worth a look.\n\nI found this game rather charming. While the plot, music, and graphics aren't the newest and shiniest things ever, everything is good quality and holds together well enough for me to enjoy playing through it -- I even want to run through it again later. There are moments between characters to establish them more beyond "insert hero person here", and the world combines steampunk with a more standard fantasy setting in a way that's enjoyable, with more going on than is apparent at first. While there might not be a whole lot more to do than just the main story, there are some sidequests for players who poke around looking for extra treasure, and there's a crafting/augment system for people who want to micromanage their equipment a bit more.\n\nThe battle system is pretty fun to work with -- each character has a threat level that rises as they do damage, and whoever has the highest threat will be soaking up most of the attacks. The key is to make sure the tankiest character in your group keeps their threat level the highest (easier said than done, at times!), and I feel it works fairly well. Most fights are fairly simple, though there are some trickier fights later in the game -- the final boss and bonus boss in particular are pretty darn hard to deal with.\n\nAll in all, I'd say give this game a try if a charming little steampunk/fantasy turn-based RPG with fun characters and a neat battle system sounds interesting to you.","March 7","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On top of all that, the gameplay is among the best you can find in the RPGMaker world.\n\nI would recommend this game to any fan of RPGs!","May 27","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style was just brilliant and brought back fond memories of Golden Sun and the older Final Fantasy games. The story was rich and exciting throughout the whole game. With also a good deal of humor mixed in! Would absolutely recommend for anyone into this type of game.","June 5","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
