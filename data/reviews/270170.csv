I can't really call it a game since I don't think the point is to entertain you. It was originally a website and this is just the web-kit version of the site put on Steam. I'm not sure it will help anyone with depression, so much as it lets people with depression think, no you are not alone (the player, not the character 'You'). Other people feel the way you do.\n\nThe basic gameplay in Depression Quest is that you will read through things (You is the player character that you will play) and then make a choice of what to do (click a hyperlink).\n\nIt sets a story and gives you background information on things. You have everything going for you, a significant other, a circle of friends, a day job. Your girlfriend, Alex is supportive of who you are and understands you. That's more than some people have in real life, but it illustrates you can have everything and yet depression still affects you. At least the characters in the game are supportive of you and not questioning why you have depression or does depression exist or are you just lazy? Its almost like everyone accepts you, but you are the one with a problem that doesn't accept yourself. Its all inward in this experience. You make enough money to support yourself, so money isn't the issue, but money is never a discussion or a reason to the depression, its just all you.\n\nBelow each life choice, Depression Quest bluntly tells you that you are not in therapy, nor taking medication for depression, you are just dealing with it. The 'happy' or 'logical' choices are always crossed out forcing you to select the sad choices such as, 'watch TV, work on a project (Depression Quest) or crawl into bed.'\n\nThe big thing that I take away from this is everyone around you (the player character) really cares about you. It also seems like there's no way out. Maybe there would be a way out to happiness with diet, less beer, soaking up some sun so your body can make vitamin D or a life change, but that's never explored, you are just suffering from depression and forced to live that way. Depression Quest brings up minor what ifs, such as going back to school or finding a better job might help... but well there's risk. Those statements are never followed up. You have no choice to change things in your life (the character's).\n\nYou see the character get worse and worse with no help in sight. Almost as if the entire point of this is to make you the player depressed (which is different than depression). Crossing out logical happy choices for depressing ones. This is a quick experience that finishes after maybe 2 dozen pages of text. I quickly played through it three times and it felt like while there are multiple endings, it didn't feel like I wanted to take the time to see them all. Like reading and carefully selecting my choices leads to more reading to endings that I didn't feel were satisfying. It was too quick of an experience to feel nothing more than a brief diversion. Someone did write me on how to get to the 'good ending' where you are allowed to get help, but with so many choices and endings, I found it difficult to even get the good ending with someone telling me how to achieve it. Again, the happy ending just didn't feel good or satisfying. Maybe that's depression in a nutshell or maybe that's poor writing.\n\nTo anyone suffering from depression, there is always help. There are always people willing to help and you are never alone. *hug*","August 18, 2014","false","1.1"," 6,046 of 6,797 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","046","6","18","96"

It doesn't make the user understand depression at all. In fact, it's just the story of some overpriviledged guy too stuck in his head. Nothing awful actually happens to the character. The player isn't made to sympathize with him in any way. Instead it just comes off as "Make the right decision and get moderately better". Actual depression is nothing like that. It just fails on all levels to capture just how dreary and dreadful the world actually looks when you've got depression. There's no sense of hopelessness or despair.

Depression Quest takes the impossible  weight and drain of simply feeling /bad/, and reduces it to a rather whiney, irritating and self-absorbed narrative. It /then/ takes the raging emotional battles and incredible fears cloud rational thought and displays them as so many single-line responses. I KNOW WHAT TO DO. I KNOW A SEEING THERAPIST IS THE CORRECT CHOICE. I KNOW LYING BACK IN BED IS THE WRONG CHOICE. It's not about what you should do, it's about how in the heck to conquor all that negativity and emotional drag to get anywhere. It's about how to consciously break those cycles of self-hating thoughts and stop those feelings before they happen. Bear in mind these are only my objections to the depiction of depression as a disorder.\n\nDepression Quest as a game? I have literally read popup books that were more interactive, and I use the term correctly. The 1996 classic Wishbone and the Amazing Odyssey was 100 times the game this one could ever hope to be, and it had a neato dog. I tried to think of games that came close to being as frustrating to play, aside from personally offensive, and I counted to None! None games!

That's the easiest way I can describe it, but even that does no real justice. This game did the very thing that is almost impossible to do, offend me. It offends me, because of how terribly it misrepresents actual suicidal depression.

Keeping in mind that this is dubbed "an interactive fiction game" with almost no gameplay, I would like to think of this program as more of a webpage story. The writing in this program is at a level of articulation and description that I would expect from a middle school student. Personally, I was disapointed in the level of writing most of all, with this program being a text-based program.\n\nI'd like to make a note for anyone coming here thinking that suicide is a theme here. Chronic depression rarely results in suicide. On the other hand, major depression is typically what actually can result suicide.\n\nI find this program cringe-worthy and I am personally embarrassed to have this associated with depression. I would recomend this to anyone who enjoyed Gone Home, anyone without strong emotional intelligence, and anyone with depression looking for a good laugh with friends with depression.","August 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 1,353 of 1,624 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","353","1","7","6"

And while it tries to be an interesting interactive fiction game, it suffers from several misteps that ultimately made me feeling like DQ was poorly done and pointless to play.\nThe first thing was the music. I understand something upbeat and jazzy may not have been appropriate, but the same three or so bars of minor chord piano music just got annoying far too quickly. I would have liked an option to turn it off.\nAs for the gameplay, it's completely told through text with decisions at the bottom, like Choose Your Own Adventure books. The writer was of average quality. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't exactly Virginia Wolfe either. The choices frustrated me, however, by having you frequently unable to select more positive choices over more negative ones. I get that this was to simulate the 'it will never get better' feelings of depression, but there is a difference between feeling it will never improve and actively being unable to make a positive choice in your life, even ones like seeing a therapist. When I was depressed, they couldn't make me NOT see one.\nOn the bottom of your screen, you have boxes that discuss your condition in regards to depression, if you're in therapy, and whether you take medication or not. It seemed to me, though, that no matter how well the little box said you were doing, the story never reflected that through a brighter outcome (until the ending at least) or by letting you make more positive choices. I understand depression is a struggle, but I never felt any sort of real sense of progression beyond the game occasionally telling me I was with a token pat on the back.\nI also question whether this game belongs on Steam. I know it used to be a browser game, but it still looks and plays exactly like a browser game. Why does Steam have to be involved? In the end, I would not have played this game if it wasn't free.\n4/10","August 17, 2014","false","0.8"," 970 of 1,159 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","970","1","2","3"

It's just boring and is entirely all reading.\n\nDepression Quest is a very, very basic wall of text formatted into several linear paths about depression. Literally, wall of text after wall of text without any visuals other than grainy photographs at the top and a really depressing audio (similar to Minecraft's music). The story is written in a way that makes you feel like you're living a dead-end life without any motivation to go on. A bad event comes after bad event. Think of the game like a text-based version of The Walking Dead.\n\nDon't even bother trying this "game." If you really wanted to read up on depression, you can do so online with an easy Bing search. They even have a controls page. Don't know why anyone would ever use that, but they do.\n\nObligatory Score: Steam asks "Do you recommend this game?" Is this a game? Can I review it? Is this real life? N/A.

Each person deals with depression differently; when I feel it come on, I know to get out and do something to feel better. To have those options in the game scratched out makes the game seem biased to what most people think is depression; lazy, defeated, unhappy for months on end. Really, it was getting hard to play this game. There were problems in how depression was put out in this game. This isn't a game to play if you have experienced depression; this is sort of a mockery to ways of dealing with depression and posting this negative view of people with depression.\nLastly, I'd like to add that this isn't a quest. Depression isn't a quest that someone goes through. It's a real life problem that many people suffer with. This game makes it out that there is nothing you can do to make things better, which is even worse to read.\nI would not recommend this game.

To you I say: You are so much more important to others than you realize, and there is no shame in needing and getting help. In fact, it is quite heroic of you to be able to admit your weakness to others and to seek to better your situation.\n\nAnd to those who are depressed, this "game" will do absolutely nothing for you. Please go get professional help.\n\nTo those who are NOT depressed, you would be better of looking at your group of friends and looking for signs of depression yourself. Skip this "game" entirely. It is a waste of time.\n\nHere are (some) warning signs of Depression and/or Suicide.\n\n•Always talking or thinking about death\n•Clinical depression -- deep sadness, loss of interest, trouble sleeping and eating -- that gets worse\n•Having a "death wish," tempting fate by taking risks that could lead to death, such as driving fast or running red lights\n•Losing interest in things one used to care about\n•Making comments about being hopeless, helpless, or worthless\n•Putting affairs in order, tying up loose ends, changing a will\n•Saying things like "it would be better if I wasn't here" or "I want out"\n•Sudden, unexpected switch from being very sad to being very calm or appearing to be happy\n•Talking about suicide or killing one's self\n•Visiting or calling people to say goodbye\n\nIf you notice that somebody you know or love exhibits some, any, or all of these symptoms, make sure you say something to them. Offer them your support. Tell somebody else about it, whether it be your high school or college councellor, this person's parents, lover, doctor, etc. Encourage this person to seek professional help.

I've been suffering from depression since ten years old and I can't let some game make it look like you'e just "lazy." No ♥♥♥♥ you. You're not just "lazy." You're depressed. Depression is not as simple as an emotion. Depression is a location. That location is the end of the road, a gun to your head and screams. When your mother and father get divorced. When your mother beats you so badly child protective services has to get involved. When a ten year old child has to see his own brother accuse his non biological father after his original father killed himself. The man who raised him when he was a six. The one who did all this. And he accuses the ten year old boy's father of beating him when he was young. When it turns out the mother was cheating on the father. When you realize the garage door opening at five in the morning at night was the boy's mother going to the gym to cheat on the father. Depression is watching your whole entire world fall apart. This game just makes it look like you smoked a bit of weed and are lazy and sleepy. This game has nothing special other than depression. I don't believe anyone on that team had ever experienced depression. Because the real thing about depression is. There is no escape. It will follow you around and whenever you're having a happy moment you remember the bad moments, you always do. Even when I had no will to live, when I just wanted to end it all. I still soldiered on, I hated myself. I thought I was ♥♥♥♥, like everything was my fault. I soldiered on because people cared about me, people loved me. People talked to me. They taught me how to love myself, they taught me how to be myself again. Talking in this game doesn't help, it doesn't solve anything and it doesn't help your character which is a total and utter lie. So at the end of third grade the boy was depressed. By fifth grade the boy was happy. And by sixth grade the boy was loved. From one depression survivor from another, don't kill yourself. You might think nobody cares about you, but really all you had to do all along was open your eyes and experience the good. Therapists are overrated, talk to a dog and or cat.

I'm not the type of person who would intentionally make the character kill themself, but this is a story about depression. Many people with depression commit suicide. The fact that if I made certain choices, the character would kill themself would give me an incentive to play it so that they wouldn't kill themself. I feel like this would work better if it were a dating sim style game (I think they're called interactive novels), where you're the friend or family member of someone with depression, and you have to spend time with them to make them feel better, or they could kill themself.

This isn't a quality "game" (it isn't a game), and I was given no reason to give a ♥♥♥♥ about the character.\n\nUPDATE: I tried it again. Still found it terrible. And, yet again, I didn't finish it, but I got further this time. The fact that you are prevented from selecting certain choices is still infuriating. It was like a carrot on a stick. I don't have depression, but the fact that you can't even make an attempt to help yourself is absolutely frustrating. I had a few friends in school who did have depression, and they weren't like this at all. They were able to come to school, and have an enjoyable time with their friends, even if they were depressed. The main character just seems to shut down. Many people are still able to function with depression.\n\nSince the first time I reviewed this, I have played a few other visual novels, and found myself really enjoying the genre. This one still remains incredibly boring. The scenes weren't long enough, or descriptive enough to let me connect with any of the characters. The scenes were basically "X shows up and starts talking to you. They point out that you don't seem like your normal self. Here's some choices. The ones that will help you can't be selected, so you lie to them or brush it off. They make another point about you being strange, and the scene ends." This isn't good writing, it's lazy.\n\nSince the last time I played this, I learned who developer Zoe Quinn was. I greatly dislike this person, and her unprofessional attitude. Most of the positive reviews of this game I read were just someone joking about her reputation of sleeping with reviewers to get good reviews on this piece of garbage. That isn't a good sign.","August 17, 2014","false","0.3"," 215 of 262 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","215","262","2","0"

This is the kind of thing that I imagine as a flash game, somewhere on Kongregate or Armor Games where you don't have to keep it on your computer for the fact that it's just about clicking on links and expecting that you chose the right option.\n\nThe music I'd have to say is something I that I myself did not enjoy. The piano was slow, and as far as I could tell it was just a few second loop. The party music would have to be the same in regards to it just being a loop as well. Anyone who is seriously considering trying Depression Quest out, I recommend listening to something on youtube. "Under the Sea" from The Little Mermaid made playing this game a fun experience but if you don't like that song, "Hakuna Matata" from The Lion King is a good substitute.\n\nThe story itself is something that I personally could not get into. I think it was something to do with being depressed and having a girlfriend named Alex and yeah ... Couldn't get into it.\n\nThe fact that certain visable options aren't available in Depression Quest is quite annoying - but I guess that was what was intended when it was being developed. The choices when in your first reading were quite obvious to make, the train of thought that I had was "Choose the options that make the most sense. Don't focus on work? Hell no. Ignore girlfriend? Hell no. Go to party? Hell YEAH (the most exciting thing that happens until you find out that you're socially awkward even though you HAVE a girlfriend who tries to be intimate with you)"\n\nThinking that you clicked the wrong button and then backtracking to try a different selection of options probably made my experience a drool. Also the fact that choosing different options didn't really change the story all that much was also a bummer, for as short an experience as Depression Quest is, it does seem rushed, and if not rushed then not thought out a lot.\n\nAlthough this review in my opinion was not well thought out and was just me typing out things about Depression Quest that came into my head, I'd have to say that this isn't a fun or interesting experience. If you want to have fun with it, try listening to music that doesn't come from Depression Quest itself and don't get your hopes high when you see options that require you to be in any way social as they probably won't be selectable no matter what you try.\n\nNote: I avoided trying to call Depression Quest a game for a reason, the reason being because it doesn't take long at all to finish. Seriously though, not a long experience, I read it over a decent number of times just to see how fun I could make the experience with whatever I could find around me at the time.\n\nI recommend trying a 'Doctor Who Choose Your Destiny' book if you want to make choices in a story that directly impact how it plays out and haven't tried a interactive story before.","October 28, 2014","false","0.9"," 322 of 412 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","322","412","6","1"

Maybe it IS like this for some people in worst case scenarios, but still, even depressed people have a personality of some sort. Also, the music was very boring, slow, annoyingly repetitive, and just made me even less interested in playing more of the game. This also applies to the visuals. If I could, I'd rather continue to read it as a visual novel instead. Maybe it gets better the further you play, but until then, I wouldn't recommend playing this game if you have depression.

Anything positive, anything sensible anybody with half a brain would do and should do in these absurd situations are all blocked out to tease you, as if in an attempt to say "Because I have depression, I can not do this" -- which can not be further from the truth. The game attempts to showcase the mental disorder in an understandable standpoint, but fails terribly, instead taking it as some kind of given. It makes no attempt to show any glimmer of hope or actual realism in logical solutions, and instead wallows in its own idiotic sense of loathing.

Let me start out by saying that I have had depression. This "Game" is not accurate to what depression is like. I say "game" because it's not a game. You can't win nor lose. There is no challenge, it's an interactive story. The player has no reason to be depressed, and there is no conflict. There's no rising action, no climax, not even an actual ending. There is no structure. You're just told that you are depressed. The big problem is that the more depressed you get the more limited you are in your choises. My first play I got the worst ending possible for making choices I would realisticly make (or choises I was forced to make). Second play I chose all the good options and nothing really changed. All that happened was that I was less depressed. Nothing major to the story changed. It's less of a story and more of a series of events that sort of connect. The players depression is not realistic whatsoever. You just are depressed for no reason. The problem is that depression is a unique experience for everyone. The basics are the same but the way you deal with it is entirely up to what works for you. I personally shut myself out of the world and worked on writing short stories. I saw a therapist once and hated it. Hated the drugs too. This game makes it too black and white in solutions when really it's all grey. All the player can do to feel better is seek help from others. No way to feel good on your own. Depression for me was not wanting to do anything because it all seems dull. Here it's not wanting to do anything because you're scared. Depression is different for everyone, but here, it just looks silly. No reason is given for anything. It makes me feel diconnected from the story. The writing is really the biggest flaw. It just isn't what I would do. It isn't how I would act or how I feel with depression. It makes it boring and I just feel uninterested. There's just nothing here. You want to learn about depression?

I’m not sure if I was just dealing with grief or if I genuinely was depressed, but I played it hoping I could get an answer. My views are personal as a result.\n\nI found the options for what I could do to be more restricting as the game went on, unnecessarily so to the point where I found it harder to feel immersed in not even being able to try to do some of the things I’d like. Considering I did get medicine and psychiatric help after the devastating end to my long-distance 5 year relationship, I’d have like to know where I would have been for pursuing the same type of help in the game. Some choices in general, particularly the ones that didn’t allow me to talk about my problems, created a greater disconnect between my feelings and the protagonist. In particular, moments where I would simply “choose” not to allow my girlfriend Alex to understand my gnawing feelings that she may to be with someone else--uncannily like my own situation--were extraordinarily frustrating. The fact that the game was becoming linear at the moment I began to actually identify wit the protagonist made this feel like a lost opportunity to me.\n\nEither I’m too wrapped up in my own thoughts to truly empathize with the protagonist, or the developers failed to get a reliably feasible representation of what it means to feel depressed. If it’s the latter, it definitely comes in part from the emphasis on feeling doubtful for anything rather than the actual struggle it takes to pull-through with wanting to save yourself from yourself, which would have made the game give more agency to the player as well as accurately portray how depression is a behemoth of a challenge to feel you can overcome, not a parasite that forces you to make choices you don’t want to.\n\nWhile the atmosphere left me ready to cry some more, the game wasn’t immersive enough to make the experience feel well-executed. If the game had more focus on allowing choices that are difficult rather than simply disallowing the best options, I would feel completely in the place of this miserable protagonist. In short, the game has potential, but definitely needs refinement before it truly becomes what it sets itself out to be.","November 17, 2014","false","0.6"," 125 of 153 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","125","153","2","0"

Alas, I would not call this a successful attempt in raising awareness for depression.\n\nFor those who complained about not being able to commit suicide despite choosing the worst possible choices in this game, people with severe depression are in reality often too exhausted to do anything, including taking steps to end their lives (any form of suicide takes action, unless you count starving to death as an option).

Not a lot can be said for it in terms of originality, aside from the fact that nobody to my knowledge, has had the nerve to attempt to make depression into an interactive experience.\nI can't help but feel, as much as the supposed intentions of the author as stated at the beggining of the game are all fine and good, that this game comes from a somewhat self centered place. Many of those, and I include myself, who have suffered depression, can often tend to allow their experience to inspire their art and the results can be very satisfying. When I listen to, watch or observe such art, as much as it comes off as sad, it makes me feel joy. This is simply not the case with this game. The author has clearly taken their own experiences and their output has been to make a game that attempts to make other people feel depressed (and I'll place emphasis on the word 'attempt'), rather than to create art and other things that instead express and explore the feeling. It flimsily attempts to impose the feeling upon the viewer rather than present the feeling for the viewer to explore and gain something out of. This gives the game a very self indulgent tone. Self indulgence emanating from any piece of art is not necessarily a bad thing but in this case it feels as though it was completely unchecked by the author, and puts a very bad taste in my mouth.\nThere really isn't much to speak about in terms of art assets aside from it's sound track, which in my opinion sounds rather tacky and contrived, like the sound track to a depression ad campaign. I must actually say that I feel that the lack of art assets is one of this game's only wise decisions. It's white background and plain text don't overstate the feelings of depression the game is supposed to be imposing on you, which may even compensate for the horrible cheasy music I just mentioned. I can only imagine the overused contrasty pictures and grain effects that could have been chosen to give the game an 'edgy' and 'dark' appearance, and this makes me cringe.\nIf I could say one other good thing about the game, it would be in the effectiveness of the way in which it makes the player feel hopelessly as though their choices won't matter. Although as stated above, I can't say I appreciate this game's over all approach, and so this slightly impressive mechanic does not even begin to remove the bad taste from my mouth. It should also be mentioned that as a trade off this causes your play through to have little variation as your choices make little difference. No matter what, you tend to wind up back on the same path of the story no matter what choices you make. This only makes a story that is already dull, unoriginal and boring, even less worth while and gives it very little replayability.\n\nIn short, I feel that this is a misguided and self indulgent exercise running behind the pretence of being an attempt to reach out to people. It lacks both subtlety and substance, and as an experimental indie game it is dwarved by hundreds of text adventures, point and click adventures and experimental games that have come before it on the levels of creativity, originality, taste and righteous intent, and I can't say it deserves the greenlight it has received.\n","October 24, 2014","false","0.5"," 139 of 178 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","139","178","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PerpetuallyTired/recommended/270170/","PerpetuallyTired","Akubi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PerpetuallyTired/","251 products in account","Depression Quest as described by their website is an “interactive fiction game where you play as someone living with depression. You are given a series of everyday life events and have to attempt to manage your illness, relationships, job, and possible treatment. This game aims to show other sufferers of depression that they are not alone in their feelings, and to illustrate to people who may not understand the illness the depths of what it can do to people.“\n\nLet’s talk about the code behind it… The game is written entirely in web-based languages, such as CSS, HTML, JS etc. It uses a node.js webkit browser to display said pages. There’s no problem with this, but it gave me a bit of a surprise as it doesn’t seem to be too suited to the task at hand. This also gave me a bit of trouble recording the game as I normally use DXTory but it didn’t pick the ‘browser game’ up. In my opinion it would be better coded in a different language as it didn’t even make use of any HTML5 features or any features to access websites which is kind of a waste.\n\nLet’s talk about the game itself, it starts out with some story that didn’t explain why the character was depressed at all, it just seemed to drop you into something you knew nothing about with unfamiliar characters. It asks you some questions on what you would like to do and you can answer, 1, 2, 3 or 4. Except 1 is crossed out for no apparent reason other than to provay the story and lock it down to a more linearised path.\nSuddenly after I clicked answer 1 to do work, I am very depressed for no reason other than to tell a story. Next my girlfriend calls me, Alex. It gives me a boring wall of text and 3 options. 1 is of course, as always crossed out because it is the most sensible option of them all - go hang out with your girlfriend and be happy, because that would be way too easy. Now we’re at a party, boring wall of text… and of course, option 1 is crossed off, which is the most sensible with ‘Enthusiastically socialize’. It really confuses me why the most sensible options are crossed off, I thought this story was Depression Quest and not ‘Let’s Try and be as Sad for No Reason and Silly as we can Quest.’\n\nNow we’re back home and our mother has come over for a surprise visit, except we can’t choose the most sensible option again, which is tell her how sad we are, I’ll choose the similar option, number 2.\n\nSidenote: For some reason the crossed out options and the one just below them are nearly identical… This game is strange…\n\nSo, I decide to take up this offer with this person to get a cat as the other options to take the cat but enthusiastically were crossed out..\n\nAnyway, the next scene is the character and their GF talking about some stuff I skipped because it was too long and didn’t seem too relevant to the plot when I speed-read it, anyway, you have options:\n1. Tell her how awesome she is, explained with lots of words.\n2. Tell her how awesome she is, explained with fewer amount of words.\n3. Ask if she is happy with the relationship.\n4. Do nothing.\n\nI have decided to chose 3 as it seemed the most sensible. You know I’ve found a pattern; the highest available one seems the most sensible one to choose but usually ends up making you more depressed for no apparent reason.\n\nAnyway, this carries on for some time. Eventually it just becomes “NEXT”, “PICK OPTION 6 AS IT’S THE ONLY ONE”.\n\nApparently playing with cats makes you depressed these days. I ended up after trying several times I managed to unlock the therapist and I talked to some guy called Attic who doesn’t actually live in my roof.\n\nI skipped forward because I was starting to get more and more bored by the planck time. Infact the boredom turned into depression it was that lackluster and dull (in a boring way). Anyway, its now Christmas and this is where the game ends.\n\nTL;DR\nBORING QUESTIONS, PRETTY LINEAR STORY WITH FEW ACTUAL CHOICES, AND A STORY THAT MADE NO SENSE.\n\nOverall: 1/10.

In my opinion is... Ok. I'll simply list what i like, and disliked.\n\nDislikes, starting off is the most glaring issue for me, the pretentiousness. The language, and tone just is so pretentious, there's a special way to write things seriously, and this game did not do it right, it just comes off as pretentious. (Sorry for saying pretentious so many times!)  Secondly, this isn't that bad for me atleast but i think the developers wouldn't appreciate this comment, it seems more like a... Pet game. I can't put myslef in the main character's shoes. (even though i have had suicidal deppresion.) It justs seemes like, im nudging around this sad little creature. Last, i really couldn't sypathise for the main character. the deppresion was very sappy, and cheesy, there really weren't any reasons for him/her to be depressed, he/she just was. and the existing reasons were terrible. the deppresion just seemed like a petty teenager overeacting to life.\nI also would have liked to be able to controll this person more. If this is susposed to be me, then i shouldn't be able to just make trivial nudges. Also, the "What do i do?" thing, was stupid. the options were so limited, and i got to choose so few things, the main character got to make important decisions without me even consenting!\n\nLIkes, I got a very good sense of... Satisfaction when i "beat" the game. I felt like i had helped my little pet make the right choices, and actually was touched by the ending, i found myslef smiling, becuase i had this felling that i had made my little pet happy. As i have had depresion the red corss over the best answer was good. if you're deppresed there are times when you want to, you know you should, but you jsut can't.\n\nAll in all, i wouldn't recommend playing. It shows a very melodramatic, unrealistic view on depresion.\n\n4/10 stars, a passable game.\n\nEdit: I also have learned the "reputation" of the person that made this game, and I honestly don't care.\nWhat I care about is that this is called an "Interactive Fiction" Yes It's FICTION, this is a FICTITIOUS story, at best it's realistic fiction.

Yes. Absolutely. This is right on point with what depression is like, even the noise on the status. You want to understand a friend or family member with depression, absolutely download this game. This is just plain clinical depression though. When you wanna mix in other types of depression or things like manic depressive or bipolar it is a whole new territory. Just use this as a baseline for regular clinical depression depression.\n\nDo I recommend this as a game? No. I like the sound track but there are very limited choices in which to live your depressed life and you don't get much insight on things. You don't even get a technical/medical aspect of depression. I'd like some customization, a more in-depth game. Turn it from a choose your own adventure to more like Kudos, where you can pick who you are, what you do, what kind of friends you have, and then fight depression by cutting out toxic people, going to a therapist, support group, seeing friends, petting cute animals, meds, or even just forcing yourself to get out there with both good and bad consequences. Perhaps even include different types of depresison or personality disorders. It could show you what its like in a wider scope and show you how to beat it. Now that's a game worth playing! Of course, this game is free and supported on donation. So perhaps that's unreasonable.

It’s kind of sad. This may help put me in the mood and let me understand what depression is for some.”\n\nI’ve dealt with depression in the past, and no, it’s not fun. It’s tiresome and… depressing (Lol, kind of like this review). But depression is a bit different from one person to another, so knowing how it was like for myself and some other people I’ve been close to, I was curious about how this game would portray it.\n\nFirst and foremost, the writing is decent. Fortunately for the player, there aren’t any serious flaws that derail the story completely. BUT, there definitely could’ve been more elaboration on the character’s past(s) or relationships with others. There was no real detail about the player’s workplace, or even their boss. Having that relationship explored more could’ve greatly helped the story, even if it was for a short moment.\n\nHalfway through the game, I just stopped caring about the outcome. Which is weird for me, since I’ve trudged through some pretty boring interactive fictions in the past, including those old school text adventures very few people would ever want to play (unless you’re into that sort of thing like me).\n\nTechnically, I found this game irritatingly lazy. There’s no save function. I know this seems trivial, but even with the most homebrew of interactive fictions through platforms like Gargoyle or the InfoCom reader, there’s usually a save function. If you find yourself bored wanting to quit to carry on later… YOU CAN’T. You have no other choice but to start from the beginning.\n\nThe “branching” story is misleading in the description above. This game is marketed as an interactive fiction with decent options to change the ending, but in reality, there isn’t. Most people aren’t going to play this more than once to realize this, but there is only one ending. Sure a couple words and things may be switched around or replaced, but it’s a lie. Sure your “stats” may be a little better or worse, but it doesn’t change the context of the game greatly enough to be considered truly interactive.\n\nAnd yes, I understand the crossed out options are options that would be available if you weren’t depressed, but since you’re given so little options, the variance is negligible. Therefore, replay value is at an all-time low. And even though I didn’t want to, I replayed this sucker more than I wanted to. I even went with the worst options available to me, singling me out to depressing options (no pun intended), to see if I would have a super terrible ending… it never came.\n\nFrom personal experience with depression, I faced myself at the edge of a bridge considering suicide since I’m a terrible swimmer. The choice of suicide never came in this game.\n\nI know this sounds absolutely terrible and I apologize to anybody that may be offended, but when you think the world is better off without you in it, you only drag the people around you down, that God has either forsaken you or isn’t even there, or if you killed yourself the world wouldn’t skip a beat, then yes… suicide, regardless of the stigma, is a viable option to somebody that is depressed, regardless of how terrible of a choice it may be.\n\nAn option for this could’ve been suicide, then showing the aftermath of what it would do to the family and friends of the player.\n\nUnfortunately if this choice was made into the game, you never get acquainted well enough with your family and girlfriend enough to actually care. They overall seemed paper thin in character, and sure this detail may be thrown aside as a viewpoint of somebody that's depressed. I get that. But if you want to really grind at the readers views and heart, you need to connect them to the characters and their feelings, including the supporting characters. This may seem pretty basic, but the supporting characters are just as important as the main. And no matter how crappy this sounds, suicide could’ve opened up another heartbreaker end game scenario in the fact that your new kitten would die of starvation because you killed yourself and nobody knew about it for, I dunno... let's throw out some arbitrary numbers: 4-5 days to a week at most.\n\nSo yes, I found this game lazy in mechanic and programming. From the lack of options, lack of ending, and lack of a save function. I felt like it always ended with a sigh with no resolution. Which is funny, since the writers at the end of the game thank you for playing stating, “there’s no real end to depression.” Which may be true, but I just found lazy. For a good story, there could still of been a resolution of what happened, even if it’s, “Oh, nothing happened. You stayed depressed and went into a deeper spiral of darkness. Lost your job, and found yourself homeless.” Or, “Your girlfriend Alex, wanting to help you, excorted you to go see a therapist.” Or, “Your family, admitted you to a psyche ward, because they realized your depression got so bad, you weren’t able to function in day to day tasks.” OR, “Your IM friend Attic, realized you didn’t go see the therapist, attempted to get you help in person. You denied. So he called a Suicide help line.” OR, “ANYTHING beyond the same thing, nearly every time.”\n\nThe music was okay at first… then it got annoying. And in the end it seemed to actually add to the boredom I found with this game. It definitely didn’t help the more times I played through it. Luckily there’s a mute function in the menu, or you can always just mute your computer audio.\n\nBUT here are the pros…\n\nI appreciate what the game attempts to do.\n\nThe pictures getting fuzzier and turning black and white was a nice touch.\n\nThe music getting a little distorted the more you get depressed was kind of a nice touch.\n\nI found no typos (unlike this review)\n\nFinal verdict:\nThis game should be Pong and Forgotten.\n3.7/10 – Not worth your time unless you’re really curious. OR, you’re a diehard interactive fiction novel gamer and want a taste of everything at some point, despite whether or not you’d like it or not. Which unfortunately for me, I fell under this category.\n\nP.S. I'll probably make a video review of this on my YouTube Channel. I know this is shameless advertising, but idc. It'll probably get me some views and subs because of the whole gamergate crap. Also, It'll knock off anybody thinking that I plagerized my own material since my Youtube name doesn't have the underscore. lol","May 11, 2015","false","1.9"," 76 of 94 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","76","94","5","0"

For me, I just didn't care, I didn't see a point to, why strive for anything? I often sat outside of the classroom in a ball because first off I couldn't see a ♥♥♥♥ing point in striving to do any of the work, and then furthermore the frustration that you can't do that and you know it's not normal or healthy drives you even further.\n\nIt's a continous spiral I feel, and I feel like the character was just in a slump. It doesn't represent my depression, but it might represent less severe cases, so I can't really say "NO THIS IS WRONG", but I feel that someone playing this game couldn't learn about how my own depression has affected my life, and I feel it chips away at the integrity of the game in that instance, because it's trying to represent an actual perseption.","September 27, 2014","false","7.2"," 111 of 148 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","111","148","0","1"

However, when I got into it, it wasn't fully what I was expecting.\n\nIt does have a decent amount of replayability, if you want to go back and make different choices, however, one questions if that is something that most people would even really want to do. Most of the choices seemed geared more towards keeping you in that depressive state, and all of the 'good' choices were unavailable to you. At the same time, only one side of depression was expressed, with a lot of things about the disorder being left out. This could have easily been fixed by lengthening the story and adding more to the characters in it. I felt like I wasn't really connected to the characters.\n\nIt did, however, do an excellent job expressing the fact that depression is something that can effect anyone, no matter what you have in life. This is the one really great thing that I hope people will take away from this game.\n\nThe music created a nice ambiance for whatever part you were at in the story as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terrafeena/recommended/270170/","terrafeena","Terra Feena","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terrafeena/","40 products in account","As somebody who struggled with depression for the better part of ten years, and seeing as this application is free, I decided to play it for myself. Yes, I know that this does not techincally qualify as a game, it's an interactive story, it doesn't belong on Steam, yadda yadda yadda. I agree, and I'm approaching this as the form of media that it is.\n\nFirst off, the presentation is quite bland. The sales pitch for this "game" promises that you can "watch the color get sucked out of how you see the world" as your depression gets ever deeper, however, there isn't much color in the game to begin with. It's a solid white background with plain black text in a generic font, with a small picture on top of the page, sometimes of something that has absolutely nothing to do with the scenario. I mean, come on guys...I understand that the point of this game isn't to entertain, but if you can't put forth the effort to make it look good, then why should we put forth the effort to stick around to the end? The pictures themselve are very boring and add nothing to the text. The worsening of your depression results in the picture becomming slightly swarmed with static, an interesting (albeit misguided) choice. Indeed, depression can make your life seem dull and dreary, but why would you choose static to convey this? All it did was make the picture look like a TV that's not getting good reception. The audio is also said to change, and it does, but not by much. It's the same ol' track, only tweaked a bit to make it sound a bit more unsettling (of course, I lowered the volume because it's just kind of annoying). Overall, the special effects did nothing to enhance the experience, and the presentation leaves much to be desired.\n\nSecondly, I don't understand the mechanics of this game. The story and outcome are driven by the choices that you make, but sometimes the outcome you get doesn't make much sense in regard to the choices that you made. For example, in my first playthrough, I based my decisions somewhat on what *I* would do in the given situation if I were depressed. I didn't always make good choices, and yet somehow, I got the good ending. On the flip side, when I chose the choices that I thought were the best options, I only got an okay ending, which confused me to no end. In the beginning of that playthrough, I made many choices in the beginning that were identical to my first playthrough. The only thing that was different was that I had chosen to try to get some work done in the first scenario, and my character somehow ended up even more depressed than when I had them veg out on the couch watching TV. And somehow, this ended up in me not being able to "test the waters" when I had lunch with Amanda. Even in Mass Effect, I could usually choose whatever option I wanted regardless of my past decisions. Of course, the first couple of options are always crossed out no matter what, as if their only function is merely to taunt you. These choices are the best ones possible, and you can never choose them, EVER. Although, sometimes when you pick the best choice available, it ends up backfiring, as is the case with the first scenario in the game. So really, what's the point? Another blunder is that the progress you make isn't really reflected that well between the text and the depression "meter". For example, if you have your character take medication, the text will say that they have noticed that they are feeling better, but the depression "meter" will persist on saying that your character is still pretty depressed, even after a few scenarios. The text itself is not much different depending on the depression "meter". There is a slight difference when you go the extremely negative path, but it's nothing to brag about. All in all, I didn't feel like the depression "meter" was a true-to-life representation. It makes it seem like when you are going through a major depressive episode, that you're down in the dumps everyday, and that's just not true. Some days are still better than others, and I just felt like this wasn't adequately reflected in the "meter". I feel like this feature shouldn't have been added at all, and I'm thinking the only reason it was added was for the sake of making this seem more like a game. And why was this game made compatible with the XBOX controller? It's just dumb. That's like surfing Wikipedia with a gamepad. Is this their way of saying, "See! This IS a game! It can be played with an XBOX controller!!!" Stupid...\n\nNow, let's deal with the actual CONTENT of the game. In which case, what more can I say that hasn't already been said? The writing is very dry and uninspired. It's like they were trying to write an imaginative story using nothing but exposition. There's absolutely no style, whatsoever. At the beginning, you're told that you are a "twenty-something human being" and that's about all the information you get on the character you are "controlling". There's not much backstory into your character at all, and you are spoonfed tidbits about your friends, family, and girlfriend by clicking on their names in the beginning, instead of, you know, fleshing them out in the story. You're also given some vague information about your job and a "project" that you work on off to the side, but you're never told what you do for a living other than that your job is dull and repetitive, and you're never told what this "project" is and why it's so important. Other than that, you're told absolutely nothing about your character, leaving you with the conclusion that he is the most boring human being that you've ever met. I'm thinking that they did this because they wanted players to put themselves in the main character's shoes, but it doesn't really work here, especially not when the story is so linear. Instead, leaving you to imagine what your main character does for a living, and the nature of this "project" comes off as a major cop-out to me. It takes away the work of having to create a character that people can connect with.\n\nSometimes the reactions of the main character are overly exaggerated. Like in the beginning, when he comes home from work and is for some reason overwhelmed with stress over the idea of working on his project. I didn't understand that at all. Why would you be so stressed out about something you do as a hobby??? It's not like this project is important to his job. It baffles me that the developers state the objective of this game is to get rid of the stigma of depression, but it seems they're trying to achieve this goal by resorting to stereotypes. The impression this scenario gives is that somebody who suffers from depression is so frozen by their anxiety that the very thought of even doing something that they love makes them want to curl up into a corner and suck their thumb. Of course, this is not accurate by any stretch of the imagination. It seems like this character is always over-reacting, even for a depressed person.\n\nSome elements of the story turn out to be a complete red herring, like the project, which is mentioned maybe two times in the entire story, and then forgetten completely by the end. Then there is the case of the resume you send for that "dream job", it's never mentioned whether you were contacted for that or not. I would imagine that being either called in for an interview or rejected outright would have a profound effect on the character, but it's never explored. This is yet another indication of lazy writing, or a complete lack of planning (or both).\nSome of the characteristics of depression were accurate, such as the feelings of isolation and the mental fog, but even the developers admit that not everybody's experience is the same. I think it would have been better if they had avoided a cookie-cutter story, and had mutliple characters with different personalities and life situations. Oh, but that would have taken actual WORK.\n\nCase in point, I can't recommend. It doesn't do well what it sets out to do.","October 8, 2014","false","2.1"," 56 of 70 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","56","70","0","0"

Although I applaud the intentions of the development team, the execution fails miserably.\n\nWhatever genre/style etc of game you play one of they key focuses is on creating an immersive environment. The first faux pax "Depression Quest" commits is to intentionally alienate the player through the constant use of the accusative pronoun "you". Being constantly reminded that you are a player and not the game's protagonist means it is increasingly difficult to actually empathise with Alex. This deliberate alienation between player and game actually detracts from the stated aim which is to "help people understand what it is like to be depressed". The over-use of the pronoun also makes the game appear to be controlling the action and outcomes, rather than the player. (Alright that's a highly subjective statement so I will clarify it further). When using accusative pronouns, we are telling others what we think about them or what to do. As the only interaction the player can engage in is choosing options, using the accusative makes the game appear as if it is telling us what to do, essentially coding a response, rather than the player having the illusion of control. This is particularly compounded by the fact that the choices are also phrased in the accusative... i.e. "You choose to stay at home and watch Netflix". Now the styling of "Choose your own adventure" does use the pronoun you, but usually only when asking the player a question. Questions are a direct, overt engagement that break the narrative (and consequently breaks immersion), this isn't necessarily the developers fault, it's a fault of the format, but when juxtaposed against the larger narrative it serves to further alienate the player from the story.\nThe sad thing is this could have been easily overcome by simply rewriting the game as a journal, blog or diary and so switching to the pronoun "I". (This is actually a viable option as many counsellors, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists encourage the keeping of a diary or journal as part of therapy).\nThe writing is tediously unimaginative and dull, and simply fails to hold interest. There is little use of metaphor, simile or any sort of figurative or descriptive language. Now, this may have been a stylistic choice on the part of the writer, Patrick Lindsey, but it doesn't pay off. In other media we have been exposed to vigorous compelling accounts of people who have suffered from Depression, from Woolfe to Wurtzel with Plath inbetween. Lindsey has borrowed nothing from their style and in choosing to create a "factual" account has lost the lyricism that allows people to emotionally engage with a piece of writing (or game).\nLindsey isn't all bad though, his characterization is consistent and the narrative account is well researched. In fact I can recommend the portrayal of Depression at least. Three of the methods for coping and dealing with Depression are emphasised, the two most obvious are Therapy and Medication (primarily emphasised visually but also within the narrative itself), and the narrative additionally reveals the need for support systems, whether from a close loved one, family or friends. He also manages to note the relapse stages of depression through his characterization, however the game suffers from a lack of dialogue or choices within counselling/therapy. Even when you do opt for the counselling you aren't able to interact with the psychiatrist by giving or receiving information from her, information is only supplied through friend/family/girlfriend interactions. This means that, again the developers have managed to exclude a great deal of important information regarding coping techniques that would have enhanced the game by providing more interactions and improved their narrative discourse to meet their intention of informing people.\nVisually I presume they wanted to adopt a minimalist style, to better evoke depression. The colours are primarily shades of grey and the background is left a neutral white. The choice of font is similarly plain and clearly legible. In addition a variety of pictures are included to accompany the text, in an attempt to enhance visual appeal as well as serve a function of assisting in a display of how depressed Alex is. This is done by increasing the amount of "noise" overlying each picture and the text at the very bottom of the screen when he begins to suffer greater depression and decreases as he returns to an equilibrium state. It's a clever idea and it works fairly well, at least in the case of the pictures. On the text at the bottom of the screen however, it merely serves to distract from readings of the text by annoyingly catching attention in some sort of entoptic diversion. The pictures themselves are at least evocative, and add some much needed emotional colour to what is otherwise a rather drab piece. Now again, Depressed people do suffer from dampened emotions so the choice may have been a stylistic one on the part of the developers, but if you are making a game for non-depressed people to engage with you need to convey lethargy and despondency through your medium which Depression Quest would appear to, intentionally, refuse to do and so fail.\nThe music is suitably doleful, and repetitive, which does assist the atmosphere when reading the story. In fact my response is slightly different to most in that I don't find it annoying, its chords become familiar and in a way reassuring, blurring off into background noise, and not overtly intruding, allowing one to focus on the text. I didn't however notice any substantial change in the music depending on your depression level, in fact it doesn't even tranpose to a "happier" key, so I was slightly disappointed there.\n\nIn conclusion, I applaud the intentions of the game to attempt to recreate what depression is like, however it alienates the player, is riddled with poor design decisions, and utterly fails to capture attention or interest despite being well researched.\nInstead of playing this go read Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning" instead.","October 24, 2014","false","1.0"," 77 of 104 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","77","104","0","6"

The guy in the story seems to have his ♥♥♥♥ sorted out. Girlfriend, job, house, family and so on. The way you progress through the game is just to keep on picking certain options until you finish.\n\nI always picked the options that were right, going to see a therapist, tablets and so on. This is not how it works. The ending I got seems to think that he just brushes it off as if it was nothing. Depressed people can not just say, "Well, tablets are good. I'm fine now." I don't think the creator of this game really knew what depression really is because it's nothing like the game.\n\nA nit-picky thing is the title. Depression Quest is a stupid name. It sounds like you're on a quest for depression.\n\nHowever, where the game flops in it's main purpose. It flourshies, sort of, in it's writing. It's very detailed and the multiple choice answers are there and will make you think. Do I want to go to a party even if I don't want to go? Or do I stay in and play with my cat?\n\nBut these all seems pointless when the main part of the game, the depression, is so quickly glanced over and easily dealt with.

So, like almost everybody else, I've heard about this thanks to all the controversy surrounding Zoe Quinn and I went into it quite negatively biased. Anyway, I wanted to see what all this fuss was about and I'll try to sum up my thoughts as objectively as I can in this post.\n\n\nSo, with all that out of the way, is Depression Quest a good game? First of all, it's not much of a game. It's done in the classic choose-your-own-adventure style, but it's not done very well. Your choices don't affect the main course of the game very much - they mostly just affect your character's status.\n\nGenerally you just get a wall of text and a few options (which options you get depends on your character's status) and you choose one of them. This may cause a change in your character's status, e.g. it can make you more or less depressed. Then you get another wall of text which is a reaction to you choice and then you move on to the next event.\n\nAnd that's it. Most of the game follows exactly this formula and you shouldn't expect any extensive branching - there isn't any. The only change is right at the very end, and that's simply not enough.\n\nThe other problem is that it's quite easy to get a good ending - just pick the choices that make your character actually DO something. And of course it's equally easy to get a bad ending - just pick the choices that make your character do nothing. Usually the choices are even ordered from good to bad, so you really don't need to think about them too much.\n\nUnfortunately all the above means that there is not much replay value. You may go through the game two or three times just to be able to read the different endings, but you really will not be reading all the stuff before that.\n\n\nTechnically the game is alright. Although for some weird reason it has to run in three processes which in total use more than a hundred megs of RAM. I guess it's got something to do with the fact that the game is using Webkit. There's a graphical glitch when the text is shorter than what fits on your screen, but that doesn't cause any problems.\n\n\nThere are a few typographical mistakes, but nothing serious (there will probably be more mistakes in this post than there are in the game :P). I haven't noticed any bad grammar or misspellings.\n\n\nWhat is kind of annoying is the sound. Basically, it's just a single repeating piano track which gets boring quite fast. There are some ambient noises for some of the events but nothing major.\n\n\nAnd finally we get to the last part. This game obviously deals with depression, which is quite a strong emotional theme. So, did I feel depressed when playing this? Not exactly, although it did show me how a person with depression might feel - or at least I think so.\n\n\nAll in all it's not a great game. The mechanics are weak and the depression part just doesn't do it for me, but that is most likely subjective.\n\nFinally, I do feel that it doesn't deserve all the publicity it's getting, but hey, at least it's free.\n\n\ntl;dr: I felt more depressed when I couldn't find the bloody keys in Doom.\n\n\n","August 19, 2014","false","1.1"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","36","40","0","0"

It does involve choices and a story and somewhat of a level of immersion, now as a game it doesn't really deliver any sort of exposition to the player, it just sort of expects you to pick up on it, which kind of confused me near the beginning, I had questions about who my character was? if it was supposed to be me or someone I'm playing? I also was slightly confused with the cast of characters because of the gender neutral names and the lack of any true back story. So as a game this has a few flaws but the story is not one that's bad, the way its told is not bad, the difficulty is extremely easy but, I don't really see the game as something that is about winning, it seems to be more about experiencing depression through the eyes of this character. I honestly believe this game shouldn't have as much flak as it's getting, I will probably start a discussion to further my opinions on this game because its so.... currently noted.\n\n\nSo now the standard game rating:Story: 7/10 (Its a story and its not really explained well, there are some branching sort of choices but all together its very short but well written.)\nGameplay: X/10 (Text adventure things don't really count for gameplay, all of them have choices and reading, you don't add anything to that normally.

It's hardly even a "text based adventure". It consists of reading walls of average-at-best text and choosing from a few different options. Depending on previous choices, you can get to a point where there isn't any choice at all- every option but one is crossed out. I guess the developers were trying to represent the lack of motivation that can come with depression, but when your attempt to simulate depression results in 20 minutes of clicking through boring pages of text, you've done something wrong.\n\nAfter playing through this "game", I just found myself angry and offended. It claims to try to help people without depression understand what people with it go through, but all it really accomplishes is making people with depression look lazy, completely unmotivated and utterly incapable of making any good decisions to improve their situation. I have depression. It does make you feel like crap, it can destroy your motivation. What it doesn't do is prevent you from trying to get help. When one of the characters gave the protagonist the phone number for a therapist and my only option was to crumple up the note and throw it away, I just sat in silence.\n\nThat's the main problem with this garbage (aside from the fact that it's a boring piece of junk)- it portrays what I can only assume is one of the developers' experience with depression as what all sufferers go through.

Every case is different, and frankly, I find this game insulting to anyone who does suffer from depression.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reikkei/recommended/270170/","reikkei","Rei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reikkei/","47 products in account","Depression Quest is an interactive narrative with a set goal: to try to help people who haven’t experienced depression understand what it’s like for the sufferer. However, throughout my time with the narrative, I couldn’t focus as much on the goal of the story because of the poor implementation of the game design itself.\n\nYou play as an unnamed character who struggles with depression that progressively gets more burdensome as the game goes on. The goal of using an unnamed character was probably to put the player in the character’s shoes, but for me, it only served to give me no real connection to the character. In the first few pages of the game, when the character is introduced, there are various links to other pages that explain some of the context for future situations. One, for example, is described as “a project you’ve been working on,” but since it doesn’t go into detail, the player loses a connection with the character that could’ve been more personal. At the end of a long section of pages, when the character needs to make a decision, there are a few different options, with the first always crossed out—the next few will continually be crossed out as the depression worsens. This option is clearly supposed to show what the character could do, if not for the depression, but instead it just distracts from the actual possible choices and the player finally picks something to just get past the page.\nThe music and overall design of each page also leaves the player feeling bored and uninterested.\n\nThe supposedly “sad” piano music is distracting from the text, and the page itself, being a static, gray affair, doesn’t do much—if anything—to hold the player’s attention and keep them focused on the story. The status buttons below decision options are also static, with a poor font choice, and slightly distract the player from the options available. Another problem is that you cannot stop playing and pick back up where you left off. For a game with such a bland, boring interface, not having this option makes the player even less likely to want to work back through the game, if they have to stop playing for some reason.\n\nOverall, this game could have been much better, if it had been designed to better keep and hold the player’s attention. As it is, there are too many distracting things going on and not enough draw to the story to keep the player interested and caring about the outcome.","November 17, 2014","false","1.0"," 60 of 83 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","60","83","0","1"

It finds its way home and crawls back, even with proper medication/therapy/love/whatever. It’s not that simple, some people might be “cured”, but it’s definitely not the same for everyone else. It’s a constant thing in a person’s life, it appears when you less expect), I felt that this game was not real. First, I felt that the MC was suffering from the effects of depression beginning to grow. But having choices literally locked because apparently “you can’t do that” made me angry. People can TRY to do those things even tho they are depressed! Locking the options was a terrible thing in my opinion, leading the MC to an endless spiral of unworthy feelings, when I actually wanted to help them. This kills the concept of the game, which was supposed to be interactive and you could attempt to make the MC get help.\n\nCharacter development wasn’t good either. MC was too plain, I couldn’t feel any sympathy for them, same for the other characters. This could have been a decent/good game (I honestly believe that), but it’s not.\n\nPlease don’t treat this subject like a superficial aspect.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/recommended/270170/","serendone","Serendone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/","675 products in account","The War of 1812 was a military conflict, lasting for two-and-a-half years, fought by the United States of America against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, its North American colonies, and its American Indian allies. Seen by the United States and Canada as a war in its own right, it is frequently seen in Europe as a theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). The war resolved many issues which remained from the American Revolutionary War but involved no boundary changes. The United States declared war on June 18, 1812 for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy, British support of Indian tribes against American expansion, outrage over insults to national honor after humiliations on the high seas, and possible American interest in annexing British territory in modern-day Canada.[3]\n\nThe war was fought in three principal theatres. Firstly, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Secondly, land and naval battles were fought on the American–Canadian frontier, which ran along the Great Lakes, the Saint Lawrence River and the northern end of Lake Champlain. Thirdly, the American South and Gulf Coast also saw big land battles, in which the American forces defeated Britain's Indian allies and a British invasion force at New Orleans. At the end of the war both sides signed the Treaty of Ghent and both parties returned occupied land to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations.\n\nWith the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, repelling initial American invasions. Early victories over poorly led American armies such as the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the Americans were able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Indian state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. US forces were also able to make several gains on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813 and seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However a large-scale American attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813, and serious American attempts to conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane in July 1814.\n\nIn April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In September 1814, the British invaded and occupied eastern Maine. In the south-west, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Creek nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C, but they were repulsed in an attempt to take Baltimore. American victories in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which along with pressure from merchants on the British government prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Both sides agreed to a peace that restored the situation before the war began. However, it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic so news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[4]\n\nIn the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring their national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner") and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a "second war of independence" against Britain.[5][6] The Federalist Party had strongly opposed the war effort and prevented New England from providing much in the way of soldiers and troops; it now virtually collapsed. The war ended on a high note for Americans, bringing an "Era of Good Feelings" in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened U.S. nationalism. Spain played a small role, but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.\n\nIn Upper and Lower Canada, British and Provincial militia victories over invading American armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[7] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe.\n\nIt was ok.","June 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 90 of 140 people (64%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","64","90","140","63","1"

Yes, at the end of the story it says some fluff about this being a lifelong struggle, but the story never delvs into anything more than superficially.

Whatever, the actualy gameplay is bland but it is text based, what would you expect?\n\nMy core issue here lies in the representation of depression and the way the "adventure" is set up.  So it starts you as a depressed person with not much context as to how you got there.  Then, it throws you in with a cast of characters who seem  to want to help you but no matter what I did my character was constantly in a downward spiral.  It seemed like the creator was under the impression that a depressed person can only be helped by therapy and SSRI's (anti-depressants).  This game perpuates the idea (which is wrong) that all depression can be fixed with drugs and that all depression is basically the same.  This is anything but though truth, there are thousands of factors that can influence depression.  Diet, excersize, lack of vitamin D, getting a blood test to test for lack of SERT (serotonin transporters), or drug abuse.  You do not have the option to explore any of these.  No, you are on a downward spiral and you can't get help to get better.  It is a terrible representation of depression because depression is something that simply can't be represented in a video game.\n\nThere are reasons that doctors spent years and years studying depression and mental illnesses because there are millions of factors and millions of solution and possiblities.  This game is not just an embarrassment to video games but to people who are unlucky enough to suffer from depression and or anxiety.  How this game got past greenlight simply blows my mind.  I can not recommend this game at all, to anyone.\n\nIf you are suffering from depression, know this, there is help and there are people out there who care about you.  I was lucky enough to have my parents and they are the the primary reason I graduated highschool and made my way into college.  Please to remember,  It gets better, I promise.","August 19, 2014","false","0.6"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

To say that I am about as low as I can get might be the biggist understatment since Lady Godiva walked into her stable and said she had absolutly nothing to ware. I tried to play this "game" out as I would in real life, I've seen profecionals and even tried medication, however in the end this "game" told me that I should be on the mend. I can attest I am not. I think it might have made me focus on my problems even more, because it's telling me things should get better. If you're going to make a text based "choose your own ending" type game you must give the player the option of choosing their own adventure. Locking off answers and simply saying "You'll never NOT be depressed" is frankly the antithisis of gaming.

They do, however, often feel impossible.\nThis game tries to represent depression, and to does so poorly. This game shows what a person who has never had depression, but has done some background research on it, would think depression is like. The reviews left on the main site feel forced, because the reviewers may have feared being accused of misogyny, and do not accurately reflect the actual game. But I digress.\n\nThis game portrays depression as nearly a hopeless spiral of constant self loathing and negativity.

So I decided to have a go, maybe only because the counter-arguements were developed in such a juvenile attitude.\n\nFirst of all, as a person who suffered depression couple of times in his life, this game fails to describe the emotions and perception of every day life of a depressed person. It repetitively tells that you are exhausted, tired, nothing to keep you going but when it comes to the actual feelings that depression creates, it is possible to say narration and description in the game is quite bland and dull. If you want to know how depression actually feels, you can always listen to People Are Strange from The Doors.\n\nAlso I don't think that this game should be on Steam. As an educative tool on internet, it might help some people but here, it probably won't. If you want to tell a story about a depressed person, do it in the way Telltale Games does, if you want to explore the depths of a human mind, do it in the way Psychonauts does, do you want to express the perception of every day life in depression, get some ideas from Quantic Dreams (or even Max Payne) this is not the way how you can accomplish these with a "game" on Steam. Considering they are in the same genre, the Commodore64 game Alter-Ego is still so much better than this so called game.\n\nAs I said above, be helpful to people, it's a good cause. Seriously. But please don't call this a game. The right definition you're looking for is "interactive educative tool."\n\nP.S.: Most of the people writing reviews on this game here have the intellect of a pile of manure.

I felt like I was wheeling a wooden plank through a series of rooms, so lacking in personality or any distinguishable features that I found myself bored, and struggling to read the text that was telling me how I was 'feeling'. It worries me that the person this game is portraying is dull, boring, robotic. While some ambiguity and vagueness is needed in order for any player to put themselves in the character's shoes, I felt like that vagueness was taken to a point where we can no longer truly care for the character.\n\nI was also troubled by the lack of options. As someone who has experienced depression, I know that there are times where it feels like options are limited. But people don't express depression in the same way. I have been the person that, despite feeling like death inside, I went out, feigned happiness. I went out and did things, even if I wasn't being honest with people, and that was part of my problem. That was something I had to deal with for years, giving the appearance I was happy and healthy, when I wasn't. I was disappointed to find that so many of the options I'd have chosen, the options that would make sense to not just me, but probably many other people just trying to survive, and maintain the life one has, were just simply crossed out, as if the mere thought of doing such a thing was preposterous.\n\nI couldn't help but feel just a bit insulted by that. That my experience was an impossibility.\n\nSo no, I would not recommend this game.

I was too disinterested and disconnected with the character to care about pushing through.\nI do think the theme is important, but I do not feel like this game is a strong example for how games can capture an experience. I would like to see the theme handled with greater mastery of the medium and narrative.","November 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/270170/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","Depression Quest has stirred up quite the controversy and has already received many negative reviews as well as a lot of troll reviews that are to be honest hilarilously funny. I was really tempted to write a troll review myself but I'll try to give a honest review here. Im aware that it is highly debatable if Depression Quest qualifies as a game or not but I will at times refer to it as "the game" and to the act of using it as "playing". I don't want to scratch the topic if it's a game or not but I'll use those words for convenience.\n\nIn Depression Quest you play as a person with depression trying to manage daily life. The game is fairly minimalistic and basically looks like a website with white background and some gifs. It can be controlled with the mouse or suprisingly with a gamepad. Depression Quest plays like a "choose your own adventure"-book. You basically read a short story and sometimes get to choose from a set of options to determine how the story continues. The problem is that despite the advertising there is not much to choose from here. Some people complain that many of the options are crossed out and not selectable. However, I think that is actually getting the point of knowing what the right thing to do is while being unable to do it across. Depression Quest portrays depression and it does not do a particularly bad job at it but it is all that it does. It does not offer any way out, what is depressing in itself. If that was the point of it then it works out well but I think that there should be more to it. As it stands Depression Quest does work as an art project but has severe shortcomings in the game department. The writing is not great but is does its job. It just feels too clichéd at times. During the first minute it almost put me off immediately though because it comes with a trigger warning. Also it describes the protagonist as a "human being" instead of specifying the gender or just using ''you''. The problem is that the developer apparently forgot about that part immediately. For the rest of the game it is clear that the player character is in fact male. I really wonder what the original point was then.\n\nI would not recommend Depression Quest to anybody who is actually suffering from depression or anybody not interested in the topic. If you want to get a basic understanding of the way people with depression think it's worth a look though. However, I say that only because it is free. If it would cost actual money I would advise you to stay away from it.\n\nDepression Quest is not completely horrible but below average and has next to no target audience. To a certain degree it does what it was set out to do. What it does is however not for everyone, even among the expected target audience. Some people with living depression may share similar experiences to those depicted in the game, others won't at all. If you want to play a simplistic game that explores the human condition you are better off with Papers, Please since that game does not simply describe a situation but presents you with a moral dilemma and communicates its message through actual gameplay. As for Depression Quest... it takes no advantage of the medium at all.\n\nMore reviews here","August 22, 2014","false","0.8"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

I deliberately ignored the warning to see what this "game" had to offer. Long story short, I had a really bad breakdown and then I decided to go to therapy. So there was some benefit to me playing this.\n\nIf you have depression, this is nowhere near accurate because, even at my suicidal worst, I was still able to make myself do things. The best ending in the scenario presented isn't necessarily the right one in real life. Medication doesn't work for everybody, there are therapists who are motivated solely by money and, in my case, people aren't always understanding of what you're going through. However, like others have said, you're not alone in the end.\n\nIf you don't have depression, the same inaccuracy applies, but I will say that it can offer some insight into what depression is. There are still a lot of people who think it's a choice/lifestyle. I think DQ busted that myth just fine, but it's not always evident when someone is depressed and there is a spectrum of kinds of depression. There isn't always consistency with depression. Believe it or not, we have good days too.\n\nIn the end, Depression Quest was a bit of an eye-opener for me personally.

Each page, if you wanna call it that, is literally a long story. I'd have no problem with this if this were a book or some other medium, but there really is no gameplay, something that could potentially really connect you with the feeling the game is trying to show.\n\n2) The game seems to show a rather extreme side of depression where everything is doom and gloom. I won't contest this as being a real life possibility, but it would seem that a greater impact could be given if there was a build up, a slow, gripping build up that led to the intial level of depression seen in the game. Then maybe it could show how bad and dangerous depression can really get if left untreated.\n\n3) The person behind this game, Zoe Quinn, is a total hack in the industry. Based on evidence compiled around the internet by actual legitimate sources, she has done nothing but produce sympathy toward herself through falsehoods and fake outrage. Tack on to this the fact that she somehow has several journalists and indie developers in her pocket, presumably because of the fact she has dated them and then used this to her advantage by getting positive coverage of her out and then destroying any negative coverage, be it legitimate or not, just goes to show how corrupt ♥♥♥♥ can get.\n\nI do not recommend this game. If it were remade with some better design choices, it may be a great way to show the effects of depression to others and help people who have depression. But with its current state, and the fact that it really only exists to further Zoe Quinn's agenda, it is a sure pass.","August 19, 2014","false","0.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","0"

It's no different than the free browser based game originally made and the only gameplay you get is responding to questions. This is not to be used to try to sympathize to someone with Depression, nor is it a tool in understanding depression. This is a ♥♥♥♥ text game that trys to convey a ♥♥♥♥ generic plot and fails at doing so.\n\nEveryone going into this obviously wants to have the best outcome. The only negatives you get is if you just choose all the most negative responses regardless, it locks the most obvious postive choices from being picked. Even if you are depressed, and even if you are SEVERLY depressed, you can still CHOOSE to do things that will bring you up, even if for a moment. I know I sure as ♥♥♥♥ have done so.\n\nNow with that out of the way, theres nothing stopping you from picking everything "right" from the git-go. Therefore, it's not realistic in its message at all because you seemingly "fight" your depression extremely easily in what seems like a 4 min game.\n\nThere's not substance. Your supposed to "care" about your outcome, but nothing happens because of no visulization. The characters are cringe-worthy, and the story is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing generic.\nThis game paints people with depression as unlikeable ♥♥♥♥s that are completely useless. I'd like to quote from another reviewer on here, Judge Holden.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"This game goes out of its way to display depressed people as utterly unlikeable people, unable to think for themselves and dependent on the most superficial of things to be able to carry on with their normal lives. People currently struggling with anhedonia or depression will most likely see themselves meta-scrutinizing their own lives from a new perspective because of this game, should they not know any better. People who have never struggled with depression could easily learn to see depressed people as useless, oversensitive lumps -- exactly the way that this portrays it.\n\nIf there were like at least either still shots of things happening, maybe I'd care more, but I wouldn't even care if the first option I was presented with was to kill myself. I'd off the character and turn the game off right then and there."\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere's absolutely nothing outside of this mediocre story besides the feeling of boredomness you get.\n\nAlso, about Zoe Quinn:\n\nZoe Quinn is an insane ♥♥♥♥nut that believes being trolled by people = getting ptsd. She's like the brain dead Anita Sarkeesian, except she lied about the ♥♥♥♥ in the first place, calling the supposed website that bullied her "lame man-children". and "virgin pedophiles".\nproof she lied http://imgur.com/a/4VOcx\n\nPeople like her want to censore the internet because some things people say hurt her feelings. I hate to tell you, but Steam's has already enforced a form of censoreship in censoring words. I wish neo-feminazis would get it through their skulls that not everyone in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed world agrees with their absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ideolgy of placing themselves higher than other people.\nShe censored people from criticizing her game, and then talks about how censorship is unjust. She is a hypocrite, and among everything, a lying sack of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nTHE ONLY REASON this game got on Steam, is because she slept with not 1, not 2, but 5 DIFFERENT ♥♥♥♥ING GAMING JOURNALISTS. Everyone on the greenlight community expressed their displeasure with this ♥♥♥♥ and it STILL got on Steam.\n\nDon't waste your time installing this waste of space.

I don't think it should have been greenlit as a game. It's unfathomable to me that so many actual indie GAME developers were passed by for a story.\n\nWhat I'm also seeing from other reviews is that this interactive story was crutched through the greenlight selection solely based on who developed and not wanting to 'hurt any feelings' if it wasn't picked. Greenlight games are to help give indie GAME developers a fighting chance in the gaming industry for their hard work based on the communities approval of the concept. Not social politics.\n\nMy final outlook on this experience is that this may be a welcome addition to an E-Bookstore or find a happy home on its own website, but it does not belong on the Steam game store.","September 18, 2014","false","0.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

I hope to be a little more constructive...\n\nI was quite looking forward to Depression Quest as I'm no stranger to depression, I've felt different kinds in the past and I'm currently going through a rough patch at the moment. I was also a big fan of Dear Esther, another game that centered around depression, loss and grief and I loved To the Moon for its similar themes.\n\nI was equally as disappointed as most to see that the game was about advanced as a basic website, a white background, with text and a depressing piano rift but, obviously, I tried to see past that and tried to judge the game on its story and the things that it DOES offer.\n\nWhat it offers is a scenario, in which it tells you, your problem and then gives you a list of options, asking you how you would proceed. I usually like this style of storytelling, like in Tell Tale's games or your average RPG and went along with it but I was a bit puzzled to see that two of the options were crossed out and one of them was the option that I would have picked. It didn't take me long to see through the message, that this game appeared to be conveying.\n\nThe logical answer is always crossed off the list, meaning that people suffering from depression aren't capable of ever doing the logical thing. Though this may be true for some cases, it's not true for EVERYONE and it's certainly isn't a rock hard fact. The reason that it, especially, bothers me is the fact that the only thing you do is read a wall of text before making a decision and after a few minutes, the decision aspect is completely taken away from you, to the point that you just read a wall of text and then click the only option presented to you.\n\nI tried to make it to the end, hearing that it tries to accurately simulate depression, by taking the colour out of the world but I just couldn't get to the end of it. I was incredibly bored and I couldn't even get worked up over it anymore, the music was just depressing the hell out of me and I found myself trapped in a seemingly endless monotonous cycle, where I just read text and clicked options, that weren't mine.\n\nI've always been very liberal with my definition of what a game is, some said that Dear Esther wasn't a game and I argued against that but this? I don't know, I don't believe that it is a 'game' as you could recreate the experience by listening to a playlist of every depressing song/theme you know, whilst reading something off of fanfiction.net and occasionally slapping yourself across the face.\n\nIn conclusion; I wouldn't recommend it, I don't believe that it is an accurate portrayal of depression and I struggle to see where the 'it's a game!' argument is coming from.\n\nIf you want a better experience, I'd recommend Dear Esther or To the Moon over this as both are much better interractive stories.","August 25, 2014","false","0.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","5"

At least Japanese Visual Novels have, you know, visuals, or sometimes a gameplay element of some sort. DQ on the the otherhand is as bland as they come.\n\nIt's made by a "Social Media Activist/Clictivist" and it really shows. While the game might related to some people on some levels, the main character is bothered by the most trivial of things, making it obvious the game was written by a SJW tumblrette. The game reduces the character's choice the worse your depression gets. Makes sense right? You feel moody, you probably aren't going to be as motivated to do certain things. The problem here is that the MC is too pathetic to blame his problems on depression. His problem isn't that he's depressed, his problem is that he's too beta. See, the game has you step into the shoes of this character but all this does is make it feel like you have no control over the outcomes in any given situation.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, this developer has no idea what depression is like anyway outside of being called out on Twitter. The person who made this doesn't even like gamers and I think that speaks volumes for the quality of the game. Don't believe me? https://imgur.com/a/4VOcx#HpTwnYl How could a game made by someone who holds such contempt for gamers, and with people suffering from actual depression possibly make a good game?\n\nIn short, DQ is a short "game" that can be beat in less than 5 minutes. I got a good ending my first time just picking the obvious "social" choices. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a way to an hero on purpose so that was quite disappointing.

(freudian slip of the developers, perhaps?)\n\nAnyways, in the story you can get a pet kitten. Highlight of the game.\n\nOn that note, it is not really much a "game" as much as a "take some mostly irrelevent choices that we think reflect depressed people's thoughts" sort of thing. The design is mostly text and images with links. This is closer to a choose your own adventure book, a shallow one at that.\nThe imagination here is very paint by numbers and does not portray depression as anything other than a woe is me dithering, to the point where it's downright insulting to the science behind depression as well as misrepresentative of depression in sufferers as a whole.\n\nBut umm... kitty... going in between people's legs... (The writers are oh so cleverly subtle)\nI, by no means like freudian phychology, but this game's writing makes a very compelling argument for it.\n\nConclusivly, this choose your own adventure book (because calling it a game is highly demeaning to the gaming industry, forsooth, it is insulting to adventure books akin) comes off as an abusive exploitation of the depressed, and is downright offensive to the reader's (player would suggest gameplay) intelligence, shows and pervades a contempt for humanity, and portrays the depressed as unlikeable slobs who are to blame for their own issues.\n\nCons\n-Choose your own adventure book pampered up as a "game".\n-Insults your intelligence.\n-Demeaning to men and women alike.\n-Comes off as abusive.\n-Taunts with choices you cannot choose.\n\nPro\n-Kitten.\n-Wonderous example of irony.","August 19, 2014","false","0.4"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Just a terrible mess of a game.\nWhere do I even begin? From a gameplay standpoint, it's boring. There's nothing visually stimulating (and while I realize that's not the point with choose your own adventure games-but something semi-decent would have been nice, a background to simulate scene changes), and it's all too easy to get the good ending if you have even a sliver of an idea how choose your own adventure games work. The story is bland at best and does nothing to suck the player in and make them care about the character their playing as. Honestly, 3/4 of the way through and I found myself skimming the mammoth-sized paragraphs of crap just to get to my options. Speaking of options, why cross out the ones that would actually help you? I'm speaking from an odd position here, as I have never been diagnosed with depression, but it feels strange that, in an attemtpt to simulate someone being depressed you wouldn't present the helpful option as an option. To the people who played this game who actually have depression, did that feel condescending at all? Plus, the character is completely self-absorbed. There's a point in the game where one of your friends is having some nasty issues in their life and instead of consoling them, you can choose to just ignore him because you feel that you have it worse.

This piece of indie shovelware is not a game at all.  It is a despicable mock on people with depression.  Superman 64 is said to be one of the worst games of all time, and I can find myself prefering that to this because it has gameplay.  Even E.T. for the Atari 2600 has more potential.  I do believe people should play it though.  I feel they should play it so they can understand that indie "developers" need to stop thinking their shovelware titles belong in the industry.

Yeah I get it, it's meant to be a spiral, but I don't think it's the greatest representation even from an individual standpoint. It's more like someone's idea of what they think depression should be like, but comes off more like someone who's just whiny and can't help themselves without managing to incite any understanding or compassion at all. Can think of many better resources for people wanting to read up more on what depression is.\n\nIt's also concerning the play though I did at least, makes out like there is no end to it and you'll be miserable your entire life which I think is very misrepresented and a dangerous message, especially for those with current clinical depression.

I understand it's coming from the point of view of someone else suffering from depression, but honestly I think that person is just... lazy.\n\nSource: I've dealt with depression throughout my entire life and it's never convinced me to not go to work, not get paid and just stay in bed all day. It's actually a part of my personality that I complement with intense cynicism and sarcasm -- which essentially makes me one of the most negative people imaginable -- yet I still manage to go throughout my daily routine.

I hesitate calling it a "game" because it isn't one. It's a horrible fictional novel that is as bland as my personality and is pretty much false in how depression is handled. This game teaches you that if you have depression, you're doomed and there's no going back. Having depression myself, this is not the case. It's about fixing your issues and making yourself happy. This game, no matter what, will give you proper options that'll do anything to make you happy in slightest.

What I noticed first were some typographical errors, which would be negligible if not for this game being almost exclusively text-oriented. Also, since I find it difficult to concentrate on large areas of text for long periods of time, I think having a save state of some sort would have been a nice addition to the game, especially since the developer was generous enough to include a graphic showing how to "play" this game with a controller.\n\nAs far as content goes, I think that since the protagonist is supposed to be you (the player), I think that “Alex” (your girlfriend in the game) should have been a neuter character so people of all sexual orientations (not just lesbians) could better relate – there was a huge opportunity to do so, what with “Alex” being a unisex nickname, and since this game is meant to simulate what it feels like to be clinically depressed, I think it would have better immersed the player in that world.\n\nOther than these few minor nitpicks, it does have a semi-interesting story, and as someone who has suffered from clinical depression myself, it does have relatable elements. I didn't finish because it was too long for me to complete in one sitting and I couldn't find a way to bookmark my place to pick it up later (as I stated before, save states would have been useful). I think this game could use more development, but it does have potential, and I can honestly say I got what I paid for from Depression Quest.","December 8, 2015","false","0.5"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

Thus, my view of this piece of "interactive (non)fiction" isn't the product of going in completely blind.\n\nI don't have any problems with visual novels, "story games," and "walking simulators" on principle, since they can be great experiences if executed well (insert plug for The Stanley Parable here). However, Depression Quest has some major issues that ultimately cause it to fall flat. The writing is poor on a technical level: it's difficult to get immersed in a text-heavy experience when you have to wrestle with typos, ambiguous pronoun references, and unnecessary alliteration. In addition, instead of being written in a way that evokes certain emotions in the reader, Depression Quest explicitly tells you how you feel every step of the way. This caused me to approach the experience in a disconnected, analytical manner. Finally, perhaps due to my disconnect with the "player character," it was far too simple to determine the proper series of choices to guide the character toward a solution to their depression (protip: don't lay in bed all week).\n\nIn conclusion, although I personally can't speak to whether or not Depression Quest is an accurate representation of chronic depression, I couldn't force myself to care about the events in the story due to awkward, weak execution. But hey, if you don't believe me, it's free and only takes about half an hour to go through once, so it's not too hard to form your own opinion.","October 19, 2014","false","0.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

It's the typical 'no one loves me/I'm a burden' stuff and it's basic. There was nothing to draw me into the story and the best part of the game was probably the picture of the cat. This felt more like a chore and not a form of 'entertainment' (for lack of better words). It was boring, plain, and a waste of time. The choices you make have very little effect on the aactual game as the game will have the same outcome, and that is no real outcome. Either you do good and get over it or you do bad and you dont. If this game is trying to show someone how it feels to be depressed, it's failing horribly. Making decisions isn't as easy as clicking a button. You cant show someone how it is to be depressed through a video game. If you want to try and see what it's like for someone who's going through a depression and struggling, go play The Cat Lady.\nOverall, this game was a disappointment and could possibly be one of the worst games I've played in my entire 18 years.\n","September 22, 2014","false","0.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Is it enticing to the mood?) - 1\nGenre Structure - 1\nReturn Factor - 1\nAverage Score - 2\n\nAs everyone knows, a game is entitled a fair chance. 'Depression Quest' is unique in its development as it brings forward the viewpoints and emotional curtains that define depression. However, it is only applicable to one scenario. It in fact plays through the possible actions of a single person in a very specific environment. The limited actions allow for smooth transitioning, but are generally lacking for what gamers consider to be a developing title.\n\nWith all else said and done, the game was fairly straight-forward in its guided direction. Did you fight through the depression, or did you succumb to what would be a vision-altering take on an individuals inner turmoil. With multiple paths to choose from which gradually became more and more limited as time progressed, one could feel restricted to their options, an argument which invalidates the free-thought that many gamers wish to experience. With no real graphical rendering save for a very contrasting back-drop to the text, I found my eyes hurting and straining, consistently reminding myself that this game looked more like a website than an actual game. There wasn't any Artificial Intelligence to interact with so the choices seemed rather stale in comparison to other titles. As for the images that did perceive themselves, the images were repetative and didn't give an ebb or flow to the text, so when it came up with changes in time, it felt much like a car slamming into a concrete baricade, and other times it felt like time was at a stand-still.\n\nThe music was a single repetitive track that played itself over and over again and was almost maddening in and of itself, so the feel was genuinely successful, but the music felt out of place at many points in the story line. As a fast reader, I was able to play through this game in roughly twenty minutes with all possible endings. On that note, the gameplay was very short, and the replay factor was damaged by my own personal abilities. That being said, it felt short and fairly lacking in immersive content. Credit shall be given, however, into the emotions that the game drew out. Having suffered from depression myself, a majority of the situations actually forced myself to review my own experiences in some self-reflection and as I am writing this, I can't help but feel emotionally connected to the game. However, I must remain clinical and give an honest review, and so my personal feelings will be directed in a more professional manner.\n\nThe last questions that come to mind are fairly straight-forward. Is this a game, and does it befit the genre advertised? The answer to these questions is an undeniable, "No." Depression Quest feels more like a book that you would select your choice, and then turn the page to reveal your decision's consequence, whether it be positive, negative, or neutral. As well, with Depression Quest having the graphical interface of a web-page or flash-based game, it did not feel like it belonged on Steam as a Green-Light. With all this said, it also cannot be considered a Role-Playing Game as it doesn't fit the criteria to be considered a game.\n\nOn a personal note, I feel that Depression Quest was fairly enlightening and would definately help others feel what depression is. As much as I can relate to it, I feel this would be better as a graphic novel or a short-story rather than a video-game. As a video-game, I stick by my rating of '2 out of 5" and would not recommend this game over-all, but on a personal scale, I feel that this could become something better if it were applied in a different application.\n\nIf you like this review, please be sure to head over to my Twitter or my Facebook (both will be linked below) and leave a follow/like.

It also doesn't count in any of the problems that come with it, like forgetfulness, irrational input evaluation and the side effects of medication.\nIt seems like the game is about someone who is having a hard time being depressed, rather than suffering from a major depressive disorder.\n\ntldr; Not in-depth, but okay story.

Hahaha, oh wow\n\nIn all seriousness it's a interactive story about some random guy and his depression and you have to direct his actions via multiple choice outcomes. You could probably speed play through it in 1 minute; there's not that much of a story to it. It's not really that much of a game. Maybe it could've been considered one back in the 80s or 90s when they had those interactive text based ones, but even those usually were a lot longer than this and more interesting as well.\n\nNow I don't like to use Ad hominems but the broad who made this, Zoe Qunin, didn't even make it directly. She got help from some game makers who were doing a project where they'd help inexperienced women make games. After they helped her make this, she attacked them! Also, after Robin Williams took his life (rest in piece, you were one of the few celebrities I actually felt horrible from after they died) she tried to cash in on that to promote her game more. So she also has no respect for victims of suicide. There's been a massive storm of controversy over her actions, and a lot of censoring of facts and freedom of speech. So I encourage you, the audience, not to support her.\n\nDepression is a hellish sickness of the mind that nobody should experience.

It is a depiction of someone who is depressed. There is in fact a difference here.\nMuch of the text trivializes the long term issues and makes it appear as if this is something the character is just now dealing with, as in it suddenly appeared. While it is possible for someone with untreated clinical depression to have a girlfriend, a job, a (apparent) group of friends, and overall live a normal life, that is near miraculous as depicted in this game. I attempted to self-manage my depression for years without help, and can tell you that social withdrawal and self-esteem issues are pretty much a given in this kind of situation.\nI truly think this 'game' utterly fails to depict the mental state of someone with clinical depression. There are a number of issues with the presentation, even aside from the inexplicably understanding people surrounding the character, such as the portrayal of anti-social behavior as a direct result of depression. Some people genuinely don't like other people, and have issues connecting with them, thus seeing avoidance as a way to not have to deal with the added stress trying to deal with that you don't understand creates. I know I'm anti-social. I also know that my being anti-social has nothing to do with my depression, but more to do with just not having the desire for social interaction. That is the root cause of anti-social behavior in most people. Social withdrawal is getting so anti-social that it begins to affect your life negatively.\nMoving on from that, I cannot call this an accurate portrayal of even caricaturized depression. It portrays someone who is depressed, and fails to do that very well, due to a number of misconceptions on the creator's part on what depression is, and on what the effects are.","September 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","3"

Despite the short amount of time it took to complete, it felt like an eternity.\n\nI wanted to give it a fair chance, but there was no game here. The design of the game is just lazy. It's so bland and uninteresting to look at that I really couldn't focus on the story. It's white background, with black text, and a picture on top that pertains to the story.\n\nWhenever I could actually look at what was going on, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of originality of the situation I was in. The story is that I have a girlfriend and family who all love me and are concerned about my depression. WHOOP-DEE-DOO!!! I got excited when someone gave me a kitten. I thought that would make it a good game, but the cat POSSIBLY only shows up one other time. There was no connection with any of the characters really since they're all nothing more than cliches.\n\nThe game has a total of ONE TRACK of a short piano piece on a loop. There will be background noises sometimes depending on the area which can make this short track even more annoying than it actually is. I would go insane listening to it as I merely got the gist of what was going on. I can't imagine what would happen if I took the time to go over all the details.\n\nThe whole thing about this game is making choices. It doesn't matter how many choices the GAME says there are because in reality there are only two every time. There can be 6 choices the GAME gives you, but there are really only two. It lists some options only to cross them out because you're "TOO DEPRESSED" which is just the most infuriating thing a game about choices can do. I understand my character is depressed, but don't tell me you're restricting my options because of this. Depression doesn't mean incapable of choosing to do enjoyable things. Depression doesn't make some options impossible, but it does make some options more difficult to make because of the emotional weight that just doesn't seem like something to bring around other people. The choices that were presented in this game seemed like they were made to guide the player towards one over the others. I can't choose the crossed out option, but I can choose the option that's the crossed out option with different words. The obvious right option sometimes is actually not always the obvious right option for someone who isn't depressed. The writers basically assume that this is how a normal life should be and anyone who isn't living like this is depressed. I don't have time for parties, internet interaction, and Netflix with a girlfriend when MY JOB is on the line. Depression should have nothing to do with that. Do my choices really matter? Only when it comes down to choosing to see a therapist and taking medicine is when it truly matters. The game is always telling you that you're not doing those things, so obviously the player can deduce that those are the things that must be done in order to win the game. In the real world a therapist and medication does NOT fix all cases of depression. Sometimes these things cause people to become more lost and more depressed.\n\nI do not believe that this game depicts depression exactly. There are many ways people can struggle with depression and I've only seen one very generic and uneducated depiction in Depression Quest. The writing is made to make your character obviously sad when sometimes it's not always so obvious even to those affected by this terrible state of mind. I, along with some of the other reviewers here, have struggled with depression and know how it feels. The game gives a trigger warning to anyone who has been depressed that this game might be too real and may emulate our own lives too well. IT DOES NOT!!! If anything it offends and belittles anyone in this very serious condition. I know it wasn't their intention to do so, but that's how I feel about it.\n\nDepression Quest is a pretentious way of bring attention to this issue. I'm not even happy that some of the money they receive to support this game goes to the Suicide Hotline. It should ALL go to the Suicide Hotline. It's insulting to think how these people have made money off of this. At the very least, it is at the least totally free if we choose it to be that way.\n\n1/10 since it was free. Play it if you want, but your time is better spent elsewhere.","March 21","false","0.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

You don't make the choices in the game, instead, the developer has already crossed off certain options in order to force you down the same bad ending. Depression Quest only tries to show the worst case scenario for depression, not at all acknowledging that it is treatable by the choices you make, instead, it portrays the only way to treat depression is with pills and a therapist. Notice how I said "tries", because even then everyone in the "game" acts like a complete idiot around the player.\n\nAccuracy aside, this is just a poor excuse for a "game". From the static overlay constantly on the screen in a pathetic attempt to make the mediocre story seem "deep" to the lack of multiple endings with your choices basically doing nothing, there's a reason this game's top reviews are mostly negative.","January 7, 2015","false","1.6"," 50 of 86 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","50","86","2","0"

All this story does is tell the reader about the authors point of view on depression from what seems to be from a female mindset, which is not educating people correctly on the matter.\n\nThis story doesn't express the difficulty of actually dealing with depression and how frustrated and hopeless you actually feel when dealing with this illness and even though the charactor refers to being 'exhausted' and 'emotionally drained', this is not the whole of what people feel in their battle with depression. This so called game is wrongly educating people on the subject.\nAlso, if you're struggling with depression this 'game' is not for you, as all it does is make you feel worse about yourself and the direction in which your own life is going, so don't waste your time on this poor excuse of a game.\n\nOverall, the music is terrible and repetative, the story is inacurate about the struggles of depression and it is wrongly categorised (this is most certainly not an RPG).","August 22, 2014","false","1.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Big time. A lot of the thought processes, situations, and dialogue that are used in this 'game' are somewhat relatable to some of my own experiences. The not feeling good enough for your partner, being emotionally exhausted, having to pep yourself up for menial activities...It's a lot more difficult than people realize, and I will give some credit to Depression Quest for trying to shed some light on that, for the small hints of it that are there.\n\nHowever, while I understand what this was trying to accomplish, there are better ways of doing so. This is not a game. It is an interactive journal essentially. It is trying to be a new-age look into a 'deep' soul that ends up sounding very pretentious. I just know most people do not want to sit and read walls of text(s) of sad things, which is probably one of the major reasons Depression Quest has been so negatively received. There's also the fact that the story overall really isn't even that engaging. I started skipping over entries after the seventh one and just clicked the most positive options to get to the end. I also can't stand the title. As another reviewer stated, Depression is not a 'quest' where you get a nice little reward for making it to the end. It's draining and exhausting. It's learning how to cope and when you think everything is fine and figured out, the rules change again for no reason. Basically, it's not nearly as straight-forward as this 'groundbreaking game' claims to be.\n\nI read a bit on Zoe Quinn and her desire to create a more straight-forward game because all the ones dealing with Depression are more metaphorical and about symbolism (which I prefer personally).

The writing in the game was very mundane I often had to read it a second time because I had drifted off. The choices also felt very fake and were not really choices because a lot of the time they were almost forced upon you.  The choices also made it seem like the devs did not want you to come out of your depression. The game also felt like it rushed the story. The story takes place over months but the writing makes it feel like it took place over a week. That is what overall made the game feel fake to me I didn’t feel like the protagonist I felt like a person clicking buttons and making choices that didn’t really affect me.

Twice. Upon playing it, I noticed a few things. This is, a graphical choose your own adventure book. But, I feel it sadly lacks substance. It doesn't touch on real depression. It doesn't at all represent those of us who have dealt with it. Struggled with it.\n\nThe narrative feels hollow at times. Disjointed. Even by graphic novel standards, this seems to be a hodgepodge of poorly done tripe. But the worst of it is, this simply doesn't touch on the real darkness of depression. The self apathy. The grueling feelings of despair. Perhpas another medium other than point and click might have worked. Random events, for example. A different format or engine.\n\nAs it is, I found this game lacking in every way. I found no emotional connection to a game that wants me to feel connected to it. To relate to it. I find it does a horrid job even depicting depression itself. It's simply a series of cliking on choice, and get better or worse. That's not even one tenth accurate. It's not showing the troubles one faces in feeling down, then depressed, then the utter despair.\n\nI tried going into this with an open mind, and realized this game was simply awful.","August 20, 2014","false","0.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I can't bring it to myself to give this game a good review. I tried to give this game at least one full playthrough but after about 10 minutes I really couldn't do it. I understand what this game is trying to do but honestly its execution is downright ♥♥♥♥ poor. I know everyones battle with depression is different and many people deal with it in different ways but this game only gives, in my opinion, a sterotypical depression outlook. Some of the good options to pick through to advance in the story are crossed off. As it seems like a person battling with depression is unable to do those things. It would have done the game more justice to let the player pick some of the more social and common things to see how a person with depression would react to them! I know when I was battling with depression I still tried my hardest to do what was right and I went after help to get things under control. So overall do yourself a favor and don't play this game. The game isn't even worth it to be free. Go download the demo for Five Night's at Freddys or something. Or if you want a good visual novel expierence go pick up Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright:Ace Attorney next week.\n\nI'll probably sit down and play the game from start to finish and give my full thoughts on this, however the game just isn't worth your time.","August 20, 2014","false","0.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Jesus, does this whole drama situation make me angry. Angry that I can't do anything about it. I'll start off by saying something that might seem irrelevant. I consider my political stance quite conservative. But you see one thing that I see often labeled as "the liberal idea" is that the government has total control over you, and you are simply puppets. Now to a certain extent I see this fit, because after all I'd like to have some control and not erupt into anarchy. But that doesn't mean I'm willing to live in an orwellian society where citizens have no voice. Why am I talking about this? Well see, what sparked my interest in this game was the actions of the Reddit r/gaming subreddit. Comments being deleted. Now that isn't maintaining order. That is flat out repressing our voice. How can you even call it a public forum anymore? It's not like those comments were yelling obsecnities, posting links to viruses, or bullying each other. They were talking about the situation, maybe asking question about the situation, and simply getting deleted. Now I like going to the gaming reddit sometimes to read up on news and stuff. Gaming is something I consider a big part of my life. When I saw something like that happening, it was kind of an eye-opener. A feeling of, wow this is right at my doorstep, kind of feeling. Suddenly, my closeted political activist side of me thought, alright that's it. So many things in this world that I am upset with. Israel and Hammas, ISIS, The looting in Ferguson. And then there's this. Yes, compared to what I talked about this whole ordeal is of lesser importance, yet I think I'm going to voice my opinion about it. This kind of thing probably happens everyday in our government. Corruption. Manipulation of press. Don't tell me that someone sleeping with someone else in exchange for priority over others is not corruption. If it isn't then why aren't we allowed to discuss it? Why do I go through those threads and see *deleted* *deleted* *deleted* everywhere? One more thing. Another reason this game doesn't recieve my support is because of the way this creator has acted publicly on twitter. Alogn with others. I'm not part of this wizchan forum, but jesus, the things peopele were saying about them. THAT is the real abuse. THAT is the bullying. Many feminists are headstrong about the use of sensitive terms and advocate the consideration of other peoples thoughts and feeligns. I respect and admire that. But what I saw was the term 'virgin' being thrown around with a incredibly huge negative connotation. Where's the respect for people following religions that advocate abstinence till marriage? So no, I can't have respect for someone making a game, who is immature, insensitive, could possibly be lying!?!?! (ever thought of that? who really did call her?), and just flat out immoral. I cant support conspiracy and manipulation.\n\nBut for those of you who want an actual game review. Well I watched a playthrough. Despite others, I thought the idea of the game was amazing. Truly needed in our society right now. But the playthrough that I watched. My god this game misses the mark completely. Just really shoddy work all around. Makes this important topic look very dissmissive. A careless approach to what I thought was a good idea. Surely there wasn't enough work done on this game. I guess it makes sense it was free. But unless this developer puts out anoher free game that truly reflects impressive, hardworked, artistic work. Then sure, I'll give a thumbs up for that one. But for this one, well sorry but it really isn't good.\n\nAs I said, I'm just here to rant, and provide my opinion on the game. If you want to reply, you wont get a reply from me. Dont think of that as "Oh man, I really got hime! He's at a loss for words and cant provide a rebuttal!" No. I'm not going to spend my time arguing about this. Just here to do my job downvoting what I think is a disgrace to the gaming comunity and harfmul   to the industry.","August 19, 2014","false","0.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

It's not a good tale about depression, nor could I connect to it in any way, shape or form. The choices that this game has feel like they were just thrown in there for the sake of making this thing an interactive experience, and there are some places where choices could have been put there, but for some reason weren't put in those places (probably laziness). In conclusion, I find this virtual "choose-your-own-adventure" book to be lame, and not worth the free download. You're better off picking up a good book rather than "playing" this garbage. Overall, this game gets a rating of Five Guys Burgers and Fries out of Ten. Also, despite the "Time Spent" counter saying that I completed this thing in about 42 minutes, I left this running while I was AFK, so the time that it took me to complete was probably way shorter than 42 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*inb4 All the SWJs come pouring in calling me a woman hater*","August 20, 2014","false","0.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","4"

The story is set in a very generic context: you live with your mother, you have an old brother and a girlfriend, you have a job and everything seems to fall apart. The writing style doesn't manage to deliver the complexities of depression. It is like listening to a casual conversation so there is nothing creative about the writing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/270170/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","There are two things I want to discuss here.  The game itself, and the controversy.\n\nThe Game:\n\nThis is not a traditional game, rather a kind of interactive novel.  It is more along the lines of a choose-your-own-adventure type game.\n\nIt follows the life of someone struggling with depression, in the second person, in an attempt to illustrate the experience.\n\nWhile it's a noble goal, the game itself tries to beat the atmosphere and helplessness into you in such an awkward way that playing this is unpleasant.  Not in an "uncomfortable because it's thought-provoking" way, but an "I can't do anything" way.\n\nWere it not for the disclaimer page before the game starts, I would be concerned about it trivializing the condition by stereotyping it.\n\nI have not put much time into this game, and I don't think I will.  It's just too uncomfortable.  Fortunately if you do try it, it is not very long and can be finished in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe Controversy:\n\nFace it.  The negative reviews and forum posts on this game are not because of the game itself, but are about the creator, Zoe Quinn.  Quinn's ex-boyfriend made a number of allegations about her, and her personal life basically went viral.  It's become a sport in the last few weeks to attack Quinn directly and indirectly for the unforgiveable sin of "doing it".  It's like the Internet is made of middle school kids giggling while getting their shamesticks out.\n\nLook.  We get it.  She isn't a nun, nor did she claim to be.  That has nothing to do with the game.  Even when you try to disguise misogyny as being about journalistic integrity, or honesty, or whatever excuse gets used.  When the method is calling someone a "hooker" or making "5 guys" jokes, that's not about journalism.  That's about her private life.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is not fun or enjoyable.  It's kind of an interesting experiment, but most people will probably want to avoid it.  Unfortunately a straight review is hard to find in the nest of cruel and inappropriate snark.  This game is marred by the public reaction to it.","August 31, 2014","false","0.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","4"

It's a wonderful game with lots of potential and is crisply written and nocely noted.\n\nNow what I say beyond this point is basically a spoiler and if you intend on playing the game, I don't recommend reading. But if your interested on why I don't recommend it, keep reading.\n\nAs a man who's had major depression, and has been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder (A disease that makes it harder to comprehend reality and gives you immense mood swings.), I have to say that the justification given in the ending I GOT, is NOT the way to approach depression. It doesn't matter if the story has multiple branches and has various amounts of endings, it should all end in the RIGHT way to treat depression and not with the going excuse of just saying "deal with it".\n\nFor one thing, depression is not something you can just accept and just let it pass. Like any form of mental disorder, it can be treated with the right amount of medicine and seeing a therapist. It makes me angry seeing how a game about something as serious as depression can just say "you have to live with it". Depression is something YOU CANNOT just say go away to.\n\nNow I know the game is probably vouching for many playthroughs, and it wants you to find the "optimal path" to fighting depression, but the problem is that there IS NO SPECIFIC PATH to fighting depression. And giving the answer to people who may have depressio to just deal with it is the WRONG APPROACH.\n\nWith Depression, you have to be more careful in what you tell the public due to the numerous misconceptions about the disease. Depression is CURABLE, it's something that could be fought with help. Giving an ending that says deal with it is not only infuriating to me as someone who has known and has had depression himself, but also infuriating because it sending the wrong message to people.\n\nNow what can I recommend to make the game more exact in how to treat depression and how to articulate depression better? I would make the story have branching paths, but have it only have one ending which is getting yourself cured. Giving the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you just deal with it is NOT the way to do it. With a premise as important as this, you have to tell the right message and not muddle the message by adding mechanics that hinder it.\n\nSo that's what I think. Depression Quest is not something I would recommend listening to but would recommend actually playing to see what experiance you might actually get. From the looks of it, there's a way to get to the right ending, but giving an endng that just says to deal with it is not the way to go.\n\nTo all of those who have depression, please seek help immideately. Dont be afraid to go to a psychiatrist and talking about it. The psychiatrist is payed to listen to you. Don't be afraid if he will started judging you or something, because he wont. He will help you, and will get you better.\n\nSpread the word that Depression is something you can FIGHT, not just AVOID.","September 6, 2014","false","0.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

This is not a game, this is an interactive Short Story.. My rationale for it being a non-game is that it has no gameplay just hyperlinks that can be done in so many different ways including powerpoint. I can't see how this got through greenlight or how it won awards especially over Papers Please.. Personally, I come from a family that does have Depression problems in it and this game while it gets some things right most other problems it doesn't. So don't buy the hype you see from these "professional" reviewers.. It is just insane how they think this is a perfect way to understand depression. Its not. I still have my Psychology text books and those are more clearly defined and from personal experience as well.\n\nMy next problem is on the writing level.. there is no characterization, not even a very good idea of the feelings one experiences when being depressed. But it does get some right. It is very hard to even care about the protagonist or even the choices you make since the weight to them is painfully clear. Some more emotional weight and more atmosphere would have been better suited for the emotional impact. Heck it doesn't even have anything in the way of a hero's journey or even much depth of character.\n\nOverall, even though this is a free game its best to avoid this story and actually read up on depression and actually support those suffering from it. Encourage them to get the help they need even if they are afraid. Pro tip for the creator, more depth, more emotion, more characterization, and more atmosphere. Plus researching and interviewing would help too.. That is my friendly advice from me to you writer to writer.","September 5, 2014","false","0.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

Realistically however, depression doesn't just go away, it comes in tremors, one day you'll be laughing with your friends and playing games, next day you'll be regretting life and considering suicide. The only way that I made it this far through my depression is because I don't want to end up like some relatives of mine, forgotten through time by those around them. The depiction of depression in this game makes it seem that everyday is spent in endless peryl and suffering, and it's always black and white and lethargic, however I can wholeheartedly vouch that it is not.

NOPE.\n\n\nAs someone currently struggling with depression, I find most of this game very controversial. Yes, it may be accurate in few areas, but it is also a very vague and inaccurate representation of someone with such a mind. We with depression DO like to hang out with friends and seek help. The answers were extremely pointed and were obviously only leading to one end. So basically, in summary, the representation of a mind with depression is appalling.\n\nOn top of this, the background noise/music/whatever was the most irritating thing I have ever had to listen to - and I've listened to Justin Bieber. It was EXTREMELY basic and could've had AT LEAST SOME effort put into it.\n\nThe game itself was just boring. A bunch of text with a few answers at the bottom of every second page? My five year old cousin could make that. There was nothing to interact with or to make the person playing feel like they were experiencing this all first hand.\n\nAlso, when you're making a game, PLEASE get some interesting pictures.

Are you sure you know what a game is? I've had better experiences from YouTube annotations. Also can i consider this "retro"? since i have not seen Web1.0 since grade school.\n\n2/10.\n\nAs a book though, the story was rather engaging for a short while. This should be a a book/ E-book amateur short story Why amateur? Because the writing could be improved. Though your "options" made the main character (MC) look more like a lazy, anti-social, procrastinating and loathing person*(i wanted to use a different word here). MC does not seem like a person suffering from depression. Maybe thats why it's "(non) fiction" instead of  "non-fiction". see the difference? the brackets or lack thereof emphasize two different meanings. You give players/readers different choices but restricting them whereas in real life, a person suffering from depression or not is free to make those choices, no matter how unlikely. Also your MC has a S.O, a house, no financial problems whsoever, circle of friends and still have depression?\n\n3/10.\n\nTL;DR : I do not recommend this "game" because this (Steam) is a platform for games. This should have been released on a different platform. As an E-Book or audio book for example.\n\n\n\nEdit: My post in their forums got deleted.

I hated playing this, but I played all the way through.\n\nFirst off: Title is completely misleading, I was completely expecting to be playing an RPG but it turned out this wasnt an RPG... The entire game I thought was like a cinematic where you create the storyline for your character before you start the game. Extremely misleading...\n\nSecond off: There were a lot of parts where I just wanted to smash my girlfriend, but the game DID NOT ALLOW THIS, EXTREMELY UNREALISTIC. If I was super depressed or anything, I would just smash my girl and be done with my issues.\n\nThird off: I dont understand quite why some of the options were completely unavailable to choose from: perhaps I was playing the game wrong? Missed the pre-requisites? Maybe I wasn't a high enough level and after the long cinematic I would be able to choose a class and go back to have those options available? No, not in this game, this game was not a game where you could do whatever you want..\n\nMy suggestion to the developer : Change the name of your game, I was not on a quest, I did not save the princess, I did not get any poonanny, I didn't make it to the highest level, and I didnt slay the ♥♥♥♥ing dragon - this is not a quest!!!!!!!\n\nIf you dont wanna change the name of the game, you might wanna make it so that after the whole depression storyline, you can actually move on to the quest and choose a class and ♥♥♥♥, but dont do like Rogue Warrior and Sorcerer either, that's too cliche, you should make it so you dont really have a class, but you choose what skills you wanna be good at, know what I mean?\n\nPros: awesome soundtrack - I personally downloaded the soundtrack and use it when I workout\nbeautiful quality images - I felt like I was actually watching netflix at one point when the netflix screen popped up\n\nCons: no real quests\nno classes\nno boss fights\nno xp system\na lot of options unavailable\ncould not smash girl\ncould not get into hard drugs\n\n\nI would NOT recommend this game to a friend.

Might have potential, but is weighed down (By glitches, poor/uninteresting design and controls, ETC)\n5/10: Average\n7/10: Well made\n9/10: Stellar\nI do not give 10/10's, as there is no such thing as perfection. I do not give 0/10's, unless the game truly lacks something. And I always round down.\n\nReview Intro:\n\nWhen I was in elementary school, I would read a few choose-your-own adventure books in the library. For vague reasons, a friend told me to try this game out and see what I thought of it.\n\nGameplay: 2.5/10\n\nDepression Quest is not a game, it is instead a virtual Choose-your-own-adventure story that does not let you choose your adventure, as it will frequently provide you with many options that cannot actually be selected. This single fact made me lose interest rapidly. If the game had allowed you to select those options, but the results would vary based on the three stats displayed at the bottom of every page (Depression level, therapist level, and medication level), the game might take a turn for the better. The three options do change based on some available actions, but the fact that it means nothing is disappointing. The option for plugging a controller in is strange and entirely unneeded.\n\nGameplay Suggestions: Allow the ability to select options who's results vary based on the stats located at the bottom of the page: Depression Level, Therapist Level ( Which would include seeing a therapist, and one's relation with said therapist) and Medication level (level of medication in one's system at that time.). Do not deprive the player of their aility to choose: There is always a choice.\n\nGraphics (For the sake of this particular review, this will include music): 1/10\n\nI've never been a fan of grayscaled images. That comment aside, this program features limited visuals that are meant to go alongside the story text, but due to the nature of the layout these pictures fall to the wayside on longer text instances. The music is meant to set a sad mood, and ignoring the fact that slow piano music has become a staple for sad game moments, the lack of variety in music made things feel monotonous...The piano number is also boring, to be blunt.\n\nGraphics Suggestions: Different music numbers to coincide with different events, that, like the singular piano number, are meant to envoke feelings. There are many kinds of sadness, there should be just as many sad music numbers. If the game is changed to feature more scenes and instances, have music that accompanies it: Music that shows joy, anger, defeat.\n\nStory/Writing: I divide the Story/Writing into three categories. Theme, Characters, and Quality. The total score for writing is 5/30, or 1.6/10, rounded down.\n\nTheme: 1/10\n\nDepression is a serious topic. However, depression on it's own is not enough, thematically, for a game. We need to better see a gradual decent into the depths of sorrow, but being able to rise above and triumph over depression is just as satisfying as defeating the final boss in any other game. This game lacks any of those feelings, and in turn I felt nothing from the game.\n\nTheme Suggestions: Make me feel something.\n\nCharacters: 3/10\n\nThe protagonist is unnamed, and meant to be an avatar for the player to see the world with. I did not once feel connected to the world or the plights of the protagonist. The reason for this is tied heavily to my comments in regards to 'gameplay'. We have Alex, your 'significant other', but we know very little about them, and less of the other minor characters such as Attic. Alongside the lack of noteworthy characters, the story does not make you feel for the characters already present.\n\nCharacter Suggestions: Add additional characters. Usually an iffy topic for any story, but when your story lacks characters, you need a few more to bring life to the world. Provide us with more details of these characters; make us feel for these characters. Yes the story is about the protagonist, but those characters are a part of the protagonist's world. At present, they exist moreso to advance the story.\n\nWriting Quality: 1/10\n\nDepression Quest lacks it's quest.\n\nI found the writing to be similar to a High Schooler's Biology essay: It might look proper, but there's no soul to it. It's also short.\n\nOn the first playthrough the protagonist broke up with Alex, and then a few turns later the story ended. On the second playthrough the protagonist went to a therapist and got some medications, and actually seemed to start to get better (which almost made me become interested in the story) and then a few turns later the story ended. If I decided to suffer a third time through, it would go on for a bit, and then the story would end.\n\nTHE STORY WOULD END. Yes, all stories have to end, but when the ending is "Thank you for playing, we know this might not be the easiest game...". First off, game is the wrong word (see Gameplay review), secondly you do not deprive the reader of the story's end unless you've crafted the story in such a way that it can be interpreted freely by the reader...which is not how a 'Choose-Your-Own-Adventure' works. You do not interprete the end because you found the end, and the end is not a message from the author, it is THE END of the story.\n\nStory Suggestions: Start over. That's all I can say.\n\nOveral Game Score: By math, the score is 5.1/30, or 1.7/10. But my soul believes the score to be 1/10, at the most generous.\n\nDepression Quest attempts to show us the world of someone who is depressed, but it's limited gameplay and poor story are the only depressing things to be found. I would suggest that Depression Quest either evolve into an actual, fully fleshed out Text-Based Adventure game that challenges the player to free the protagonist from the bonds of depression, or be transformed into a Short Story piece. It cannot operate as both.\n\nAlso, and this question is solely to my fellow reviewers: What in blazes does Five Guys have to do with any of this?","August 20, 2014","false","0.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","2"

On top of that for the first half of the game what seemed like wrong choices (since they were doing nothing) turned out to be right choices closer to the end of the game. The fact that seeing what I thought would be common sense and the right answer rejected and then picked up later sort of brought the feeling like I could have done better in the game even though, in all likelyhood, I had a near perfect game.\n\nI also had an issue with the music. I get that it was supposed to help greaten the story, or maybe even cover over it, but  it wound up distracting me from the story. I of course didn't turn the music off out of fear that the generally labeled "sound" would somehow be important later in game (it wasn't). By the end of the game I was not only not affected by the music but I was out right sick of it.\n\nAnother issue is that some of the points are automatically crossed off. This lead to a more straight-forward feel to the game instead of the (hopefully) intended mood of it being a choose your own adventure. By the end of it I felt like there could have been a completely better and different game if you didn't focus on keeping the character so depressed for half the game.\n\nSo in summary I feel as though Depression Quest has a lacking storyline, monotone music that will bore you to tears, a confusing choice of story options, and a lack of creative writing that will never really help draw in the player.\n\nI rated it a 4/10 because it was honestly not a bad game considering it was free, just medicore at best.  If it was paid I probably would have never bought it because even the cover art draws me off from this title.","July 2, 2015","false","2.7"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

About an hour into the game, I figured out that the choices presented all had a very easy to predict path. I could be a loner at the party, or I could be cheery. Guess what made me sink deeper into a depression? That's right. The game is too easy to predict, so I didn't really enjoy, especially since I do have these thoughts. It tells me that I only have one way to go if I choose the choices I would, because it would be hopeless. I can respect what the creator was trying to do, but this is something extremely tricky to create a game out.\n\nI'm even directing a play about depression and suicide, and it has been difficult. She goes with the stereotypes and connotations associated with depression, when there is a lot more that goes into it other than feeling hopeless.

And a bad one at that. The dialogue is rubbish. The choices are very limited and unrealistic, basically boiling down to "sink into depression because the game says so". Music is a bad looped piano. This "game" doesn't give you any background information or characters' backstories. There's no way you can feel for the characters.\n\nFailing at it's main reason for existance, it doesn't even capture depression realistically nor does it get the point out there. The main character laments over his pointless life while having friends, a decent job, family and their loved one, making them sound like a jaded emo kid from a rich family. Why are they not at a therapy? Why do they start at despair?\n\nThe idea of Depression Quest isn't half bad, but the execution is just painful. Does it work good as a book? No, not at all. 95% of the contenent on fanfiction.net marked as "angst" shows depression better than this.  Does it work well as a interactive story? Yeah no. Any choose your own adventure or even visual novel (if you're into them) does its job better than this. As a simulation? Oh please.\n\nRead any book on the subject, even if it's under average for better experience than this. It has nothing going for it. Rubbish about an important issue is still rubbish. As a person that experienced depression, I'll tell you this: It's rubbish. Don't waste your time. It's junk like this that drives others to despair thanks to depression being displayed so shallowly in media, with others claiming to suffer from it because it's "cool, since my favourite video character suffers from it!". I wonder if Steam realizes that most of the recommendations for crap like this go among the line of "10/10 cured my cancer".","August 23, 2014","false","0.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

People have been bringing up the controversy with Quinn, but here's the thing: it has nothing to do with Depression Quest so I could care less about someone's personal life simply because it was never my business to begin with so lets move away from that and actually talk about the "game".\n\nDepression Quest is simply a choose you own adventure kind of ordeal touching upon the subject of depression and I have mixed feelings on how the subject matter was handled. I do like on how it simulated the feeling of depression since there is a sense of hopelessness in the world, but what also irritates me is that they crossed out choices that makes a real positive impact in your life and forces you to remain in a state of depression for the entire run, which for those people who are currently or formerly depressed might not find this helpful in any shape or form (at least they gave us a warning about suicidal thoughts). You are basically just some guy in his twenties who currently is in a state of depression possibly because of an inferiority complex constantly comparing himself with his friends and family including his significant other.\n\nUnfortunately the soundtrack basically consists of one track on a loop the entire time and for me, it did not deliver much of an impact so that was pretty disapointing because if Depression Quest wasn't good, (which it wasn't) I was hoping the music would at least make up for it.\n\nDespite having multiple "endings", I had no desire to go back and find out what they are because I feel it would be similar to one another, which is falling into despair with no chance of self redemption with the best "ending" is continuing to assess your condition which in no way it feels reassuring which is the purpose of this "game" and it acheives it.\n\nI do not know much about depression other than it negatively affects the relationships of those around the victim, so to end this, I can only say to those who is or knows someone that is depressed, try to be patient and get assistance as soon as possible.\n\n","August 19, 2014","false","1.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Played this again to see if they’ve made any changes to the possible choices. From what I can tell, no changes were made and the decision making is still very contrived. Would hardly consider this a game about depression. If anything, I’d change the game’s name from “Depression Quest” to “Bob’s Quest, Who Happens to Have Depression With a Set of Very Specific Circumstances.”\n\nThe thing I hate about this the most (which I don't remember from the flash version) is the music. This works better without any music playing. The fact that it has the piano playing a tune that belongs in a funeral proceeding like that in the background is almost expecting things to turn out poorly.\n\n3/10 - Would rather feed Cid bad fish and have Celes jump off the cliff instead.","August 19, 2014","false","1.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The character comes across as more of a self-absorbed ♥♥♥♥ with no backbone, whom they try to give an illusion of having depression by greatly limiting any decisions made available to the character.

I played the game for about twenty minutes, and then uninstalled it. The game struck me as boring, and lacking in any actual gameplay mechanics. I found little interest in the game's story, and the attempts at atmospheric piano music wore thin after it began to loop. As for how this game relates to helping you understand depression, I cannot say. I have never experienced depression myself, but it seems to me that the character in this game is incredibly fortunate to have so many supportive people when they have such a severe problem. Overall, I feel this game would be more approrpriate on a flash game site like newgrounds, as this is more of a choose your own adventure book then a game","August 22, 2014","false","0.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It seems like the people behind it follows the "tublr-definition" of depression, and not the real definition of depression. Every "choice" you make is not really a choice, and leads to the same ends (at least as far as I can see), which is probably to strenghten the message that depression is a vicious circle. But this game is just throwing the message down your throat, like if you didn't already know it.\nOn top of that you have a boring, and not even that depressing piano-piece playing in the background all the time, where it would just have been easier to put "mad world" on the soundtrack and be done with it, and even come out with a more effective result, if only slightly.\nAnd while I am totally for artsy games, and are myself an avid fan of companies like Tale of Tales and the Fullbright Company, this game just doesn't hold any merit, even as being an "art-game".\nPlus, the amount of spelling mistakes in this game is unbearable, and I began skipping a lot of text after a few screens, because of the major unimportance it had, and on top of that the horrible writing and lack of proof-reading. I'm surprised that a game with this great a following could not even get some volunteer fans to proof-read and "play-test".\n\nDo NOT waste your time on this mess. Go read a book instead, it's a way more fulfilling experience. And if you want something containing a lot of depression or depressing subjects, then let me suggest Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven" or anything by Victor Hugo.","August 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

So how is this game ? Its not good its actually quite bad and i honestly dont suggest you play it. The game tries to make you depressed while playing it but all it does is bore you to death. The game is essiantly a novel with choice making which doenst affect the story at all. The game doenst have anything under its belt and all of is just bad. So ill just try to explain everything thats bad about it. The game is incredibly short. You can pretty much breeze through the game in under an hour which already as bad as it is. The games writing is awfull. It makes the game feel unfinished and its not very good. Overall there is another problem with it and that the choices dont affect the story which is stupid which revolves around choices. Overall the only saving grace is that the game is free which all i can say about it. Depression Quest is a boring mess you should only play if youre incredibly bored and dont have a better game to play. I give Depression Quest a 4/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 29, 2014","false","0.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

It doesn't seem like any of your choices really do much of anything, and since there's also no ending, there's no point/motivation anyway. It's essentially just randomly clicking links until you get bored. It's extremely short too; when it finished, I hadn't even reached an hour of play time.\n\nAudio: 1/10\n\nThe audio was just annoying. It's described as being an important part of the experience, but all it is is really plain and awkwardly slow piano music that tries way too hard to sound sad. There was also audio of people talking, which was... okay, I guess. The sound all sounded a little off but I assume that was on purpose.\n\nGraphics: 0/10\n\nThe only graphics were small grainy photographs that appeared over each wall of text. Even without the filters, they look like bad amateur "photography" taken with an old webcam. This contributed to the unprofessional feel of the game.\n\nStory: 0/10\n\nIt's aimless. There's no plot. The pacing is really quick, and you find your character suddenly go from miserably depressed to "barely depressed" in a span of five minutes. A lot of your choices have no real bearing on what will happen anyway. We aren't at any point made to care about this character, so we're stuck lugging through as a guy we don't care about moans about how miserable his life is. I don't know what emotions we were supposed to be feeling throughout the course of this game, but I assume "annoyance" and "boredom" are not on the list.\n\nIt's also not an accurate portrayal of depression. It's so much more multifaceted than it's portrayed here, and it's obvious that the developer has either never experienced depression or was trying to portray a blatantly fake, one-dimensional depression stereotype.\n\nWriting: 0/10\n\nSince this is a choose your own adventure book rather than a game, I feel the need to comment on the writing. It's nothing short of awful. To visualize, imagine everything that good writers do; then, imagine that the writer aimed to do exactly the opposite. The Choose Your Own Adventure books in the kids section at the library are more thought-provoking and engaging.\n\nOverall: -10/10\n\nYes, that's a negative ten. It's a book, not a game, and it's a bad book at that. Why was this greenlit...?","August 23, 2014","false","1.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bofast/recommended/270170/","Bofast","Aerwidh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bofast/","355 products in account","So, I only played this to see what that whole scandal (and the surrounding mess) on the Internet was about. If it hadn't been for all that, I would not be here writing this.\n\nIs depression a real problem for many? Yes.\nCan it be useful to discuss in a public setting? Sure.\nIs this the way to do it? Not really.\n\nThis is like one of those "Choose You Own Adventure" kind of little stories, except it's about depression instead of adventure. There's no actual gameplay, just pages of text and a list of choices that branch the narrative out in different ways. The happy choices are crossed out, so you can only pick less happy ones. Depending on your choices, you get different ending text, but considering that the ending was not even particularly interesting, I see no reason to replay it.\n\nThe continuity in the narrative is so-so. Even after I kept picking "positive" choices and having my avatar be open about how things were, and so on, for quite some time, the text would occasionally revert to my avatar being back to the bottom without recognizing the previous progress "upwards" in the text, except for the three status phrases always shown near the bottom. It felt rather forced, I must say.\n\nAlso, regarding the way this whole narrative is presented, I don't get why they would choose to make the reader's perspective one where the narrative keeps pushing "you feel this", "you feel that", "you think this", when clearly that is not going to be the case. It just pushed me, as a reader, away. Combined with the heavy handed narrative that gives the impression that your choices don't necessarily matter all that much, it comes close to breaking even this basic "Choose Your Own Adventure" structure. What were they thinking?\n\nThey ask you to play with sound on, as it's supposed to be part of the experience, but it's really just annoying. Poor piano music and the occasional annoying sound effect just bugged me. Visually, the presentation looks like a bunch of white web pages with black text, a picture here and there and some links, which I suppose might be pretty close to the truth. The whole thing feels as though it had little to no effort put into anything outside the text itself, which perhaps had some effort put into it but seemingly suffers from a lack of storytelling skill.\n\nTo summarize, this product of just barely interactive fiction did not tell me anything new about depression, nor did it make me more aware of it than I was previously. If someone claims it's educational, don't believe them. It really isn't.\nIt also has no real entertainment value, so no points there. Those "professional" reviews shown on the store page are just a bunch of non-sense, which is admittedly not all that surprising.\nDecent products typically exist to do a job for a consumer, be it to educate, to still hunger, to save time or money, or whatever. I can't think of any job that this thing does for a gamer or reader. Perhaps it serves as a vent of sorts for its creators, I don't know. What I do know is that I cannot think of any good reason for this to be on Steam.\n\nI wasted a little over half an hour on this, but you don't have to. If it wasn't for the publicity this got from that big mess on the Internet, this little story piece would have been largely ignored and quickly forgotten, and for good reason. It's just not worth your time, so go spend that time on something worthwhile, like doing something fun and/or hanging out with someone who needs you.","August 27, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But amid the turmoil, I found myself somewhere I didn't want to be -a particularly hateful state of mind. I've said things I am not proud of and decided to cool off and approach the axis of this whole ordeal with the presence of mind to be as objective and purely observant as possible, and leaving behind any intial personal feelings and bias so that I may gain a perspective. I am not a professional video game critic in the least bit, but I do write and edit people's stories as a hobby, so I like to think that I have a credible right to review this.\n\nWith all that said, and after playing through, I do no recommend this game.\n\nForemostly -and this critical point has been brought up before- can this really be considered a game? It is a digital choose-your-own-adventure novel that feels like it belongs to a site dedicated to ametuer fiction or to an art blog like Deviantart -not a video game distributer. I feel Depression Quest would of been more appropriate and more well received if it were distributed on an art site where skill progression and opinionated pieces are welcome. But Steam brings with it a great expectation, and you can be hard hit by the community if you fall short of it with even the greatest intentions. There just isn't a place for a glorified book in steam, and I feel that alone warrants my negative recommendation.\n\nBut beyond where and how the developers chose to distribute Depression Quest, the game falls flat in a number of ways. Despite a fairly strong start, the protagonist becomes insufferable and I find it impossible to sympathize half the time, and this is due to, for the most part, the constant repitition of the same theme of "I'm sad". The chapters blend together as a blur of melancholy and it becomes increasingly difficult for me to go on as it progresses to the point that it is so dull it becomes a chore to keep on reading. Each page felt like a rehash of the previous with a different background and theme like a depression Madlib. My determination to see it through to the end to gain perspective on the situation was the only thing that kept me going, and I otherwise would of just stopped half way through if this wasn't the case.\n\nThen there is the sporadic grammar mistakes, colorless style, lackluster attempt at scenery and visuals, bluntness in the expression of emotions and feelings where I'm just told how he feels and am expected to just accept it -not a sight of subtley to be seen. And there's just a general lack of direction, with what would seem obvious to be the main goal of being 'not depressed' always being touched upon but never probed. Without the going into detail of the process of recovering and coping with depression, all this is is page after page of complaining and whining, with brief breaks to choose between an obviously good choice and the obviously bad one -which brings me to my last point.\n\nLiterally the only gameplay mechanic the game provides is terrible. There is no critical decisions to be made. One is always the best choice with the rest at varying degerees of bad, making the story linear and defeating the purpose of a choice system, and therefore effectively turning this into a book entirely. The only reason to choose the bad decisions is just to speed through it again to see how it ends differently -and spoiler: it isn't suicide. Yes, what you would expect be the greatest and most terrible end the character could possibly find in game about depression is not that. Not to say that I was hoping to see someone, even fictional, lose themselves to the struggle with depression, but it would add such a greater depth when the reppercussions of not being able to solve your issues with depression is ultimately depth at your own hands.\n\nIf this game achieved anything, it definitely looks like a depressed person designed it, but it needs a writer that can bring across the feeling of depression and have it seep into the reader with the protagonist's actions and thoughts without the writer themselves getting absorbed in self-pity. If this was a story I received from a upstart writer, I would praise him/her/whoever for what they accomplished, but would stress that they put asside a few more months to work on it and make it everything it could be. However; this is a professional, million dollar site that I and everyone else expects a higher standard from, and this game is below that standard. Its only saving grace is that it's free.","August 19, 2014","false","2.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

From my point of view this game was clearly made by someone TRYING to be insightful, but who had a less then terrible grasp on the source material. This project is to accurate portrayal of mental health issues what Victorian era wandering womb & hysteria diagnosis’s are to modern medicine: In no way related.\n\nWhatever this project is, one thing is for certain, it needs to not be on steam: Steam is a place for games, not emo masturbation fantasies conveyed in tumblr blogspot style wall of text, with annoying eye straining animation, repetitive image use & white noise static for music.\n\nWatching this game scramble for mediocrity and failing is just painful to watch: I'm not depressed, but i'm pretty sure i would be if this was the best thing i could create given how much support the author was given to succeed.\n","August 20, 2014","false","1.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And that's sad, because that's the only purpose this game serves. It isn't fun. It doesn't hold your attention very well. There's no substance to it.\n\nThe online conversation with "attic" was the most relatable part of the game, and I almost missed it. He was the main reason I even played as long as I did.\n\nIf the intent was to show how much of a chore life seems to be when you're depressed, you certainly hit the nail on the head. This game is a chore. You have barely any input on what your character does. You just sort of meander around. "Yeah, I'd like a kitten." "Netflix sounds good right about now." "Yeah sure I'll drink a beer." Again, I suppose this is an accurate simulation of living life while you're depressed, but if the goal of the game is to give people who don't suffer from depression a way to unerstand what depression is like... Well, I don't think they're going to stick around for it very long. Maybe that was the point, but as a story piece we should really have a reason to care about our protagonist. We're just thrust into it, all we know about them is that they have a girlfriend, a brother, parents, a job; like to watch Netflix and chat with internet friends... And that's it. That's literally it.\n\nIf your goal was to give people who don't suffer depression an idea of what it's like to suffer depression, you should really have made more of an effort to keep them engaged. If your goal was to give people who suffer depression a story they could relate to, again, you should have done something to keep them engaged.","August 20, 2014","false","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClassyQuinn/recommended/270170/","ClassyQuinn","Mackdonalds Fries","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClassyQuinn/","251 products in account","Okay this isn't going to be a negative review for it being "Not a game" as that's just a pretty ridiculous thing to complain about. Depression Quest, as a product, simply can't exist as anything else other than an interactive experience which at least today, we call a game. It can't be a movie because of the multiple choices, but it also can't be a "Choose your own adventure" book because of the fact that not all choices are available, so it has every reason to be a game. Sorry guys but not all games have to be about winning or losing anymore; whether you like that or not.\n\nAnyway yeah Depression Quest, I'm giving this a Negative review not because of what it is, but how it does what it wants to do badly. There are good aspects to the game, I personally like how the more depressed you are the less options you're available to choose, you know it's a nice blend of storytelling and gameplay. Also I dig the grain filter on the images, it's pretty fitting as depression's about exhaustion and the grain makes things seem well... exhausted.\n\nBut that's about it for what I like about Depression Quest. Depression Quest simply doesn't do its task well. For starters the choices you have to solve the depression are PAINFULLY obvious. If someone was to tell someone with depression how to solve it, they'd say "Take Medication, see a therapist and talk with people about your feelings", things which are much easier to say than do, and while could help depression, it's not necessarily all there is to helping it. Well that's all you need to do to solve it according to the game. A small child could solve the character's depression in this as you simply just do the things that seem helpful. The game could have presented player with harder to understand options, have the more positive options not always be the highest available one, anything. But it doesn't so solving depression is just easy according to the game.\n\nAnd I know you're supposed to put yourself in the character's shoes but you can't really. You're basically told how to feel about situations and characters around you. The game could have very much benefitted from things such as interacting with the co-workers you don't get along with to see why we don't relate to them, but basically the game just tells us we don't which makes it harder for me to be in the character's shoes.\n\nNow I'm not depressed. I enjoy my life quite a bit. However even if I was depressed, I'd still be hesitant to relate with this character. I won't know the people in this game, I won't experience the job I hate, I won't feel the lack of motivation from this character when it comes to choosing Depression Quest's choices as I'm never going to face consequences of actions because of my lack in place of this story.\n\nAll depression quest boils down to is obvious advice on how to treat depression which COULD help but I can see it not working for a lot of people... however I still don't think it shouldn't exist.  This is a game which is incredibly hard to make. You need to write a LOT to convey this character's life, you need to make the player think a lot with some very complex choices, among other things. Hell, as weird as this sounds, maybe give the player really tedious and unskippable things to read or do that will help make the player feel more exhausted. I don't know. Point is, depression quest could be an alright tool, but as it stands it's just not good enough for somebody with depression to have as a help. I'm sorry.\n","August 20, 2014","false","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is an experience. Unfortunately, the experience is more akin to sitting in a DMV waiting line and reading the dictionary at the same time, only even more tedious. First and foremost, the main portion (and by this I mean all of it) is reading and choosing some "action" that leads to... more reading! . Yes! I totally want to read some lame story to pass the time instead of, you know, PLAYING something. This could be forgivable if not for the fact that the story isn't even that good to begin with. And by that, I mean that I enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights more than this story. Wuthering ♥♥♥♥ing Heights was more interesting than this. What really bothered me the most about this was that the choices you were given almost never go through because your "character" is just too full of self-pity to do anything you say. Way to make me feel like I have ANY control whatsoever over a gaming experience.\n\nImagine if an actual game did this. Suppose you're playing some Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and you come across a Blue Tektite. You have some choices here.\n1. Swing your sword\n2. Shoot it with an arrow\n3. Bomb it\n4. Megaton Hammer it into the ground\n\nSo then you choose the best (or most fun) option, but then a text box appears "Link tries to lift the Megaton Hammer to hit the Tektite, but feels his scaly arm skin scratch on the inside of his tunic and is reminded of his moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.* And then Link drops the hammer and leaves without bothering with the Tektite to wallow in self-pity.\nThat's not FUN. That isn't satisfying whatsoever. That's just annoying.\n\nNow, I know that there are some "games" where you choose the best options and if you choose a wrong option, bad things happen... but this is EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU CHOOSE SOMETHING.\n\nAfter about halfway through the game I had a sort of epiphany. The goal of the game isn't to understand how it feels to be depressed...\nWell.. wait yes it is.\nBut by making you depressed.\n\nDepression has a few key symptoms that include:\n\n-Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions.\nDifficulty concentrating: I'm so bored that I can barely finish a paragraph at a time.\n\n-Fatigue and decreased energy.\nEven scrolling down feels like an effort to me.\n\n-Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and/or helplessness.\n"I can't do anything worthwhile in this game so why bother?"\n\n-Feelings of hopelessness, regret and/or pessimism\n"This game is hopeless and it's so boring. I really regret downloading it, even though it was free."\n\nOnly see, in this case it doesn't get better. Sure, there's an ending that is "happy", I guess? Honestly I stopped caring long before I got to the ending so I can't really be invested enough to care about the ending. The point is, the game never gets better. So if you're the protagonist. you never get to enjoy life (the game). The only way to get out is to play through and feel like ♥♥♥♥...\nOr turn the game off (suicide)\n\nI'd tell the creators of this game to try harder next time, but that would require them trying at all in the first place.\nDepression is a serious mental problem. Depression is not a good premise for a game, because depression is not a game. By that token, Depression Quest is not a game. If I wanted to learn about depression, I'd look it up on Wikipedia, not play a "game" about it.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to "commit suicide" and go play an actual game.","August 21, 2014","false","0.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game looks like it was written in Flash by someone unfamiliar with how to create a project in Flash. Seriously, I've seen students who - in their first few weeks of learning how to create Flash projects - had created something far, far better than this.\n\nThe writing and design of this title is simply poor. Choices, when prompted, often don't make any sense, even in the context of psychology (not to mention game design). e.g. if someone doesn't like cats it doesn't mean they're going to get depressed - dog people exist too. This game does nothing for the great cat people/dog people divide in our society - instead of taking the opportunity to mend fences, the author insists that people who don't like cats are depressed loners, longing to slit their wrists.\n\nAs someone who has suffered on and off again with depression my entire life, along with extensive counseling and even some psychology coursework, I went into this game expecting to understand the subject matter better than most. Instead I'm given a series of overly simplified, trite choices created by a team who didn't understand the first step in game design: understand your subject matter. If you're going to make a first person shooter, you need to spend your time looking at other first person shooters, learning what makes them good and bad, then try to create a game that's compromised of more good elements than bad. When you're going to make a game dealing with psychology,.. you damn well better have a firm grasp of psychology. Anyone who was actually depressed would likely end up getting more depressed by "playing" this, thanks to the boorish way the authors deal with their subject.\n\nI recommend in the strongest possible terms that everyone simply avoid this title at all costs, it has no redeeming value whatsoever.","September 22, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

After this, it talks about the following days with hyperlinks on what to do next at the bottom. This is where I have my problem.\nI have depression. Out of all of these 'choices', normally one or two of them are in red and have a strike through them meaning that these are options that you cannot do because your character is simply incapable of doing because of their depression. The other choices? One is the 'right choice' of doing something that brings them out with their friends or to work on their side project, and the other two are normally 'withdraw from social interaction', 'nothing, I don't want to talk about my problems,' or, 'I'm going to go back to sleep.'

I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone, as if you have depression it will make you feel worse, and if you don't it will build upon the stereotypes society already has built up around the illness. If you want to play a thoughtful game about the subject, please go and buy Actual Sunlight. It is much better. Please, if you feel you're suffering from depression, reach out to someone, and if you know someone else who is, encourage them. Don't be like this game.","August 31, 2014","false","0.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It seems the simulator just really wants to drive the point home that depressed people are sad all of the time. Feeling sad isn't called "depression", feeling sad is called "feeling sad" If I didn't have depression, and was told to play this game to learn more about what depressed people deal with day-to-day, I'd spend more time making the depressed person feel worse by asking them if they were "okay" all of the time. What depressed people want are people that understand that a depressed person is depressed, rather than trying to sit them down and lecture them or...try to tell them how they can help. Depressed people are healed by being in an environment where they can forget about their self-loathing for a little while, or by doing something that takes their mind off of it. It doesn't help when someone is at your back asking you how they can help when you show any signs of coming down. The ending to this needs to have an addendum to letting people know that getting someone who is depressed to forget about it for a while is all the help they need to do. Anything else is just pity or unrealistic.","September 5, 2014","false","1.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/125409/recommended/270170/","125409","...","http://steamcommunity.com/id/125409/","69 products in account","It's utter ♥♥♥♥♥.\nIt does not even help in the slightest in learning about depression (Let alone the MULTIPLE FORMS OF IT), and instead uses it to motivate a floppy 2 dimensional story. That's right. It uses depression as the driving force of a story. Not that it can't be done, but this game delivers it in the most awful way possible. The game gives no insight on how the psyche of a depressed person truly works, and utterly shames the issue completely. Developers, you should feel ashamed for this. I feel ashamed for this game, as a player, and as someone who deals with others with depression daily. A simple google search could have given you plenty of insight, but instead you choose the most bland, stereotypical version of depression, and followed that through. Why on Earth would you all think your base knowledge was good enough for such a complex issue?!?! If this game was truly for insight on depression, you all should have spent more time adding in various stories that at least include each form of depression (Chronic, Persistent, Major, Bipolar(Manic), Seasonal Affective Disorder, Psychotic, Postpartum, Premenstrual, Situational, and Atypical. There you go, listed all known forms of depression, go research them and deliver the players a PROPER informational Story on each form of depression with actions backed by research from professionals proven to help against depression. Not just "Take the meds, get motivated" bull ♥♥♥♥.) As a person who deals with this, depressed people can lie to others, can manipulate cunningly well to hide a more sinister side to their depression, which can ultimately cause themselves Fatal injuries. Some depressed individuals, if not all, plan out their deaths to prevent any intervention. This game shames all of those people. This game shames the issue. This game is shameful, and any news site or what have you that tells you that it is accurate to the psyche of a depressed individual clearly need to research their ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAlright, now the game is nothing special. It's a shoddily, quickly done Visual Story (If that can even be justified), with a looping audio of a "Piano playing a minor key for emphasis on the mood which makes the game cheesy and irritating to listen to". Not to say the piece is bad, but when it loops it becomes grating on the ears quickly. Devs, add in different audio tracks, options for said audio, and the like to suit the mood of the story. When things go well, make the melancholy music fade somewhat or become slightly more cheerful. When there are dips in the story, make the audio change accordingly. The audio, as it is, is half-♥♥♥♥♥ and lazy. I can play any D-minor improv and get the same effect as this audio. Improve the game's audio, and story, those are it's fronts and they are both LACKING. Obviously the game was designed to play on people's heart-strings and suck out as much cash as possible. So make it do that, because right now, you all are FAILING MISERABLY AT DOING THAT. You are failing as a team to deliver a sensational, informational, honest story that could be BEAUTIFUL. It has the premise of a good Story, so make it good. If you need help with that, read EDGAR ALLEN POE a few times, Read notes from depressed individuals, spend TIME with depressed individuals. Learn about the people, then their psyche, and then deliver the steam player base a sensational story.\n\nFix it, or rebuild the game completely, but don't leave it as a decaying piece of ♥♥♥♥ it is now. If you all fix it, I garauntee a lot of negative reviews that are relevant will turn positive, and you all might not have such a bad track record later on.\n\nIf you, the individual thinking about this game, truly want to learn about depression, don't waste your time on this piece of garbage, and instead look it up online and learn from professionals who deal with it daily. This Free game isn't even a game, nor is it even informational on the situation it tries to convey and talk about. You could spend your time better by having a burger and fries at Five Guys.","July 22, 2015","false","0.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

The writing is average, with thankfully few-no mistakes (the texts are humorously mispelled at times).  The red text options are unfortunately a slight against the game I have when there are 3-4 good options and it only lets you select one.

There are, however, a few very good points that perfectly outline what and how deppression is, but only if you are able to analyze the game without your own bias. The author tried to use situations and telling (instead of showing) how the character feels to try and manipulate the player into understanding deppression, yet she *completely* missed the point. If she truly wanted to make people understand deppression she would've used the mentioning and not mentioning of in game concepts to manipulate the player into looking at a 90/10 world of happiness/sadness and making the player only look at the sad. That would be a true work of art, unfortunately this is just angsty-projection with big words thrown in to sound smart and tell instead of show.\n\n\n2/10 Is harmful to the understanding of how deppressed people's mindset and feelings.

Besides occasional lines of dialog how I am horrible because depression and someone cannot take it any more and suddenly we're up to something else? What borderlines irony is the foreword of the game is perhaps the most enjoyable part of the game, since it feels like the developers knew their onions; they laud and dazzle how it focuses on depression... by simply telling what it is. You have depression. Everything is great but you just have depression and then things falls apart and end of story - or not quite but more like sort of but not kind of. Boo said the ghost of hung criminal at the gallows.\n\nUnless there is some new, booming market for choose-your-own-depression books, since choose-your-own adventure books usually operate on different matters at hand.\n\nIf the game simply gave basic framework for interactivity to properly explore, shallowly telling what is going on with no further investment is not bad idea. That is assuming there is more interactivity besides click for another skip of text that makes me want to read an actual book. I do not shun the idea of interactive media branching beyond common "ideas" for video games, but I hesitate to call Depression Quest even an unfinished novella, or early prototype for a visual novel. It is a game which throws plenty of text with less substance than Harlequin novels, offending ambiguity not to offend anyone with anything vaguely related to English gender pronouns, and no personal viewport to depression... which the foreword already said is very subjective. I am here to read a story for the novelty of reading a story about depression that pretends to be a video game: People are referred as human beings as ambugiuosly as possible all the bleeping time with less character than mouldy piece of paper, and once again, I am supposed to be looking through viewport to one manifestation of depression. Yay.\n\n(If semantics are that important, can we please have it written in language with no gender-specific pronouns - aside from inconvenience of less potential readers? Too hardcore? Why not ask the reader's gender? Still too specific or offending? Why not just offer option to type it down then and have pronouns adjusted accordingly for pity's sake?)\n\nRhetorically, it is the only part where the game feels like there was actual effort to convey idea of depression with extremely nonexistent and empty presentation of everything. Unfortunately that still leaves me, as a reader, unconvinced as lame horse merchant given the pronounced lack of subjectivity in something which is supposed to be pretty subjective experience. Warsaw in Poland, cows moo, dogs bark, depression is unfortunate experience etc etc. Such lovely and profound words of wisdom and insight! Truly we are dealing here with a masterpiece! Broken record! Round two! Fight!\n\nOh, and the absolute best\worst part of is lack of even hinting at suicide or you know, actual drama between people besides few lines of dialog. My depression nearly culminated to eaten shotgun and several burned bridges; some which remain burned to this day. What does the game tell you to offer anything remote to this kind of drama? Few lines of dialog and leave imagination do the rest, which could be fair with deeper substance. Once again, the game outright assumes player has absolutely no idea what depression is about, which is subjective but the narrative is less compelling than reading kindergarteners' stories. Where is subjectivity? Has the writer(s) ever heard of show, don't tell? Here it's tell, also choose your own silly options which leads to even more telling what depression is about in daily life.\n\nDepression Quest could be passable, even perhaps curious and interesting piece of work if it did not too hard to be an "art" game. Art game with novelty of being about depression to educate the foolish, ignorant savages how depression may manifest by presenting ideal scenario torn down by boringly dramatic events presented as grippingly as reading the latest football or hockey match results from news, only exception being at least the match scoreboard can offer me useful insight to what happened. Same cannot be said of Depression Quest, no matter how noble or unfortunate its beginning may have been.\n\n(Edit as of September 2nd: fixed some Engrish.)","August 31, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The narrative is cohesive, if restrictive, and progresses naturally. This is, however, where the title's merits both begin and end. The graphics, which are mostly nonexistent, consist of a few pictures strewn across the top of the page that sometimes relate to the topic at hand. Depression Quest is at its core a text-based adventure, however in 2014 we should expect a little more out of rudimentary game design.\nThe gameplay is typical of Choose Your Own Adventure novels (and would perhaps be a better classification than video game), and while it lacks any kind of flair, your choices are made precise and clear. They are, however, limited in scope, which is Depression Quest's major downfall. Your choices in each scenario basically boil down to "Let me wallow deeper into depression," or "Let me try to climb out of this pit of depression," and with no inventory to speak of and a very limited status indicator ("You are depressed." "You are kind of depressed." "You are severely depressed."), you not only very quickly learn how to game the system, but that your choices have no real effect on the actual outcome of the title.\nNo matter how you choose to play, events play out in the same fashion, with key moments happening regardless of if you try to avoid them, albeit with very slight alterations. Again, this might be acceptable if the title had further redeeming qualities, but as a text adventure, you expect a higher level of interaction with the world.\nThe music is effective, if a little drab, but that's exactly what the developers were looking for, and I'm unable to find issue with their choice of song. It's said that the music changes based on how you play the game, but I found this effect muted at best, and really had to listen for the changes.\n\nAll things considered, again, calling Depression Quest a video game is at best dishonest and at worst insulting to the medium. As a Choose Your Own Adventure Novel, Depression Quest is a coherently written story that perhaps misses the mark - you're left wondering if this game is about a depressed person or just a chronically lazy narcoleptic - but as a title available on Steam, where users are searching for video games, I cannot recommend it.","August 20, 2014","false","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dusty_thoreau/recommended/270170/","dusty_thoreau","dusty_thoreau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dusty_thoreau/","194 products in account","Interactive Fiction was one of the first genres of videogames that I ever got seriously into. The reasons why are mainly by accident: I was a pre-teen looking for fun things play online that had a little more depth than crappy flash games. A google search landed me on an Infocom database site, and learning how to use WinFrotz, I entered the magical world of text based, parser command games. Zork, Andrew Plotkin, Emily Short, Chickzilla, Slouching Towards Bedlam, Aaron A. Reed (Blue Lacuna), Taco Fiction. These games and authors of games shaped what I know, love, and enjoy from the genre.\n\nPlaying Depression Quest was difficult for me. The reason being because it does so many things that turn Interactive Fiction players like me off. One of the biggest mistakes was doing the age old WOT, or Wall of Text mistake. The game likes to open, and continue, to barrage you with walls of text, and this makes for terrible flow in IF games. No one wants to sit and read a wall of text every time they make a decision. It's a typical amateur IF game mistake that I'm surprised has been allowed in a game published on Steam. The second biggest issue with this game is the lack of choice. I get that part of the reason that half of the choices are crossed out and unusuable are because they are the "rational" or "good" choices that a person who does not suffer depression would typically choose. But that's not a good excuse for crappy design, because I am no longer playing the game: the game is instead playing itself. The only feeling of "helplessness" that Depression Quest seems to evoke is that of surrendering all choice to the game. Which is another amateur IF mistake.\n\nAnd yes, I get it, that is the point of Depression Quest. To take away your choice because when you suffer from depression you don't have one. But that's where the word "game" comes into question here: is Depression Quest a game? The reason I know it is not, is simple.\n\nIt says so right in the WoT introduction: "This game is not meant to be a fun or lighthearted experience." It's not meant to be fun. So of course how can it be a game? Nor is it a CYOA (choose your own adventure), because despite the feature of choice, the choices ultimately effect literally nothing, and are always extremely similar to one another.\n\nSo why is it on Steam? Well I guess it's in an effort to raise awareness that Depression is a real problem. So is it a good education tool? I don't really think so; it doesn't do it's job as well as it should. There were games that made me feel like the person I was playing easily, not from experience, but from sheer authorship alone, and the way it was designed. That was Blue Lacuna, and when I look at this game, Blue Lacuna, in terms of trying to get the player to understand how something feels, makes Depression Quest look kind of...lazy...in terms of what it tried to do in order to simulate an experience. Blue Lacuna, unlike Depression Quest, didn't "tell me how I felt" constantly, it evoked that feeling by building the feeling around me. I felt it. And like Depression Quest, it had the same outcome: an insurmountable dread that you cannot escape, no matter how much I clung to the time, place, and people I was living with. It came and it took me regardless, no matter what I felt, or what I did.\n\ntl;dr:While Depression Quest may bring depression awareness to Steam, that's about as far as it goes. Honeslty I don't think this should have been made a game. Using words is a very hard way to convey a feeling. And other than that, there's a difference between making a game with an agenda, and making a game with an agenda done well.","August 23, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

"Depression Quest" is not only boring and poorly written, it's portrayal of depression is off-base in a number of ways. If you choose the "right" option early on (like the third page or so), everything goes swimmingly for "you," and you suffer basically no symptoms of depression. You have a loving and wonderful support system of family, friends, and even a girlfriend. Everyone in the story's universe seems to understand depression (aside from your kind of ♥♥♥♥♥y mom), and you face no obsticles in your pursuit for therapy and drugs beyond yourself. The main character is an overprivelaged ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who does the bare minimum to cope with his depression, and feels, at worst, "a bit worn out" by his attempts to carry on a somewhat normal existance. In reality, depression ravages you, and it changes it types of decisions you would make. It does not instantly turn you into a whiny litle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Depression ignites a myriad of different reactions, but the character in this story lays down and waits to die. When I myself went through depression, I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I had to bury my feelings and keep trudging onwards. For the most part, extreme apathy seems to be consistent, but never really arises in this game. If anything, "you" care TOO much: Depression Quest's character is "worried his girlfriend doesn't really like him that much," even though she is entirely supportive (unless you agressively whine at her and accuse her of not caring) and doesn't even get frustrated with you when you wake her up. Depression Quest treats depression as something easy to get out of if you get your thumb out of your bum for just long enough to get into therapy. It also treats drugs as a cure-all with little to no side-effects and an impossibility of increasing your overall distress. How accurate.

Not even as an avid adventure gamer could I find enjoyment out of this.\n\nI suffer from depression and almost a year ago I ended up in the hospital due to it, but this experience, and i use that term lightly, was not something I could relate to.\n\nThe thing about depression, and it's associated pain is that it's individualized, no one will know what it is like to be in your shoes, and a video game about your experience won't help anyone come to any realizations.\n\nThis doesn't show what depression is like, nothing can and since everyone experiences it differently, I suggest you pick up a psychology book if you really want to understand depression.\n\nThere isn't much here of substance, it's all very arbitrary and lacking. It looks like a 5 year old designed it and athestically it looks like it was made with windows 95 in mind.\n\nIronically, the game made me more depressed than I already was, but depressed in a different way... depressed that this made it through greenlight. This doesn't belong here. It's not a game.\n\nThe entire time I was playing it, I was pigeon holed into making choices I didn't want to make, and as a person with depression many of the choices that were blocked for me were choices that I would make. I felt a strong sense of a victim mentality from the "author".\n\nJust like anyone with depression - We are but a victim of our own minds. She is a victim, but her own victim, and it doesn't sound like she has enough of a grasp on depression to be trying to educate others on it. Having depression doesn't make you a good teacher on the subject.\n\nThere isn't much to be had here, it's basically a choose your own adventure book, except you can't really make your own choices. Only the choices of the author. Which is the point, I get it - but it is poorly done.\n\nThumbs down.","September 22, 2014","false","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I don't mean because there's no graphics, swordplay, puzzles, platforming, etc, etc, I still play zork on dosbox. I say that because it's more of a story of someone ELSE'S battle with depression, which is a serious problem I won't make fun of. You aren't given options that you'd take, you're forced into the same pattern of spiraling depression everytime which kind of gives the impression that it's hopeless, as if it didn't already feel like that. I've battled depression since my father died when I was 11, dealt with it still when I was 15 and my grandfather passed away from cancer, then at 19 when I was diagnosed with cancer, then for the next 14 months as I watched two close friends lose their fight with cancer. I know depression, my depression, but that doesn't mean I can tell anyone else what it's like or how to deal with it. My way was to open up to my friends and family (Drake, Mar, Crim, if you guys read this know you've probably saved me a couple of times when I was in a down mood just by bringing in some normalcy and letting me know there are people that care) but I know that's not an option for a lot of people. It was actually impossible for me to come out and talk to my mom about it, I had to write a note on the computer and leave it there for her to find.

It's like as if they have picked at my brain and took my life apart but added extra things to it to spice it up a bit, like parents that care or a job that I can sustain but I hate?\n\nI've only been through a bit of the game and it has turned out okay. To be honest, even though it's a text based adventure, it feels like there is just TOO much text. It branches off important subjects that you don't know properly, like your relationship with your girlfriend Alex, your parents, your job, your brother that you're jealous of, etc. when it feels like it shouldn't really be describing each important subject with such detail. They should have just added minor explanations of certain things to help you become acquainted with the character that you are portraying, rather than create entirely new stories out of them that make it hard to catch up with and remember.\n\nThe idea of depression being different for everyone is both true and false, and they do have that kinda knotted down properly in the beginning of the game with an explanation, but I don't think they should say to stop playing it immediately if you are suicidal or anything close simply because it's a falsity of something relevant to you.\n\nI like the idea of the game to help explain to people not suffering from depression what it's like, but it just doesn't fit well. It says that it's not an explanation or detail of depression because it varies between people, but it nails it down to just one type of depression, contradicting itself in the process of the entire game.","October 1, 2014","false","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It, somehow, in its simplistic yet bafflingly bombastic language manages to successfully light a window into what depression, an illness that is very much so personal and very obviously able to be extended to everyone in generic terms in a generic setting.\n\nThe generalizations of this game made me look out for the warning signs of depression: sitting at home watching Netflix, having a job you don't like, having an older brother that is more successful than you, having a mom that criticizes you. I'm glad we have this game to depict an average person with depression, since we know that depressed people are only those in a rut, who are always visibly upset when in social situations. Depression is definitely something that is outwardly shown constantly like a giant neon sign saying "This ♥♥♥♥nut is depressed as ♥♥♥♥, guys", instead of the invisible force of unrelenting dread that people are constantly at odds to ignore while nonetheless functioning throughout the day.\n\nOverall, I feel the message of the game is lost because depression is a very personal ailment for people that, by nature, can not be generalized. In its very personal nature, you cannot delve into depression with a John Everyman with a generic life in which you are simply told that you are a depressed. The purpose of the game is to try and create empathy towards those with depression by creating a generic character simulator in which no empathy is compelled to be given. The fact that the game is described as "hing[ing] on its deeply personal writing style" by an actual human being and not a ♥♥♥♥ing Vulcan or something is quite shocking. People that come to understand depression by playing this game are worse than the people that come to understand any other ailment by googling it then skimming through the wikipedia article about it.\n\nAnd last but not least, let's address the fact that this game is not actually a game at all. Greenlight is getting a lot of non-games pushed through it ranging from a moderately pornographic visual novel to now a completely non-visual interactive novel. It's not even advertised as being "fun", it's meant to be a game that is insightful.\n\nAlso In-N-Out is better than Five Guys by far.","August 24, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

The main character is described as sparingly as possible early on, to make him/her a blank slate for the player to put themselves in his/her shoes. And then the writers screwed that up by giving the main character a family and girlfriend, which requires him/her to be a definite person seperate from player.

Overall it is very poorly written with numerous spelling and punctuation mistakes. The story is very dull and to be frank quite contrived. Each section has multiple options where the majority of the time you can not select a number of them which completely ruins your immersion in the story, for example at one point there are 6 options available but you are only allowed to click 1. This turns this multiroute “game” into a fairly linear story. Most of the remaining options are either ridiculous or completely unrealistic. I don’t know how many times the main protagonist is with his girlfriend and you are not given the option to discuss things with her honestly up until the end of the game where the character is already well on his way to recovery. On top of all this the game doesn’t even achieve that which it sets out to do. It in no way displays what life is like if you are living with depression. Instead all it does is turns depression into a type of gameshow and if you choose the right option you get a reward (in this case you start to get better). It fails to show just how grim the world can appear to be when you suffer from the illness. All it really shows is a very self absorbed person (the protagonist) as he goes through his life only focusing on himself and not taking other peoples feelings into consideration (example being his time spent with his girlfriend). Maybe it would have come across differently if it was written by a better author, but that is not the case and as it stands it is miles short of completing it’s goal. But I will give credit where credit is due, this is the first game to make me hate the main protagonist more than “Spec Ops: The Line” managed to do.","August 29, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

While it has been getting better, I can entirely say this experience was complete and utter garbage.\n\nHow it handles something as permeating as depression is shameful at best and downright ham-handed at worst, shoehorning in options some people take, but then crossing them out in what I can only assume is their way of saying people who are really depressed don't make them. Some victims don't just shut themselves in, and this story seems to be saying that all of them do. In addition, depression is usually a slow fadeout. It doesn't just ♥♥♥♥ing appear in less than a day, and getting rid of it can take months at best, years at worst.\n\nThen, the ending which claims it is a constant battle is an absolute slap in the face. We've been so hilariously unrealistic so far, why didn't you go that final ♥♥♥♥ing mile and make our protagonist suddenly all better, ready to face the world with his arsenal of rainicorns and unibows? Did you waste it on your "Watch Netflix and cry" scenes?\n\nI could say so much about this game, about how badly it does what it set out to do, how I completely loathe the developer and the scandal parade behind her, but I'll just stop at this:\n\nThis is not depression.

The writing was also kind of meh, just seemed very stale and boring, lost interest around the third page. I also could not become immersed or interested in the story at all, I was not able to put myself in the shoes of the character basically because the whole gender neutral tone gave me no information about the character, and what information I did get felt like it was being shoved down my throat from the beginning and I was not left to discover the information throughout the story, it made it seem like the character was more of a robot than a person the fact that I have to describe the character as him/her or "the character" illustrates this point.\n\nSomething’s that could be done to improve the game:\n1) Try to make it easier for the play to become immersed, a short questionnaire that would ask the age, gender, and sexual orientation of the player that would change the story slightly to fit this information and help the reader step into the shoes of the character. I was basically taken out of the story from the very beginning by how hard the game tried to be gender neutral with the whole "you are a human being, you have a significant other" thing. Also no one describes them self as a "mid-twenties human being and this information is irreverent anyways, we know the character is a human being and there would be better ways to find out the age of the character than this.\n\n2) You need better writing period, this game is heavily dependent on reading and yet the story is poorly written and robotic. Instead of telling us who the character is right off the bat, let us discover the character, develop him/her over time instead of having him/her fully formed straight from the beginning. Show us his/her experiences instead of telling us "you lack motivation, you lose sleep over this" show us how the character has lost his/her motivation, show us how him/her is up all night wondering why he/she can't seem to get his/her life on track.\n\nTD;DR:\nGet better writers who can write a decent story, get rid of gender neutrality, and make the game more interactive.\n","August 20, 2014","false","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mallachin/recommended/270170/","mallachin","mallachin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mallachin/","152 products in account","Thought I would review this game to get an alternate opinion of it.\n\nDepression Quest is an interactive fiction game and not a modern one. It is in the vein of early computer games that were entirely text-based and derived from narratives. I think that is one of the reasons reviews are mixed on it. It doesn't fit the mold of what a "modern" computer game is. Us old fart garmers will remember this type of gaming experience with fondness.\n\nThat being said, I can really only reccommend  the game for people who want to experience or learn about clinical depression or people who want to deal with their clinical depression in a positive way.\n\nIt is ingenious in its audacity and for tackling an often overlooked mental disease. It is innovative for its attempt to recreate the experience of a disease at a very realistic level. All the little things are there, such as the thought among many depressives that they don't actually have a disease when they are able to deal with it effectively (yes, that is a real thing) or excusing your tiredness for simply being tired, instead of the effects of a disease. Effects on concentration, focus, seeking diversion (as a result of the disease, not as a way to find enjoyment as it is with many people), social anxiety, interpersonal relationships, and others are all modeled. It takes the form of a choose-your-own-adventure (as interactive fiction generally is) and so there is some replay value to it. I personally played it several times and, since I don't know how the different paths of the game are determined, it's actually kind of fun (yes, in that ruminating depressive sort of way!) to tease out how the choices are rendered.\n\nThis is a game that does not have a wide appeal and is a very niche product. It is a game that has a therapeutic effect for suffers and/or is a way for the curious to "play" with the disease and challenge some preconceptions of yours or your preconceptions of those who suffer from the disease. If you are even remotely interested or intrigued, I'd suggest it because it is free. Just realize that the "fun" of the game is derived from  learning about something, not derived from entertainment.","December 14, 2014","true","2.1"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","17","31","4","0"

After looking at masterpieces on the steam store such as Anime tank dating sim, Gabe Newell simulator, Shower with your dad simulator, and other works of pure art we stumbled across this game. Which I placed on my wishlist right next to Shower with your dad simulator. I then forgot about it for the rest of the day until around 11 that night. I was up doing who gives a ♥♥♥♥, when for some reason I had a craving.\n\nLike you that craving you have when you want to play or watch something dark, or funny, or warm hearted, or whatever. Well I was craving something depressing. Something to kill my spirits and make me sit in the corner of my dark room thinking of how insignificant everything is in the grand scheme of things. And with that I reminded of Depression Quest. I wasn't expecting anything crazy, just something to make me feel weak and tired emotional, to help me sleep.\n\nSo I booted it up and pressed play, and the first thing I noticed was that the game had the names of the people who worked on the game on the left side of the screen, and there was one name that caught my eye, Zoe Quinn. I thought the name was familier so I decideed to do a quick google search. My reaction was "OH FOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE!" Turns out my pal Zoe here was essentially the trigger that fired the bullet known as "Gamer Gate". Her whole scandel flooded my search feed. I exitted out and went to Depression Quest, fully aware of the amount of triggers my fingers were now gently resting on, and that I may accidently pull one, and send a Tumblr rage post bullet ripping straight threw my skull. But I pressed on anyway.\n\nThe game was mostly read this and choose how you would react in this situation. All the ions that a normnal person would choose were present, but crossed off preventing you from choosing them, leaving only the depressing, bad answers, which made sense.\n\nI as played through I would react in 3 different ways: The first would be I would simply laugh, the second would be I'd say out loud "grow a pair ♥♥♥♥♥", and the third was I'd choose the reaction that I would actually choose in that situation, even if the crossed out anwsers were available. At points I also felt the same way the main protagonist felt about some things, not all buit some.\n\nNow, does this mean I'm clinically depressed? I mean, I guess not I don't know. I would say I dobn't cut myself so no, but one night out of sheer boredom I did the "Eraser Challenge" For those of you who don't know, it's when you rub an eraser on your skin and see how long you can last. Now I went full on balls deep nut up or shut up do it you little ♥♥♥♥♥ how else can you call youself a man. I grabbed the tie I wear to school (Catholic school :/) and tied it around my arm hoping in some way ease the pain (why I thought it would help in anyway, shape, or form is a mystery) I bet down on my tie and clenched my left hand into a fist and began erasing my skin away. If my parents were to walk in it would've looked like I was getting my daily fix of Heroin. I decided I would do it for however long the next song on my shuffle playlist would be. The song was 7 minutes long, and I powered through all 7 minutes.\n\nWhen I was finished, they eraser left a burn scar that looked like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The burn left I scar that still exists on my arm today, even though it has faded. Now what was the purpose of me typing that is beyond me. And why I also thought it was a good idea in the first place is also up in the air. So what am I getting at I don't know, I'm simply killing time for this update.\n\nLong story short this game did deliver on bumming me out, which was good I guess? I felt the ending was a cop-out however. I mean the whole "This game doen't have an end because there is no true resolution to depression" just felt cheesy to me. I would've rather had an ending where you break out of depression, or make your way to the other side. Well whatever. If you bothered to read this whole thing you really need to get a hobby, bu if your also waiting for  update like me, then write a reply to kill time.\n\nI wish I could give this game a neutral rating cause that's how i fell, but I guess a thumbs down is needed in honor of Infinite Warefare reaching 2 million dislikes XD\n","May 14","false","1.0"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","17","31","9","1"

I feel it can be a hard read mostly due to the length. I don't think a lot of people can really relate with it since they will be in varying situations. I would have prefered if the game featured more than one music track since looping one can get kind of irratating. As a tool to teach others about depression I don't know how effective it would be and it feels more like a depression questionnaire that you would take on a site then a game.\n\nAs someone who was diagnosed with depression I could relate to parts but I feel a few things should be mentioned. Antidepressants are not always the best solution, in my experience I kept having to switch between meds to find which worked best since some cause really bad nausea, insomnia, and mood swings. I can't speak much on therapy since I only went in for a few sessions and would constantly put off or forget my sessions. And for those that don't have people in their lives to talk to it is worth noting that you can find support groups that you can talk to. I always found it easier to talk to people I didn't know about my issues since I felt less worried about being judged.\n\nOverall I think if you have depression you would understand some of the choices you are presented with but if you are trying to understand someone else's depression it might be a bit harder. I liked that some options were crossed out but I feel an explaination on why you aren't up to that choice would be better suited. The game was kind of long winded and I feel that it could have been said with fewer words and would still have surmised the point it was aiming at.","August 27, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

WALL OF TEXT INBOUND. GAIN +5 DEPRESSION POINTS*\n\nWhere to begin this review? My first impressions of Depression Quest were on its official site with a myrid of glitches in the hyperlinks. Thoughts "Oh, well it was an indie project trying to raise awareness for depression and taking donations to give to iFred and the Suicide Prevention Hotline." This soon faded from memory as a lackluster indie game with a good cause. Now recently seeing this game released on the free to play raised a little curiosity. Did they expand on the story of the game? Have those glitches in the website version been fixed? Disregarding reviews I downloaded the game today and played through ten to 15 minutes. First thought is that this all seems familiar. Same red lines blocking choices, same exact description, same hyperlinks, same everything. But wait, there is artsy piano music now to make it sad as you read. "Ok, so they haven't expanded the story or improved the look of the game". Next are the glitches encountered, for example crashing the application twice in a single playthrough. Finally getting through to an epilogue another realization kicks in that this is the exact same version of the game I played before it was released on steam. Nothing changed, nothing fixed, nothing brushed up. I'll rate here to avoid having people read a wall of text. 3/10. Onward to elaboration\n\nPlot: You play as 20 year old Michael McNoCharacterization. You have a decent job, loving family, loving girlfriend, good little social circle but you also have depression. A lack of motivation, disillusionment, and general angst ensue. The plot will railroad you, and railroad you hard, further into depression, more actions will be cut off from selection to simulate depression getting worse. The plot falls flat due to this in my honest opinion. Instead of giving us a reason to sympathise it gives us invisible -5s to happiness time an option is chosen.\n\nMechanics: Simple pick option A get outcome A, pick option B get outcome B, with the occasional Pick Option A crash game.\n\nSoundtrack: Royalty free piano music to make things sad. Emotional manipulation at its finest.\n\nFourth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t listing: I hate ending on threes so here is a fourth detail, cannot pick this option.

I was bored with it when it was a browser game I clicked through once, and I'm still immensely bored with it, and surprised it got onto steam greenlight with how little of a game it was. I'm willing to bet people only threw in their vote because they felt they had to because of the creator's supposed "attacks because female" and will forget about it just as soon as I did.\n\nSave yourself the download and play it in a browser.","August 20, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No contoversy, no rant about being text only, just a review"\n\nBottom line, Depression Quest is a game about immersing you, the player, into the protagonist's shoes, trying to fight depression with little hope.\n\nIt starts off telling you that this isn't ment to be played as a game, but as an actual way to help you sink into someones life that is suffering from depression. It does a good job of doing that.\n\nThe game's strong point is being text based. This may sound weird, but when the games says you are feeling hopeless or sad, I remembered when was the last time I felt hopeless or sad, and then I reflected what I tend to do feeling these emotions. Instead of showing what happened to you (with an animation, or a cutscene) the game lets you use your imagination! (To an extent.) This is how gaming was some time ago, in "the dark ages", like Zork!\n\nThe characters are good as well. Ranging from your family, your loved one, and even a freind online. This game covers most friends that we have! The dialogue is good (at times), and it shows different personalities to each character, not some copy and paste/repeat characters.\n\nAnother strong point is the sound, it's a repeating piano melody. However, sometimes you can hear some other noices reflecting to what the character your controlling is hearing, like noices from a party, or mellow talking when the character is in a therapy session. It's a small touch, but cool.\n\nNow some problems with the game:\n-No save feature. Like come on, I had to do something between a play session, and all my progress was lost! What a bummer!\n\n-The "Mood Meters". These meters found in the bottom of the screen tells you how depressed you are, how you feel on regards to therapy, and how you feel in regards to taking medication. This is okay, but it gave me dead giveaways to how the character felt. It would have been better if these wern't there so I needed to debunk on how the character is feeling. The main purpose that I got this game is was to find out what is wrong with the character, that's not the case in this game.\n\n-Ending. Now the ending, at first enraged me. However, when I read the epelogue, it made sense to me. However, I sort of wanted it to wrap up better than how it did.\n\n-Length. The game is shoooort. Even if you read every backstory in the beginning and you read eveything, you will see the ending in 30 minutes flat. Same with the ending. I wanted the story to go further, and to see the character change as time goes on. The game sort of stopped dead in it's tracks and says "The character is feeling better now". It kinda ruined the experince for me there.\n\nOverall, this game isn't ment to be played as a game, it's rather a simulation.\nI cannot recommend this game to everyone, becasue again it isn't a game, but I will say it's worth checking out. Hell, it's free to play. The only thing your spending is 30 minutes of your time.\n5/10","August 20, 2014","false","3.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I thught that changing the shemical compisition of my brain wasn't the route to choose since I was on the path to recovery. Then things started to fall apart. My life with my girlfriend got more stressed. My family was appreantly being to nosy and my online friend didnt want to talk to anymore. Now I know that if you really want to be a better person you have to shovel medication that society says you need in order to be normal and that Zoe Quinn or whoever made this depressing game, depressing not because of the concept but depressing because man is so weak that he has to force himself to be not depressed and if he doesn't force feed himself medication in order to be normal then he should just die because thats not how you should go about it. Also the game is sexist because I wanted to play a depressed girl but I never got the option, replaying to see if I can force my character to kill himself like society wants him to.\nEdit: The game doesn't allow you to kill yourself.

WALL OF TEXT INBOUND. GAIN +5 DEPRESSION POINTS*\n\nWhere to begin this review? My first impressions of Depression Quest were on its official site with a myrid of glitches in the hyperlinks. Thoughts "Oh, well it was an indie project trying to raise awareness for depression and taking donations to give to iFred and the Suicide Prevention Hotline." This soon faded from memory as a lackluster indie game with a good cause. Now recently seeing this game released on the free to play raised a little curiosity. Did they expand on the story of the game? Have those glitches in the website version been fixed? Disregarding reviews I downloaded the game today and played through ten to 15 minutes. First thought is that this all seems familiar. Same red lines blocking choices, same exact description, same hyperlinks, same everything. But wait, there is artsy piano music now to make it sad as you read. "Ok, so they haven't expanded the story or improved the look of the game". Next are the glitches encountered, for example crashing the application twice in a single playthrough. Finally getting through to an epilogue another realization kicks in that this is the exact same version of the game I played before it was released on steam. Nothing changed, nothing fixed, nothing brushed up. I'll rate here to avoid having people read a wall of text. 3/10. Onward to elaboration\n\nPlot: You play as 20 year old Michael McNoCharacterization. You have a decent job, loving family, loving girlfriend, good little social circle but you also have depression. A lack of motivation, disillusionment, and general angst ensue. The plot will railroad you, and railroad you hard, further into depression, more actions will be cut off from selection to simulate depression getting worse. The plot falls flat due to this in my honest opinion. Instead of giving us a reason to sympathise it gives us invisible -5s to happiness time an option is chosen.\n\nMechanics: Simple pick option A get outcome A, pick option B get outcome B, with the occasional Pick Option A crash game.\n\nSoundtrack: Royalty free piano music to make things sad. Emotional manipulation at its finest.\n\nFourth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t listing: I hate ending on threes so here is a fourth detail, cannot pick this option.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fagtimus0Cockatron/recommended/270170/","Fagtimus0Cockatron","max degeneracy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fagtimus0Cockatron/","88 products in account","This game sucks, for multiple reasons.\n\n1.It's too easy. Battling depression is no where near this easy in real life. Literally almost every choice you can ever choose from is "Stay inside/be a lonely loser/don't socialize/don't be happy" or "Go outside/talk to people/do something that makes you happy" This game does not properly portray just how difficult it is to be motivated or do things that will improve your life while depressed.\n\n2.It's too short. Over the course of half and hour and one minute I was able to beat the game twice, hell, look at the play times of the other reviewers. The game is just too short. Depression is a serious, usually life long thing, something that can't be conveyed in a game that's not even half an hour long. And no, just because the epilogue says depression lasts a long time and the game takes place over a long time does not make the fact that it's too short okay. A game such as this show what depression is like in an immersive and realistic way that draws people in, which leads to my next point...\n\n3.The game isn't fun. It has no real gameplay. Yes I know depression isn't fun but games are supposed to be played. Playing involves fun. The fact that the game says it's supposed to be something other than fun does not matter. Just because a videogame has a real meaning doesn't mean it shouldn't have real gameplay or be fun. A good game developer would use the gameplay to convey the message! A good game developer doesn't shy away from gameplay just because it doesn't fit the story or the meaning of the game. No, a good game developer would make the gameplay suit the message, they would make the gameplay PART OF THE STORY, they would use the gameplay artistically to draw in the masses and illustrate the message they want to get across. Show not tell! That's the way a good story is written! This game doesn't show me a damned thing about depression, it just tells me a sob story that can easily be made happy by choosing the "Do happy thing" option whenever prompted.\n\nI give this game a 3/10. I can see what they were going for, but they poorly conveyed the message they wanted to convey, and removing the cornerstone of a certain type of media is never okay, even if you have a poorly thought out excuse for it.","August 22, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And despite my feelings about infidelities, corruption of journalism, and the pack mentality of Indie Game developers, I will try to keep it out of this review.\n\nSomething I would not like to keep out of this review is my personal history with depression. I suffered for a few years, and at my worst was contemplating suicide. Seeing how this is a game about depression, I hope these experiences of mine can help with shedding light on this game.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this game is its presentation. Though I have own a tumblr blog, I do not regularly browse tumblr or other blogging sites. However, if I did, I’m sure I’d find a striking similarity between the menus and greyed-out gifs at the tops of pages with their counterparts in tumblr blogs. I realize that this is a text-based adventure game, but for a Greenlit game I was expecting a game with more body to it. I felt like I was reading an article on the Internet, let alone engaging in a game, I wasn’t immersed.\n\nBut maybe that’s because when I was immersed I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at depression’s representation. The main character, in my first play through, goes through a downward spiral after his depression begins to take the better of him. The game represents this through staticy music and all color fading away. Granted, depression varies between individuals, and I’m sure others suffering from depression experience feelings of hopelessness and fatigue. But depression isn’t an easy thing to make a game out of without disrespecting it.\n\nI’m competitive by nature. When I sit down and play Dark Souls or Team Fortress 2, I play to win. When I lose, I take it as a learning experience, and correct my strategy. It’s something I learned in my battle with depression. I fought, and didn’t let the common inconveniences that once disabled me slow me down further. This attitude proved useless in Depression quest, as even when I had all the chances in the world to fix my character’s problems, the game wouldn’t let me. The game wouldn’t let me do what I did in my victory over depression. It didn’t give me a chance.\n\nI realize that many people wither under depression’s burdens without a chance of saving themselves. But a game is no place to toy with a problem that hurts millions. Depression Quest shouldn’t be played because of how it taunts a player with a chance of healing, only to cross-out the option to go to someone and get help.\n\nA player can do a lot of amazing feats. They can save princesses, build worlds, and dominate the competition in their quests. But this is one quest that I recommend no player attempt. As a player, I was disappointed when my attitude to heal my character was worthless when the doors were already closed from the beginning. And as someone who suffered from depression, I was utterly disgusted with how a developer toys with a serious problem. Say what you will about gaming being a medium for art or a message, but this is one game that I feel is just worthless. Worthless to Indie Games, worthless to Steam, and worthless to the gaming world. Do not play this game.\n","August 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"How did this get on steam?" I mean sure, visual novels are on steam as well, but at least those have art and actual soundtracks. Sure, they aren't free, but they're far more extensive and faaaaar less pretentious.\n\nI'm sorry, but this hardly deserves any of the publicity, interest, or credit it has recieved. If you had told me that this was a browser game, I wouldn't doubt you for a second. I've seen browser games that put more effort in. Bare graphics, some piano music, and overall poor and unrealistic writing.\n\nI can't say much on the game's subject. People I know with depression don't normally act in the way the character in this game supposedly acts, but that can be written off as coincidence. The word pretentious comes back because it simply feels like it's trying to be more than it actually is. These websites that reviewed it made it seem like something that would stun me and blow my mind with how thought-provoking it is. It wasn't. At all.\n\nNot to mention the recent controversy surrounding this game. I have some not so positive words surrounding the developer and her boy toy- er, friends (HINT: Pretentious is one of them).  Quite frankly, I don't want to say them because I'm horredously afraid of Phil Fish and his threating twitter tweets.  Needless to say, this isn't about her as much as the game.\n\nAnd the game sucks. It may be free, but it's a free waste of time you could be dedicating to contributing to society.

Despite all the controversy regarding the developer, the game itself isn't inherently bad, and it would help you understand those who have depression better. But I don't recommend it because it's not necessary. It tells you what you already know about people who are depressed, what they do, how they act, etcetera, there's not much else to it, except for it being a nice interactive story about someone who is. If you like text-based adventure novels, go for this game, but if you want to understand depression, I can sum it up in a single sentence: "I ♥♥♥♥ed five guys to censor criticism about my new game and faked attacks to myself on messaging boards to gain the sympathy of people who are ♥♥♥♥ed up like I am."\nOh, wait, that's just the "depression" the developer had.

I wouldn't even go so far as to call it a visual novel, much less a game, because the pictures placed above the text don't add anything to the story. Basically, you play as "you", and you start out depressed. You have a bunch of first world problems going against you, and you have to manage all of these issues in order to get to the point where you're still depressed, but coping with it by the end of the story. I believe that the producer of this "game's" goal was to raise awareness for depression, but I don't think she really was able to do so. She made it seem much like the misconceptions that overpriviledged people who self-diagnose themselves were what depression really is, and it made the whole storyline seem a bit pretentious. I don't think it's really possible for anyone to get anything from this experience, because quite honestly, it didn't explain depression at all to those who don't have it, and only maybe convinced those with depression that it does help to get seek guidance and comfort from those who are close to you. And with all of this going against it, the producer couldn't even go through all the text walls to make sure there weren't any spelling or grammatical errors!\n\nOverall:\n\nPros:\n-Shows those with depression that they aren't suffering alone\n\nCons:\n-No gameplay\n-No visual aids\n-Not a correct depiction of depression\n-Grammatical/spelling errors all over the place\n\nScores:\nGameplay: 0/10\nSoundtrack: 1/10 (There was pretty much only one instrumental throughout the whole game)\nStyle: 0/10\nGraphics: 0/10\nAddictiveness: 0/10\nOverall: 0/10","August 21, 2014","false","2.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Even though it might not be considered a game we all know and love, it is more of a novel or a little story, like a webpage comic or something. So if you were expecting a game, this might disappoint you. Steer away from this if you just want gameplay.\n\nA person like me loves a story, and this game did well to portrait realism and a guy genuinely going through life choices that we are all destined towards to, experiencing depression and emotionall/physical exhaustion. The choices in this game chilled my spine just thinking what would happen if I clicked it. Also, there is a nice feature, which if you are depressed in a level, it won't let you make the choice, further adding realism. You can't expect a morbidly depressed guy to suddenly go up to people and say "Hey guys, hows the weather".\n\nThe "characters" did well in their role, adding a sense to the story, etheir adding emotional support if you choose the accept it. "The music adds to the surreal atmosphere, although I put off my headphones because I don't want to feel chills\n\n\nOverall, if you like stories, go with this. If you like choice-making, go with this. Otherwise, I would steer away from it because it's not an actual game.( I do like the awareness spread with this.)","September 25, 2014","false","1.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Why anyone would greenlight this is beyond me, perhaps Zoe slept with more people than previously thought. Sure, cry about the misogyny and hatred of women in the gaming industry and cry to some more journalists you have corrupted with the cosmic suction of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you really want to get yourself into the gaming industry and push all of the priviliged white males at the top off of their spot, then making games which people can play without ripping their eyes out and blending them in hope of no possibility of re - attatchment could be a good start. I get that it's meant to be some deeply profound story of depression but this is not a game so why stick it in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of gamers?* Plopegg has more artistic prowess than this, which is essentially a painfully long text "adventure" "game". All this has done is leave a scar in the face of greenlight, seeing as you have quite obviously accumulated a mindless gaggle of zombies to shove your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ballsack of a game into the face of people who like to play actual games.

This is not a game. It's a choose-your-own-adventure story that would do better if there was some kind of visual, less scrolling paragraphs and pages to read through before a choice, and somewhat better options. The thing with it is that it's understandable that it's not going to be any fun - I mean it's called Depression Quest and the whole point is to show what it's like but at the same time, so much work to go through means nobody is really going to read everything. People are just going to exit out. Some of the responses don't seem very realistic either. But then we all have different experiences with depression and some have none. It wasn't very good, the story was mind-numbing as were the supposed characters, responses and timeframes could be better, it was long and arduous and usually I just skimmed to make my choice, and the "game" was so quick that it was just blah. If I want I could just tell people everything I'm experiencing or feeling instead.

Not only is this game NOT a game, but it's a TERRIBLE representation of what Depression is actually like. This game reinforces terrible stereotypes about people legitimately suffering from the disease, such as that we're never happy and all we do is wallow in our own misery 24/7 with no interest in getting better, seeking treatment or taking care of ourselves. It tells people that nothing ever makes us happy ever, not even temporarily, and that all we do is lie around unable to do anything.\n\nSure, depression is brutal. Believe me I know. But this? This game is ridiculous. The only time I've ever been NEARLY as sick as the protagonist of this "story" was in my extreme lows where I was borderline suicidal. But it's harmful to people who ACTUALLY suffer from depression to reinforce these horrible stereotypes. Zoe claims she wants to help fight against the stigma but all she's done was add to it. This game is further proof to me that Zoe Quinn not only doesn't care about ANYTHING she claims she does (Women's rights, mental health, ect ect) but that she has no problems milking these things for all the money she can get. Sure the game is free but look at all the press she's gotten from other people who think this is a GREAT thing, people who (spoiler alert) more than likely don't have mental illnesses themselves and just think the sentiment is nice.\n\nDo not support this game. It's not even a game and were it not for Zoe's constant lying and harmful use of legitimate causes to gain for herself this game would NOT have made it onto steam, period. Steam sells games. This is not a game. And it CERTAINLY isn't an acurate depiction of what living with depression is like, nor is it sending out a positive message in any way, shape or form.","September 4, 2014","false","0.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I am going to set aside the controversy surrounding the game and focus on the game itself.\n\nI am not sure exactly what Zoe Quinn thinks depression entails, but it is not simply a series of "I don't feel like it" moments. What is portrayed in this game, if you can really call it that, seems like an eight-minute commercial for Prozac that pushes the "Hollywood Angle" on the subject. Depicting anyone who is withdrawn and unhappy with their life as automatically depressed and stating they must be rushed to therapy and put on meds. The mood is punctuated by a rote series of piano codas designed to make the viewer sad and sympathetic, but quickly become annoying. If anything this is almost feels like a poorly-written tearjerker script for a Lifetime movie than any accurate depiction of how depression affects a person and those around them.\n\nI almost feel like the game isn't about depression in general. Instead I'm left with the impression that Zoe Quinn created this visual novel, again if you can really call it that, to engender sympathy because she went through a rough patch for several months. I suppose that in and of itself is not a problem, but if it's all about you then just say it's about you.

I know that sounds like an excuse, but believe me. I've clocked in one playthrough of it and in that one playthrough, more thoughts crossed my mind than any 12 hours spent on a typical shooter of your choice. In fact, I think it's wrong for me to even bring up the term 'shooter' as though in comparison because shooters are games. That's something many people who criticise this tend to complain most about. That this is a poor excuse for a game. In doing so they miss the biggest and most powerful message that this game does it's ultimate best to send.\nDepression is not a game.\n\nI've read plenty of complaints about this game from people who do have depression that found this game insulting or offensive. The last thing I, or Depression Quest, want to do is devalue those people and their experiences. But I can assure you that the opening message of the game openly admits that it's only trying to give a semblance of depression and what it's like, though they can not, in fact they can never, fully encapsulate everything about it. No two experiences of depression are the same, something the multiple choice nature of this story can only reach for. The game is honest about itself, which I think everyone at least can appreciate. It's not the be-all, end-all definition of depression. It's a taste, based on a limited experience set to try and share the pain that is experienced in the real world.\n\nIf you have depression, the game warns you beforehand what you're getting into. You may not get along with this game, which is completely okay.\nAs for me? I do not have depression. Nor do I understand depression. But Depression Quest did for me what it set out to do. It showed me - if only just a little - a little of what it's like. In an ironic use of the word, it's through 'play' that I'm given a bit on insight into how hopeless life can be. This is a game that teaches and shares. It might not be music that resonates with you, but the important thing is that it's heard. And I heard it.\nAnother complaint I've read is that your 'character' has no personality and is an empty protagonist. Again, something has been missed. This is a game told through written 2nd-person narrative. You are the main character. This is your life that you're playing through and these are your decisions. How restricted you are is how restricted you could be if you had depression. How you're told that you're feeling is how you could be feeling if you had depression. The game is saying through it's presentation of the story and 'main character' that this could be you. This could be your life. And for some people, this is their life.\nYou're given choices on how to make decisions on what to do, some of which are completely inaccessable. Even though you know that it's there, you can't do it. You're told often how you feel and what your mental state is, so sometimes you'll try to do what seems like the right thing only to realise that your character is only feeling worse. You'll wonder what the right choice was, or even if there ever was a right choice to begin with. Again, not everyone faces the same kind of depression, but to see into the eyes of even one kind is... eye-opening. And regardless of how it ends, you can't simply resolve everything because, once again, this isn't a game. This is life. This is depression. This is no idealised, escapist happy ending for feeling better. This is depression awareness.\n\nIn summation, no. This game is not fun. You are not meant to have fun playing it. You are meant to think, to consider, to choose and possibly to feel. If that's not what you want, if this isn't what you're looking for, walk away. But if you're up for it, dive. Dive right in. This is less of a game and more of an experience. An experience with depression for those unenlightened to it. Even if you disagree with it and it's portrayal, that's all the more reason to try it.\nI promise. Devote yourself to one playthrough and you'll come away with something meaningful. Positive or negative, this is a game that redefines what games can be and what they can live up to. This is something more games should aspire to try and perfect.\n\nSo yes. I recommend it. It's thoughtful, well-written, intricate and with the best of intentions. Above all, it's different. Even if you hate it, you should try it.","November 15, 2014","true","0.8"," 35 of 68 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","35","68","2","0"

I now wish I hadn't.\n\nThis game is hard for me to review because there's so little to review. This "game" can barely be called a game. It's more like a visual novel. There's no interactivity beyond clicking text options. At least visual novels have pictures of anime girls. This game doesn't even have that.\n\nGeneric piano music plays throughout. I'm guessing this is supposed to make the game feel more sad, but it just sounds annoying to me.\n\nThe story itself is dull and boring. It's impossible for me to relate to the main character. None of your decisions feel like they have any major impact. Nothing truly bad happens to the main character that makes me want to sympathize with him. It just slogs on and on before reaching one of many anticlimactic, unsatisfying conclusions.\n\nDepression Quest is the laziest excuse for a game I have ever played. Anyone can make a text-based adventure game. Anyone. You could program a game just like this in flash in ten minutes. This isn't even Newgrounds quality. The only reason this got put on Steam is because the author has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. That's it.

Depression Quest isn't a game so much as a 'choose your own adventure' book in a digital format. Unfortunately, it doesn't even do that well. The story is plagued by long, boring, and bland writing. That's unfortunate because the writing is really all you see. There aren't much in the way of visuals, and navigation feels more like navigating an awkward web page than moving through a story. It tries to ram into your head that your 'character' is depressed, but it doesn't personalize the character enough to make you feel sorry for them, nor does the awkward writing make it easy to sit through all of the story. Most of the actions you choose also tend to railroad you in one single direction. It gives the illusion of variation where the reality is that it is severely lacking in that department.\n\nOverall, I do not recommend this game. I can't even begin to give this a score because it's not really a game, and even the experience it means to give you fails so horribly that trying to give it a */10 score is like trying to score a trainwreck.","August 19, 2014","false","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game will not raise awareness or increase understanding. All it does is reinforce depression stereotypes. Whoever made this game has no idea what it means to be clinically depressed and have a $#!tty lot in life.

It feels as though you’re reading someone’s unfiltered mental diary. Depression Quest is uncomfortable in that it feels voyeuristic, but the cramped proximity is how you develop a relationship with the character. It’s why, by the end, I was able to say I understood depression a bit better. It's a window.” By-Giant Bomb Was not a smart quote I would say. By the end of the game to me I didn't understand depression at all. It wasn't in first person at all it was in second or third person view. Reading a diary? I just said it was in second or third person view. I didn't develop a relationship with the character at all.\nThis quote also: “Besides the blues-ridden story, it's just a well-made game overall. It's excellently written, well-paced, and so engaging that you might just find yourself playing again to find out what might happen”\nBy-GameSpy Well, let me just say this, it's too slow. Yea I played it kinda fast cuz I got bored or reading the paragraphs, but how the story builded up was too slow. It didn't have a climax, lowering action, and cliffhangers.

Place your order and grab some free peanuts while you wait for everything to be prepared fresh and to-order.\n\nFree peanuts! Don't want to spring for fries? Fill up on these little guys instead.\n\nThe burger itself. I know its not very good for me, but I love these patties, covered in gooey cheese and crispy bacon, topped with whatever I ask for.\n\nAnd the fries. Sometimes over salted, they're cooked nice and crispy and delicious. And they're tossed into the bag, overflowing from their container. If you're not stuffed after a burger and an order of these guys, you're inhuman.\n\nAll in all, if you set your expectations right and are looking for a good but not so good-for-you fast food meal, you'll have a hard time finding something better than this 5 Guys.","August 26, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

They didn't ask for this.\n\nThough on the game here's what I think:\n\nI won't go on about how the text is uninteresting, etc. or that your  options are always left and right,  even though the door on the left is a hallway to the right.\n\nThe game was so unengaging, that you don't have to worry about being called a sociopath if you didn't care about what happened to the character. A man in the prime of his life, with a girlfriend, friends, a job, and his own place. That's a lot more than I have, and I'm not complaining with what I do, So why's this guy upset? I guess what I'm trying to say is: This guy has no reason to complain, he's got a mate and lads to hang out with, a job, etc. so what's his deal? The thing with depression is: There's always some sort of underlying cause, and one is never given in the game. How do I sympathize with someone who hasn't a tale to his struggle? There's no sign of social distress, or infidelity (Which would be ironic in a Zoey Quinn game) no past history to go off of to see that the character has a reason to be depressed. And that's the thing: He doesn't. You quickly realize that the character is unsuitable to represent depression, or at least a common form. The Developer's chosen the MOST UNLIKELY SCENARIO to give someone depression, and that's why I can't feel a connection.\n\nThere's more I'd say, but I've decided to refrain.\n\nTL;DR? Succinctly: It's kind of like a mid-life crisis ten+ years too early.","August 24, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Here is a better one: ''is this a game?'' The answer to both questions is no IMO. Why? Cause it is just a mediocre book. There is no gameplay and no graphics. There is no reason to play it over so many wonderful free games on steam.\n\nLet me cut this game apart in steps.\n\n1: No gameplay: Gameplay makes a game, and this one does not even have incomplete controls. It is just a book with some options, there is no gameplay that keeps you excited. It is just not there.\n\n2: The story is stupid: Who makes a game about a girl who is despressed and you need to help her get rid of that depression. To me, that is not a good idea for a game (but this is not a game anyway). For a game that tries to sell itself as immersive, the poor writing and the long walls of uninteresting text just make me want to skip it all.\n\n3: It is not fun: I know that at the beginning it says that ''it is not meant to be fun'', but fun is the thing that makes a game good for me. Even technically bad games will be liked by me if they have a good fun factor. But this one does not even try, and it is not hard to see. It is so boring, its only use would be as a tool to help you sleep. If you want to read a book, THEN READ A F*CKING BOOK.\n\n4: The developer: This is a thing that keeps coming to my mind when i think about this 'game'. You see all of those reviews saying it is a great game? Well the 'game' itself did not do anything to create these positive reviews. Rather the developer had sex with the reviewers and they had to pay her in a good review for her game, i am not kidding.... look here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5-51PfwI3M#t=209 all credit to InternetAristocrat for making it. It is just stupid, and also why the reviews are lies. Developer Zoe Quinn....... you should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nThose are mayor reasons why this is not a good game, or a game for that matter. There are many good and free games, please do not waste time on this one. And you may call me a hypocrite for wasting 7 minutes on it (it felt much longer), but now i experienced it and i want no more..... ever.\n\nThe End.","September 12, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This review will be slightly nit-picky and slightly spoiler-ridden, but no one who reads this is really going to care about that.\n\nStarting off with the very first line of this story we have this: "You are a 20-something human being". Okay, cool. But yet it reads that your significant other is named "Alex", again, not a huge deal until you realize that Alex is a female, meaning the only two demographics of "human being" that the author recognizes are heterosexual men and homosexual women. If you are a heterosexual female or a homosexual man, tough cookies hombre! I mean, why even include this if it's so obvious that this story is about a female and her experience with "depression"? to make people feel included? great job there! you couldn't even include a sexuality slider somewhere? And let's talk about the protagonist here: over the course of the story she is clearly socially awkward with what seems to me to be a rather average case of ADD.\n\nThroughout the pages of the story you will see notifications about her depression level, and the lowest I could get it to was "mildly depressed" However, knowing what clinically describes depression and how depression actually feels like are two wholly different beasts entirely. Honestly in my opinion this person was just fed up with their awful job at kinkos or fedex, or where-ever and simply wasn't cut out for customer service. Hey, I get that some people aren't meant for that sort of job! But I don't care HOW depressed you are, you are NEVER too depressed to order a pizza over the phone, or most likely over the internet. Heck, I'm almost willing to bet that because of a bad mood you might get extra toppings on it, maybe get some sort of dessert, too!\n\nReturning to your depression however, lets take a closer look at what you claimed to have done in order to calm your mind, shall well? Netflix. video games. playing with your cat with a laser pointer, browsing social media.. never at any point while reading through this whatever-it-is did you once make a reference to, or make any attempt to do some sort of physical activity for the purpose of stress-relief. A sedentary lifestyle, which the protagonist seems to have displayed throughout this story leads me to believe that they were not in fact depressed, but simply bored. This lack of physical activity in the protagonist's de-stressing routine may have led to additional stresses, such as an inability to deal with others and making one become quick to anger. (Which really isn't helped by the cliche nosy mother character you seem to have.) It could also explain the complete lack of progress on this "secret project" they keep whispering about. Though maybe this motherly issue is somehow related to the fact that the protagonist very well may have lead a rather sheltered life up until leaving the nest and the mother is simply putting on a harsher front to help toughen her up. In either case the protagonist is overly sensitive to perceived threats and probably needs trigger warnings when watching the news.\n\nIf all of this wasn't enough the protagonist is also quite paranoid, not to the point of delusion really, but every single thing is like "oh geez, oh man! what if! aaaarg!"  And ya know what? this protagonist needs a good slap in the back of the head, NCIS style. Not everything is a personal attack, not everything is a slight against you, In fact most people on earth have some of these effects simply due to aging. Yes, even an inability to sleep.\n\nSo, is the protagonist in this story depressed at any point? I believe the other reviews will answer that question nicely. See what I did there? you and your awful ending.. feh! this whole thing was just absolutely infuriating.","December 6, 2015","false","2.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I definitely thought the protag was whiny and the writing was a bit pretentious, but I didn't get the sense that the game was making them out to be lazy and selfless, more that the depression was crippling their motivation and made it hard to find interest in the things they normally do.\n\nFor people saying that all the positive choices were crossed out, yes, the most helpful ones were, but there were still positive choices (usually the second option - this game has a tendency to list options in order of most-to-least helpful with a few switch-ups thrown in now-and-then, which I find a bit weird but w/e). I managed to get what I believe is the best ending (my protag was seeing a therapist, taking medication, and they weren't depressed anymore), so maybe it's just that I took the time to read the choices and think about what would be most helpful.\n\nFor those saying it's too long/too much reading, come on. It took me maybe 20 - 30 minutes to play this game and I only skimmed like 5% of the text.\n\nI've never been officially diagnosed with depression and I don't think I have it, so I can't speak to the accuracy of the depiction in this. I'll simply say, take it with a grain of salt. You may relate to it, you may not. This game doesn't suit everyone. I liked it, but hey, that's just me. Experience the game for yourself if you want to have an opinion on it. Or don't. It doesn't matter.","March 10","true","0.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

This review will be slightly nit-picky and slightly spoiler-ridden, but no one who reads this is really going to care about that.\n\nStarting off with the very first line of this story we have this: "You are a 20-something human being". Okay, cool. But yet it reads that your significant other is named "Alex", again, not a huge deal until you realize that Alex is a female, meaning the only two demographics of "human being" that the author recognizes are heterosexual men and homosexual women. If you are a heterosexual female or a homosexual man, tough cookies hombre! I mean, why even include this if it's so obvious that this story is about a female and her experience with "depression"? to make people feel included? great job there! you couldn't even include a sexuality slider somewhere? And let's talk about the protagonist here: over the course of the story she is clearly socially awkward with what seems to me to be a rather average case of ADD.\n\nThroughout the pages of the story you will see notifications about her depression level, and the lowest I could get it to was "mildly depressed" However, knowing what clinically describes depression and how depression actually feels like are two wholly different beasts entirely. Honestly in my opinion this person was just fed up with their awful job at kinkos or fedex, or where-ever and simply wasn't cut out for customer service. Hey, I get that some people aren't meant for that sort of job! But I don't care HOW depressed you are, you are NEVER too depressed to order a pizza over the phone, or most likely over the internet. Heck, I'm almost willing to bet that because of a bad mood you might get extra toppings on it, maybe get some sort of dessert, too!\n\nReturning to your depression however, lets take a closer look at what you claimed to have done in order to calm your mind, shall well? Netflix. video games. playing with your cat with a laser pointer, browsing social media.. never at any point while reading through this whatever-it-is did you once make a reference to, or make any attempt to do some sort of physical activity for the purpose of stress-relief. A sedentary lifestyle, which the protagonist seems to have displayed throughout this story leads me to believe that they were not in fact depressed, but simply bored. This lack of physical activity in the protagonist's de-stressing routine may have led to additional stresses, such as an inability to deal with others and making one become quick to anger. (Which really isn't helped by the cliche nosy mother character you seem to have.) It could also explain the complete lack of progress on this "secret project" they keep whispering about. Though maybe this motherly issue is somehow related to the fact that the protagonist very well may have lead a rather sheltered life up until leaving the nest and the mother is simply putting on a harsher front to help toughen her up. In either case the protagonist is overly sensitive to perceived threats and probably needs trigger warnings when watching the news.\n\nIf all of this wasn't enough the protagonist is also quite paranoid, not to the point of delusion really, but every single thing is like "oh geez, oh man! what if! aaaarg!"  And ya know what? this protagonist needs a good slap in the back of the head, NCIS style. Not everything is a personal attack, not everything is a slight against you, In fact most people on earth have some of these effects simply due to aging. Yes, even an inability to sleep.\n\nSo, is the protagonist in this story depressed at any point? I believe the other reviews will answer that question nicely. See what I did there? you and your awful ending.. feh! this whole thing was just absolutely infuriating.","December 6, 2015","false","2.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I keep seeing people compare this to choose your own adventure books, and that's insulting, the writers of stories like the Fighting Fantasy series put effort into their games. This game looks like a 90s website, with the artwork being pictures they most likely got on a google image search.\nThey claim this is a learning experience, I knew nothing about clinical depression before playing, I still know jack ♥♥♥♥. The character comes off more as a whining little turd than anything else, he's got lots of friends, a girlfriend, and job that he says right at the beginning he's been rising through the ranks quickly. He's got more than many people who don't mope and ♥♥♥♥♥ about their life. Then, when he gets to doing something about his problem, it takes half a year to get it under control; Damn that's fast!\nLooking at the posted official reviews on their Steam page, I see three gaming sites whose word I will never trust. Not just the game is unpleasant though, the developers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I dared to make a snarky discussion post and it took about an hour for them to ban my discussion. They are actively censoring criticism where they can, and I'll probably be accused of being a mysoginist for saying this game sucks.\nAlso, a lot of the other reviews are making me hungry, I'm going to Five Guys.","October 23, 2014","false","0.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The game isn’t quite a game. I’m not even sure what to call this. A short story, maybe? An adventure novel? It might even be too short to be considered an adventure novel. I’m not really sure why this is on Steam. Unless Steam is soon deciding that branching out into short stories is a good idea, this isn’t a game, and it’s categorized as one, so why is it here? It’s a “hit next” simulator at best. The ability to convey depression through Depression Quest is something that only the worst of game developers could master. The experience was so horrible, not by the content that they included to intentionally make me feel horrible — no, by the lack of content that was greatly overlooked by these “game developers”. Game review? This was more of a “short story” review, but I hear 5 guys out of 10 loved it. Me? I’ll keep my integrity: Zoe Quinn’s monstrosity was the worst game that I have ever played.","October 28, 2014","false","0.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I didn't want to admit anything was wrong to the people around me and felt shameful about many parts of myself. At some point, I came across the game, made by a few indie developers I hadn't heard of before, and decided to give it a shot.\n\nOf all of the games I've played, this one has had the biggest impact on my life. It managed to show me that, just maybe, what I was experiencing in my head wasn't "normal", but neither did I need to feel ashamed about it. I've since sought out professional help and I'm dealing with my mental issues much better.\n\nThis game may or may not be for you. It is not a fun game - don't expect to come out all smiles. Some even say it's not a game (not me, although I can understand their point based on their definition of the word). If you're easily triggered by stories or discussions about depression, I recommend avoiding playing it if you're trying to stay in a positive mood.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for an understanding of what depression is like, to help you understand what someone else might be going through... or even yourself, this game offers a perspective. It is not the be all or end all of descriptions of what it is like - for sure, some parts of the game's perspective differ from my own experiences with depression - but if you're looking for a starting place to help you develop that understanding, this game is worth a try.","August 25, 2014","true","0.4"," 70 of 138 people (51%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","51","70","138","9","0"

Yes, some endings are more hopeful than others, but overall, I think Depression Quest did a great job of getting inside the head of someone who is stuck in an endless cycle, not sure how to get out.

The game is interesting in little snippets of it's story but only lasts about thirty minutes in total due to an unexpected and generally dissapointing ending which I'm gonna spoil in a second so if you don't want to read any spoilers , shut you eye holes. The ending of this game doesn't end with the main character getting over his depression because apparently "Despression doesn't end". Well excuse me , Mr Game Developer or Mrs Game Developer but if you actually gave us a chance to develop our character and get him through the depression and lead him into a nice and happy life, I am very certain that it would be a happier and more fuffiling ending than just "Yeah, mate, he still has depression there was nothing you could do to help him, soz."

This is as much as a game as reading a .pdf file with all the 'interaction' being the tools up top. This is as much as a game as reading a website from 1999 and seeing all the .gif buttons lead you through the website. Shucks, maybe this is actually the next revolutional game and I'm too happy to even understand it.\n\nI don't know, and I couldn't give any more ideas or opinions on it because I had barely played it to realize that there are people on the Greenlight who get ignored and spit on, but hey, at least they spent actual effort, right? They didn't have to do some dirty work just to get it through to several outlets where it's authors' opinions are one's people might actually listen to. They spent actual work onto it, dreaming of being into the industry one day. In this day and age of things like Game Maker and YouTube handing out free tutorials, all you really need is ambition and determination. Clearly, making a game like this had neither.\n\nIn short, this game is a load of ♥♥♥, and I want you to play it! Do YOU have a 2k Gaming PC, a good relationship, great social life, a job that makes you financially stable, great family, and possibly even more that makes you smile in the morning? Good!

Through the expansion of my journey i found that the game was to teach and give players a feel of what its like to have Depressioon. Upon downloading and launching the game I was ever so graciously greeted with a "(not responding)" message that some games naturally have upon launch. Once i had reached the title screen i was intruduced to the most enlightening piano music i have possibly ever heard in my life. Instinctively I started playing skipping the controls and other useless information. The first page alone had way to much dialogue so naturally i was all "wow nope" and went straight to the options. Without any idea of what my options were actually affecting I picked the most negative one i could. Since everyone knows depression is a fake disease the only possitive choice I made was adopting a cat so I could officially become a cat man. Then I proceded to dump my girl friend Alex so i could oficially be a lonely cat man. I then decided that my love for cats was greater than that of myself. So in this process i realized the only reason I hate myself is because im a male. Finally I ended the game by becoming a flaming male feminist who wanted to eliminate all other males, and once done. Commit suicide. I ended the game with a personal high score of 420 Depression Points which i then cashed in at the arcade shop for a stuffed slice of pizza. Great game over all.

My First issue with the game is the stup*d soundtrack, boring, and it becomes nuisance in no time, it's so terrible that i cannot even concentrate in the text, the very long and boring text about someone with a very ♥♥♥♥*y life, after the first five pages a was like "Ok, it will start anytime now", but, a text without gameplay it's not a game, it doesn't have the any of the four basic element that consist a experience as a game, you beign developers, i think you should know what element are those, in case you don't know, fear not for you incapaity, i will listen those here, they are Alea (The Random factor in a game, Aka Luck Factor), Agon (The Competitive Factor, Aka Skill), Mimicry (The Roleplaying Factor) And Ilinx (The Vertigo Factor) The only factor i saw was roleplaying, you say the game brings the experience of someone who suffers from Deppression, i will come back to this later, right on the bat i see the first choice on the blocked, cleaver, giving limitations to the player to make the "Game" Challenging, i chose something, even if it's not what i would chose because what i would chose is not an option or it's blocked, but after some turns i just get annoyed by this design choice, i'm just chosing random things, making the "Mimicry Factor" not really there, but i'm feeling generous today, but every bolder choice that would be better if you where in the main character position only results in your own demise, beign blocked or becoming a unhappy cat owner, an i guess this is not how depression works, would you care to send me the contact of the psychologist or the psychiatric doctor that gave you consultorship for your project? Because that person is a incompetent, and that is a important thing, in any matter, developers can't say "I Think" about a problem this dangerous such as depression, you NEED consultory, you NEED someone who know what they are talking about and when your friend offers help to you YOU CANNOT EVEN GET THE F*CKING THERAPY RIGHT AWAY, the game make a huge burden for you to call the doctor, even if you should encourage depressed people to do so, well, since the soundtrack is stupid, the gameplay is non-existent and the content is bullcrap, the graphics must be Outstanding, Crysis Level sh*t, but they at it's best, Lookable, they don't hurt your eyes, but they are not an eye candy, the fonts are boring and the background is so bright that make the text feel take a huge effort to read, which should not happen in a TEXT BASED GAME, why not use the Visual Novel style? It's good enough for what you need and feel better, in general, by not making your text based experience feel like a 1-ton Burden, and i didn't even talk about the reused resources like the same photo beign used over and over again.\nNow, in all Honesty, how DARE you call yourselves Game Developers? People study, they learn, they work hard, they give they bests to produce and successfully release a Game, Japanese developers expend a great amount of money to release their games in conventions like Comiket, ocidental developers have to raise a great amount of money on IndieGoGo, Kickstarter, etc, and get past on Steam GreenLight, i've see so many people trying, and even small RPG Maker games made by some random kid deserve some praise, you know why? Because you can see they, even if they didn't know much, they gave they f*cking best, hell, I even defend Super Man 64 sometime because how ambitious the developers imagined the game and how DC broke they legs, but i can clearly see that you guys didn't even GAVE A F*CKING ♥♥♥♥ ABOUT YOUR GAME, Video-Games are Art, expression, text, media, imerssion and emergency, how Dare you Negglect those meanings so much and make this abomination? Hell, Big Huge Games Broke because they made Kingdoms of Amalur which is a great game, but didn't sold enough, they gave they best and it was not enough to those great developers going (Some of they even worked on games like Conkers and my eternally beloved series, The Elder Scrolls) and they could not keep it, And you get here by Sucking Balls, LITERALLY, Now it's time to get back to the depression point, and that's what i'm feeling now, i wanted to be parted of this industry my whole childhood, i learned what i could from what i had, read a lot of book in game development, and then, when i finally get in the university, i see this monstruosity, do you know how i felt? Broken, everything i idolized was now unholy and dirty, my passions and aspirations broken, and i'm not talking about this "Gamer Jornalism" Bullsh*t, it was always stupid to see people with no knowledge in games harshly criticizing thing they know ♥♥♥♥ about, as a Future Developer, i feel ashamed of you, and you should feel as well, your names may carry shame and hatred, people will remeber you not as developers, but as atention seeking morons, who think everything can be bought by the right price, but know, tha me, and many more like me, who are really passionate about we do, what we want to do, what we love to do, your ART, that you carry no weight for us, we will not be bought, we will not bow down, we will always give your best to make this industry better, and more acessible, a world where everyone can play, a world where everyone can develop, know that you will not stop us","March 7, 2015","false","0.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

It made me feel more emotions than any other game I've ever played. I have struggled with depression and it is comforting to me that there is a game that shows how difficult it is to live with depression. Many people who don't understand what it is like to be depressed don't know how to help or understand someone who is lives with it. I actually had my boyfriend play it even though he was against it at the beginning because there was a lot of reading. But when he finished we talked about it and I think he got a lot out of it. It's hard to live with me sometimes when I get down but he's always there for me and I think Depression Quest can help him know more how I feel. I liked how there would always be a "normal" response to a situation but it would have a line crossed out and you weren't able to pick it. That's just like real life. You know what you should feel like or what you should be doing but you just can't do it. It's just not possible. That also is a great way to show people who don't suffer what it feels like. I always tried making the best decision possible when I played. Again, I know what it's like to be depressed and I always try to see the best in life even when it's really hard to do so. I think it should be manditory for everyone to play this game.\n\n","April 2, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

The way the main character overthinks things, beats himself up over large and small mistakes alike, runs through possible scenarios in his head, only causing himself to worry more - I have experienced all of this. Also, too many times do I hear people telling me to "cheer up" or "get over it," but they just don't understand... it's not that easy - I don't want to be depressed, if it were just a mindset, I would have stopped being depressed long ago. Although many situations in this story I have not experienced (I've never had a girlfriend, or seen a therapist) I can still relate to how the main character feels throughout - the narrative is very thorough, and thus is very effective at portraying the situation, making it easy for me to put myself in his shoes. The choices are well varied, and I always found at least one option that I would do in that situation. After completing the game, I came to what seemed to me to be the best ending. Too bad it's just a game.\n\nBy the way, it's funny how many bad reviews this game got by people who aren't depressed, saying, "it's not realistic" when they are the target audience, and yet, a depressed person writing a review gave a positive one saying that it is realistic.","August 27, 2014","true","0.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","7","15","3","0"

They do select the red choices and make things better for themselves.\n\nThis game does a great disservice to genuine sufferers of depression who may be led to believe the message that all is hopeless. I worry that it might just tip them into seeking a permanent solution. If you have any remotely depressed friends, DO NOT let them play this 'game'. I cannot stress this enough.\n\nAnd I cannot understand why the developers have chosen to preach such a bleak (and untrue!) message instead of one carrying some hope for depressives. This is bordering on, if not outright irresponsible.\n","January 24, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Depression can't really be recreated in anyway, and I fail to see what the this is trying to accomplish. You can't choose the options you actually want to do, which would seem like logical things to do in this situation. I was expecting this to be a story about overcoming depression, as I see it is harder to overcome than to cope with. Those who sit around all day waiting for something to happen to them will never get anywhere in a situation of this measure, real or not. I don't even know if there is an ending where you get over it. If you have depression, seek guidance, because the people who try to be tough and not talk about are those who end up with the serious depression. I don't see why you'd make a "game" about a serious thing almost everyone endures nowadays. I don't know, maybe it's to "raise awareness" or whatever tumblr says today. Someone pass the Vicodins...

Might as well toss out a token review.\nFor a game that causes grown men to go into fits over the dreaded ess-jay-dubyas, this isn't a terrible intersectional game. The main character doesn't have any money concerns, has a steady job, a supportive girlfriend and at least one supportive family member, hits the jackpot on their first time visiting a therapist (it took me about four or five tries to find one that clicked), lives in a location that allows them to keep a cat, and doesn't seem to suffer any ill effects from race, religion, physical disability, age, or gender.\nAs a long-time sufferer of depression's smaller cousin, dysthymia (if depression is a big black dog sitting on your chest for stretches of time, dysthymia is an overweight cat that lays on your head and never leaves), I recognized a lot of the situations presented in the game, and the options for action described pretty well actions I might have taken. Although I really wish getting help were as easy as clicking a link in a Twine game...\nAll in all this game doesn't merit the hate it gets. So thusly I give it a recommendation. It's not a Half-Life-esque landmark game... but it deserves to be appreciated for what it is.\nI hope that somewhere, somehow, thisgame  makes a grown man-child dudebro cry. I hope it makes him recognize depression in himself or someone he loves. I hope he can become a better person because of it.

It's interactive, and presents situations this man goes through while providing 2-5 options to pick your way to continue.\nAt the very beginning and a few more [pages?] through, it felt as it was shouting "Welcome to Ayudon". Way too me-ish, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt like this.\nBut then as I progressed it felt like.. I don't know, should I say "less charming"? With this I mean, I think I 'lost focus' on actually giving accurate answers on what *I* would do in his place and instead trying to get the best ones for him to achieve a happier mood. Maybe because it showed your mood "status" on each page and I felt like it asked me to increase it, maybe because it had options to make you choose from (still, if it hadn't I suppose it would be even less interesting) instead of being a one-way wall of text (don't get me wrong, a very worth reading wall of text)... or maybe it's just me playing it entirely for the whole night. Although it's quite short, so it's possible.\nEnough, back to the point. In sintesi, if there was an "Unsure" option for recommending games, I would leave this one there. It has its ups (such as depicting something I was diagnosed with very accurately), and downs (losing its touch), but then again it might as well be just me...\n... Why don't you find out *yourself*? It's a very short road in both playtime and file size, like ~100mbs, so there's that to it as well.\n8/10. Might re-review it some day..

The only problem I have with this game is that while it has this insanely good soundtrack (best part of this game), the whole thing in of itself is nothing but an unfinished text reading and clicking bonanza. Seriously. It often feels like perusing a wiki article and flowing through hyper-links out of curiosity, while at others, the lack of appeal to this "book" makes me flat-out skip entries I'm completely and utterly uninterested in.\n\nWhile this game can be sharp in terms of it's text entries, it certainly lacks in terms of everything else that should make it a videogame - but ultimately can't make a videogame out of it, as the "video" elements of this game are missing- outside of the surprizingly striking status text at the end of each day's entry.\n\nIn the end, this game worked one thing for me: reading the increasingly worrying status texts in the entries was immersing, but in the end, I was so bored out of my mind with everything else to this game that awarding this game a 4/10 is, unfortunately, a too generous review.\n\n2/10 is my final grade.\n\n\nHope this project gets to be polished.

With command functions and true dialogue responses it could have connected the player closer to the content.\n\nI had a very strong disconnection when the script tried to put me in first person.

I believe it had a respectful perspective of depression, and used classical text-adventure game mechanics as an appropriate delivery method. Depression is a sensitive subject that can be explored in a variety of ways, and the creators appear sensitive to the potential consequences of 'gamifying' depression. The music and evolving background ambience enhanced the experience. The strike-out progression options add to the atmosphere of futility, that no action ever feels like the right action, because the right action is always present but unavailable.\n\nI really saw a lot of potential for the link-to-additional-info buttons in the first screen of the game, and believe the experience would have been improved by continued use of that mechanic. I'd like to see more interactive stories with drill-down narratives like this; it's an inspiring piece of functionality that allows an author to provide supplemental details for those who crave a deeper narrative.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the three Status boxes for emotional well-being, therapy and medication, I felt that these may have felt too much like direct goal indicators. I believe it would have been beneficial to expose this information only upon receiving therapy or medication. While the player may be aware that these statuses represent treatment for depression, my gamer-brain interprets their immediate presence as goals for success. However, the narrative clearly indicates that the player character did not consider the benefits of seeking help.\n\nThe game provided key triggers that lead to introspection of my own depression as well as the depression of my family members. I felt the game succeeds very strongly in its ability to trigger introspective thought. I was particularly moved by the scenes in which Mom presses for career progression and "inspects" the player's life, as well as the scenes in which the player struggles with the negative-feedback loop associated with job dissatisfaction. Alex, Amanda, and attic's support not only reminded me of the support I've received, but also reminds me to be supportive of those I care about.\n\nAs a take-away, it's important to remember to be empathetic of those facing depression, and to be cognizant of signs that they may be in "one of those moods." It can be difficult not to fall into Mom's aggressive encouragement, and so the game inspires me to be more reflective on my own impatience with others' depression.","September 7, 2014","true","1.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Thats where she comes in to save the day! In the events following jamal'rese and this mysterious black women have many action packed adventures across the land ( i dont want to spoil the entire story, but things get pretty crazy!).\n\nWhat i should mention is the gameplay, its absolutly amazing! very dynamic and fun in every way, this game has a huge replayability factor to it. The graphics are breathtaking, from underground blackmarkets selling Uranium-235 and M249s, to the beautiful mexican city of Tijuana, it will put you in a trance with the ultimate immersion! The desicion makeing is absolutleeeeey briliant, so many life changeing desicions that will make your mind crack in sadness as you watch the tears of small african children hit the ground... and the music is out of this world! the 3-hour OST is amazing and i listen to it every night when i go to sleep.\n\n\nIn conclusion, this game is absolutly amazing and i recomend it to anyone brave enough to face its hardships... 71 pounds of pure crystal meth/70","August 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","3","7","3","0"

That being said the dialogue is very uninspired, I was hoping that this would be more of a "literary" game. When it came to actual mechanics the dialogue choices gave me very few options, by marking out the dialogue options in red made my interactivity fall off the chart completely.\n\nI would recommend this game because I feel that in better hands it could have been something much more interesting. With command functions and true dialogue responses it could have connected the player closer to the content.\n\nI had a very strong disconnection when the script tried to put me in first person. I feel that the game would be more effective if the player was playing as someone other than themselves. From a mechanic stand point this stops the player from making the easiest, obvious or "right" decision.","March 25, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Even if they have to let go of the concept of fun to do it.\n\nThis game doesn't have win-lose scenarios, an obvious best choice, or even a guarnteed resolution. All it has is realistic decisions based on the story's current circumstances. It plays with exceptations the same way reality does.\n\nWhile I've only played through the game once, I managed to get a personal ending that I felt was appropriate for the story (out of the possibilities of 150 possible encounters). If you ask me, it was pretty close to the best ending, but I felt like I didn't always make the right choices. Just honest answers.\n\nAnd rule of thumb: the first choice isn't always the best choice.\n\nPlus it's free and takes about 20-30 minutes of reading (at my reading speed).\n\nIf you can spare that time, then I guarantee that this game deserves to be played once; and you deserve to understand that depression is always a possibility, but never an eventuality. So remember what this game offered. As a fellow human, it is the best that you can do.\n\nSincerely,\n\nR.B.","September 29, 2014","true","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

While the game is obviously designed to make the player feel helpless, the method of achieving such a feeling is awkward at best and dysfunctional at worst; The Player does not take the role of the protagonist or understand the protagonist, but rather feels agitated by the lack of control of the protagonist (For this reason, I especially do not recommend Depression Quest to those suffering from Clinical Depression).\n\nYou know you've failed in your work when an MS paint comic (Hyperbole and a Half) made by one person better conveys the concept of clinical depression than an Interactive Fiction made by three people.","December 19, 2014","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The warning at the beginning mentions suicide as a trigger, so why isn't that even mentioned by the character? If you want to make a more realistic game about depression, at least give the option to kill yourself. Sure that's not what EVERY depressed person contemplates, but had a content warning for it, so what's the problem? When nameless-MC is so deeply depressed he can't get out of bed 90% of the time, why can he not kill himself. Why. Regardless of what's right or wrong or whatever, it's reality.\n\nBut that aside, I found it to be pretty accurate for depression- at least for the way I experience it. I'm probably just griping about the suicide option because that's the main difference between the depression depicted here and my personal depression, because no matter how good I feel I still want to die. I realize that this game was based on the creators' experience with depression, but I find the trigger warning to be out of place. I did a playthrough making the worst possible choices to see if he could off himself, and it was hardly different than if he was happy, save for the fact that MC was spending a buttload of money on therapy and medications on the happiest route. There should be a more drastic difference between the endings to show just how much a few decisions can make someone's life pan out differently.","November 19, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
