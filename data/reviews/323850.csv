You then play  your match according to the game randomly picking from your collective choices of gamemodes and you playing them in that order.\n\nExpierence Points\nYou earn xp for every match you play with people online, you are however, able to play using AI bots to fill in for other players, but if you play the entire game without another person you earn no xp at all.\n\nSteam Items!\nSteam items are awarded with every level up of your exp bar and items you earn have different rarities. You earn characters and gamemodes by leveling up, characters are purely cosmetic and provide no in-game benefit, while gamemodes give the player the ability to choose that in thier list of gamemodes to play for any given match! Players can still play gamemodes they dont have, but they have to rely on another player having it and putting it up for individual matches.\n\nGamemodes\nThere is many different gamemodes (I believe a little over 15 or so)  that challenge the player with moving, each gamemode has a different objective and it is up to you to master them and beat everyone who stands in your way. The devs have said they will continue to release new gamemodes and characters as future updates continue, but really as this game is not in early access, there really should be alot more features by now.\n\nGamestate\nRight now the state of the game is okay, connection can get really bad, and it gives the host a slight advantage every match, which is a big deal, but the devs are working on the feature, and hopefully they will put all effort towards it and stop giving us wierd updates like this "mutator update" that gives more of an RNG taste to the game and veers from the skill aspect of the game a bit.\n\nPros:- Sountrack\n- Graphics\n- Announcer Voice\n- Leveling System\n- Replayability\n- Steam Achievements, Trading cards, and Items\n- Idea Of The Game\n\nCons:- Multiplayer Connection Issues\n- Lack Of Gamemodes\n- No single-player way to earn xp\n\nGood, not the best, shows potential As of right now I would give this game a 6/10 rating\nThe game is in need of features, a stable multiplayer feature, and some kind of way to earn exp without bieng online. Other than that, the soundtrack is great, the graphics are great, and hopefully the devs here continue to put in alot of work and work out these issues with the game. I recommend this game to people that seek a fun quick party game and look forward to more features. Other than that, you may want to save your money and wait awhile to see if the problems the game has are fixed.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","March 13","true","69.6"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","29","35","6","0"

However, tons of minigames make it less easier for you and your friends and you have to be the last man standing. And that's quite difficult when blocks are trying to delete you or when your friends try to tag you with a bomb!\n\nTruly a magnificent piece of an Indie game. Simple, yet fun. Good luck maintaining your friendship in this hectic chaos!\n\nPros:\n\n+ Simple gameplay.\n+ Quite the diversity of mini-games.\n+ Free Unlockables\n+ Challenge mode: How many mini-games can you survive before you die?\n+ Gamepad/Controller support.\n+ Colorful.\n+ 249 MB (as of writing this)\n\nCons:\n\n- Online gameplay may feel a bit off.\n- Trying to join a server may take some time as "hosts seem to be sleeping" or there is a time-out. But this can be easily countered by hosting a server yourself!\n- Only two maps for certain mini-games which might come off as "stale" or "boring".\n- Mods are currently available only for local use. (Like sniper skins in "Jump shot")\n- Unable to rebind keys.\n- Not enough mini-games. (NEED MOAR)\n\nIt's quite a new game so you can expect some additions/changes and new options later on!\n\nAll in all, actually a lot of fun. Oh, and you'll be laughing at every fail everyone makes.

This is fast becoming a staple of the "drunken night with local multiplayer games" that my friends and I have. The art style sets the mood perfectly, and a full match only takes a couple minutes with several rounds in it.\n\nMy only big concern is that the game is almost out and there aren't enough official gamemodes to keep it fresh.

Around here we play any local couch games we can get our hands on and I can confidently say that Move or Die is hands-down pure fun.\n\nWith both online play and local madness, it's always easy to get a game going. Overall, Move or Die is highly polished. There are tons of avatars you can earn as you level up, and lots of built in player interaction. I think this is definately a game that you have to play to truly experience the fun factor. Kind of like TowerFall, in a way.\n\nPros:\n+Online and local play.\n+It can be described as a series of really well done mini-games. You then select how long you want to play, followed by what mini-games you want in the mix. We thought they were all fun.\n+Artwork and music are great!\n+Easy to pick up and learn. We had a mix of gaming veterans and fairly new people, and it wasn't unbalanced.\n+Level 'mutations' that a random player gets to pick (ie. double jump ability, teleporting, etc.). Definately adds variation and life to the game.\n+Game design keeps you in the fast-and-frantic play all the time, which is great. It also baits you into easily joining others games that are about to begin lol.\n+Workshop support.\n\nCons:\n-The price seems steep, but I really think its worth it. It is very well done and highly polished.\n\nYeah I'm really glad I decided to take the plunge with this one. It's great and will likely be our go-to game for local multiplayer fun.","April 30","true","0.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/recommended/323850/","SkyeF","Flutter Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/","413 products in account","Move or Die is a party game for up to 4 players, it supports both online multiplayer, and local multiplayer. The game\nis the best party game I've ever played, and here's why:\n\nThe game has a completely unique mechanic, which is also the title of the game: Move or die. You have a health bar on the bottom of the screen, which depletes\nwhen you do not move, and will result in your death in the moment of it reaching 0%. as long as you move, it will not deplete. The mechanic is really fun\nand changes gameplay entirely, because you have to move all of the time, resulting in you having to be careful in various game mode to keep moving, but don't\nget killed by the various hazards.\n\nThere's currently about 10 Various game modes in the game, with more planned in free content updates after the game gets released.\nI'm going to give a small summary of the game modes:\n\nSugar Rush - A few candies (Always smaller by 1 of the current players. Ex. 4 Players, 3 candies) spawn in a random part of the map, and you have to get one as quickly as possible, otherwise the candies will be eaten by other players, and you'll die. To get to the candy, you can either use the routes through the map, or the various teleporters to get somewhere quicker, you kind of need to be strategic to know which path will be the shortest to the candy.\nChainsaw Backstab - You have a chainsaw and you need to backstab someone using it. If you hit someone else's chainsaw, both of them will fly towards a wall and you'll have to get it back. If you do it quickly, you can do it before the other player and be able to quickly stab them.\nVertigo - All of the platforms are falling, and you need to keep jumping on them to not touch the red death tiles on the bottom of the screen (There's a variation of the map where the whole map is surrounded by red death tiles) The longer the round goes on, the quicker the platforms will fall.\nColor Craze - Color as many tiles as you can in your color. If a player touches a tile which has already been colored, the color will be overrided with the one of that player. You need to be strategic in order to make a lot of the blocks the same color as yours.\nJump Shot - You get a shotgun which you have to use to shot the other players. But you can only shot when you're jumping, and your jumps are complete flips, so you have to get the timing right. Or just stand near a player and keep jumping and shooting and hoping for the best.\nCleanup Crew - The wall behind everyone is covered in color, and you have to clean as much as you can in order to win. You need to be strategic and take the best path in order to clean the most.\nBomb Tag - The Friendship Ruining Game.\nStomp - Jump on the head of another player in order to stomp them and kill them. Can't get much simpler than that.\nGhost Scare - You and the other players are transparent. The only way to know where the other players are is their steps GFX effect, and you need to scare them before you in order to win. You can actually scare someone here by taking an unexpected path, and scaring them.\nRocket Run - A rocket is chasing you, and will explode just a few short moments after you get close enough to it.. You have to use the gravity in order to get away from the rocket, or use the teleporters which is more riskier.\n\n\nAll of the gamemodes, as simple as they sound, are changing the way the game is played completely, and they're all completely fun, and guaranteed to ruin lots of friendships!\n\n\nAnother great addition to the game level up system. When you play an online game, or do the daily challenge, you get some experience points, and after you get a set amount of it, you level up and get a completely random item, it might be a gamemode, it might be a new character, maybe even a Pumpkin! If you play TF2, think about it this way: The Crates being opened without having to waste real money, and you not having to be disappointed that you got something bad which is worth less than 3 cents.\nAll of the items are tradable and marketable, so for example if you got a duplicate character, you can sell it on the market, or trade it with a friend for their pumpkin.\nThe LVL system is a really great thing, and gives yet another reason to play this wonderful game. The only negative of this in my opinion, is the EXP required to level up after reaching level 12. The amount of XP required after getting LV 12 is always 120, which is quite a lot. You need to play a match lasting 30 minutes to just level up a single time.\nIn Local Games, all Gamemodes are unlocked for the start, which is great for the players who don't like playing online, but only with real friends or family.\n\n\nMoD is also really easy to mod, depending on the thing you're doing. You can easily make a map with the Level Editor, create a new character using the provided resources. The game has already a few great mods at the moment of writing this, and it will only become better!\n\nThe developers of the game were actively taking user feedback, and changing things basing on them. In other words, Early Access done right.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: The game has a lot of various gamemodes where each changes the way you play completely, while keeping the base formula of "Move, or you will die" intact. The developers are nice and will put free content updates for the game, a nice level up system to get various characters and game modes, and it can guarantee a single thing: It will ruin friendships! :Djoe:\nI cannot recommend this enough, if you like playing party games, this one will be definitely perfect for you, and you'll definitely have lots of fun, and lost friendships!\nMy rating for this game is a 10/10.\n\n\nDid I mention this game might cause losing friendships?","January 21","true","38.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","0"

Your health bar will deplete as you stand still, so on top of trying to win the various party minigames, players will need to also constantly be moving to ward off an explosive death.\n\nMove or Die Game Features:\n\n·         4-Player Local/Online Multiplayer and Offline Practice Modes\nPlay as one of several outrageous characters on the couch with friends, online against people from around the world or battle devious bots offline.\n\n·         Game Modes Galore\nChoose from a huge and always increasing variety of hilarious game modes like Jump Shot, Chainsaw Backstab and Rocket Run, each with their own unique mechanics and level design.\n\n·         Easy-to-Learn, Fast-Paced Fun\nMove or die…literally. With not moving resulting in your character exploding and only 20 seconds per round, Move or Die is quick to pick up and incredibly fast-paced.\n\n·         Leveling-Up System\nAcquire crazy skins for your character and unlock new game modes as you squash your opponents online.\n\n·         Daily Challenges and Missions\nWork your way up the leader board and earn bonus XP by completing challenges and missions that change every 24 hours.\n\n·         Regular Content Updates\nNew content, including game modes, characters and new features will be added on a regular basis to keep Move or Die’s friendship-ruining-o-meter high.\n\n·         MOD Friendly and DRM Free\nBuild your own characters, game modes, mechanics, levels, soundtracks and more. Includes Steam Workshop support, as well as a super user-friendly level editor.\n\n·         DLC Free…Always\nEverything in the game can be unlocked for free, no paywalls. No B.S. Period.\n\n·         Striking Graphics and a Killer Soundtrack\nGet your blood pumping with vibrant 2D graphics, as well as a heart-thumping soundtrack by Jacob Lincke.\n\n·         Controller and Keyboard Support\nPlay with one or 4 controllers, a keyboard, a DDR pad…or…”Those Awesome Guys” even claim the guitar and drums from Guitar Hero will work. I think everyone will safely recommend a regular controller 😉\n\nOverall Likes and Dislikes:\n\nThe Good – The game is the epitome of fast-paced; even the music is high speed techno/electro-pop goodness. Some may argue whether it’s good or not, but the minigames are all just about 20-30 seconds long, and in very little time after that, you’ll be thrown right into your next game. But don’t worry, there is still a quick screen with instructions before you start your next minigame, allowing you some time to view what the purpose and Move or Die Instructions screencontrols are for the next minigame. And on that note, the controls are simple and easy. This is the kind of game that is easy to pick up and hard to put down. There is also an achievement system and daily challenges that Very fun, very fast, and kind of quirky. Also, free DLC for life and Mod-friendliness is a major plus.\n\nThe Bad – The minigames are very fun, but if you don’t plan on downloading new modded minigames (or if there’s not much in the way of future DLC), they will get kind of old fast. Multiplayer with friends/online could add to the replayability, but if you’re riding single-player, the minigames will be somewhat repetitive after you’ve played each one a few times. And while the mod-friendly attitude is a definite plus, the DKCgaming authors have determined that it doesn’t appear that players can use modded characters in online games… whether you created them yourself, or downloaded them from the Steam Workshop. After reaching out to Nicolae Berbece, the man behind “Those Awesome Guys” I have been informed that the decision to not include mods in online matches was made in order to protect the experiences of others. Berbece went on to say “if we were to allow mods online, there wouldn’t be anything stopping players from using “no-life-drain” or “win-instantly” mods. That being said, all mods work perfectly fine locally.” The mod process is semi-easy to start, but it certainly could have been made a little easier to publish the mods.\n\nScore:\n8 out of 10!\n\nMove or Die is incredibly fun, and the developers have made it easy to play such a fast-paced game, while still having the challenge that keeps you thirsty for victory. While the mod support could be streamlined a bit, it is still a feature that I personally believe bumps this game from a 7 out of 10 to an 8 out of 10. Creating mods will add freshness to the game for years to come. This game is definitely worth playing, and everyone should absolutely be sure to get your friends involved in it too, as you will create many frantic moments of scream-inducing joy!\n\nMove or Die will be released on January 21st, 2016 on Steam for PC, Linux, and Mac.

Also, if the host is losing and cares at all about his win ratio, he can just leave unscathed, no penalty and everyone else gets booted from the game with no XP. its quiet un-enjoyable to deal with, and it hasn't been worked on NEARLY as much as it should have been.

The fast-paced, ever-changing gamemodes makes every match a dynamic, refreshing experience, and combined with the interesting twist of this game (having to move or else your health depletes itself), it leads rounds to often result in goofy and hilarious outcomes. Plus, assuming you can get friends to join you like I did (in my case, I ended up making someone even more addicted to the game than I am xD), the rounds will constantly feel completely new and unique. Win or lose, with friends, it won't matter; the only thing you'll be able to do, in both cases, will always be to laugh.\n\nMove or Die is still early in its lifetime, it'll probably get much more gamemodes and features given time, yet even at this point, I would say it's already worth buying.","January 26","true","49.2"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","13","19","2","1"

The game is very easy to control when using a controller. Moving onto the game UI style, it is great, and well is simple. The graphics are basic of which make the game a small file size, but the game is still fun, and will not get repetitive for a long time. I enjoy playing this game and will continue to play it\n\nConsWhen trying to play and get better you may decide to go offline with bots, without the tutorial playing, but you make choke on the way of setting up the bots, luckily I had a friend that knows how to play the game to help me, but I am sure a small google search would give you your answer. Going towards the keyboard controls, the game is really hard to control if you are using a keyboard, you can learn, but I guess that you can learn...\n\nOverall reviewThis game is great fun, I was playing with Hackerman mi Fight face, and although I was bad it was fun, and I would play again. So make sure to buy it! It is around $14, so not that much, maybe too much for what it is, but it is worth it. I would say buy it! you can have some fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dastuke/recommended/323850/","Dastuke","Dastuke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dastuke/","361 products in account","Oh man writing a review for this game is honestly way too hard.... After watching a video of this game on youtube I was immediately interested and very quickly purchased and jumped into this game. The party aspect behind it is clever, the scoring is fair, the games fun, and the moving element unique enough to make it so you're always slightly distracted from the main goal of the current minigame as you need to keep moving and avoid jump spamming to keep yourself from exploding in a colorful splatter of paint on the board. As far as steam party games go, this is definitely a unique experience and definitely a fun game... but I still have a hard time recommending it, at least for its current price tag, as it is right now.\n\nWhile the game itself is a total blast, it feels unpolished in many aspects that have turned me off a bit... for starters connectivity is a huge issue in this game. I myself can join CSGO and tf2 servers with next to no lag, but this game always seems to struggle to connect with the other players in online. Many times I'll be running through a stage only to have my opponents freeze momentarily or go into its "ice skating" glitch. When the game starts "ice skating" the minigame will begin and the characters themselves won't be shown to move. Behind the scenes however all the other players are doing their own thing in a sort of limbo where you can't see them but they're more than capable of interacting with you, making certain games like trickshot, chainsaw backstab, blowback, bomb tag, and hat chase virtually impossible to win, as you're disadvantaged by the fact that you have literally no idea where the rest of the players are, resulting in you blindly wandering the stages hoping for the best and praying you're not screwed over. (video of said ice skating glitch here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CoTxFBvoGQ )\n\nNext, is the current state of the online game. Frequently I've looked online for a game only to have their be no servers up currently and no one to play with. Out of desperation I would then check the server list and see 8 open games, 3 of which were private lobbies and the other were random games with 2 other players. Often times you'll end up joining an open server only to be kicked by the host immediately as they're farming wins with a friend or the users were just unsure of how to set a password. Regardless you eventually join a game and the host doesn't kick you but then you wait a few more minutes as the host sits aimlessly unreadied either waiting for a 4th user, who may never come, or just being away from their screen. As you play through the game every 5 or so rounds maybe a user disconnects either due to a poor score, or poor connection, but then when you're finally within striking distance and 1 win away, the host can end the game, sending you back to the lobby, where you can both sit, without gaining any experience (as I've had this exact scenario happen around 4 times now)... With the game being new its understandable for their to be few players... however this is a huge problem when you consider all the current flaws of the game as it is now and the fact that the "bots" you can play with any time not only don't give experience, but struggle to even play through certain game modes as their intended (seriously I've never seen a bot survive more than 3 seconds in vertigo).\n\nNext lets discuss a few of the minigames...\n\nJump shot- A great concept but flawed in its execution, due to the fact that it has only one stage with health pads everywhere, users often times just spam jump as the whole "move or die" aspect is totally irrelevant. Users often camp the top platform and time out\n\nColor Craze- I like the concept and it definitely fits the game, but its easily my least favorite minigame. Strategies include running 3 blocks behind an opponent and wiping away all their progress or just getting the walls and ceilings and then trying to get the floor in the last minute.\n\nRocket Run- Very fun game type, teleporters allow for you to screw over your opponents. One of the funner game types Imo\n\nChainsaw Backstab- Once again not much to say here, it fits and its executed well.\n\nVertigo- Another really fun game type, the random spawning of platforms can often screw you and leave you in an inescapable place, and its impossible to play if you're ice skating, but I really enjoy this game type, very skill oriented.\n\nBlow Back- Fun "fighting like" game where you try to knockback your opponents into the death tiles. Once again few complaints aside from many of the "safe spots" users will try to camp where a single blowback will never put them in harms way.\n\nGhost scare- The concept is fun and interesting but not executed as well as I'd hope, the teleporters allow for you to screw over opponents almost right at the start of the game, and the cooldown on the scream can ♥♥♥♥ you over as sometimes you get a kill and an opponent will slide in as you're scream leaves you in endlag for another easy kill. Furthermore, users often just camp at the top for an easy win in time out.\n\nFizzle Floor- Love this game type, no complaints, moving on.\n\nCleanup Crew- Another good one, very fair, no real advantage, just clean up as much as you can.\n\nBomb Tag- God do I want to love this minigame, but I really have a hard time doing so. While its fun and fitting with 4 players, as soon as you get to the 1 on 1, I've found that whoever the bomb spawns on ends up getting screwed. It's just much harder to chase someone than to be chased and I find myself just missing an opponent nearly every time it spawns on me in 1 on 1.\n\nSugar Rush- Yeah this one sucks. Sorry. You spawn in a random spot of a labrynth of confusing paths with teleporters that I still haven't figured out and candy spawners scattered throughout. The Game effectively picks a random spawner and then spawns pieces of candy, one less than there are players. The winner is often chosen by whomever is lucky enough to be closest to the spawner that's chosen... But since that apparently wasn't terrible enough, the candy moves all over the stage through walls, so many times after racing to the spawner you'll get there just in time to watch the piece you just missed phase through a wall and land exactly where you were 5 seconds ago, right into the hands of an opponent. It's like a sadistic version of musical chairs.\n\nSpeed Run- This is a great game type and it rewards skill.... but I feel like it's trying to be much more complex than it actually is. There are different paths that activate traps that can slow your opponents or make them backtrack but these traps are easily avoidable, and while the game seems to have "safer" shortcuts, i've found these to be completely pointless as you barely have enough time to complete the course if you try any route aside from the most obvious one and it often turns into a cluster of 4 users all in the same 30 pixel area trying to finish the stage a fraction of a second faster than one another.\n\nHat Chase- Great concept, poor execution. The hats initial spawn point is random, so in many cases whoever it spawns closest to wins just because of how hard it can be to navigate the map and how big an advantage having the hat uncontested for the first 3 seconds of the game can be. It should spawn in the very middle of all 4 characters, making it as fair as possible from the start.\n\nFalling blocks- Great game time, no complaints, gradually gets tougher and rewards those who are willing to try to snake their way down to the lowest platform.\n\nStomp- I don't know if I've ever even played this one truthfully. I don't think it works online?\nAnd one universal complaint for all minigames... wayy to few maps... like 1 maybe 2 for each so everything gets to be very repetitive very quickly...\n\nTL;DR This is a fun game, and while I can't give a full recommendation right now, it's definitely worth checking out in the future/at a sale price.","January 25","true","8.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

What we have here is an awesome little party game that's quick and easy to pick up. Even if some of your friends aren't gamers they can easily learn and play it with you. I do recommend having friends to play with since trying to hop online and find a server can be a bit annoying though not impossible. About half the time I am quickly able to get into a game and the other half I either time out from searching or get kicked out of the ones I find. There's also not too many modes and I would like to see more variety with the maps, but players are able to mod and I am sure sooner than later we will see more variety from fellow gamers and the developers. I'm giving it a 4.5/5 and I can't wait to see all the different mods and skins.\n\nHave Fun Gamers!","January 23","true","6.0"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","20","35","3","0"

Controls aren't complicated and response is quick, the music and sound fx are really well done and I love how the beats synchronize with the levels.\n\nDevelopers are also awesome and really fun people to talk to, and they listen to what players say to make the playing experience even more fun than it already is. So I'm rooting the developerd and the game to be a huge success. :)","January 26, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LemonyPinkness/recommended/323850/","LemonyPinkness","LemonyPinkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LemonyPinkness/","55 products in account","Below is my review of Move Or Die as seen on MyGamer.com (http://www.mygamer.com/die-pc-review/)\n\nScore: 8.5\nBottom-Line: A blast.\n\nPositives:\n-Fast-paced, intuitive gameplay\n-Perfect party game\n-Easy to pick up, hard to master\n-Healthy online community\n-”Free DLC forever” and mod support\n\nNegatives:\n-Arguably a few bucks too expensive\n-Visually and architecturally repetitive stages\n\nMove or Die is a blast. It’s fast, hard fun at its simplest. A quick run down of movement controls at the title screen and you’re set to enter the 2D arena, party/playlist chaos. An evolution of Those Awesome Guys’ previous Newgrounds entry Concerned Joe, Move or Die is testament to the developers expertise in fast-paced, quick-fix gaming.\n\nThe basic premise is in the name. Keep your globby character in motion or he’ll explode. The rest plays out in a shuffle of various game modes, each of which has its own rules and mechanics. Bomb Tag rigs up one player with a bomb he must hand off before its timer’s up. Rock Run launches a guided missile toward a single player which can be guided into other players. Hat Chase places a single hat in the arena which players must wrestle to wear for longest. The rules are quickly but sufficiently summarized at the start of each of the current 14 modes. It’s incredibly intuitive with plenty of mechanical variables, like randomly placed death, jump, invisible, and teleport blocks, to keep you on your toes.\n\nWhile they all do their job of mixing things up, some game modes are better than others. Race, while a party-game staple, was definitely the weakest game mode, made so by its repetitive layout. The stage is well designed but lacks in excitement once its track’s been committed to memory: you can’t throw players curveballs once they know what to expect. This is made worse by the fact that environments don’t vary in texture or setting; it all takes place in sleek, laboratory-looking environments. While it wouldn’t wouldn’t have affected gameplay, I feel that varying environment skins to include, say, a jungle, desert, or snow level, would’ve added a pinch more flavor to the otherwise solid visuals. Both issues, however, might be a simple fix in the long run considering the developer’s promise of “free DLC forever” in the form of new game modes, maps, mechanics, and characters. In fact, The developer’s Patch Notes History page outlines previous additions and fixes while an Updates History page previews some of the content in the works. Furthermore, Steam Workshop functionality and an included level creator could help foster a creative community that outlives any developer support.\n\nThe current online community, partially remnants from the title’s days in Early Access, is strong and match-making quick. While in lobby, each player must add their preferred game modes to the match playlist to be shuffled between rounds. In my experience, no particular game modes seemed more popular than others so the roulette stayed nice and varied. Servers work great and seem rather forgiving of poor internet connections: I had to conduct my review using a weak connection yet never suffered heavy lag spells or felt like I was put at a disadvantage.\n\nYou start out with a handful of characters but quickly develop your roster through levelling up. Most characters feature playful designs, like the pug or skellington. (UPDATE: The zombie character does not in fact take two hits to kill as previously stated.) There currently isn’t a character creation mode but the roster is so large and visually amusing that I never missed one.\n\nWhile I have few qualms overall with Move Or Die, I do feel that the price of entry may be a touch too high though I guess it depends on how you value your play-time. For me, Move Or Die is most satisfying in 15-minute chunks, played during breaks, quickly before bed, etc. $14.99 is simply a little more than I’d prefer to spend for such casual play sessions. That isn’t to say that it’s a casual game; if you prefer long play-sessions to grind and hone your skills, the high skill-ceiling across the various game modes will keep you plenty busy. The one to four-player local capability makes for a perfect pick-up-and-play party game and may be worth the price in itself, featuring support for up to four controllers or two keyboards while completely playable on a single keyboard. The $40.00 4-pack available on Steam could also make for a sweet split, bringing it down to $10.00 per person if you can assemble a dedicated group.\n\nWhile most game modes aren't as outright violent as Duck Game, they do see goo-guys popping left and right. Competition is more of a focus on screwing the other players til they mess up and die, as opposed to directly killing them. I’d like to note that my issue with the price is only slight; I really feel like Move Or Die is only a few modes and maps away from becoming a must-buy.\n\nFast, fun, and satisfying; Move Or Die delivers with next to no filler. The emphasis on “fun” and transparency that Those Awesome Guys set at the core of the game’s promotion and PR, including a 24/7 broadcast of matches played exclusively by AI, seems sincere to me and really helped bolster my appreciation for the title. Consider the Daily Challenges, AI VS, Steam Leaderboards, and upcoming content updates and you’ll have plenty of reason to play today, tomorrow, and next year. Move Or Die is a blast.","March 12","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

I have been following this game for a while lately, but have finally decided to buy the full game, as I couldn't wait for it to come out of early access. The game is made by Those Awesome Guys (or TAG).\n\nIt is a 2D arcade-style game, built on the principal that if you don't move, you die. The game is very fast paced, and very fun to play. There are game modes, the newest being Sugar Rush; a race to get the candy first, ranging to Stomp, having to stamp on others.\n\nModding\nYou are encourage to modify the game, after all, it's initials are MoD! I made some changes to the speed of characters to make the AI bots really bad, as they are not programmed that way and otherwise are really hard to beat. I also changed some of the textures of the characters, making them look  different.\n\nMove or Die uses Bit Bucket to host it's game (although the repository is private) so bug reporting is an easy process. I have reported a couple of bugs already, as it is in early access. Me and my friends have had a great time battling to be the best at Move or Die, and I hope you will too!

So for me, as a game beginner, it was very easy to start playing. Especially the cute characters and coluful illustration is attractive.\nThe things I did not like are, if I want to play with people online, I cannot choose level. So often there were very good players and bad players like me. It would be much more fun if I could compete with people around same level.\nAlso it is a bit scarely and kinda unfriendly that team member start repeating 'ready' and  ' cancel' when I did not notice everyone else is ready. Wish there is a chat function or when everyone is ready, there is automatically sound which kindly tell me you should be ready soon.\nWhen I keep playing for hours, I honestly got tired of the same paturn. I think at this moment the sections are around 10 kinds, but maybe later some more new maps would be avaiable, then I would like to come back to play after some air change.\nI also noticed that if would be more fun and more entertaining if the characters talks or we could follow the gaidance, not only by reading and watching the screen, but some effective sound would be cool.\nI really like the map which we need to colur as much as possible because I feel like the game depends on not only the player's skill but also some luck. I had difficulty moving and jamping smoothly and lost many times, but this map helped me to cheer up by showing I also can win, even sometimes the other player's win number is over 300, compared to me it is very different level.","January 26","true","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I wanted to add something about the poor connections isssues and the lack of content. I am only a 13 year old person so I find it really disappointing when I get really excited for a game, save money for said game (and this can take me a while) and when it comes to buying it I really get P*SSED off when the game I was looking forward to is a pile of crap. PLEASe FIX THE CONNECTION ISSUES AND ADD MORE CONTENT!!!!\nSecondly, the leveling system is really bad I have been playing for 7.7 hours now and I am  level 10 I thought I would be a higher level but I have to finish a game (must be online) to gain exp and level up to get the stuff you want and half the time you get gamemodes (which should all be unlocked at the start) that you dont want when you just want some cool characters. As I said I am level 10 and out of the 9 levels I have gained 4 have been characters to of which have been the same. Another thing about the BS leveling system is I cannot earn exp when I play with A.I. bots so I have to look for online which takes ages to find one and half the time I find a host of a server or a group i either get kicked immediatly or the host is AFK. Rocket Run is a bit unfair, saying that the rocket chooses someone randomly would be wrong as once it was down to 2 players me and someone else and out of the about 10 rockets that were launched they were ALL aimed at me! And I was losing overall so it is not making it harder for players who are winning. I recommend waiting until this BS price is reduced or just not getting it until all issues are addressed (level system, online things, lack of content, rocket run and maybe players bein able to vote kick the host when he is AFK). overall at its current state at release I would give it a 3/10","February 13","false","8.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It's got a lot of good aspects to it and I was really excited to bring this out on one of our couch game nights but ultimately we didn't spend longer than 30 minutes on it. There's a few reasons for this but it boils down to Move or Die not leaving a great first impression.\n\nThe match picker is... not great. Please don't randomly choose from the list, or rather have an option to work through mini games sequentially, if you end up like we did with Rocket Run, Color Craze, Hat Chase and Cleanup Crew all in the same playlist you're playing back-to-back games of minimal skill, maximal luck mini games. This really drains enthuasism in a group of 4 players when "Move around a lot and hope for the best, maybe employ some tiny amount of strategy" is all you can really think about. It's really not fun, and once the bad impression is there it's hard to get out of it.\n\nSome games have good concepts but fall alittle flat on execution, Speed Run (where the first instinct is for all players to run right together, ending up in a cluster, one dies which causes their corpse or something to interact strangely collision wise and the other 3 players slow down, now their character isn't running as fast as it should and you die due to a change you had no control over.) Vertigo is incredibly unforgiving. Jump Shot you almost have no control over where your bullets go as your character rotates incredibly fast.\n\nI think Move or Die has a lot of potential, the love is clearly there and some of the concepts are spot on (Falling Blocks, Stomp, Fizzle Floor, Ghost Scare [nice.]) but when you have a party game you need to come out of the gates swinging, otherwise when one player out of a group of 4 starts to feel encumbered, the rest shortly will follow and the game is put away not long after.\n\nTo recap some of my thoughts:\n* Match picker needs options - "Randomise", "Sequential", "Losing player (total point score) choses next game", "Player 1 chooses." etc.\n* One-button gameplay is enticing but might also be limiting some great interactions, Ghost Scare could have a 2-second "hide my footsteps" button that could really bring out the mind games, Rocket Run might let you additional produce a shield to bounce the rocket off you.\n* Speed Run might need a look over, Vertigo might move alittle slower to begin with and ramp up, Jump Shot could have you rotate slower but add a 'dodge' button to compensate, etc.\n\n\nThat's just my opinion though, as an avid Mario Party and couch-party game fan Move or Die is just a little short of the mark for me. I'll definitely revisit it later on but for now it is what it is.","January 26","false","0.5"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","10","26","2","2"

He said that it was a great game (which it is) to play with friends. I tried to play once with my friend. I got like 45fps at high (which is not that bad for my computer) and then I changed it to low and I got 60 fps. It's not that bad, but my computer is way over the system requirements, so I don't understand that I only got 45fps at high. Maybe that's because the game isn't optimised?\n\nSo, here's a list of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n-The game is really fun to play with friends\n-lots of minigames\n-good community\n\n\nCons:\n\n-It lags (both FPS and ping)\n-there's a lot of minigames, but they're all too short and there's not enough for that kind of game\n-there's not a lot of people online\n-there's not enough  content, I feel like I am playing an alpha version\n-there's no double jumps (which is essential in these kind of games)\n\n\nSo yeah, it's up to you of you want this game, but let me tell you this: it's a fun game, it has great potential, but if you think that you won't rage because of the lags, you're wrong. They need to fix all kinds of things and add some features.\n\nI've only played 20 mins and I got bored of it already because of the bad connection (I got a good internet)\n\nThanks for reading my review!","January 26","false","0.3"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","5","16","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jables1986/recommended/323850/","Jables1986","Jables","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jables1986/","6 products in account","I have to say I was quite excited for this game to come out, being a fan of local couch competition as well as online play with friends.  This game has it all on paper, complete with grinding incentives and lots of potential for long replay value, customization and friend competition.  The trailer had me, hook, line and sinker, and it seems like everyone is giving this game rave reviews.  Honestly the game is great on paper, the graphics are great, the controls are simple and this game is easy to pick up.\n\nHere's the problem, This type of game hinges on 2 concepts:\n-Multiplayer competition with friends whether local or online\n-Tight engaging fast gameplay with variety\n\nUnfortunately the multiplayer is completely broken at the moment, you basically have to create or find a room and just sit there and wait.  The game isn't well populated so you'll end up in a room with a high lvl individual who will probably start the match with just you and some bots as he's probably been waiting for 20 minutes.\n\nOnce you finally get to play you get treated to extreme lag (unless you're host apparently) I'm on a solid wired connection and play games such as Brawlhalla with zero lag whatsoever.  It really pains me to say this but even if you can get past these gamebreaking issues, the gameplay itself is actually quite bland and unimaginative and very repetitive at the moment.  The devs are saying free DLC and sure there's the workshop I suppose, but a full game at release needs a variety of engaging minigames.  It's like buying Mario Party at full price and finding out that you only have 5 minigames for now but you're free to wait for the community to make some new ones...  The game claims variety but the minigames are all so similar in look and feel that you may as well be playing the same 20 second mini-game over and over again.\n\nThe graphics are nice IMO but the game suffered from performance issues and constant frame drops for me and my system is well past the purported system requirements. I have much more than 1 gig of ram and 512 mb of video memory.... These aren't even specific requirements and seem to be quite watered down for a game that clearly needs optimization and polish.  Either way I can't get this game to run at 60fps consistently and this game is all about split second controls.  I'd understand if the system requirements were honest but they're simply not or else I'd be getting a smooth experience with the video settings at near minimum.\n\nIn all honesty I bought the game, I messed with the gfx settings, played the tutorial, popped right into multiplayer (well after trying to find a server and all that), the experience was as listed above, I gave it a few tries, realized I was bored stiff and playing an alpha basically and requested a refund.\n\nI can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone as it's not complete.  I was testing the game for me and 4 friends because I was leery about this title.  The plan was to get a four pack basically and play together but the game simply isn't engaging enough to be local, and the online is broken.  Also I read in another review that apparently you do not progress or unlock anything in local, you must be online, but online is, once again, broken (didn't bother trying the local because we'd mostly be playing online anyways)\n\nSolid reccomendations:\nFor Online And Local: Brawlhalla (This one is free, online and local, with no lag, and they're still in beta)\nLocal only but omg buy a case of beer and invite 3 buddies over: Samurai Gunn (THIS IS THE LOCAL COUCH FRIENDSHIP RUINING GAME TRUST)\n\nTL/DR:  This game is great on paper, promises to deliver so much but is broken in it's present state.  It's in alpha.. early beta at best.  I really hate to bash on an indie title but at 15$, and claiming to be a fully released game? Nope.  If it's testing that's required early access was the route with an honest memo.  Especially if the multiplayer is the focus and local is an afterthought (ie you can't unlock anything unless you play online) then your multiplayer is expected to be smooth as butter and you're expected to have servers.  This game may be fun one day, but not today.\n\nParting words: I could MAYBE recommend this game for young children for local play.  At 15$ you'll have a cute colorful game that might get a few laughs.  If you have a family and game with your kids this might be worth considering, try it with steam refund policy with your kids and see if they like it.  If you're an adult looking for a party game to pwn your friends at Smash Bros style you'll most likely be let down and much better served with the two titles I suggested (one of which is free to play but not pay to win).  Note that this game was marketed as a party competition game for adults so I reviewed it as such and that this is just my opinion.  Honestly with steam's refund policy you can always just try it :)","January 28","false","0.4"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","4","14","0","1"

While the amount of gamemodes is pretty large, each multiplayer session only really has a handful of them since players pick the 2 or 3 they like the most and together and that makes for a much smaller pool of them for that session.\n\nhowever the maps really feel they're lacking in variety as there only seemed to be 1 for each game mode,  i think some had a second variation that i noticed but it felt too similar and still felt like it was the same map.  so each session just consisted of playing the same few chosen gamemodes repeatedly until all interest was drained.\n\n\nthe closest sort of comparison for this that comes to mind  is duck game,   while u dont switch game modes after every quick round, the layout of each map and the weapons available has a big impact on how u play each one.    the amount of levels it has is huge and all of them are in the playable pool for any session.\nso generally after a map has been played u wont be seeing it for a while,   whereas this game had me play the same one several times within a few minutes.  leaving me thinking "oh its this one again" with all my eagerness to play it drained away, rather than feeling excited and energetic about the round that was about to start","January 21","false","0.5"," 16 of 45 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","16","45","0","3"

I'd really enjoy playing the game more if it wasnt for some flaws that made me refund the game (for now).\nFirst of all it is the Rage Quitters. I understand why some people do that, but out of 7 Online games I played with people 4 times it ended because someone quitted. (All those 4 times shortly before I would've won)\nSo those game neither gave EXP nor any reward.\nSecondly it is the matchmaking. I didn't play a lot, and when being Lvl 2-3 I got matched against Lvl 30+ that had a lot of experience in the game and (checked their Steam profiles) some had over 40 hours. How am I meant to defeat others in those random modes if they all played the modes hundred times oftener than me? I won randomly, but would've wished for me being matched against equally bad/undexperienced players.\nAnd I know I could've played against AI, yet I don't get any EXP/Rewards for AI games, so there are no sense in playing that.\nI'd rather suck Online and improve there than winning against AI bots and getting NOTHING from that.\n\nThe game itself is great, and if you have friends to play with it is even better. For me it wasnt what I imagined.\nALSO HOW DO I NOT A SINGLE TIME GET TO CHOOSE A MODIFIER IN 25 TIMES A MODIFIER WAS CHOSEN","May 1","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just for two and a half reasons.\n\n1) No exp if you play offline. So you can’t level up and can’t get new characters. The only way to get exp is by playing with online people (probably people you don’t know) or playing the solo challenges. So, why a game so fun, about playing with your friends that have great characters, have this limitation?\n2) The online connection is..well not so good. So again, cant progress playing with friends, cant progress playing with online people and the only way is with online solo challenges. So what’s the point?\n3) Moar minigames and characters! It have enough by now. But more will be awesome.\n\nAnd that is. The game is really good, but it have to improve/correct those things.

Four pack (or single pack with couch co-op) with friends is a fast-paced blast.  You'll yell, you'll laugh, you'll possibly curse.\n\nDepending on how much you like party games, you can debate if it's worth full price.  It succeeds at what it aims to do and well have you laughing (and cursing) at your friends.\n\nThe potential "or not" argument is based on pricing of other party games (esp. if they are on sale).\n\n+ Lots of fun, with a possible side of cursing at your friends.\n\n- Mods are only available in offline matches.\n\n- Connections are peer-to-peer only. But I've had fewer issues here than with first party Nintendo titles.\n\n? Certain character models and modes have to be unlocked.\n\nMove or Die was well worth singing "I'm a little Teacup" on my third party voice chat in order to get my friend to gift me the last copy in his four pack : )","February 26","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The objective is to survive till the end of each round, though rules differ every game. Its one of the best party games out there for sure. The characters are really cute and most game modes are fun to play. And winning any round gives its own kind of satisfaction.\n\nThere are only two downsides to this game but they are easily fixable I feel:\n1.There aren't enough players online. You can rarely find a game to play with random players over the internet and usually cannot find a party of 4. This can be solved if you got many friends who buy this game as well, so that you get a full party to play with. Also the peer-to-peer connection might be a problem for various reasons.\n2.They haven't introduced too much content since the initial release. The games are pretty fun. But they tend to get repetitive. The workshop has been kind of creative but those contents aren't allowed in online game. They should be able to fix this as making character models and game modes for this game isn't as difficult as the high end games.\n\nBut looking past the cons I would definitely recommend you to buy this game if you have a few friends willing to buy a copy for themselves as well. I bought a 4-pack for me and my friends and I don't regret it.\nGood Day.","February 9","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No doubt for this point.\n4.Free degree is no bad. The developer encourage player make them own mods and accept the language version which made up from players like Chinese version.

Seeing as matchmaking is slightly unreliable it's important to have a person or group of people (online or off) that you can play with.\n\nIn terms of gameplay , MoD is akin to Pacman in the sense that nearly anyone can play this game. It's a game with a variety of simple premises, and it's very easy to just pick up and play any of the gamemodes regardless of experience level. It's a great party game if only becuase it's so accessable.\n\nFor content the game has a lot to offer. There are a total of 14 gamemodes and a slew of characters to unlock. The game comes with a variety of maps for each of the gamemodes. This content doesn't even begin to touch mods which are currently getting a lot of workshop support. All of these unlockables come from the level system which just rewards you for participating in daily challenges, different goals and just regular online play.\n\nThis game is great, and apart from some latency issues it runs smoothly.

Four pack (or single pack with couch co-op) with friends is a fast-paced blast.  You'll yell, you'll laugh, you'll possibly curse.\n\nDepending on how much you like party games, you can debate if it's worth full price.  It succeeds at what it aims to do and well have you laughing (and cursing) at your friends.\n\nThe potential "or not" argument is based on pricing of other party games (esp. if they are on sale).\n\n+ Lots of fun, with a possible side of cursing at your friends.\n\n- Mods are only available in offline matches.\n\n- Connections are peer-to-peer only.

I was decieved into thinking this was a good game but with all the conenction issues, and lack of players it's really boring and you find the same people over and over again. I wouldn't get it now and would reccomend getting it on a sale or if you get it with your friends.","February 18","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game consistently refuses to properly shut down despite re-installing the game twice. Needing to win a round before being able to win, despite receiving points fo second and third place at any other moment is inane- probably a reason why basically no other game practices that.  Movement and jumping feels innacurate, leading to a lot of colliding with the very end of a corner. Handles latency worst than literally every other game in my collection.\n\nI understand why people would enjoy this- but I absolutely did not. Because the game wouldn't close, my play time ran up and I am no longer able to refund it. Sadface.","February 27","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must write one.. It's amazing\n\nThe game is really fast and look away from the screen for one second.. You are dead.\n\nSo let's begin about the main idea of the game: Move Or Die.\nIf you don't move, your health goes down, jumping doesn't count. Stand too long or jump too much, you die. Really simple, but what makes it hilarious is, when you don't have space to move! That's when it gets fun.\n\nLet's move to gamemodes, the thing that makes moving or dying harder.\nThere are some amazing gamemods to this game and I gotta say, they are hilarious (And crazy!). One of my many favourites is Hat Chase, where players run after a flying hat. Who keeps the hat longest on their head, wins. More gamemodes are unlocked the more you play, so keep chasing those hats!\n\nMutators!\nGame chanching things that really annoy people! Once in a while the game let's one player choose a mutator! The mutator can for an example, constantly change players skins, make the lights go out, make the game "Move And Die" and many others. Mutators are also one great reason to hate your friends!\n\nOverall, the game is great and crazy, you will never sleep again after this","March 25","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I literally tried everything, I uninstalled/reinstalled it, I went on Youtube for tutorials, I messed with the resolution and nothing worked so sadly ima have to give a negitive review of this game, and honestly Ima get a refund.Also this cannot be blamed for my computer, I have a windows 7 premium which passed all your requirements perfectly, this is on you devs. Anyway I hope anyone else who is reading this, that your copy of this game works.

Plenty of chances to win as well without needing too much skill.\nThe rounds are quick and keeps the game going strong for hours of gameplay.\n\nThe solo play is not as good. The AI bots are great competitors, but if you wanted to just get some experience points, you must play online. So without many people playing the game right now, unless you have friends playing it or know groups that might be playing online and accept random people, you won't have any chance to gain exp online, except in the daily challenge which is once a day.\n\nFor a group game, I highly reccomend it.\nFor solo play, it's fun to muck around though might get a touch boring against the AI so definitely invite friends along to play this game.","February 10","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it still goes beyond my common nature to not stand still when I’m safe in a platforming versus game. I will admit that that was exactly what happened the first time I played. I entered a round called Bomb Tag against three other people. I had managed to “hot potato” the bomb away from myself and it seemed like the other three were very content with passing it back and forth between each other. I was fine with that too and then it was down to myself and the last guy. I was on the opposite side of the screen and got to the highest perch in the level. Knowing he didn’t have enough time to get to me, I sat back and laughed at my all-to inevitable victory… and then I lost. I exploded because I stopped moving. I then face-palmed myself because that is what the whole point (and name if you didn’t catch it) of the game.\n\nI believe the worst part of all of this was that I was showing the game off to some friends and explaining how you play when this happened. The game doesn’t stop there though. While you may lose health if you stand still, you also can’t get health back when jumping. You still need to obey the laws of the levels too! The modes/levels switch up every round… unless someone just picks a single mode over and over again, but that shouldn’t happen very often (unless someone is achievement hunting or that coworker that just didn’t understand level selection).\n\nUp to four people can play this and I’ll admit that it is fun online to play with random strangers. It truly is. Unless it’s only against one other person and they just keep beating you hands down. That actually sucks pretty bad and stops being fun rather quickly. Like most games, the close matches are the most exciting. Move or Die is no exception here. However, they don’t call this “the friendship ruining game” for nothing. Move or Die was the most fun when I played it locally with my buds. “That makes sense” you’ll say, but I have no doubt that some people will look at this game and think, “there won’t be enough people online to make this fun.” To that I say “Rubbish!” Pick this game up and play with friends… and then lose them because that’s the nature of the game because as we all know, you can’t make an omelette without destroying a forest.\n\nScore: Tasty!\n\nWith friendships to be ruined, crazy-frantic fun to be had and chainsaws to be fought with (yeh, that’s a real mode) Move or Die should be picked up by everyone that likes to have fun. That said, if you don’t like fun, you’ll probably want to steer clear of Move or Die. It controls super smoothly, there are plenty of game modes to love and hate (freak’n Rocket Chase or whatever the junk that mode is called) and there are plenty of things to unlock. Play for a few minutes. Play for an hour. Just play Move or Die, you won’t regret it! Unless you have a crappy netbook, don’t pick this up with 1gb of Ram on a junker of a netbook… it doesn’t work so well even with local play. Everything else is awesome!","January 22","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other minor game bugs and glitches that im sure will be fixed in future update but until then i would say 4 out of 5 stars and would reccomend this if you have a group of friends and nothing to do its a great game.","April 16","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The objective is to survive till the end of each round, though rules differ every game. Its one of the best party games out there for sure. The characters are really cute and most game modes are fun to play. And winning any round gives its own kind of satisfaction.\n\nThere are only two downsides to this game but they are easily fixable I feel:\n1.There aren't enough players online. You can rarely find a game to play with random players over the internet and usually cannot find a party of 4. This can be solved if you got many friends who buy this game as well, so that you get a full party to play with. Also the peer-to-peer connection might be a problem for various reasons.\n2.They haven't introduced too much content since the initial release. The games are pretty fun. But they tend to get repetitive. The workshop has been kind of creative but those contents aren't allowed in online game. They should be able to fix this as making character models and game modes for this game isn't as difficult as the high end games.\n\nBut looking past the cons I would definitely recommend you to buy this game if you have a few friends willing to buy a copy for themselves as well. I bought a 4-pack for me and my friends and I don't regret it.\nGood Day.","February 9","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd really enjoy playing the game more if it wasnt for some flaws that made me refund the game (for now).\nFirst of all it is the Rage Quitters. I understand why some people do that, but out of 7 Online games I played with people 4 times it ended because someone quitted. (All those 4 times shortly before I would've won)\nSo those game neither gave EXP nor any reward.\nSecondly it is the matchmaking. I didn't play a lot, and when being Lvl 2-3 I got matched against Lvl 30+ that had a lot of experience in the game and (checked their Steam profiles) some had over 40 hours. How am I meant to defeat others in those random modes if they all played the modes hundred times oftener than me? I won randomly, but would've wished for me being matched against equally bad/undexperienced players.\nAnd I know I could've played against AI, yet I don't get any EXP/Rewards for AI games, so there are no sense in playing that.\nI'd rather suck Online and improve there than winning against AI bots and getting NOTHING from that.\n\nThe game itself is great, and if you have friends to play with it is even better. For me it wasnt what I imagined.\nALSO HOW DO I NOT A SINGLE TIME GET TO CHOOSE A MODIFIER IN 25 TIMES A MODIFIER WAS CHOSEN","May 1","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I get why a lot of People loves this Game, and I would be happy if I could too, but there are a few things that kills it for me:\n\n1.) No XP when you play local. Thats really sad, because that means I have to play online with some randoms to unlock some more Characters. But because we didn't want to play with randoms, we had to keep playing with the 3 we had. I want to note Brawlhalla here, where you still earn Gold if you play local to buy new Heroes.\n\n2.) Ok, so after a while we tried to unlock some things and wanted to play online.  So I created a room, just to notice that no one of my friends can join. This means that everyone of them have to be on there Computer and have to buy the Game for themselves to be able to play with me AND unlock things. That's really bad... I want to note here Brawlhalla too. There you can play with e.g. 2 Players on one machine with 2 other random Guys on the Internet.\n\n\nSo we had to play local, without unlocking anything.\nAnother Problem is the (at least now) poor variety of Maps. It get boring rather fast after playing for ~an hour.\n\n\nWould love the Game if the Things mentioned get changed. Until then, I will keep it on my Wichlist, with hopes high!\n\nUpdate:\n\nOk Guys, I have to confess that my Brawlhalla statements were wrong. I somehow confused that in my head.\nBut whatever, Move or Die got some nice Updates now.\nAnd one of these Updates made it possible to play online with local Players! Thats just brutal! Now we can play with 3 People, and with one Online Player (and there are plenty) to unlock things!\n\nThumps up.","January 24","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","9"
