The game ranges from a cockpit space shooter, obstacle course, and light gun game where you control a Rebel through a Star Wars story exclusive to this game. The game plays great on modern computers, and it runs out of the box with both games. I reccomend Rebel Assault 2 since it has more adventure and gameplay features that you would be expecting.\n\nMy cons are that the obstacle course with the space craft is SOOOO buggy without a physical joystick. You NEED a joystick, the mouse emulation is close to impossible to use and enjoy fully. Get a classy joystick if you wanna fully enjoy.\n\n\n\nVerdit: Buy it/11","April 27","true","0.2"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","25","27","2","0"

I love Rebel Assault 2 and will always love it, but if you never played these games twenty years ago, spare yourself.\n\nThe gameplay is criminally substandard in both games and they were marketed based on how mind blowing the visuals and the presentation were for a video game. The "movie like presentation" is no longer impressive given the video and audio compression, plus all the 90s cgi. It's a pretty corny game. (although that may appeal to some)\n\nEach game consists of levels which can be categorized into reflex cursor action, cover shooting, or vehicle based obstical avoidance. If you have an itch for any of those, this game is the last thing you should scratch it with.","May 3","false","2.3"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","36","50","4","0"

I played these games back in the day (probably mid 90's) when I was young. RA2 was the first game that I completed to the end, and I remember being quite proud of it!\n\nThe Steam + Dosbox port works quite well, even on Win 10. I had no errors or glitches of any kind. The audio can get a bit messy, but that is a limitation of the technology at the time, so it gets excused in my book.\n\nIf you want to see what Starwars games were like before 3D rendering, or you played these when they were released, these would make an excellent addition to any Starwars collection!","May 3","true","2.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

I was so wrong.  The controls make this game unplayable.  I only tried out RA2, not RA1, so I can't speak to that particular game, though I imagine the problems are similar.  If I use a mouse, it makes the first-person rail shooting sections easy enough to aim and fire with, which admittedly is pretty nice.  However, on any sort of third-person flight level (like the first half of Mission 3 in RA2), the mouse is too slow to respond and you crash into almost everything.  I switched to my Logitech controller to use its joystick, and the opposite problem occurred.  The control became way too sensitive.  I started weaving and zig-zagging like a drunken pilot, and I *still* crashed into everything, though not quite as much as before.  But on the second half of Mission 3, it switches back to first person, and the joystick is AWFUL for aiming.  Since you can't switch from joystick to mouse mid-level, that meant Mission 3 was going to be nigh unbeatable for me, so I just threw my hands up and asked for a refund.  What a disappointment.","May 6","false","0.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

If you're a nostalgia sucker than this is 100% for you. That's why I bought these.\n\nBut if you have any gameplay expectations, stop right here. The game has some extremely unreasonably difficult parts, wherein targets are literally not reachable by your cursor and you will take assinine amounts of damage. In other parts which integrate both a shooting and flying mechanic, you have to choose between shooting at the enemy chipping away at your health or not blatantly smashing into a wall since drifting your reticle to take a shot will involve shifting too far in one direction. The controls are also very twitchy in certain sections and collision detection is pretty wonky by modern standards. That and the flying controls wobble like you're the drunkest Rebel this side of Corelia.\n\nSarcastic 10/10.\n\nHonestly more like 5/10 with a +5 bonus if you've got nostalgia.","May 6","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
