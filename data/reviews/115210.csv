For its time the graphics and gameplay are amazing. The different civilizations you can play require different kinds of skill levels. Though it can sometimes feel like the game is a bit unbalanced. (Britons fight with guns and mounted musketeers, Aztecs fight with bows and spears). By having the opportunity to mass up a huge army of spearmen as a native American against a Briton that can only have a limited amount of musketeers, you can still fight quite a fair battle. The campaigns are also really well made. The maps look absolutely beautiful and the kind of strategy you'll have to apply to each campaign can get you some more variety than just a random map game. There's definitely plenty of stuff left for you to find out when you'll start playing this game. You're going to love it if you're into strategy games (like me ^^).","December 10, 2013","true","94.7"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","50","53","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redfiveHQ/recommended/115210/","redfiveHQ","RedFiveO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redfiveHQ/","49 products in account","Really achieves a realistic feel for the weaponry, making the European gunpowder units have to reload every shot while the natives can just hammer away with bows, spears, slings and even blow darts. It evens the playing field with the powerful artillary and cavarly of the Europeans, combined with powerful ranged attacks to counter the native size advantage. That being said, it also requires you you always have peasants gathering to support your military. The editor allows you to simply go ahead without any worry and just cause massive death and destruction in any terrain you could think of. In short, this game allows you not only to play as God, it allows you to bombard the hell outta a few native warriors. It combines military fun and destruction with resource managing and the all great Empire building. You'll love this just so you can blow up that fort your neighbor spent so much time and resources putting up in the first place.","December 16, 2013","true","26.7"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

The campaigns are SUPER long which adds for an even better gameplay experience. If you ever beat the campaigns there is always the amazing random map gamemode which is basically a sandbox. Also, even the fact you can assign men to regiments with an Officer, Drummer, and even a Standard Bearer drove me insane because of how awesome it was!

The reason I given a negative review is that it is poorly integrated for new pc's. The game will crash randomly and video options are not avaliable for me. The game's speed is abnormal and its like its default pace is ultra and when I try to change its speed it crashes. I start up a game it crashes, I cannot do much without destroying the game and having to start-up again. Unless you use steam on a computer from 2001 with a poor resolution and GPU don't buy this game.

Scary good. as in, like, thousands or quite angry native americans running at you with pointy sticks good. If you're afraid of gratuitous amounts of humans and empire building, do not play this. You might get smothered by their corpses. It's almost like Hoarders... but with people and buildings.\n\nThe only complaints I have against the game are, as follows:\n\n-It's a tad unstable and prone to crashing. It COULD completely disown your computer and refuse to run on certain modes and speeds.\n\n-Lack of a solid multiplayer system. The multiplayer system they HAVE is confusing and doesn't work, even with hamachi. Your best bet is using something like Gameranger.\n\nApart from that, pretty good quality stuff for $4.99.\n\nWARNING: small chunks of charred flesh, not suitable for children under 3 years of age.\n\nP.S starving is bad.

Subsequently that means that:\n\n1. No food: Your soldiers and ppl will starve to death\n2. No coal and iron: European ships and units that use pistols and muskets can not fire!!!!\n3. No gold: certain unit types (mostly mercenaries) will rebell attack any faction\n4. No wood and stone: obviously you can`t build.\n\nCutting of the enemies supply of these materials can be a vital key to success.\n\n- several historical campaigns\n- 7 player skirmish or multiplayer matches (It is possible to get a population between 2000-3000 persons per faction: 14.000 units in one match!!!1)\n\n- Naval and land combat.\n- extensive training and tech trees per faction.\n- Buildings cannot be destroyed by simply hammering on it with a sword like in some other real time strategie games\nThey must be destroyed with cannons or fire-arrows\n- Innovative city combat: it is possible to put units in any building. they will shoot (bullets or arrows) out of these buildings. Sending units into enemy buildings will get them fighting inside to take over the building.\n- damaged/burning buildings will slowly lose HP.\n- Moral system: Units are susceptible to fear. Especially if they get attacked from the rear or the flanlk. They will start running back to the base.\n- Formations increase moral, power etc.\n- there are independent indian tribes which can be persuaded to join your side and deliver scouts and troops or trade with you.\n\nCon's:\n\n- Can be overwhelming\n-City warfare: Innovative but does not work as good as it should. AI and other players use the del button to explode the buildings they are about to lose. Meaning that your soldiers inside die!!! Furthermore for every building you take the Ai builds another on the other side of the city. This can create an terrible drag and prolongs the fight unnecessary. On top of that in order to take over buildings the formations get dissolved automatically, causing the soldiers to flee quicker.\n- As the point above (City Warfare) is the final stage of every match, which can become very annoying, it dimishes the overall game experience.\n- Population cap: It's cool to be able to have so many units. However the result is that it is nearly impossible to have a good overview of what is going on. Fleeing and fighting units run between each other turning the battlefield into chaos.\nA further problem is that it makes it possible to run over the enemy using numbers alone (except in the city), strategy is hardly needed or, considering the numbers, impossible to execute.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAmerican Conquest is a game that is worth experiencing for Strategy gamers that like the more traditional RTS games like AoE and EmEa. Despite the Con's it is an innovative, fun game.","March 5, 2015","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It seems to be too old and chaotic for me. Small icons and units, require patience. In my few minutes I didn't met bugs, it starts with huge speed, but you can change it from settings. (I played it on Win7pro)\nIt should be remade for modern ecpectations, but would be easier to make a uniqe new game..","November 2, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

Oh god was i wrong. start it up, start a random map. The cursor flew around at like a hundred miles per hour. thing was warped speed from space balls. so i go to the settings. who in their right mind puts default cursor speed to max.  so i tried changing it and the game crashes. i spent like 30 minutes, patiance ran out and i was cussing up a hurricane katrina part two. id rather spend $5 on an asian prostitue with herpes than this game.","May 11, 2014","false","0.4"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","2"
