But it doesn't look or even at first blush play like solitaire, so I want to explain why the analogy works for me:\n\nIn solitaire, you have the same 52 cards, arranged in such a way that their order is different, so sometimes you might get snuffed out early by an unlucky deal, and sometimes you might fly through for victory - you don't really mind which, because games don't take long so the stakes never feel so high that you'll never play it again.\n\nWeird Worlds shares some of this in common. The star system is filled with mostly the same items and hazards, but the order you encounter them switches out, so in one play through you might have exactly the item you need to best deal with an encounter, and another time you might not.\n\nThis means that a lot of it is luck based, but half the fun is replaying the game and seeing where luck will take your exploration of the galaxy this time.\n\nThat's not to say it's all luck - fitting out your ships with the best gear takes a bit of decision making, and it's possible to learn the function of special objects to understand whether they're worthless and tradable, or could come in handy. Plus the real time combat segments are basic, but reward people who avoid combat before becoming sufficiently tooled up.\n\nOccasionally, too, the game likes to switch things up by layering a 'meta' plot, usually difficult to resolve, above the usual exploration. Some sort of crisis which the player must solve in order to score a 'win.' These are rare, but always welcome.\n\nLike Solitaire, this is an ideal game to kill a short space of time with, but better than solitaire, it rewards repeat play with just a modicum of depth to be discovered beneath the surface.","October 9, 2014","true","11.2"," 73 of 85 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","73","85","0","1"

I enjoy the space opera, exploring, seeing new things but htis game just doesn't scratch that itch.  Here's a brief breakdown.\n\nPROS:\n1) it's a short and sweet game.  Want to blow a little time?  Here you go\n2) Easy to pick up, easy to 'master'\n3) There's fun to be had!  Explore space, meet new things, see how you do.\n\nCONS:\n1) It's -short-, as in after less than 3 hours I'm seeing nothing but repeats of things I've seen 3-4 times already\n2) Combat is rather dull and straightforward, rarely get any chance to try any tactics\n3) perhaps too easy to pick up and to master, I don't feel like there's anything below the surface I scratched 3 hrs in\n4) Far too much of your score and your game seems entirely dependant on the RNG at universe creation\n\nAll in all I wouldn't reccomend it.  I'd been watching it for a while and it looked up my alley but despite getting it with another bundle (so there's no buyer's regret, I bought the bundle for a different game) I'm still rather disappointed with how this turned out.  I hope the creators go on to make a more interesting, expansive 'infinite space' type game.","October 21, 2014","false","2.7"," 75 of 112 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","75","112","0","0"

Play this game if you want to level up your procrastination badge.\n\nWhile ‘The Binding of Isaac’ is pressure-inducing, morally complex, and fast paced with severe depth,  ‘Weird Worlds: The Return to infinite space’ is relaxing, gentle and well circumscribed, the perfect depth for what is promised; a Short break time game permitting escape from the dull beat of the work drum.\n\nDo not read a single FAQ for this game - just enjoy exploring through trial and error. Player skill is increased through successive rounds. Random elements are introduced as the game progresses, so playing the 30 minute version is more interesting than the 20 or 10 minute versions. I wish there was a 60 minute version XD\n\nNegative comments by others include that random generation may produce unfavorable layouts of the universe. The flip side is that at some point your knowledge and experience can negate the random effects and create advantages.\n\nAll you need to know:\n1. Explore more of the universe by upgrading the FTL drives and navigation computer and avoid getting sucked into a blackhole.\n2. Be a space pirate. Upgrade your weapons and thrusters and hire mercenaries.\n3. Trade. Alien races will keep you guessing and are the gateway to mercantile opportunities. Trade is organized to facilitate the game and wealth accrual is secondary.\n4. Comparing items (thrusters, shields ect) is straightforward and comes down to the coin values (1-5).\n5. Experimenting with bizarre artifacts will uncover favorable secrets.\n\nPlay this game if you want space exploration with modest effort into depth and prefer short 30 minute conclusions, or\n\nPlay this game if you have never played a rogue-like; it is the perfect gentle introduction to the rogue-like genre in a 2D Space exploration format.\n\nNov 2015\n\nPS The spiritual and logical successor to this game - Infinite Space 3: Sea of Stars - was just released a month ago….

It's a turn-based "board game", with play sessions lasting from ten to thirty minutes, depending on whether you die early or play to the end.\n\nBasically, you pick a "class", which determines your starting gear and the value of given items (Military players will want to collect weapons and tech, Scientists will want samples of alien lifeforms with a secondary emphasis on tech, and Pirates will focus on "treasures", mostly consisting of otherwise useless sulptures and shiny things).\n\nThe endgame score is equal parts skill and luck. You'll need to figure out what does what, and you'll need to be lucky enough to find things to do the things that do things. (Hint: Smash the Timeless Bauble and type "Nova Cannon" or "Hyperdrive", depending on which you don't have yet.)\n\nEvery so often, the game board will spawn with one of three "Major" random events. To beat these, you'll need to either look up a game guide, or try your hand at trial and error.\n\nBy the time you've got things figured out, you'll really only be playing this game to try to beat your last score. This is the primary charm of the game. "Oh neat! I found this really valuable thing really early on in the game! I sure do feel lucky!". The parts of the game that require skill are equally emotionally-rewarding. "Wow! I can't believe I vapourised an entire Urluquai armada!"\n\nFor $10, you really can't go wrong for something that'll always be in your library whenever you need to kill ten minutes.

The concept is simple, but is very addictive as you scour the galaxy with your ragtag fleet of ships, destroying all in your way! Or, picking up a 4th dimensional piece of space-art to sell at the space-market.\n\nSo, the game boils down to this: You're given a set amount of in-game months to explor the universe, returning to the earth-equivelant to get a score. The score is based on the events you've seen, planets visited, people, cargo, battles, and ships. These are all tracked against your playthroughs. This creates a very compelling environment, seeing as one playthrough can be completed in the time it would take to eat a sandwich and chips.\n\nThe bulk of the game is spent exploring the galaxy, divided into segments that are color coded. Each planet can have one of a few things. As you travel from planet to planet, in-game months will pass. The exploration is fun, due to the game's sense of humor and cartoon art style, and it's a joy etting high tier items.\n\nThe combat isn't the game's strong point. Depending on the planet you visit, you may choose to engage in battle. Your ships and their equipment are displayed against the enemy forces. You have to individually turn ships to make their weapons point the right direction, and command your ships to more or halt or escort. It's not horrible, but it's certainly annoying having a ship destroyed just because you didn't turn it correctly.\n\nOverall, i'd really reccomend this game. It's an underated classic that is well worth the price of admission, if you can stand the occasional annoyance.","November 26, 2013","true","3.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Its a short and sweet game good for 5 minute plays allow for multiple plays within a 30min-1hr period but still challenging enough to keep you coming back for more.\n\nPick it up for a buck,buy it full price, or buy it in a bundle.Either way worth if for a quicky.","August 4, 2014","true","3.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

On one hand the gameplay is based around that of a rougelike, with all the hardcore aspects like permadeath and randomized maps. On the other, it's built around the idea of 10-30 minute playthroughs making the execution feel almost geared towards a casual crowd. Yet this is not a casual game, nor would it be fair to say it is a hardcore game. It is a compilation of the two, trying to strike a balance and for the most part, coming out alright in the end.\n\nWeird Worlds pits you as a spaceship captain out to explore the great unknown on a 10-30 year mission at the end of which you are awarded points based on your accomplishments and how much loot you manage to bring back. That is not to say that making it back is a guarantee, falling prey to hostile aliens and black holes is just as common if not more so.\n\nMost of the game is spent in this galaxy view, you direct your ship to fly towards a planet and upon arrival is hit by a random event, you might run into a shop, a free item, friendly aliens or hostile aliens or many other things. As you progress through the game you slowly upgrade your ship with newfound items getting better engines, scanners and weapons and even occasionally added on a wingman to your entourage who is equally as customizable as your own ship.\n\nShould misfortune strike and you encounter hostile aliens you are transported into a 2D battlefield where your ships do battle, your actions are limited to tell your ships where to go and who to attack and if you're lucky enough to have found any one shot ability items you get to activate those too in here. The battles are unfortunately fairly lackluster and you can do little to influence the outcome once you are committed, the only real decider being the equipment you have managed to scavenge so far.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest flaws of Infinite Worlds is also the reason for it's longevity. The randomness of the game might make every playthrough a little unique but it might also mean you run into the highest tier engine on the first planet you visit making this particular go-round a sure success whereas other times your first trip away from home will be to a soon to be supernova explosion.\n\nAll in all Weird Worlds manages to make a decent experience by combining the casual and the hardcore, in many ways it becomes sort of a solitaire for the Sci-fi inclined. A good way to waste 20 minutes every once in a while when you have nothing else to do.","June 3, 2013","true","20.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

For a 2005 game, this is a pretty decent rouge-like space exploration and combat adventure game. After playing FTL quite a bit, it's pretty obvious where FTL got a lot of its ideas from. Much of the gameplay is very similar although the combat of Weird Worlds is overly complicated. It's kind of like SPAZ combat in some respects, but without the intuitiveness. The game does provide a combat simulator that allows you to practice as needed, but to win it's more about what equipment you  have as opposed to using any real strategy.\n\nWeird Worlds biggest shortcoming is the lack of a proper reward system since you don't really have to earn anything. You just take items as you find them or if you find the right trader you can exchange some cheap trash for the best equipment in the game. Also you are not forced into combat and can retreat anytime. Where FTL creates an environment of urgency, Weird Worlds creates an environment of casualness and I'm not sure casualness and rogue-like is a winning combination. Essentially you are given a specific amount of time to explore and collect as much loot as possible and eventually get killed or retire and get a score based on several factors.\n\nThe randomness makes it fun from an exploratory perspective, but it's not really a game that captivates for replayability.","July 29, 2013","true","4.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

For the majority of the game, you will be flying to different star systems, picking up valuable items, specimens, ship parts, or ambassadors to bring back to your homeworld in the Glory system. The combat can be pretty interesting when you manage to get good upgrades and recruit multiple pilots for your flotilla, but it's usually best to avoid confrontation in the beginning of the game.\n\nUnfortunately, all of the events and alien races can be seen in about 20 playthroughs on the "long" setting, and the long setting itself seems too short. This game would be far better if it had much more content and even longer playtimes, and I can't help but feel it would be more fun to continue upgrading your ships and battling for much longer instead of having to return back to your planet.\n\nIf you like games that have some depth yet allow you to sit back and relax while playing, Weird Worlds might be right up your alley.","October 30, 2014","true","1.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

But they are otherwise substantially different experiences. Weird Worlds presents the player with an open map and a fairly generous time limit to explore it in order to find upgrades and acrue wealth. This gives the game a very different feel to it compared to FTL, but it's not why I am giving this a thumbs down.\n\nI gave this a couple of attempts, putting little more than half an hour into actually playing it before I decided I was done. The reason being that the choices the game offers lack any reasonable sense of transparency. Apart from hyperdrive upgrades, none of the other things you can augment your ship with includes numbers. Everything is descriptive rather than quantitative. This may well be a valid approach. The history of roguelikes is replete with games that thrive on obfuscation and player experimentation (e.g. "drink red potion? Y/N"). But I think it is terribly misplaced here. The combat system in the game is a little like Gratuitous Space Battles. It's a 2D map with ships on either side of the screen squaring off. The player can choose targets for each of their ships, or whether a ship holds off or retreats. The rest of the engagement is handled automatically. For me, this was instantly just a way too chaotic environment for me to learn the basic efficacy of a given ship upgrade or anything else for that matter. I am loathe to do too much comparing to FTL, as it just ends up sounding like I like that more than Weird Worlds. I do, but I also came to this looking for something different. With all that said, I have to say that what FTL does right is that it presents situations where it's possible to see what is going on step by step. While there might be a steep learning curve, and one neglected thing overwhelms you while you are busy learning about something else, there is still a constant sense that you are learning something all the time, even if you're losing horribly. Weird Worlds lacks that transparency. Whether you win or lose an encounter, it is really hard to know what helped or hindered the situation.\n\nThere may be a lot of depth to the game a couple of hours in that I will never see. But I am choosing to recommend against this game because it simply offered me little incentive to keep going far enough to learn of any hidden potential.","April 28, 2014","false","0.7"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","28","51","0","0"

The release date is misleading (that's the Steam availabilty date) since it's a 2005 game (keep that in mind when you notice there's no mouse-wheel zooming). Dozens of weapons, engines and other interchangeable ship components along with mostly useless cargo/artifacts (some have significant effects). You can increase the size of your fleet by recruiting a few alien ships (possibly also increasing cargo capacity and component slots). There are a few infrequent game altering random events (spoilers not included).\n\nBoth my description and the screenshots make the game seem more complex than it actually is. You quickly realize the mechanics are pretty simple but after a bit more play find it's not quite as simple as first impressions suggest (I'd even say elegantly simple).\n\nThe only technical problem I've come across is with 1920x1080 resolution on my 1080p laptop (graphics flicker). I have to play it at 720p (or lower?) res to make it work.\n\nI've played this one on and off since it was an indie GOTY nominee (from the era of "Darwinia") and still enjoy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/recommended/226120/","cannonesshannah","Katie's Hannah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/","979 products in account","Neutral: If you wanted a sort of Space Pirates and Zombies or Star Control 2 experience abbreviated into a quick gaming session, then that's pretty much exactly what Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is.  I suspect a lot of players will feel like they just got started getting interested in exploring the game world when the session is called to an end however, and the game length does nothing to hide a certain lack of content.\n\n\nWeird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is the sequel to Adventures in Infinite Space developed and published by Digital Eel.  It offers a top-down, dual mode gameplay that is similar but not quite identical to Star Control 2.\n\nGraphically, the style will seem very similar to fans of Space Pirates and Zombies as they are very similar in style in-game.  Out of game the game uses some hand-drawn sort of comic-book art that, to speak frankly, just looks strange and unprofessional for the most part.  It doesn't fit the look of the rest of the game, and usually ends up resized into a pixellated mess.\n\nThe graphics aren't what truly matters though, and the gameplay mechanics are simple but work well in the context of the game.  You have a single flagship you can select through three types that are essentially classes, each offering a slightly different play style, since they will have more or less weapons, consoles, etc available to them.  The object of the game is then to amass the most points before the time limit (determined by world size) runs out.  You gain score through the expected methods: exploration, trade, and combat.  Along the way, you'll meet different races, fight hostile aliens, and possibly find allies to help you or hire mercenaries, amassing a fleet just as you did in Star Control 2.\n\nWhere the comparison to Star Control 2 ends is in that exploration.  Star Control 2 thrived on the variety and strong personality offered by each of its races, but while Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space does try to offer some, when it is given in just simple text crawls or exposition dumps, it falls somewhat flat.  That's not to say the game is without that touch of colour, just that it's nowheres near as vibrant as Star Control 2.\n\nThe game has essentially two modes: a pseudo-turn-based overworld, whereby events basically happen every time you enter a new system, and a real time tactical combat screen.  Those expecting the Super Melee of SC2 from my constant comparisons thereto will be quite disappointed, as the combat in Weird Worlds is much more ponderous.  With that, though, it also feels more realistic.  Starships, especially larger ones, have a feeling of mass to them, and while it's hardly a Kerbal Space Program level of simulation, it does offer a vague approximation of how these ships would seem to actually handle.  Controls are simple but to the point, and the combat mechanics are likewise.  There is no subsystem targeting or the like, just plink away at the targetted ship until it goes boom.\n\nThe central mechanic of that game length is both the games greatest strength and its greatest weakness.  It boils the game down into something you could complete on a coffee break, and this makes the game very compact and doesn't overstay its welcome, which it definitely would in a longer game given then less vibrant races and distinct weakness on the content side.  Within 4-5 playthroughs you'll have a lot of repeating motifs, despite the procedural generation.  Yet that game length does make it a good game to play while waiting for something else to down load, or in the downtime between online gaming sessions.\n\nAll things considered, the mechanics are competently executed, the production values are middling, and the game length will make it or break it for you.  Personally, I would say to wait until it's in a bundle - as it often is.  It's a good game well-made, just a very shallow one.\n\nPublished: http://highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/87-review-weird-worlds-return-to-infinite-space","April 22, 2014","true","2.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

At first this was frustrating and I was struggling to survive missions but steadily I discovered weapons, combos and strats that worked.\n\nIt is a very UNFORGIVING GAME so the learning curve is steep to get to the higher scores and if something goes wrong in combat or you judge the relative strengths of enemy fleets incorrectly, you only have a very small window of time to escape or your fleet will be wiped out. Once you engage you better hope you judged it right.\n\nI love turn based 4X games (Xplore, Xpand, Xploit, Xterminate) and this game feels like a light and casual Xplore and Xterminate version of these games (there is no settling or empire building, just increasing fleet size and customisation).\n\nI play it casually but may be sucked into an hour long game if things are going well and I feel a high score coming on. Since it is turn based, I have the luxury of taking my time to consider each move and weigh my strengths and weaknesses. It is still hard to judge the relative strength of more evenly matched battles and so I still get wiped out occasionally with much chagrin! The special missions that come up can seem over whelming and only recently did I beat the bugs 1 on 1 in a fair fight.\n\nI now start with all the difficulty options on max and with a military mission base ship (I preferred scientific at the start to focus on the exploring). I find the Even Wierder Worlds mod the best extra content without making it easier (Esmarelda can take ANY item - cargo or equipped - and often a best gun!).\n\nAfter >200 hrs it is really just the procedurally generated maps and trying to get the "perfect" game that keeps me going as well as mods to change things up. Random races and random personalities of the races you meet would improve replayability in the long term.","March 8, 2015","true","280.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Its nothing too amazing, but a great game none the less. Its gameplay is randomly generating thus giving the plaer an indefinite replay value, so it can be easy to get your moneys worth out of this game if its your thing. But speaking of the price, its 10$ and thats pretty on edge of how much its worth through my experience. I got it for free in a giveaway myself, and its a great game, but I'd say its more around worth 5$, if its on sale buy thing game, if its not: invest into taking some more ime to see if its your cup of tea.\n\nThe Gameplay:	 On to the gameplay, theres alot to say and to keep it short I'll say this:\nThe gameplay is a solid 8.5/10, its a randomly generated fun adventure full of things to explore. The mechanic of having to return after 30 years in-game is a unique and brilliant touch to a game of this genre. It gives you an almost arcade like feel of constantly trying to get a new highscore, its simply addicting and fun so see what you can get. Playing this game blind will make your experience ALOT better too, playing it blind will make the game so intresting to discover things, I know from experience there will be many occasions you thought youve seen everything, but suddenly a brand new ship, race, battle, etc. comes up. If these thigns sound appealing to you, look into this game more, its a really great relaxing time waster. (and I almost forgot to mention: its got quite the FTL like feel to it, but with a wide range of completely new, different mechanics.)\n\nTL;DR	 TL;DR: The games pretty good. Is it worth 10$? That depends on your likings because 10$ is the maximum price the game could be worth, if the game is on sale you should totally buy it. It's a well-made, rouge, never ending, suprising, random, curious, almost FTL-like experience that will leave you addicted to getting a higher score or explore more each time.","February 1, 2015","true","14.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a space exploration roguelike, where you're expected to die often and your luck throughout the game is completely randomized. The goal is to accrue enough value through what you find in star systems, cargo. passengers, and equpment with in a limited. You start with a ship with inferior gear, and need to make trades or kill hostiles to get better weapons or more valueable trading goods. Usually, but not always, you will find a bird race early in your tavels that are willing to trade any item regardless of value, which helps you get better gear or more valuable cargo. You will encounter "unknown" beings at other systems, which more often than not are hostile encounters with enemies that will out gun you. You don't want to travel through nebulae as they take much time to move through, unless you have the proper equipment. This game has simplistic mechanics which actually turn out quite enjoyable, but my problem is that it's too damn random and you have to basically hope that the game gives you a good galaxy.

It has an excellent atmosphere; from the quirky bits of backstory to the memorable snippets of country music you sometimes pick up while drifting through the void, it does a great job of creating a unique 'feel'. The combat is unforgiving and forces you to truly consider the consequences of every engagement, but a bit of cleverness and careful planning can help you avoid combat entirely if you so choose (and on many runs, that's exactly what I did; combat is not by any means central to the game). I love how the various random items and their lore interconnect, and how exciting the storylines have the potential to be, in what appears on the surface to be an aimless journey. The final boss, simple as it was, is possibly the closest thing to 'epic' that I have ever seen in a game.\n\nSo yes. If you like roguelikes and want to try something that is more about exploration and thinking creatively rather than just killing everything in sight, check out Weird Worlds.","September 16, 2014","true","19.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It plays out almost like a board game - you move your ship from planet to planet, and at each location you find something - maybe a piece of alien technology, an upgrade for your ship, an alien race, hostile or otherwise, and so on. The idea is to grab as much loot as you can and get back to the home planet before time runs out. There's a simple space combat minigame tacked on, but just avoiding the baddies is a viable option too. You can finish games in just a few minutes but everything's assembled randomly every time you play and it can get kind of addictive trying to beat your top score.","July 23, 2013","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

However, after playing a few hours of it in one session, it does get a tad repetitive. The combat is very tough if you don't have much equipment. I made that mistake by trying to tackle a corvette (medium class ship) alone. I died in 10 seconds flat...\nAside from the quite tough combat, the general gameplay is enjoyable, with 3 different ships to start with and you can make your own fleet whilst on your travels. There's also a combat training bit where you pick which ships you want to control, have an alliance with or fight against.

You start your journey deciding between 3 different type of ships, you then leave your planet called Glory to venture out on a 2 year long journey traveling in interstellar space. Along your journey you will find civilizations and goods as well as allies and foes.\nMechanics is a bit clunky at some places, the graphics isn't exactly something to brag about but it's certainly succeeds in setting a vibe of mystery that hangs tight in the air.\nSound varies alot with some tracks sounding decent to horrendous at best, some tracks feels out of place and the transitions between silent to full volume can produce a jump scare better than most horror games today.\nIt's got a decent amount of replayability enough to suffice for a few hours of fun and certainly beyond that depending on your experience with the game.

There is a slight learning curve; equipment is fairly random throughout your route, and combat is pretty rough until you find some allies.

I find it to be a great diversion, a light space RPG that I can blast through without any real time commitment. It doesn't have a huge variety of content - you'll see most of what there is to see on the first few plays, but there are subtle random elements which will lead to little surprises for a while after that. Exploration is by far the highlight, finding treasures and technology and using them to upgrade your ship. Combat is probably the weak point - it's quite basic and rather difficult in early game, best avoided until you have no other options. The variety of weapon effects is nice though.\n\nWeird Worlds isn't a difficult game particularly, but as with any Roguelike there will be times when you just can't get a break. This is necessary to maintain a little sense of achievement when you do win, but for me the draw that keeps me coming back is to beat my high score and the two 'boss' events that occasionally happen.","February 24, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/226120/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a space scavenging/exploration game, with a few board game and rogue-like elements.\nThere are 3 different starter ships, each with a slightly different focus (alien ambassadors, military technology, ancient artifacts, etc.) and also different starting equipment.\n\nThe game was designed to be played in short bursts, each run being from 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how you do.\n\nI'll say that I enjoyed the concept of the game, and it did entertain me for a while, but overall, the game left me wishing it had a bit more to it. If you're into these games, definitely give it a try, but don't expect to get too much out of it.\nA sequel is in Early Access right now, so there's hoping that they can make it the bigger game it deserves to be!\n\n\nYour role is to command your ship through the universe (Small, Medium or Large), exploring as many planets as you can to collect either artifacts or technology, and also recruit other ships to your fleet, perhaps. You can either hire them as mercenaries, or they may join you when in trouble.\nThese different ships will allow you to interact in a friendly manner with its race, if you encounter it later on.\n\nYou have a limited set time to do all this and return home. If you fail, you'll be lost in space and it's game over.\nThe maps also feature Nebulas (that highly diminish your travelling speed), and Black Holes (that will suck you in... and it's game over).\n\n\nThis game was released in 2005, I believe, but despite being nearly 10 years old, it has a clean interface and the graphics actually look pretty good! They could have fooled me. It's a simple looking game, but that's not a problem, in a game like this.\nThe item pictures are also cool looking, if not cheesy (to fit the game's humor).\n\nThe music is something I can't say much about. The menu music sounded good, but in-game, the music is very limited, with a few short clips playing along with certain encounters.\nThe sound effects were also a bit space-y, as one would expect, but nothing noteworthy, that I noticed.\n\n\n\nSo, I'll try to get you an overview of the game mechanics.\nLike I said previously, the game is mainly about scavenging. You can equip your ship with things you find/trade, or you can keep things in your cargo bay, for later trade, or even use in your other ships.\nAside from these, there are artifacts (with flavor text about the game's universe) that are merely there to increase your score in the end, and other unique items with unique effects. One can switch your place with the ships in another planet, for example (this one was particularly fun when I had an item that resisted a black hole's pull, and thus spent the whole time sending ships into black holes by switching places with them).\n\nYou final score is calculated when you either die, or reach home safely, and in time. It's based on your cargo items and ambassadors, and each one has an associated value. Different ships also attribute different values to different types of cargo.\n\nSo, most of the time, you'll be travelling from planet to planet. Farther planets will take longer to reach (the time is always displayed to you), and when in a Nebula, the time increasing immensely.\nYou can change this if you come by different drives. Some of them are faster than other, some are fast in nebulas but slower outside them, and some even teleport you!\n\nOther than that, you can have different encounters. Some planets are inhabited, and these can either bring you pain and tears, or generous traders. The ambassadors and mercenaries you carry can affect this.\nThere are also scanners that show you when a plant is inhabited, so that you can prioritize other planets to gather strength until you enter conflict.\n\nThe trading system is pretty simple. Each item has a certain value, and you can usually trade items of similar value (or type). There is also a race that accepts anything that is shiny, so you have a great opportunity to get great items at the price of nearly nothing.\n\nThe combat system, is something that I didn't quite understand (there is a combat simulator, by the way, so that you can explore this aspect of the game alone, with everything at your disposal). Most of the time, if you engage in combat, you'll be horribly murdered. So I ended up avoiding combat until I got certain items that would let me deal with the enemies in more... "creative" ways (such as teleporting them into black holes, or ramming them while invisible).\nCombat itself was mostly controlled by the AI (which can be improved with items you collect). You could only control your ships' path, but it would mostly play out by itself.\nAgain, I didn't quite understand it, mostly because I didn't need to. There were ways around it, which I think is a good thing!\n\n\nAnd this is pretty much the game. There were a few random events that could happen (like an alien ship destroying every planet in its path -- and you being chosen to stop it; or a lady thief that could be captured if you had certain items), but these seemed to be pretty rare. Perhaps this problem is associated with the fairly limited replayability of this game, compared to, say, FTL.\n\nAnd here's my reasoning.\nThis game lacks a bigger goal. In FTL, the tough Mothership fight was something that would keep you coming back to the game. And it was engaging for a good amount of time, until you succeeded.\nIn Weird Worlds, however, it is really easy to end the game "successfully". The only drive would be discovering more about the universe, and improving your score. Coupled with the game sessions' short lengths, it's easy to see the game fail to keep you interested for that long.\nBesides, there aren't as many items as one would hope. In my final playthroughs, I ended up with very similar sets of items, and thus making the game a bit too monotonous. But perhaps that's my problem by avoiding combat.\n\n\nOverall, though, I enjoyed the game while it lasted. It did create some interesting situations, and sometimes made me feel like the Lord of the freakin' Universe. So I think it deserves some merit!\nIf you like the vibe of the game and my description of it (that I hope was accurate enough), give this one a try, I'm sure you'll have fun, even if for a short time. Now, there's a lot of room for improvement, so here's hoping that the newest addition to the series (Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars -- now in Early Access) manages to expand the game as it deserves!\n","September 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/226120/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a space scavenging/exploration game, with a few board game and rogue-like elements.\nThere are 3 different starter ships, each with a slightly different focus (alien ambassadors, military technology, ancient artifacts, etc.) and also different starting equipment.\n\nThe game was designed to be played in short bursts, each run being from 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how you do.\n\nI'll say that I enjoyed the concept of the game, and it did entertain me for a while, but overall, the game left me wishing it had a bit more to it. If you're into these games, definitely give it a try, but don't expect to get too much out of it.\nA sequel is in Early Access right now, so there's hoping that they can make it the bigger game it deserves to be!\n\n\nYour role is to command your ship through the universe (Small, Medium or Large), exploring as many planets as you can to collect either artifacts or technology, and also recruit other ships to your fleet, perhaps. You can either hire them as mercenaries, or they may join you when in trouble.\nThese different ships will allow you to interact in a friendly manner with its race, if you encounter it later on.\n\nYou have a limited set time to do all this and return home. If you fail, you'll be lost in space and it's game over.\nThe maps also feature Nebulas (that highly diminish your travelling speed), and Black Holes (that will suck you in... and it's game over).\n\n\nThis game was released in 2005, I believe, but despite being nearly 10 years old, it has a clean interface and the graphics actually look pretty good! They could have fooled me. It's a simple looking game, but that's not a problem, in a game like this.\nThe item pictures are also cool looking, if not cheesy (to fit the game's humor).\n\nThe music is something I can't say much about. The menu music sounded good, but in-game, the music is very limited, with a few short clips playing along with certain encounters.\nThe sound effects were also a bit space-y, as one would expect, but nothing noteworthy, that I noticed.\n\n\n\nSo, I'll try to get you an overview of the game mechanics.\nLike I said previously, the game is mainly about scavenging. You can equip your ship with things you find/trade, or you can keep things in your cargo bay, for later trade, or even use in your other ships.\nAside from these, there are artifacts (with flavor text about the game's universe) that are merely there to increase your score in the end, and other unique items with unique effects. One can switch your place with the ships in another planet, for example (this one was particularly fun when I had an item that resisted a black hole's pull, and thus spent the whole time sending ships into black holes by switching places with them).\n\nYou final score is calculated when you either die, or reach home safely, and in time. It's based on your cargo items and ambassadors, and each one has an associated value. Different ships also attribute different values to different types of cargo.\n\nSo, most of the time, you'll be travelling from planet to planet. Farther planets will take longer to reach (the time is always displayed to you), and when in a Nebula, the time increasing immensely.\nYou can change this if you come by different drives. Some of them are faster than other, some are fast in nebulas but slower outside them, and some even teleport you!\n\nOther than that, you can have different encounters. Some planets are inhabited, and these can either bring you pain and tears, or generous traders. The ambassadors and mercenaries you carry can affect this.\nThere are also scanners that show you when a plant is inhabited, so that you can prioritize other planets to gather strength until you enter conflict.\n\nThe trading system is pretty simple. Each item has a certain value, and you can usually trade items of similar value (or type). There is also a race that accepts anything that is shiny, so you have a great opportunity to get great items at the price of nearly nothing.\n\nThe combat system, is something that I didn't quite understand (there is a combat simulator, by the way, so that you can explore this aspect of the game alone, with everything at your disposal). Most of the time, if you engage in combat, you'll be horribly murdered. So I ended up avoiding combat until I got certain items that would let me deal with the enemies in more... "creative" ways (such as teleporting them into black holes, or ramming them while invisible).\nCombat itself was mostly controlled by the AI (which can be improved with items you collect). You could only control your ships' path, but it would mostly play out by itself.\nAgain, I didn't quite understand it, mostly because I didn't need to. There were ways around it, which I think is a good thing!\n\n\nAnd this is pretty much the game. There were a few random events that could happen (like an alien ship destroying every planet in its path -- and you being chosen to stop it; or a lady thief that could be captured if you had certain items), but these seemed to be pretty rare. Perhaps this problem is associated with the fairly limited replayability of this game, compared to, say, FTL.\n\nAnd here's my reasoning.\nThis game lacks a bigger goal. In FTL, the tough Mothership fight was something that would keep you coming back to the game. And it was engaging for a good amount of time, until you succeeded.\nIn Weird Worlds, however, it is really easy to end the game "successfully". The only drive would be discovering more about the universe, and improving your score. Coupled with the game sessions' short lengths, it's easy to see the game fail to keep you interested for that long.\nBesides, there aren't as many items as one would hope. In my final playthroughs, I ended up with very similar sets of items, and thus making the game a bit too monotonous. But perhaps that's my problem by avoiding combat.\n\n\nOverall, though, I enjoyed the game while it lasted. It did create some interesting situations, and sometimes made me feel like the Lord of the freakin' Universe. So I think it deserves some merit!\nIf you like the vibe of the game and my description of it (that I hope was accurate enough), give this one a try, I'm sure you'll have fun, even if for a short time. Now, there's a lot of room for improvement, so here's hoping that the newest addition to the series (Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars -- now in Early Access) manages to expand the game as it deserves!\n","September 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's quirky,  and as everyone notes, a quick play to fill some time.\n\nThat said - after a handful of play throughs, there just isn't any meat here to chew on.  I tried a couple short games to get the hang of it, but you can't built your ship up enough to withstand any battles, and the game is over so quickly, you better not stray too far or you'll never make it back to base in time.\n\nPlaying longer games was a more enjoyable experience.  Here too though, I found it very hard to survive virtually any combat encounter.\n\nOther than combat, all there really is, is going to each planet and putting whatever "thing" you find there in cargo, every once in a while trading with a wandering store - presumable trading up for more points at end game.  Then even at end game, there's no  winning in the classic sense, just a final tally of your credits based on what you found minus what you owe.\n\nThat's pretty much it unless I'm missing something.  I generally like quick time fillers, and I love quirky games, but I just can't find a way to like this one.  I don't regret the couple bucks to play it a while, but I doubt it will get much replay from me.","April 10","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Player has 1 ship (or later several), which flies through galaxy and explores particular star systems within limited time-frame. Some systems are inhabited and according to various circumstances player can fight, trade or help (to fight another race) inhabitatns. Game has 2 phases:\nstrategic movement through galaxy, which depends on local environment and also equipment;\nand tactical real-time combat within a star system.\nSucessful game ending very much depends on first several explored star systems - whether player finds fast hyperdrives, items to trade, special race with generous trade offer, etc. There are several rare scenarios which occur from time to time (maybe once per 10 games), which bring another level of difficulty and fun into the game.\n\nThe interface is quite simple and also game mechanics is simple. There are several small "gotchas", which are not obvious (e.g. it is possible to fly through blackhole if at least one ship has special equipment, or it is possible to make peace with certain race if player has certain item in inventory).","December 22, 2014","true","77.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not true. It only takes 10-40 minutes to play through once though, so it's easy to pick up and play "just one game". But people, THIS IS A ROGUELIKE GAME, and you WILL NOT see all it has to see if you only give it a few playthroughs.\n\nYou can -think- you've seen it all, but there are several story branches that simply don't always unlock. There are multiple endings, and gameplay is a bit different each time around thanks to random galaxies, and 3 settings each with 3 options that decide what your starting ship is, the size of the map (and approx game length), and the density of the nebula in the universe (Which greatly dictates where you can and can't travel at the start of the game.) You can download the game's precursor, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space, from the publisher's website, http://www.digital-eel.com/sais/ if you want to get an idea of what this is all about.\n\nI'm not saying you won't tire of this game after playing it a dozen or so times, you will see repeats of items, but this is part of the charm and fun of this game--once you learn what items are out there to be found, how species will interact, you can hone a strategy that will allow you to actually 'beat' the game, by which I mean unlock and win one of the 'hidden' storylines. You can bet that most of the people giving this a thumbs-down after <10 or so hours never got this far.\n\nI have this game downloaded DRM free and on another service, so my 7 hours played here at time of writing is less than accurate, I'm probably nearer to 30 hrs. I probably have seen 95% of the game's content, still haven't beaten one specific storyline... it involves an invasion, without giving too much away. You probably won't see it on your 1st (or 2nd, or 3rd) playthrough.\n\nIf you are into resource management, roguelike, trading, exploration, sci-fi, or adventure games, I say give this a shot, just maybe not at full sticker price. Whatever you do though, don't listen to the reviews bashing the game for a lack of content when they haven't given it a proper chance.\n\nI'd give it another thumb up if I could. The developer is currently working on a successfully-Kickstarted sequel called Sea of Stars, and I am one of many people who are eager to see it ship.

Nice short completely optional tutorial that just explains things as you go without taking control from you and a very straight-forward interface.\n\nOnly two things I didn't like were 1) when ships get too close in combat they forcibly turn away instead of passing through/over/under eachother, leaving you sometimes facing the wrong way to target the enemy ships.\n\nAnd 2) for those ships that can teleport in combat there's no meter/countdown to show how long before they can do it again, and it's automatically executed so you can't choose to move normally if you wish.\n\nOverall I'd say it's well worth the money if you enjoy going up against unknown odds at every turn.

Weird Worlds is a game all about strategy and going to planets to get upgrades for that ship you have. But within the whole aspect of going to planets, you will often go to planets where aliens are living on that planet and you can either kill them or avoid contact from them. If you do try and kill them, the ships they have are pretty much overpowered and are unkillable because they have all the upgrades for the ship. To honest, I only played this game for about 10 - 20 minutes but it wasn't my cup of tea since the AI are unkillable.

This is roughly like FTL, but with actual tactical movement of your fleet, and without FTL's final boss that's impossible without the right combo of items. On the downside, this game is VERY rough around the edges and unforgiving. It's good that games that less than an hour, because you CAN NOT SAVE at all. Text is tiny without the "big UI" option, but that makes some tutorial messages impossible to read! Everything has lots of flavor text, but almost no useful information.

You chose one of three space ships, then configure the galaxy, and you're off. You have so many years to explore the galaxy, collect booty, meet people, experience the weirdness, and then to race home before your time limit runs out. The rules become very clear and you see the limits you have to work within, but everything is shrouded in mystery until you discover all the details by experimenting. The space battles have a tactical component, but it's often better to avoid combat until you've found a lot of allies and better equipment. This is a psuedo-turn-based game. You select a star system and travel, at that system you are given a choice of engaging a race, collecting booty, or experiencing an event. When you engage in combat it becomes an rts; guide your ships to where you'd like to position them, select your targets, and use your abilities.\n\nThere's something compelling about the gameplay, especially with how quick the game is, perhaps it has to do with how easy it to die when you know you made such an obvious mistake. You can play this game without actually engaging in combat, which I find refreshing. This isn't a game you can play for hours. After you've really gotten it down it's fun for a game here and there, and when you've burned out on it, leave it hiding in your library to be rediscovered. I recommend it for those who have 15 minutes on their lunch break. This will apeal to those who like casual to light strategy rogue-like games.","April 27, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I awaited less from it so I am happy it is not bad at all. It is not difficult game. Randomness play it's role. Also you must be patient, not going to fight when you are not sure you re strong enough. Well you can go fight, but it can cost you life :-).\nOne game/round takes about 1 hour. You are flying through space with task: "Go and come back in 10/20/48 years and bring back the best stuff and make friends for us in space." You are making aliances, trade, discover, fight against "bad guys". Atmosphere of the game is great.\nAfter 5 replays or sooner game will become a bit boring, nothing new. http://www.infinitespacegames.com/weirdworlds/weird-worlds-mods/ this helped me to play game longer. Teeming with Life is only balancing game, while The Babylon project gives you slightly new universe.\n\nI could say much more, f.e. that I regret small interface or that when you come back at the end of 48 years you will recieve senior rank that you worth, but it would take long time while game is relatively short.\n\nI recomend the game Weird Worlds.

I was hooked, and played for much longer than I had planned. This space strategy game (some call it Rogue-like) kept calling me to play one more game, and I heeded its call.\n\nFast forward to the end of 2015 and I finally gave the full game a spin. The familiar menus popped up, the familiar map, and the familiar gameplay all triggered positive memories dating back to when I first played Weird Worlds, not long after building a gaming PC and joining the so-called 'Master Race' for the first time.\n\nThe game boils down to these elements:\n1) Pick your name, ship name, and type\n2) Explore a randomly generated galactic map, complete with barren planets, trading posts, and alien races -- both friend and foe.\n3) You must explore as much as you can, bringing back items of monetary and scientific value, before time is up. This limit is imposed on you between steps 1 and 2, and is always on screen. Don't worry, you have plenty of time unless you keep battling enemies, and accidentally hit the forward button a few times like I did.\n\nBattles are, admittedly and unfortunately, rather boring. There isn't much strategic element, and honestly I escaped whenever possible.\n\nExploration is a little bland, and limited to clicking a world, waiting to see what pops up, and then either trading, dealing with the fallout, or moving on to the next one.\n\nAlpha Centauri or FTL, this game is not.\n\nSo what is it? Why recommend it? Well, a game can be played in 15-30 minutes, and if you don't binge on it (thus seeing all it has to offer in one sitting), you can return to it days, months, or years later for another quick trip around the stars, then put it back on the shelf again until next time. In other words, it's a quick palate cleanse in between meatier experiences. It can be neat discovering an interesting race, item, or upgrade for your ship.\n\nIt's also dirt cheap, has mod support (note: The Star Wars one I downloaded from the official site locked up my game), and easy to learn, meaning you can play it with casual/non gamers such as youngsters and other relatives and friends.\n\nKnow what to expect, and I don't think you'll be let down.","December 2, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although there are lots of text that they might just skip through which offer hints as to what items do and what to do next.\n\nKept/Removed:KEPT. It’s the type of game that you can pick up 15-30 minutes at a time.\n\nGood/Bad:It kept me entertained for quite a while. You have a mission which is to explore the galaxy as much as you can. You may find artifacts, weapons, shops, enemies or even allies along the way. It’s really a dungeon crawler in disguise. In order to succeed in the game, I suggest to read the descriptions of the items you pick up because as the saying goes, “knowing is half the battle”.\n\nLast Thoughts: It’s a fun diversion but I recommend buying it at a discount.\n","May 24, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
